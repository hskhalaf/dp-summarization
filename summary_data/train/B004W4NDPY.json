I was going to take off a star for ease of assembly because I couldn't find where the instruction wanted me to hand the aluminum cup. I cured it twice following the instructions. Hooked up the propane, threw in apple, mesquite, and hickory wood chips and smoked me a nice piece of beef brisket. This meat came out moist and flavorful. I'll post more as I use the product. For now, I'm really happy with my purchase.",

Wood chips burn out too fast, I use chunks soaked in water. Also, line the bottom with aluminum foil to help keep the bottom clean. Change it out once in a while and this will last forever!",

Before you attempt to smoke anything. Take aluminum foil and cover the entire bottom of the chip pan to cover the holes, so the flames can't reach your chips. If you do not do this, then the chips will catch on fire and you will have a 400 degree grill and not a smoker. It only takes a minute or two to cover the chip pan. Once you do this, the smoker holds temperature and works great.",

Not only is it far easier to regulate the temperature with the propane, this unit has a second door that allows you refill the water pan and woodchip pan without opening the area with the meat rack which helps preserve your temperature and smoke. My only complaint was that door got slightly bent during shipping but it didnt impact its function so I kept it.",

The nice thing is that I read a few suggestions from others as to how to use this smoker more efficiently. I have already incorporated the changes on this unit (adding the caster wheels on the legs). This is a great smoker for the price. It consistently does the job and delivers delicious meats each time. No complaints from me.",

If there is any negative, I would say that the water bowl is a bit shallow and required you to check it about every hour.

Does best with ribs slow cooking, others such as chicken seems to dry out quicker. Would have been nice to have a larger water and wood bins for less refill. Would buy again, as was priced reasonably.",

    "description": "The rich, full flavor of slow-cooked food has been a staple of outdoor cookouts. The masterbuilt vertical gas smoker delivers smokehouse flavor as easy as grilling not only does this gas smoker come fully equipped with an electronic push button igniter, but it also has over 700 Square Inch of total cooking space on four chrome cooking racks. The porcelain coated wood chip tray and water pan are removable for easy clean-up. The built-in temperature gauge allows you to always know the temperature of the inside of the smoker and when it\u2019s ideal to add certain foods. The smoker also has a stainless steel burner and type 1 regulator with hose. The cool touch wire handles is an added value because it allows you to open the door often without having to use protective hand accessories every time you want to check the cooking process. The locking door and the inner liner help to keep the heat and smoky flavor inside. The air damper allows better smoke control allowing you to have as much or as little smoky flavor you would like for your foods. Whether you\u2019re cooking pork, chicken, beef or seafood, the delightfully smoky aroma that permeates from the masterbuilt vertical gas smoker with push button igniter has a way of making friends and family flock around the smoker in the spirit of good times and good food.",
