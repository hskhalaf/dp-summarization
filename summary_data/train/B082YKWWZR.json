It is clean, packed in a clear bag. I have been sleeping with the comforter for three weeks. I am satisfied with the purchase. Recommend.",

It\u2019s pure white, super soft and fluffy and looks elegant! No noticeable odor at all right out of the zippered bag. It\u2019s been almost 4 months since I changed the all-season down comforter, it provide the right warmth level I\u2019m comfortable with so I can get sound sleep. I don\u2019t get hot at night even during this summer time. Just hope the color could last white and fresh long!",

Overall, I really like the comforter and it is worth the price. A good comforter can increase your sleep quality and it would last longer. I highly recommend it to everyone.",

It had no trouble fluffing up. I would, however, try to avoid washing it as much as possible. It is the exact kind I needed, very light and snuggly, without being too warm.",
