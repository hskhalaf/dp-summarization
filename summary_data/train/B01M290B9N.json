Measures 9 inches high, 12 inches long and 4 inches wide. About the size of a decent size bagel toaster. Listen to my video if you would like to hear the sound of brewing",

    "title": "Nespresso Pixie Original Espresso Machine by De'Longhi, Aluminum",
    "description": "The Nespresso Pixie by De'Longhi Coffee machine offers avant-garde design with elegance and functionality. Equipped with a wide range of advanced features, the Pixie machine is energy-efficient with a surprisingly compact design. At only 4. 33 inches wide, it uses hardly any space and is perfect for smaller urban kitchens. At only 8 pounds, it is also easily portable. The one-touch buttons with two capacities (espresso and Lungo) can be reprogrammed to custom volumes and are backlit for ease of use. The 19 bar high-pressure pump allows for barista-style results, unlocking the delicate flavor and premium aromas of each coffee capsule during the brewing process and creating an incomparable dense and unctuous crema. The fast heat-up system reaches the ideal temperature in just 25 seconds, while the automatic power-off-function means the machine turns off 9 minutes after the last use. Streamlined for maximum efficiency, this Coffee maker lives up to Nespresso's reputation for high-end technology. Each machine includes a welcome set with a variety of espresso capsules. Cable storage.",
