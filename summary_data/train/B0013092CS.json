I was able to quickly set up my favorite presets with assistance from the well-written, and helpful instructions. The sound quality was very good, with three levels of bass (off, boost 1, and boost 2) to customize my sound. The auto off (to save batteries) was a nice bonus. Excellent!",

The last few times I've tried to use them, there's no sound, either from the radio or from an attached mp3 player. I've replaced the batteries. Today, I went out and bought new batteries, thinking the batteries I had been using were possibly getting old. Nope. Nothing. BTW, when it WAS working, it really chewed through batteries. Even though I was meticulous about turning the headphones off after using, the batteries would only last about a week - just long enough to be dead when I was ready to mow again.",

I like the new features like memory recall for favorite stations. Bass boost is pretty good too. But what really sets these apart from the old ones is their ability to lock in a station. My favorite rock station was constantly getting walked on by another station with the old unit. A problem that always existed. This new set locks it in, and it doesn't fade. Sooo much better! I highly recommend this work tunes headset. RS",

If you bump that huge, unprotected tuning knob, which anyone who works in these will do frequently, you'll have to go through the tedious job of resetting the channel - and changing the channel via audio feedback is extremely tedious. I glued a shield around the tuning knob to protect it and that has corrected that issue. The volume control is located so that turning your head can cause the volume control to contact your shoulder and change the volume. It is the next control I will probably have to shield.

Radio sensitivity, tuning ease and sound quality are radically improved. The digital tuning with search, memory and voice annunciator are very nicely implemented. I like the base boost, too. Radio volume is plenty high, able to approach the threshold of pain of around 82db, according to the manual. My only problem is the headset is a bit tight on my fat head, causing fatigue after a while. However, I imagine that contributes to noise protection by sealing the ear pads more firmly, so can't complain too much about that.",

THE SOLUTION TO THE BATTERY PROBLEM: I switched to rechargeable Duracell NiMH batteries (green color) and have used the same pair of batteries for 9 hours without having to recharge them. I assume but am not certain if I have solved the problem long term. The NiMH batteries are more expensive, but in this circumstance, an acceptable solution since they are rechargeable. ...hope this helps.",

I sometimes attach my phone and listen to music or podcasts from my phone, but the speakers aren't amplified in this mode and they aren't very efficient, so even with my phone on max volume I can barely hear the podcasts. They do protect my ears and are more comfortable than cheap ear protection headsets.",

If the battery is low it tells you that too. It tells you the station number you're listening too when powering up and when tuning into stations.
