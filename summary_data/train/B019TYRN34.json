Two, the legs are very difficult to adjust in such a way as to get both sides even, and they are impossible to adjust with the laptop on the flat surface. Going from sitting to reclining takes too much time to worry with. It would be easier to have two such tables and switch between the two, which defeats the whole purpose of the adjustability.",

I just needed to extend the back out a few inches to keep my laptop from sliding off. Luckily the mouse pad was perfect for this. So I secured the mouse pad to the rear of the table with two screws, thus preventing this humongous Laptop from ever sliding off. I also added some black tape to the rear and front of this metal table to minimize scratching to my Laptop. I use this table daily now, with no complaints. Once I found the perfect leg position this table is now my favorite setup.",

It's lightweight, easy to click into the desired configuration, and when I'm ready to sit back down, I just push it to the back of my cubicle, grab the laptop & mouse, and switch to sitting. Really happy with this product so far. I do see the potential for the mouse pad starting to angle downward over time with use, given that you're putting some weight on it; perhaps there's a way to mitigate that.",

I would just keep it set in one position but I want to use it in various places because it's so helpful in various places. I guess I need to write down the angle settings for each place I want to use it. Otherwise I love it!",

I have my gaming PC with 17 inches and almost 6 pound on the stand. However, the buttons has minor problem when you want to adjust the stand, you push inside so you can change legs angle. Sometimes the buttons won\u2019t get out to lock the leg. It will stuck for a long time. I think this is a quality issue where manufacturers or crafters should fix it. If it doesn't lock then it won\u2019t work as it should.",

The stand appears to be well built and I think it will last a long time. And as a bonus there are fans beneath your computer to keep your computer cool. The fans are connected to your computer via a cord and they turn on automatically whenever your turn your computer on.",
