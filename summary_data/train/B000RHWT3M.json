REFRIGERATORS according to FDA should be kept at 40F or less. So with a 10 degree range, that is impossible, because if the range is 30-40F, then your food will freeze. I called EDGESTAR and they said the PRODUCT IS MANUFACTURED to have a 5-10F range. So if this is just a beer or soda fridge it is okay, but it is not okay for perishable food!!

Worked great when I needed to ice an injury and I could freeze the cold packs during the 48 hours needed. Afterwords, I just turned it back to a fridge for normal use. If you are going to have a mini-fridge, why not get the option of using it as a freezer when needed?",
