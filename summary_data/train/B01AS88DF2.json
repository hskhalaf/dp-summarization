We tried every way to remove the mucous from his nose because he was having trouble breathing. Tried the bulb syringe and the nosefrida and he would just scream bloody murder. This was a last ditch effort and I have to say this was by far easier on my baby and more effective at removing the mucous. Don't get me wrong, he still cried but he didn't scream like I was torturing him. I would highly recommend!",

The alternative's are 1/2 the price and at best work half as well. I bought them both thinking I was being frugal, but in the end ended up spending more than I should have. tldr; buy this one and don't waste your money on the others. It is simply the best.

Device is a bit loud bit that was a good distraction for my snotty little guy. It comes with these nifty nail clippers that have a magnifying glass attached to make sure you get a precision nail trimming for your little one.",
