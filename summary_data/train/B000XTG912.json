My hair is softer, less frizzy and it doesn\u2019t leave any residue or buildup. The scent is a nice light coconut smell. I don\u2019t see much difference regarding the length of time it takes to dry. But I wasn\u2019t expecting much in that respect. A little does go a long way but even when I\u2019ve used \u201ctoo much\u201d its not even that bad. It actually seems to help with humidity protection when use too much!",

      "text": "After I began to use this product I noticed that my hair began to fall out in A considerably higher volume. First time, I did not click. But the third time I was able to connect the dots (thinking to myself this can\u2019t be I heard amazing recommendations about this product). I took a break and my hair fall out is back to \u201cnormal\u201d. I thought I was going to loose my entire hair in these 3 washes after using this product. Waste of money and very disappointing as this was my first time ever using Deva Curl product! My hair is wild and easy to please. I can\u2019t believe how it responded to this product- horribly- sadly.",

You won't find it for a better price, as it usually goes for about 24 dollars in stores like Ulta and the official DevaCurl site.
