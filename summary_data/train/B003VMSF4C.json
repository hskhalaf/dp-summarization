Hopefully I don't fall this summer, I'll just be using it until it starts too cool down then I'll go back to leather and buy a real textile jacket for next summer.",

Since my scooter only goes a top speed of 25 mph, I think I'm going to save it for longer trips or cooler weather, but I think it was a terrific deal for $64. My only question is that the armor for the shoulders is actually sewn into the outer edge of the upper arms. I'm not experienced enough to know if this is the usual placement.",

Obviously mesh isn't for protecting against weather elements... so don't try to use it in snow or rain if you didn't know. This will last years! Update 1.5 years in: Speaking of years... still looks brand new. Bear in mind my wife doesn't ride nearly as much as I do. Regardless, such a good purchase and will keep using it until we wear it out.",

In summary this is a good jacket for someone who does not want to spend big bucks on a jacket that will only get used a few times a year.",

Because of this, the armor in the shoulders and elbows do not sit where they should. I also wish it had a removable liner for the cold nights.

We have to cut the jacket in order to use it and that makes it prone to further tearing.",

Has protection but not hot on a summer day, the mesh is awesome- it lets air flow right through it and keeps you nice and cool.I actually bought a lightweight sweater to wear under it for summer nights when it is a little cooler. I did as others suggested and ordered a size up than I normally wear and was happy that I did, fits me perfectly. Very happpy with this purchase. The colors are well represented online.",
