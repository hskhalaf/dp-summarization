Don't know why the company does not make the distinction between the different formulations more obvious on the bottle as that can lead to a bad purchase and dissatisfied buyer. Poor marketing on their part. :-(",

During the time I used these products my hair was flatter and frizzy, and assumed PM changed the formula. But then I was in a drug store recently and really needed the product before a trip so I purchased it. Since I have been using it - no more frizz, the color is slightly darker and the consistency is lighter. This leads me to believe whatever they are selling online is not the real deal.",
