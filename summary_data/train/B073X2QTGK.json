      "text": "The potato sacks are great, i am an entertainer and use them pretty often. for adults it goes over the legs to about the hip and for little little kids it goes to under the armpit which is perfect. the bottom kind of flattens a bit so it is easy to identify where the base is which is a big issue for the children using the burlap sacks. the colors dont really fade because of the parachute type material. For the same price i also got 6 burlap sacks and i regret not getting this first because it really is worth it.",
