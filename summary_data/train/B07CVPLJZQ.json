There are 2 apps to download to go with the unit (why not just one?). One as a controller/remote the other to stream music; both apps are not self explanatory and in many functions redundant. Just one should be created that does everything and is easy to use. Beside that I would highly recommend this unit.",

I called Onkyo and they took me through some troubleshooting which I completed all as requested but it still didn't work. They said that it must be the HDMI board on the device and they said I need to send it to an authorized repair company but they aren't paying for the shipping. So as it turns out if you decide to buy this product you will most likely have to add another $30 or so to the price and you will go without it for a month or so until it's repaired.",

I bypassed the unit altogether for nearly a week and had no issues before sending it back. The receiver I replaced it now has no issues. Sound was great and 1080p content was fine, but if you want to do 4K HDR go with another brand.",
