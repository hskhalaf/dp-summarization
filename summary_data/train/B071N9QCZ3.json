Now I have a lightning fast, (tiny, almost silent!!, ~$400) home server for all my personal coding projects.",

This one is absolutely perfect, looking and running as new. I was surprised to also receive a new keyboard and mouse in the box. NOTE: I had added 2GB Ram to my old one when I bought it, making 4GB. I wondered if this new one would work fast enough with just 2GB. It certainly does! Can't tell any speed differences so far.",
