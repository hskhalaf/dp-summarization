      "text": "I bought these for a low-income school class we sponsor at work. I wanted the kids to have some thick, warm gloves for the Cincinnati winters, but didn't have a huge amount of money, and these were great. I loved the colors--they'd match a lot of the kids' coats--and they are really thick and warm. 2 of the pairs I received had holes in them, but Amazon was nice enough to send out a few replacement pairs so I was able to give some extras to their teacher in case someone lost theirs. These are really nice gloves for this price; I would definitely buy a pair for myself, too.",

They do work on my phone's touchscreen, but they aren't great at it and aren't super specific about touching small letters to type. I sometimes have to repeat gestures or presses multiple times. They also aren't really as warm as I was hoping. But they are definitely a good step up from my previous kids stretch/magic texting gloves. It's not easy for petite adult women with little hands to find decent texting gloves that fit, work, are fairly warm and aren't really expensive. These fit the bill. I wish they had more colors for my nieces.",
