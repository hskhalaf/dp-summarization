The second set of headphones paired OK because they told me they were on, but according to the app they were disconnected",

Off the bat, the app asks for permissions like Contacts, Media, Location, which should be none of its business - and locks up if denied. Oh well. Returning. Btw, briefly tried them on - they are too small for my head, fully extended, which made my ears hurt after 2 minutes. Are they designed for babies?? Very awkward fit.",

Website says latest firmware update is v1.39, but the app wants to install v1.32 first. Only way to update is through the app - a mere 16 hrs on iOS! So two firmware updates totaling 32 hrs to install! Ridiculous! Very disappointed and let down by Audeara's lack of functionality right out of the box. Will be returning to Amazon.",

I ran the hearing test which was simple and took about 10 minutes. The sound is really nice, hard to describe but the effect is much greater after you have used these headphones for a few hours and then you try 'normal' headphones again. I can imagine the effect is even greater if you have damage to your hearing. Aside from the customised hearing function, the headphones feel great and sound very good. I would certainly recommend.",

    "description": "\"\n\n* Winner of the Australian Good Design Awards 2018.\n\nThe Audeara A-01 over ear noise cancelling headphones with Bluetooth feature an innovative built-in hearing test that allows you to calibrate your headphones using an app, for the perfect sound, always. These wireless headphones have an incredible 65-hour battery life, so you won\u2019t have to charge them every day. The active noise cancelling means you can turn it on when you want an immersive listening experience; or turn it off when you want to listen out for announcements, traffic or other outside sounds. \n\nHOW ARE THEY UNIQUE\nOur innovative technology tests your hearing and personalises your favourite music perfectly for you, enhancing your experience through clarity, not volume. These Bluetooth over ear headphones have been designed by engineers and doctors to give you an experience like never before. \n\nHOW THEY WORK\nEveryone has a degree of hearing loss. Every person hears differently, and every person hears differently in each ear. We tailor the sound for each person based on these two principles. The first time you use these headphones you perform a simple hearing test \u2013 the results of which are stored in the headphones themselves. They then use your hearing profile to adjust the sound signal as it passes through them. They adjust your right ear independently from your left, making sure you experience sound in perfect balance. Sometimes the change is enormous, other times it\u2019s subtle, but it\u2019s always there. \n\nCOMFORT & STYLE\nBuilt with an adjustable headband and soft over-ear cushion, the headphones also boast a rotatable design for easy storage in a slim, hard carry case when travelling. They\u2019re stylish, comfortable and feature a built-in mic for hands free calling. \n\nABOUT AUDEARA \nAudeara believe music is one of life\u2019s greatest gifts. A gift that should be cherished. We believe we have created a platform that brings you a listening experience like never before. If you love music, choose headphones that love you back. \n\n\n\"\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nHeadphones\n3.5mm Cable\nCarabineer\nCarry Case\nMicro USB charging cable\nHeadphone case\nQuarter inch jack",
