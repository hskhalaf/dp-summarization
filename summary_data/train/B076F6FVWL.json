I've used these wipes, liberally, on two of them and although they realize that somehow something \"has happened\" they check out the wiped area and continue their lives as normal. These wipes, at least with my cats, don't interfere with greeting; which if you are an avid cat lover you know involves the traditional \"head butt\" and the smelling, bonding, cleaning and grooming of each other that occurs in normal healthy feline families. Plus, they don't run from me when I'm coming at them with these so that's got to say something.",

Because every dog is different, to be safe I would apply the wipe minimally at first, wait 24hrs to make sure your pupper hasn\u2019t had a reaction, and then decide how to use them.

While the wipes aren't scented heavily, it nuetralized the odors! Would definitely recommend!!",
