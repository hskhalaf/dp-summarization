I do want to point out the the waist clip it comes with feels out of place and kind of cheap. It is a basic nylon strap with a plastic clip (which is nice if you are bouldering and do not want to wear a harness) but I would recommend just buying a good carabiner to clip it to your harness.",

Not only that, the draw string, you can open it with one hand but closing it again will most certainly take two, which is not always a pleasure you have on the wall. Beyond that, the belt works well, it holds chalk well and its a very good deal for a light bag with belt and drawstring.",

It doesn't leak nearly as much as other chalk bags do. The fleece interior helps get the chalk evenly distributed without wasting excessive amounts of chalk. I've had one of these since I started climbing years ago and my original is still in great shape. I don't plan to replace it any time soon, I just liked this model so much I bought another one to keep in my gym bag for the weight room.",
