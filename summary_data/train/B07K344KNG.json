You have to learn the hard way that there is no headphone jack. And, you cannot charge while using headphones because the charging input is being used for headphones. They also do not tell you that the screen size is diagonal, so a 12.9\u201d screen is really under 11\u201d. They are becoming too greedy and this will probably be my last Apple product ever because of shady advertising practices and undisclosed buy-ups that you need to function.",
