Anytime my nephew goes to basketball practice, his teammates, coaches, and just about everyone that has a chance to come into contact with it just feels the urge to use it. Unfortunately, it comes to the point where sometimes kids or coaches will use it too much and bring out your kids possessive side, becoming unwilling to share... but that's a consequence of just having a great ball that's sought after. It's hard to describe a product that just begs to be used. It's the nicest kids basketball I've seen, at least. Hopefully your little one can share.",

We kept this ball indoors and that was good because the brown ball was stored in the garage and doesn't quite work as well for the 2nd season. Highly recommend this ball as a parent, former player and coach. Store ball out of elements and should be fine to use for several years.",
