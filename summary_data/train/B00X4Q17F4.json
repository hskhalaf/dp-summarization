I will admit that the reason I bought it was solely based on the name. I mean Unicorn Snot? How funny is that? I absolutely love this product! I love the fact that the shimmer is very subtle (I'm not into looking as though I rolled around in the stuff) and it lasts a long time. In fact, I've woken up the next morning and there was still some on me. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who fancies a nice, subtle shimmer.",

I received the pink and gold snot a couple of weeks ago and the gel is really tacky and applies in clumps rather than being able to easily spread on my skin as the purple is. It feels like the gel in the gold and pink is somewhat dry. I love the colors but like I said I really want to be able to spread it evenly on my skin but am unable to do so with the gold and the pink.",

The best way I found to remove it is to just take a dry rag and wipe, falls right off. If you use water/wet wipe it doesn't come off at all. EDIT I used this product the entire weekend at LL, it worked amazingly! It was ungodly hot but this stayed on through sweat and water.",
