Well, what was supposed to be just something for a little fun (which was, when she has used it) ended up being something she really likes and is planning on taking to work on a regular basis (she says it makes great espresso and is a quick and easy way to do it). Plus, she said it will be great when we go camping (no electric or batteries required, just hot water and it's easy to clean). it arrived quickly and in perfect condition. So, I guess I 'done good' ;)",

What I didn't like: the seals on the unit don't last, not much espresso, disassembling/reassembling seems harder than it should be, hot water tank never seems to securely attach the first time. Now when I attempt to make espresso at my desk, it leaves water all over and squirts out of the pump. I expected the product to last longer. I also don't like how little espresso it makes and the strength of espresso is weak compared to my normal methods. I wish I had bought a used electric machine or something that would last longer.",

I am not sure what exactly stopped working inside of it but it wasn't releasing any of the pressure and it seemed to have been clogged by something. For what I got out of it while it lasted, though, was pretty good. Just again, be careful.",
