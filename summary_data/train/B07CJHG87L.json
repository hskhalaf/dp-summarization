It would say connecting to camera....and never connect a few times. Especially with my husbands phone, nanny\u2019s phone and our iPad. Which was very frustrating. It would connect after being reset, which I had to do 3 times during the month which is a pain. We ended up going with a cheaper WiFi camera with great reviews and the connection is so much faster and more reliable. Read the reviews on the Apple store for safety 1st, I wish I would have done that before I made this purchase.",

Also, the audio unit is so good I could sometimes here sounds from the room next door. Luckily, u can control the sensitivity levels of the camera and audio unit.

      "text": "There is a constant static sound that emits from the camera when it\u2019s on. It wakes my baby up whenever we use it, which totally defeats the purpose. Yes the night vision is good and the picture quality is good but the constant crackling static sound and high pitch buzz make this product useless. Very disappointed.",
