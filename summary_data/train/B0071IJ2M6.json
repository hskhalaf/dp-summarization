The only gripe I have, is why is it so hard to find a battery for this camera.. on eBay, the only place to get it is from Hong kongand it says to make sure it matches the model number, which the picture did not, so I'm not ordering from them... I did find a place that sells one that's a little stronger than the original, but they have no charger for it. I will be looking for a charger on another site. My other camera I had no problem getting an extra battery plus a charger in one place. Other wise I would give it five stars.",

If they would fix that problem with the on/off switch the camera would be fine.",

It takes good, clear photos and video, doesn't weigh too much, and even with the strap, it's not cumbersome or in the way. The only downside is it doesn't get great battery life, and it would be nice to see a version that takes a standard AA or AAA battery, but it wasn't enough to detract from the camera's overall use.",
