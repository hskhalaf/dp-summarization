However, I've not reduced the 5 stars to 4 simply because the Scansnap customer service has been so incredible. This has changed my working practices and made my home office workable.",

My advice - buy something else cheaper, I wish I had. Its a very expensive piece of furniture in our office and everyone still scans with a 5 year old Brother printer/scanner.

The unit is nice and compact, it's very quiet and has coped well with everything I've scanned so far (receipts, letters, payslips, some photos, etc). Once I get more familiar with what the unit and software can do I'm pretty sure I'll be boring everyone around me with my scanning successes.",

Deducted one Star because the software isn't that great. It works fine, but looks & feels like something from the last century. Every action that feels like it should take on click actually takes 4 and overall it's not very intuitive. It's not a major drawback because once it's been set-up, the scanning process is pretty much automatic at a press of the button. It's the typical 'great hardware' - 'mediocre software' phenomenon. Having nicely designed software would make this an outstanding product.",

If you wish to tag documentation and provide a structure you either create a directory structure or purchase additional software e.g. DEVON Think Pro.

I bought the Scansnap ix500 to help fulfil my new years resolution of having a completely paperless office (as far as possible) by the end of the year. With the help of the scanner, Evernote and a bit of dedication my goal has almost been achieved. Scans both sides of an A4 piece of paper within two seconds. It doesn't matter which way up you put the paper because the software will automatically rotate so that the text is the correct orientation. Highly recommended!",
