But then when I got the bottle yesterday it did say that on there. With it saying everything was organically grown I would think that that wouldn't be the case. I do not want to give my dogs something that I can't use. There is an hemp oil out there right now that you can take and your animals can take. Of course it is a little bit more expensive, but I would rather go that route then giving them something that a human cannot use",
