The wall anchors are VERY nice and would support the case even if you filled it with concrete! This case is VERY nice and I am super pleased with how everything came out. TIP: Once you determine where and how high you want it, grab a graduated bubble level (one with measurements like a ruler) and a pencile to measure and mark the wall anchor locations. Then simply follow the instructions.",

No thank you. I decided to see how much it would cost to do it myself. I found a how to video online and decided to purchase this frame. It comes with a cardboard type insert for the jersey or a hanger for a basketball jersey. For me, the cardboard worked well. It also came with pins to keep the jersey in place. I thought it looked good once I got it framed and it made for an impressive gift.",
