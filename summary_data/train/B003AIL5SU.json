It will hang from your kid's bottom, so bending doesn't really do that much. The one thing I was disappointed with was that after wearing it once it had ripped on the inside. I can't sew, but my mother-in-law was able to fix it for me. As for size, my daughter was just over a year and fit in the 12-18 months one. The head may need to be filled with something soft, but easily fixed. She's was in the 90% percentile in height.",

In all, he looked so adorable able we got tons of compliments from anyone who saw him in the costume.

      "text": "This monkey costume is so adorable and seems really well made. Unfortunately, my daughter will not be wearing it this Halloween because she screams bloody murder whenever I put her in it. Two things that you cannot tell from looking at the pictures: 1) the neck of the costume come up pretty high, like a turtleneck, and 2) the headpiece is not a hood that buckles under the chin, it is basically a mask with a hole in it, and there is a snap to fasten it in the back. I would have loved for her to wear this costume, but apparently, as a 16 month old, she has made up her mind to be a princess instead.",

      "text": "This costume contains parts that are not infant-safe. The biggest offender is the tail, which uses a thick gauge wire (8 or 10?) which is sharp and protruding from the end of the tail. My daughter had several cuts underneath her chin from playing with the tail. We could not figure out at first why she was crying but after we saw the blood on her neck, tracked the issue down to the sharp edge of the wire inside the tail.",

This costume had nice finished cuffs and edges, it was fully lined, and the fur was super soft and cuddly against her skin. Her poor brother's costume (made by Rubie's), had raw, unfinished edges, a rough, scratchy unlined interior, and the sparse fake fur came off in clumps and got everywhere (including in his mouth and eyes). I didn't appreciate how well-made this brand was until I had something else to compare it to. Next year, I'll search for Lil Characters costumes only!",
