I bought theses for my Wife (I am using the Plantronics Fit-something and still have my GameCom780) and the quality is just as impressive as when I had mine years ago!

      "text": "The reviewers that tout strong bass in these headphones don't really know what strong bass is.... As a \"basshead\", I was expecting a little bit more from these in the bass department. With that said, these headphones are definitely pretty decent! Unlike most bluetooth in-ear headphones currently in the market, all of the bulk lies in the earpiece themselves, so it's pretty sleek around the neck. They're lightweight, and with the proper seal on the ear, the sound they can produce is actually pretty good. My biggest peeve, however, is in the battery life. If you're planning an all-day hike or bike ride, or outing, you should bring an extra pair, as these will only last you about 4-5 hrs.",

Otherwise the headphones work very well and fit quite nicely. I have tried many in-ear headphones and these are as good as any (among a category where many do not stay in).

Once I received them and tried them on, I didn't really care for the size of the ears buds, the fit, or how well they stayed in. If you turned your head one way or another it seemed to jerk them out of my ear. For these reasons, I decided to go with the LG Tone+ HBS-730 and have been very satisfied thus far.",

Also the control stub bounces up and down on my shoulder causing a large \"thump thump\" to be conveyed through the speakers (think stethoscope analogy). Otherwise - sound quality is excellent and when not running, the design (the bud cap and plastic ring) works well to keep the earphones tight inside your ear...",

Neutral: Battery life is about as advertised (~4 hours). The size and weight of the earbuds takes some getting used to. No issues afterwards though. Con: Fairly lacking in base compared to other headphones I've tried or owned.",

      "text": "I was looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones to use in both the gym and on the road. These are great in both instances! When I'm at the gym I can listen to my music without having to be connected to my phone. No wire getting in the way or tangled! When I'm running on the road I really like that I can store my phone in a hidden pocket out of sight and can still listen to my playlists. The controls on the headphones are very easy to use. I charge them about once a week, and that is probably after 5-6 hours of use. Highly recommend.",

Also, the silicon ear stabilizing pieces dont stay in place anymore. They move around so much that one or both of the headphones come off of my ears too often when I'm moving around. Microphone has poor quality outside of buildings. I think they worked well for the first 2 months, but then started degrading in quality. Would not recommend.",
