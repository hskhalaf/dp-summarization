I bought the 3 gallon version (the 5 gallon is simply taller.) Clean lines, modern aesthetic, really good looking tank for at work and/or at home. The pump does blow my Betta around, even at the lowest setting, as other reviews have noted, so I disconnected it. (The tank size and fish type don't really call for a pump in my case.) Unboxing was great, set up was easy and I've had zero issues after a week of use. The look is well above average and the price is right! Very happy! Highly recommended!",

The temperature of the water is also pretty hard to regulate. Bettas should not be kept in waters higher than 86 degrees F, and it was hard to prevent that with a tank this small. The 5 gallon tank has a guage that allows you to reduce the flow of the suction and the larger size made it easier to regulate temperature and water parameters. It was actually cheaper for some reason too.",

More frustrating, there is no way to remove the back panel, so cleaning inside the filter area is not possible without completely emptying the tank.

      "text": "Really neat, I like it a lot, you just need to make 2 changes on it and it'll meet your expectations. Buy along this tank an Aquatop NP-302 Aquarium Submersible Pump (the one that comes with it is very cheap won't last much) and the lighting for a Wave-point 6-Inch 8-Watt Super Blue and Daylight Micro Sun LED High Output and you are good to go. You won't regret it BUT remember it's a 5 gallon tank, I have 2 snails a crab and 3 YellowTail Damselfish thriving in it (1 1/2 inch approx each one). Good luck!",

Also don't have to worry about lighting system being affected with water damage being outside the lid of the tank.",
