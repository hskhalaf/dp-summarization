The jacket was folded very nicely with directions directly on top. The battery is actually way smaller than I was expecting. It warms up very fast which is great. And it has a one button interface which keeps things simple. You cannot tell there are heating units inside even when you run your hands down the inside of the back to feel for them. Not only are the heating elements warming, the jacket itself is well insulated but not bulky. The fabric has a matte feel and will be easy to keep clean.",

You can buy a more attractive jacket that doesn't heat up and probably zips easier, and costs less. Sorry, I do not recommend.",

      "text": "I am a rural carrier in upstate ny for the post office. This past week we had highs of 17\u00b0. This coat was great. On the high setting it lasted about 3 hours. The medium setting lasted my whole route around 4.5 hours. I ordered a medium and I am 5'4 145 lbs and it fits great. The coat is very good quality and is waterproof and wind resistant for sure. The collar is a bit stiff but I can deal with that. I've never been warmer while working. I highly recommend if you work outdoors.",

This jacket keeps me super warm, is able to be layered with, and compliments every outfit! My only complaint is the battery. I've had this jacket for over a year now and it annoys me that the battery will sometimes randomly shut off and I have to unzip the entire jacket, go into the battery compartment, unplug it, plug it in again, and then wait for the jacket to reheat up. That is my only complaint besides that everything else about this jacket is perfect. Great for us who don't like the cold!",

I would love to purchase a second battery pack, because 2 hours on high simply isn't enough. Overall I would say this is the best investment I have made in a LONNNGG time!",

I don't notice it anymore. Only thing I don't like about it is it is a more bulky coat - but that helps to keep you warm.",

The sizes do run a bit small like other reviews have mentioned. My wife is pregnant and not very large except for her belly and the xl is still too snug for her to wear right now. Might be a bit unfair to judge off a pregnant woman but that's all I can do. If you need more than a large maybe look elsewhere.",

There are 3 heat settings. The high setting uses the battery quickly. The instructions were not clear to me and it took me a while to find where to turn it on. Of course, now it is no problem. The chest and back are the warm places. I take disposable hand warmers when it is really cold. Overall, I am happy with my purchase.",

The jacket is form-fitting and should be perfect for layering.",

I love that the battery pack has a USB port to charge my phone also and lasts for multiple days/uses. The hood zips off which I find very convenient so I can layer another coat on top so I don't ruin it. The 3 settings is really nice so I'm not fighting with being too hot or too cold. I will definitely purchase from this company again and have referred anyone that asks about my coat. Thank you for an awesome product!",

I highly recommend them as they are not only wonderfully functional, they look so much better than other heated jackets I was looking at that had a higher $$ tag.",

The battery is depleted in short time just being plugged into the jacket. If you wear it on a day where you know it will get colder later, like when the sun goes down, unplug the battery until you absolutely need it. It's a very nice sporty jacket, and it will get hot, but it won't last you more than just a few hours.",
