I have been able to color pictures in this book using Crayola markers and there is NO bleed through. I can't even remotely tell what marker colors I used on the other side of a page. I most definitely will be purchasing other books from this publisher!",

The outlining is done in thick black lines, and the pages are thick. After cracking the spine, the book can easily be spread to color each side. We've found the binding holding the pages together to be a great quality. So great that the pages don't tear out well. Doing so seems to warp the entire binding. This isn't a problem for our family as we like the idea of keeping all the pages together. Exceptional first coloring book. Completely worth the money!",

We bought this in September last year, and she just about has all of the pictures colored now. So it has lasted her almost a year. She went from making a couple of marks on the paper to really covering the page with colors. She still isn't coloring inside the lines, but she is enjoying the process of putting lots of color on the paper. I am getting ready to buy another coloring book in this series to occupy her once this one is full.",

She is a huge fan of this book; we use it with her thicker washable markers.

I wasn't thrilled about paying $9 for something she will just scribble all over, but it's huge and I think will last awhile. I love that it's not a \"brand\" and just has everyday things in it.

Usually I pick ones up at the drugstore or dollar store and they are all the same: thin bible paper with repetitive images from tv shows. This one is great- no branding, just simple drawings with thick, forgiving lines that kids like with room for creativity. Also, the pages are super thick. We\u2019ve only used crayons here, but pretty certain that the pages would hold up okay to markers. Love it!",
