The various feature modes, which I thought were a gimmick at first, are actually pretty fun. Panorama mode is neat too, no more stitching the pictures together manually. My only complaint is the charging method it comes with is garbage. To charge the battery, you need to leave it in the camera and hook the power adapter to the camera itself. Do yourself a favor and pick up the third party battery charger (which charges the battery itself) in a pack with two spare batteries for about $30:.",

Almost a professional camera it usurp their territory making PRO Quality HiDef clear and crispy shots (16MP). 30X Zoom plus Digital Zoom take you to the smallest details. Optical Image Stabilization is excellent. All-in-One Camera no need to be carrying a lot of stuff, lenses, etc. As easy and automated, or as complex and manual, as you'd like to use it (or your family). Very completed camera with a lot of good features, much more than you can imagine. There's no better bridge camera to date*!!! * Not even Canon IX30IS, really.",

The auto focus 'tries' to focus on the subject but half the time it stops with it out of focus. The manual focus is a joke - the focus dial doesn't respond to turning unless you turn it very quickly. It's basically unusable. This could be a great camera if the focus wasn't so horrible.",

It's better to send a travel charger with the cam than a video camera charger, especially that mostly people will never use it while it's pluged.

The normal pictures are just great, and the setup is easy to follow if you learn your controls. To enjoy this camera, you do not need to be professional, you just need to learn the user guide.

In addition, the combined \u201cExmor R\u201d CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080i movie modes.6\n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Sonar T Lens with 27mm equivalent wide angle lens and 30x Optical Zoom\nThe high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonar T lens with 30x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for video recording as well as for outdoor, sports, and travel photos, and Close Focus shoots close-ups up within a \u00bd-inch of the subject. A 27mm equivalent wide-angle lens allows you to take wider shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces.\n\n3.0-inch XtraFine LCD \n3.0-inch XtraFine LCD with TruBlack technology gives you deeper blacks and more color in your display, all while being thinner than most LCDs.\n\nFull HD 1080/60p \nRecord crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60p in 1080 Full HD. This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your Blu-ray Disc players, Sony PlayStation3 systems and compatible PCs and HDTVs. \nBacklight Correction HDR \nDon\u2019t miss a single detail in high contrast shots. The built in backlight correction analyzes the image and automatically adjusts accordingly to give you a perfectly lit shot. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking three pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of each into a single image for more natural looking shots.\nHi-speed Linear Focus \nLife moves fast, your camera\u2019s focus needs to move just as fast. The Hi-speed linear focus achieves dramatically clearer images with an auto focus that moves just as fast as your life.\n3D still images and panorama \nProduce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities4. Images will take on a new dimension of creative capabilities for viewing the world in a whole new way.\nHigh resolution iSweep Panorama mode \nWith high resolution iSweep Panorama mode just press the shutter, pan the landscape and let the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a high resolution panoramic image providing the ability to zoom in on small details. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion.\nBackground Defocus \nDSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.\n\nSuperior Auto Mode \nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and 44 scenes for movies, making it easy to get the best shot.\nDigital Zoom \nCapturing the right shot at the right moment has never been so easy. Digital zoom brings the action up close to get that perfect shot, every time.\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization \nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality.\nSoft Skin Mode \nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.\nNatural Flash \nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\nHDMI output \nThe High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as a compatible camcorder, Blu-ray Disc player, a personal computer, a video game console, or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and/or video monitor such as a digital television (DTV). Easily connect your Cyber-shot camera via HDMI cable (sold separately) to any compatible HDMI device to easily enjoy and upload content. \nSmile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.\nFace Detection technology\nSony\u2019s Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.\nAnti-blink Function\nIt\u2019s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \nSweep Multi Angle Mode \nIn Sweep Multi Angle mode, the camera takes 15 images at different angles as it sweeps across the scene. By tilting the camera during playback, the camera\u2019s Gyro Sensor detects motion and displays the image in a 3D-like view on the camera\u2019s LCD.\nAnti-Motion Blur Mode\nCapture cleaner and sharper images in low light for non landscape shots. When set in Anti-motion Blur Mode, the DSC-HX100V captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and dramatically reduce subject blur, beyond the capability of traditional cameras.\nTransferJet technology \nTransferJet technology, developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by a consortium of 18 other companies, allows you to transfer up to ten files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching their TransferJet logos together, without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing.5\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.5\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD using an external DVD burning device (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites (such as Facebook and Sony\u2019s Personal Space site). \nIncludes Sony PMB Portable software \nWith the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable software the DSC-HX100V makes it easy to pre-select videos and images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites without the need for any additional software or install.2 \n 1.
