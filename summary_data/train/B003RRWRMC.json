They sound great and dont have the static, background interference, and other problems the other products have. Excellent.",

Well, he basically can't get more than 15 feet away, or even be on the other side of a truck (or under one) 5 to 10 feet away without it phasing in and out or losing the signal completely. For us it was a big waste of money. It's a shame, I had such high hopes.",

These headphones are wireless which is a big plus especially in winter when you have all these extra layers of clothing. Also, carrying a satchel and bundles of mail mean wires are constantly getting caught and pulled out os your ears or the socket. The sound is very good, no static, and the headphones actually help to keep my ears warm. Would recomend this product to anyone and everyone.",
