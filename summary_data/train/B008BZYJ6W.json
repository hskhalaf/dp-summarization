Additionally, the front of the case does not allow decent air flow through the case, and if one uses the extra hard disk cage at the top, it makes matters worse for air flow through the case. Choosing to put the power switches on the side of the case makes the case even more difficult to work as one has to be careful these connectors do not pull the wires from the mainboard noting it may be necessary to remove that panel to work in the chassis.",

Because of the style, and having an optical drive bay, it's not nearly as compact as others I've seen. I have done an ITX build before in a case that's about the size of a Skechers shoe box. The front fan slot allows for great airflow with a large 200mm fan and it's fairly easy to do a build in. My main recommendation for novice builders is to get as many motherboard connections done as possible before securing it to the frame.",

It's bigger than I expected, but that's mostly my fault for not using a tapemeasure when reading the specs. The side panels are a bit loose, if you tap them they make a clanking noise.

      "text": "Awesome case for its size, fits everything I need it to and more. Minus 1 star because mine arrived damaged. There are no signs of damage on the cardboard box or any of the packaging and it was completely sealed up. The threads where one of the thumb screws for the side panel goes was bent pretty bad. It doesn't really effect anything, but it would be nice to be able to use both thumbscrews to secure the panel.",

The flexible handle on the top absorbed most of the shock and the computer was fine. Though the handle broke I am very happy with this case. It has plenty of air flow and with a full sized modular PSU I was still able to fit in two 3.5in hard drives.",

But in the end, it looks great and works great and that's what matters to me.",

The HDD access led is very bright and distracting, I'll probably end up disconnecting it the next time I have the case open. No complaints beyond that though, I'll definitely be keeping an eye on future models from BitFenix based on a positive experience with this model.",
