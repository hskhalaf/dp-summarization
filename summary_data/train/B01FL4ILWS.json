      "text": "I've tried several different brands and types of straps/wraps for use with BFR training and none ever got close to the effect of the personalized tourniquet systems (specifically the one Delphi manufactures). This brand is not quite as effective as the Delphi unit but it is FAR and AWAY the best of the low cost straps I have tried. Yes, they are a tad more expensive than some of the other brands but they are also much more effective and easily worth the difference in price. If you have any interest in BFR training I highly recommend these.",

Perhaps what separates these cuffs from the others is the design that lets you tighten the cuffs (particularly the arm cuffs) with one hand. I've had lots of nods and numerous questions at the gym and the general consensus is that these cuffs are way better and easier to use than \"knee wraps\". Lastly, I had a couple of questions about the straps and sent a quick email to customer service. Their response was fast and thorough. I was super impressed!",

      "text": "I already own a decent pair of occlusion cuffs, but saw these and figured since they were a little less wide and more flexible fabric they'd be worth a shot. I haven't used them yet but did test fit them several times, and they feel very good. Easy to adjust and take off with one hand, the metal buckles are very high quality. The fabric itself is quite thick and of high quality. I will run them through their real paces later this week, but the quality here is the highest I've seen in an occlusion band yet. Excellent!",

I was excited and couldn't wait to get them. Once they were available, I purchased them the same day. They arrived quickly and I also go a nice guide on how to use both upper and lower body bands. The bands themselves look very well made with an iron buckle and the fabric is soft and flexible, but very strong. Here is a video I made with them on my instagram page @padilla_personal_training",
