It keeps dirt and debris from blowing back onto your Drone. Keeps the gritty dirt out of your motor and dusting your camera lens. Nice weight to it so that it doesn't blow away or flap around when taking off or landing. Also lets others around you know where you are taking off and landing which in turn keeps them a safe distance. Folds up nicely and has its own carry-bag.",

This is big enough to were you can still see it while at 300+ feet via the drone camera. This is a great land pad!",

    "description": "The Hoodman HDLP3 Drone Landing Pad is a great accessory investment for your DJI Phantom and smaller RC Quadcopter adventure video endeavors. A Hoodman launch pad will keep your lens clean throughout takeoff and landing. Nothing worse than mowing the lawn with your rotors. Your launch pad will protect your rotors from tall grass and pebble strikes. Your first sandy beach takeoff and landing will pull sand through your motor bearings and blast your lens and gimbal with sand. Deploy the Hoodman landing/launch pad in seconds as it springs out of its compact 13 inch carry bag. No need to carry a hammer and stakes to keep your pad in place; Hoodman launch pads have weighted perimeters and stay put on the windiest of days. Safely and clearly mark your next takeoff and landing area with a Hoodman launch pad. Hoodman has been a trusted name in rugged, drone, camera and video accessories for over 33 years and offers a 1 year warranty: free from manufacturing defects.",
