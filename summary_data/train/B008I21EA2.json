I bought this as a gift for my parents to replace their terribly outdated wrt54g. Got it up and running in minutes. Imagine my disappointment when I realized the range is noticeably worse than the nearly obsolete model I just replaced. It barely extends to the roku in their bedroom and drops signal in places They used to have steady signal. Within 20 feet it's great. Go any further than that and the signal drops off a cliff.

Rebooting the wireless does sort out the issues temporarily, but it's been a nuisance to come home to find out the wireless is turtle-slow and chugging into unusable territory.

      "text": "I bought 2 of these routers to use in my 2 story house. I intended to use 1 of them in bridge mode as just an access point for upstairs. This worked fine for a while but all of the sudden the one that I set up as an access point crashed and now it won't accept any incoming connections. I can log into it just fine and it says that it is working as it should but it isn't. I have factory reset it and still nothing. The router that I have set to function as a router works just fine. It accepts incoming connections just like it is supposed to.",

When I check with a link, this system had been in used since 2014, and the warranty expired.",

Unfortunately, I believe that they have a component that is failing causing these to stop working. I will say that when it worked, the wireless signal was very fast.",

I prefer MAC filtering anyway, but was hoping to see the WPS work at least between Linksys devices.
