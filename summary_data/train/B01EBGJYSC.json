The remote is fantastic, it simply knows what is connected to the TV, and controls it...all of it. I can't speak to the sound, because I run my audio through a 5.1 channel system. The apps work really well (Netflix, HBO Now, YouTube, Amazon Video, etc). Its a set worth hanging on a wall where all can see it. Simply beautiful picture for the average viewer. If you're a TV snob, I can't help you. For the other 99% of us, you'll love it.",

EDIT, bumping up to 5 stars, got over the missing screws, and this is a wonderful replacement for an array of Monitors, as least for this Computer Programmer.",

      "text": "Beautiful picture. Curve doesn't seem beneficial. If anything, it picks up more reflected light from the range of angles of the screen. Easy hookup, but needs at least one more HDMI hub. BIGGEST ISSUE: The Internet icon cannot be blocked. You can take it off the home screen list, but it is always available, and any kid that wants it can find it. This is a serious software issue (for me, at least) that needs to be corrected NOW by Samsung. If Samsung would provide a means to password protect this, I would give it 4 stars.",
