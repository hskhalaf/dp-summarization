The keyboard is nice and turns the tablet into a nice laptop. While it is definitely a budget machine, the only place I really notice that is in the small internal storage. This wouldn't be a problem except for the way KitKat now handles app storage. I've managed to work around this as only a minor inconvenience.

Quite simply, this is a great Android tablet. The graphics and video quality are wonderful, and everything is fast and responsive.

Other than that one issue, I'm very pleased with its performance.",
