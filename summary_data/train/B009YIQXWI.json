It seems to be a sturdy product, but the quality of the upholstery leaves much to be desired. If you are determined to buy this product, I would suggest you try the cloth version. Maybe it will hold up, where the leather has failed. This was clearly a waste of my money.",

I am so impressed by this company...this is the way companies used to do business...stand behind their products! it's very rare to have great customer service and a company that is proud of their products. thank you convenience concepts!",

Update: less than 3 months of use and the block the leg screws into fell off in an irreparable way. It was under light use - propping up feet, moving a few inches left or right.",

      "text": "This ottoman came in a very nice brown faux leather color. The ottoman was very easy to assembly with just 4 legs needed to be screwed into the bottom. It came well packaged, without any damage to the ottoman during shipping. Overall it\u2019s held up relatively well, but only time will tell. I will say I am fairly skeptical on longitivtiy of the product, as the buttons on top seem to be shifting with use and look like they may pop off (they have not yet). The opening mechanism is also not the most well built - so be gentle.",

Instead of the standard square or pyramid style legs this piece comes with round, espresso-colored wood legs which give it a nice touch. For the price this ottoman is beautiful and affordable.",
