Comfortable, easy to use--just sit, relax and gently move your feet back and forth. Now, as for results--WOW! My feet feel so relaxed where before they always felt tight. Nerve endings are soothed. More than this, there have been all body reaching effects. For instance I carry stress in my shoulders and neck. After a session with the massager, that area feels relaxed. When I use it briefly after a meal, my digestion seems greatly improved. I experience overall relaxation throughout y body. Thank you for this great product!",

I started recently having stabbing pains in my heel- I was told by a podiatrist I have bone spurs and plantar fasciitis- all he did was give me a cortisone shot (which only lasted a couple of weeks and which I later received a $300 bill for) and sell me on some $60 insoles. I'm so glad I came across this product! It feels SO GOOD on my feet and even though I've only had it a few days I'm already having less foot pains.",

I don't know how this product cured my foot pain but it did. It worked so well that I have already referred several friends to buy this and they feel better too. Granted there are days when my feet are sore. When I have any sore feet pain, I pull out my roller and the pain is gone when I wake up the next morning.",
