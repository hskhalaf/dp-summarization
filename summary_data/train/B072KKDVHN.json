      "verdict": "The V-Trail is a minimalist off-road shoe that is suitable for runners and racers who are relatively experienced in barefoot running. It is designed to handle rough trails, including slush and muck that is usually brought about by winter conditions. The structure of this shoe is made to withstand tough use by adventurous wearers.",
      "pros": [
        "Many users thought the Vibram FiveFingers V-Trail was extremely comfortable and breathable",
        "One reviewer was amazed that the shoe provided a tight and secure grip on slick surfaces",
        "Several runners agreed that it felt great on the foot and it fit them comfortably well",
        "The shoe was durable enough and did not show any signs of wear even after many months of usage, according to a user",
        "It provided a subtle amount of cushioning that was just right for a five-fingered shoe, as stated by a reviewer",
        "One buyer mentioned the shoe helped relieve their pain from walking",
        "A majority of runners claimed there was adequate protection from the shoe against sharp rocks and roots",
        "A couple of runners said the shoe was comfortable enough to be worn without socks",
        "A reviewer said the V-Trail allowed them a more efficient running experience and has brought less strain on the knees compared to ordinary running shoes"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A number of users found that the colors of the shoe bled and stained their sock and foot",
        "The shoe needed quite a long time to break in, as observed by a couple of runners",
        "Some buyers said that the shoe felt tight and narrow",
        "The heel bed was narrow and the toe part caused abrasions, according to one user",
        "One reviewer pointed out that the shoe was not easy to put on or take off because of its unique foot-shaped design"

I did my first ultra (47 miles of trails) in them, having done most of the training in KSOs, and had a great race. Many things hurt afterwards but my feet were not amongst them. (If you are not a regular vff wearer then I would recommend a very careful transition over a long period of time in much thinner soled vffs, such as KSOs, which are much closer to the barefoot experience.)",
