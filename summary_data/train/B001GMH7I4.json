I installed in a bathroom remodel and the heater will boost the bathroom temp in a matter of minutes. It helps of course when the room is small and the heater is over-sized. Instructions are of good quality. I haven't measured energy usage, but for a small bathroom, in an old farmhouse in Maine, the costs seem very reasonable.",

The second set were also defective. When I requested replacements, the company sent me a heater instead of the thermostat. This made returns deadlines expire. I had to refuse the heater at the post office and I now have to dispute the deadlines for the thermostat returns. Then hire an electrician for a third time to remove the defective ones in order to replace them. Too much nonsense for a mediocre product that I am stuck without being able to use. I do not recommend.",

The electric bill wasn't too much higher and the gas bill went down as we could lower the thermostat in those rooms.",

    "title": "Fahrenheat PLF Liquid Filled Electric Hydronic Baseboard Heater, 46 inches, Navajo White",
    "description": "For maximum, steady heat with a gentle and comfortable effect, the 120V Fahrenheat PLF Liquid Filled Electric Hydronic Baseboard Heater is the solution. This hard-wired UL-listed unit uses liquid-element technology, which makes it cool to the touch. This feature makes it an excellent choice to use just about anywhere, since it\u2019s safe for kids and pets. The large element reservoir maximizes volume of heat storage fluid for prolonged comfort while maintaining individual room temperature, so you\u2019re only heating the rooms you want. The linear high-temperature safety cutout automatically shuts off the unit if the air is blocked, and the tip-over switch prevents it from operating if it\u2019s knocked over. The sleek, contemporary design seamlessly blends into most room aesthetics. Thanks to the high-impact Lexan ends and steel body, this heater resists dents, scratches, and rust. Fahrenheat is part of the Marley Engineered Products family, which provides a wide range of innovative, quality engineered, commercial, industrial, and residential electric comfort heaters and ventilation solutions. All our products are engineered with aesthetics, functionality, safety, and structural tolerance in mind.",

      "USE ANYWHERE DESIGN: This heating unit provides gentle heat with maximum efficiency. Its hydronic design and safety grille means it stays cool to touch while providing unobstructed radiant heat, making it safe to use around small children and pets.",
      "OPTIMAL HEAT: The low-profile design makes it perfect for home use in bedrooms, basements, bathrooms, and living rooms, and perfect for commercial use in waiting rooms, day cares, offices, and more.",
      "EASY TO INSTALL: This unit can mount directly to any wall, and flat on the floor to wood, tile, and even carpet; the trim and low operating temperature allows for carpeting to be installed around it.",
      "SAFE AND EFFICIENT: This energy-efficient design reduces unnecessary on/off cycles, and the overheat protection feature prevents the heater from running when its air intake is blocked, reducing risk of fire.",
      "QUIET AND EFFECTIVE: The convection heater operates without the annoying popping and pinging noise that many other models give off. The fan-less operation keeps dust, allergens, and dander from circulating through the room."
