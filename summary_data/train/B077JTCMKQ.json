I had it for 14 years and it worked well with the exception of the piezoelectric starter; when the temperature dropped a lot or if it rained, the starter wouldn't work and I'd have to take a small blowtorch to the burners. The Spirit II 315 has an electric start (AA battery) that has started on the first zap every time. The other thing that I really like is that the three burners are laid from front to back instead of side-to-side. It makes it easier create temperature zones on the grill.",

Grill cooks well however with the 3rd time of usage the pressure regulator starts to leak pretty bad. Bummer because we were really ready to enjoy our summer grill out!",

      "text": "This grill is great, with the following caveat. This is about my 5th Weber, and my first that doesn't have an enclosure with doors for the propane tank and other parts. After using it twice, raccoons climbed under the grill cover and stole the aluminum foil drip pan to lick the steak drippings. I woke up and found the pan in the middle of my backyard. So, we will see if this continues, but would make me think twice about buying this again",

With all burners up high it does get up to 600+ degrees (gauge pegs out at 600). With all 3 burners on low it was at 425, so if you want lower temps than that you'll need to turn off a burner or two.
