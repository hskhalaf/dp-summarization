No system UI so cant get to settings or any streaming. The movie plays, but without sound. So wasted 2 weeks of waiting just so amazon can hold on to my money, just to give it back to me. This might be the 5th thing i bought refurbished, first time from Amazon warehouse, the only time I got a bunk machine. Maybe test the merchandise first Amazon....",

This one loads quickly and plays every disc I threw at it, even worn out discs from the library. So happy now!",
