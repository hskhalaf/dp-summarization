I seriously question if this product is authentic from this seller, as it does not have the \"certified yellow sticker\" that Clinique uses when a product is purchased. I have been using this soap over the last 12-15 years (purchased from a Clinique counter) and the one from this seller has a distinct smell (which none of the previous ones I purchase from Clinique has any noticeable smell at all). And my face seems to be breaking out with the product from this seller as well, and I've never had this problem in the past either. This product when authentic is awesome, I advise buying direct from Clinique online/counter.",

I always have to take the lid off and try to get the remainder out by putting the dispenser upside down. Overall great product for any face/skin type.",
