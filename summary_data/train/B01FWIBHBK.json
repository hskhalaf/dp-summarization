Next time, I will order at least a half size larger.",

The way it dried was like a stone was stuck in her shoe. I took the shoe apart, scrapped off the glue, sewed them back up, and now they work great again. The hard chunk of glue was the same on both shoes, so I don't feel like it was a fluke with one shoe.",

The bottom pads are sewn straight up through the insoles, which would likely be uncomfortable but other than a small strip of adhesive, it\u2019s the only thing keeping the insole attached to the shoe. There is no stretch anywhere in the canvas which could make for a very uncomfortable ballet class. I suppose if you had a wide-footed dancer who is just trying out a ballet class, this might suffice. But for a dancer with a little bit of experience who requires a little more from their shoe, this one falls short.",

If this happens to you, you can get a paper clip, unfold it, tie one end of the string on and then thread it through. Simple enough, but annoying.
