I would have had to buy another cable, USB-C to display port, for about $50 to make it work properly. That made the whole purchase too expensive. I did not use the monitor long enough to comment on quality or other features. I am buying a different monitor with FreeSync via HDMI, which my laptop has.",

I really like the durability and picture quality of this product. If you are looking for a good monitor that plays 144hz at 1080p for under $150 then this should be a viable option for you. I bought this gaming monitor to go with my RX580 Ryzen 5 build. Product was very easy to put together and I like the option to hook your head phones on the back of the monitor as well. Overall great quality and product, wont disappoint. Picture quality is clear, no missing pixels are anything that interferes with the picture quality.",

It barely reached from the floor to the monitor on a double stand. Ended up purchasing a 10ft cable, I would recommend other doing the same unless you have your source right next to the monitor.

I play mostly BF4 using this monitor, but have played some other titles and they look great. I am hoping to pickup an RX 480 and utilize Freesync, but even without Freesync it is still a great monitor. Haven't used the speakers, so I can't say much about them.",
