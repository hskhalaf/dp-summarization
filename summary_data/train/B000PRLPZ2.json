      "text": "We ordered 2 lamps which worked perfect along each side of my bed since we had a limited amount of space to work with and also wanted to have something to set our phone, water, or a book on at night. Putting them together took about 20-30 mins while watching a football game. All of the parts were included and they look just like what the picture shows. We use LED lights in them which work perfect and even if we have only 1 on at night we can still both read etc as there is plenty of light! We are very happy with our purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a similar product!",

Higher-wattage bulbs can be used in this lamp, which is great because I only need one lamp in my living room. I like that the shade softens the harshness of the bulbs, and makes the room feel really cozy. Plus the shelves are great for knick knacks/books/picture frames/etc. Great lamp!",

We saw a similar lamp at our big box store for the same price, but that one seemed to be more cheaply made. This assembled easily. You just need to insert some threaded rods into holes, and that is easier to do if you wear a work glove to protect your hand.",

      "text": "Purchased 2 of these for either side of my TV. They look great. With 60 watt bulbs, they give off a small amount of light. Good mood lighting that does not overpower the TV. 100 or 150 watt bulbs would light the room nicely. After a quick look over the instructions it took 10 minutes to assemble each. Quality is decent. They sit on carpet and i am not worried about them falling over. Make sure they are not too tall for where your putting them. They sit a couple inches taller then my 70\" LED on a normal TV stand. Would recommend to anyone. Very happy with my purchase.",
