It says one page at a time, and that's what you can do otherwise you will cause a jam. Was able to scan three pages in one minute. It is great if you want to give each employee a scanner to use at their desk, but on the road or being mobile it just doesn't work trying to connect to your cellular wireless or hotspot. Can you guys please fix this for the future?",
