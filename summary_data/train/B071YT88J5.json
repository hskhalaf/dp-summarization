Obviously one can't use the stakes on such ground. This is a clean solution. One does not need to use sand. I use rocks that I find in the launch area. It doesn't need much weight to do the job.",

Since the bags were the reason I bought this particular pad, but they\u2019re not usable as purchased, 3 stars. Hope that\u2019s not too harsh, guys. Bags you can add weight to is an excellent idea, for little gusts of wind.",
