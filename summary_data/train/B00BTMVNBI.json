The rug that came today has flaws on two of the corners. I'm pretty sure that the surfaces won't separate, but it doesn't look too nice. For that reason I give the overall 2 stars. Were it not for these flaws, I'd give this a solid 5 stars.",

    "description": "Size:\"3' Length x 2' Width\"| Color:Black SmokeWaterHog Eco Premier mats are durable, stain-resistant mats with a unique bi-level design that traps dirt and moisture below shoe level, keeping your floors clean, dry, and safe. WaterHog Eco Premier mats feature an attractive diamond patterned surface that\u2019s both beautiful and . The fabric is made with a durable solution-dyed fiber that dissipates water for quick drying and will not fade or rot. The fiber is polyethylene terephthalate, commonly referred to as PET. PET is made with 100% post-consumer recycled plastic from drink bottles. When you purchase a product made with 100% PET, you\u2019re helping keep dozens of plastic bottles out of our oceans and landfills! And WaterHog mats are backed with SBR rubber which contains 20% post-consumer recycled rubber from car tires. The rubber will not crack or curl, ensuring your mat will lie flat and remain in place. If you\u2019re looking for a beautiful, mat that will provide years of reliable performance, look no further than WaterHog Eco. Manufactured by M+A Matting in the USA, WaterHog mats are THE ORIGINAL bi-level mats. The extreme popularity has led to countless \u201ccopycat\u201d products. WaterHog is often imitated, but it is never replicated. M+A uses the highest quality raw materials (and in the case of WaterHog Eco, sustainable materials) and meticulous design standards to manufacture commercial grade mats made to perform for years. If you want a quality mat that will keep your floors clean and dry, make sure you purchase a genuine WaterHog.",
