This one fits securely onto the toliet & dosent move. He feels confident now going to the bathroom, if he wants to use another toliet, he takes this thing along with him. It's the funniest thing.

And the step part is huge which is great for him to turn around and pull up his pants. Also the handles are a great touch to help them balance while getting up and down.
