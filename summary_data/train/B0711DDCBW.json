I recommend looking at their website for additional helpful tips on the configuration based on stud spacing etc. It turned out to be a lot easier to install and they include all of the necessary screws and even the drill bit. In short it looks great and our cat loves it! Great craftsmanship. I will be expanding with their other configurations soon.",

Installation was pretty fast and easy. We had to be a little creative with some odd stud spacing, but managed to get at least one side of most pieces into a stud. I recommend this for anyone with a cat who likes height, and an owner who hates having to sweep around cat trees on the floor! The workmanship and quality on the pieces are great. Nice solid wood with sturdy canvas.",

It wasn't 100% dry so the canvas got some stain on it. Anybody know how to get stain out of the canvas? I contact customer service and they offered nothing except they wanted a photo for their records. Not impressed.",

    "title": "CatastrophiCreations Cat Mod Climb Track Handcrafted Wall Mounted Cat Tree Shelves, English Chestnut/Natural, One Size (528375911ENNAT)",
    "description": "The Climb Track is the perfect full setup. Our cats love the Vertical Sisal Pole, but we always had to set up our walls to give them a route down once they got up to the top. For the Climb Track, we combined a 4\u2032 Vertical Sisal Pole with some of our other pieces so that the route down is built into the complex. This set is a great option for homes with multiple cats or one spoiled cat! Having sisal pieces around our home has completely stopped our cats from scratching the furniture. For the layout shown it uses four studs spaced out at 16 apart center-to-center. This complex comes with a 4-foot tall vertical sisal pole, with fabric attachment mounts on the left. The Cat Mod Climb Track comes in your choice of Unfinished, English Chestnut, or Onyx wood. All sets will come with the canvas color of your choice (second option upon choosing the item) and Nickel mounting hardware. We use solid wood for the shelving and mounting posts, and thick heavy-weight canvas for the hammocks. All of the brackets come attached for easy installation: 124 Canvas fabric4' Vertical sisal-lined pole18 Sisal-lined escape hatch5 Mounting planks Would you like to add a Feeding Station or fun Escape Hatch onto your wall-mounted setup? Check out our Cat Mod Add-ons. Standard Dimensions: Total Width: 56 Total Height: 52. 5 Depth: 11- About The Cat Mod We're excited to introduce the Cat Mod, the second generation of our fabric cat complexes. When creating the Cat Mod, we made sure to maintain all the positive aspects of our original collection of cat hammocks and complexes, such as strength, appearance, and quality, while also adding some new and exciting features that elevate it from the original collection. This system allows you to remove the fabric from the structure without having to take down any of the mounted planks from your wall. Not only will this make cleaning a breeze, but it will allow you to continue to build the structure at your leisure. This gives you the option of switching out canvas fabric colors down the road.",
