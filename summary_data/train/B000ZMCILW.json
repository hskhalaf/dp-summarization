This 18-55 is a great wide angle zoom lens that is good for shooting outside, nighttime photography (no flash), and shooting with a flash. I found it challenging in low light conditions and resorted to using my 1.8 35 and 50mm lens when I didn't have a flash. It's great for shooting architecture, especially with a tripod.

The image quality is superior to the non-DX version, as per my testing. It focuses very close, and is light as a feather (as lenses go).

      "text": "I was going to Peru, well known for thievery, plus the fact that I intended to walk a lot and the 17-55 is definitely heavier. Anyway, the 18-55 has been sharp enough compared to its price and weight, has resisted to the treks, and since my 55-300 has been stolen during the trip, I definitely think it was a good idea to not take the 1.500$ lense... Note that compared to the 17-55, there is the VR stabilization which partially balances the lack of aperture.",
