She was able to pas a the car seat test that the hospital required to be able to leave. For such a tiny baby the seat really was giant. We had to roll washcloths and place them under her butt to make the smallest strap settings work (hospital\u2019s suggestion). Thankful it does work for tiny babies. (Picture is from when she was 2 weeks old, approx 4lbs 10oz)",

If you have an infant, this doesn\u2019t have a handle, nor does it detach from the base. So you can\u2019t bring it in to restaurants or anywhere, meaning you have to have another option for the infant. Additionally, it\u2019s heavy! So, switching the car seat between vehicles is a cumbersome process. We ended up getting the Grace snugride 30 for a fraction of the cost (in addition to this one) so we\u2019d have a car seat that can easily swap vehicles, and that we can take into places",

And most kids' sippee cups/bottles are going to be too big for these cup holders. So just be aware, you'll need a slimmer bottle for these for long car trips. Or maybe just use them to hold goldfish.",

It is a heavy seat to move from one vehicle to another but that just proves the quality & safety Graco put into this seat. It is steel reinforced so I'm at ease each time I strap my lo into this seat. Very satisfied!",
