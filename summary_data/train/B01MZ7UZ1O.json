And the color is pretty. It\u2019s not gaudy like most dog clothes on the market. And it\u2019s kept her from shaking on brisk days. My only negative is the hood. It\u2019s kinda silly. She got annoyed with it flopping around so I tucked it inside. I\u2019d buy every color if it didn\u2019t have the hood.",

We may pin it back or even remove it if it continues to be a problem. But, she LOVES it!! She loves wrapping up in her blankets so wearing one is perfect for her. It's warm, fuzzy and stays put.

I'm not a \"dress up your dog\" type person but he's getting older and at 13.5 years old and a polar vortex happening, he needed a bit more protection. This fits the bill. After putting it on him a few times, he now comes running over when I call his name and hold up the jacket. Quality is great for the price and it's fairly water repellent. I'll be buying more in different colors.",

I am going to have to shorten the bottom a bit so it clears his business, but other than that the fit is great.
