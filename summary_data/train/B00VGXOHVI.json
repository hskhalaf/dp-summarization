      "text": "Great organic cleanser! I have very sensitive skin and I have hard time buying a cleanser that doesn't dry out and irritate my skin. This really works for me. It is mild enough and cleanse my skin pretty good.when I wear make up it seems like it doesn't cleanse it that well but I use coconut oil to remove my make up any way so it is OK. This is a perfect everyday mild cleanser for my sensitive skin. I use it along with their moisturizer with sunblock in the morning and my skin feels amazing all day! I'll be using this as long as they make it!!",
