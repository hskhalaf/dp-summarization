As for the the sound, it's very flat and neutral. Good mid and treble, unoffensive bass. Leaks a lot of sound even at low volume. Comfort: Very good, can sit on your ears for a while without it being too constricting. However, they are heavy, and can fall off easily with some normal head movement. In conclusion, I would recommend if you're looking for a great sounding, well built, and unique pair of headphones. However, for the money, I would look elsewhere: Go wireless, check out Bose or B&O.",

I have Sennheiser HD650s, Audio Technica m50x's, beyer dt770s, and numerous other headphones. You could say I'm a hobbyist. The build quality of these blows all of my other cans out of the water. I prefer the sound to my other closed back headphones for most listening(although the beyers and ATH are fantastic too). Highly recommended.",

High notes feel crisp and mid tones are on an average. The only 2 downside to the headphone is it's weight which will affect certain users that are not used to heavy headgear. The headphone also grips less on the high and will drop if you bend your head down too suddenly so no hardcore head banging. Overall a stylish and awesome headphone.",

When I listened to the recording, I could clearly hear people shuffling feet, typing on keyboards, coughing, from across the room. But could barely make out the song I was listening to. So yeah, suffice it to say these are quiet enough for use in public... as long as you keep them on your head! Like most big headphones, once you take them off the sound is no longer sealed and they basically become loudspeakers :P",

The highs are really where these cans shine. The soundstage is very wide which is something which took me by surprise considering these are closed back. These cans carry a lot of the sound found in open back. Overall, these are absolutely amazing and I'd buy them again with my eyes closed.",

I contacted amazon for a return and they refused to deal with it. they told me to contact the manufacturer.

After fixing the brackets on my M100, I went back and forth between the MH40 and the M100 dozens of times with different types of music and there is just no comparison. Most notably, female vocals are distant and lost in the boomy low end. Very compressed mid to upper registers. Lifeless in comparison to the M100. The difference is similar (but not quite as bad) as being in the room with a live band, vs standing in the nearby hallway. Good headphones until you hear the M100. Otherwise, unsatisfying.",

      "text": "These were outstanding headphones! I used them every day at work for about 9 months. The dry weather caused a bad static shock when I fist bumped my coworker, and it caused me to get shocked in the left ear. Since then, there is a constant static popping in that annoys the hell out of me. I'd 100% recommend these headphones if you don't live in a dry part of the country.",
