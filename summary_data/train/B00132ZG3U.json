It comes with the typical attachments. The only downsides, in my opinion are that the switches are not very comfortable to use (a minor quibble) and it is a smidge on the large side (which is really just more of a personal preference).

All use was discontinued, and was returned for a refund. I award it 2 stars for it being a potentially good unit, but subtract 3 for failing.

      "text": "Buttons are very low profile. You have to slide this thing up to turn on. It's got two sliders. In theory that should give you more control over the device. However, what really happens is you peal off the top layer of your skin each time you try to turn it on when your damp fingers slide all over it. Sometimes I find myself required to use nails to get it on in a misty room. Besides the button the dryer is solid. Stronger blower with some pretty granular control over how the air is presented.",

      "text": "This hair drier is not bad for the money. It has a very plastic feel but it is made out of plastic after all. The biggest grudge I have with this product is the buttons. They dont have a good amount of grip and cannot easily switch between the levels. I use this a lot with hair products and sometimes still have product on my hands when using, so it makes it near impossible to turn it on. Also, the prongs on the plug seems to slip out of the plug frequently. This has happened on multiple plugs.",

But this drier is overall smaller than many, which makes it easier to maneuver). However, I likely will not be using the diffuser. My hair is thin and dries quickly, which means that for styling purposes, I generally need to focus more on shaping than drying. I'll see if I can come up with a creative use for the diffuser; if not, I'll recycle it.",
