Will a 10.5 be a size 9.5 as well? Or will it be a 10, 10.5, or 11?? Who knows?!",

Super cute, comfortable and as far as bowling shoes they do the trick. I bowl about once a week or every other week so they are just right price wise for me. I will recommend going down a full size, I went down half a size and there's a little bit of room, I thought about sending them back for the next size down but I figured they would be fine. Definitely perfect for the novice bowler.",

They additionally have no arch support and the sole is the same material that cheap flip-flops (they kind they sell at the dollar store) are made from. Seriously, if you were to try these on at a store you would maybe expect to pay $10 and that's if you were desperate for bowling shoes. You would be better off renting unless you don't mind everybody thinking that you're busting a huge fart every time you take a step.",

I did a fair amount of research first and decided on these. The price was great (they pay for themselves if I use them about 12 times) and they're obviously way more adorable than communal shoes. I got compliments on them too! They work, in my opinion, better than the used and possibly fungus ridden shoes at the bowling alley. I typically wear a 7 1/2 but due to previous reviews ordered a 7 and they were soooo right. You won't be disappointed!",
