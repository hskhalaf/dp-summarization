Them as it restarts the printer tells me that I am not using Epson ink cartridges even though I am and will not allow me to use the printer. So I removed them and then tried again over and over with no success. I threw the printer into my pool and now I am back on Amazon looking for a printer. Looks like it's going to be Brother this time. Never Again Epson.",

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the \"MPG\" ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.\n\n\nFeatures/Benefits\n\n * Save time \u2014 increase your productivity with the world\u2019s fastest all-in-one1 in its class\n * Speed through critical documents \u2014 ISO print speeds of 16 ISO ppm black/5.5 ISO ppm color\u2020\n * Easily share your printer with others \u2014 built-in Ethernet with wireless networking capability; connect to your wireless router using the Ethernet port and print wirelessly3\n * Get more done \u2014 30-page Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of originals\n * PC fax \u2014 fax documents directly from your computer4\n * High-speed faxing in black and color \u2014 as fast as 3 sec per page; speed dial storage up to 60 numbers; fax memory up to 180 pages\n * Protect important documents \u2014 smudge, fade and water resistant prints; documents rival those from a laser printer; highlighter-friendly too\n * Save energy \u2014 uses up to 70% less power than a laser printer2\n * Save paper \u2014 save up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two-sided printing6\n * Print twice as much \u2014 get about 2x more prints with two Black cartridges5\n * Individual ink cartridges \u2014 replace only the color you need\n * Product protection you can count on \u2014 1-year limited warranty; phone support, without charge, for the life of the product7; plus, access to exclusive templates, tutorials and offers with product registration\n\n\nEco features\n\n * Uses up to 70% less power than a laser printer6\n * Save up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two-sided printing5\n * ENERGY STAR\u00ae qualified\n * Designed to be Recycled8\n\n\nRecommended Supplies \nEpson Ink Supplies \n69 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge (T069120) \n69 DURABrite Ultra Cyan ink cartridge (T069220) \n69 DURABrite Ultra Magenta ink cartridge (T069320) \n69 DURABrite Ultra Yellow ink cartridge (T069420) \n69 DURABrite Ultra color multi-pack (3 colors) (T069520) \n\nEpson Paper Supplies \nHeavyweight 8.5 x 11 in, Matte Paper, 50 sheets (S041257) \nPhoto Quality Inkjet Paper, 100 sheets (S041062) \nPremium Semi-Gloss Photo Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331) \nPremium Glossy Photo Paper 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727) \n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s in the Box\n\n * WorkForce 310 all-in-one\n * Instruction manual\n * CD-ROM with drivers and bonus software\n * Power cord\n * Telephone cord\n * 5 DURABrite Ultra Ink cartridges; two 69 Standard-capacity Black ink cartridges and three 69 standard-capacity color ink cartridges: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow\n\n\nWorkForce products\nEngineered for business.\n\nShow the world what your business is made of with WorkForce, Epson\u2019s exclusive line of printers and all-in-ones that are engineered for better business productivity.

Two Black cartridges allow about twice as much black printing as compared to printing with a single Black cartridge.\n 6.
