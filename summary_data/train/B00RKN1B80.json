I purchased the gray ones and planning to get other colors",

I'm not downranking the new kswiss shoes, but the older ones were just way above the rest. I find the current ones good shoes too, just not as good as they used to be.",

The high \"walls\" around the shoe make it impossible for it to fit correctly. Even if you use the stretch liquid. I wear an 11 1/2 and I would have to have a 12 for these to fit and I would be stupid to pay more for a larger size. They will be returned for my money back. Sorry K-Swiss but you deserve this one.",
