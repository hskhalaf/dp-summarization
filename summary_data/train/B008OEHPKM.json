I'm experiencing issues with squeaking keys and a spacebar that is nonresponsive if tapped anywhere but dead center. Also, and as others have reported, the batteries leaked inside the keyboard. Just know that durability may be questionable here. ----- As a fan on minimalism, I really appreciate this keyboard. It's beautifully designed, and well built. Key travel is just perfect for me. It pairs very quickly across multiple devices. I'm generally using this with my Note 8 and Samsung Dex.",

Has the right amount of non skid rubber to hold it against the Surface pro when I get up to move around, and it holds the Surface vertically so well and the adjustability for angle is fantastic. Vertical or horizontal. I almost never use the Surface's built in stand. I have bought extras so I can use this keyboard for years and years.",

This one is a bit heavy for its intended purpose of being a keyboard you can carry around and with the legendary feel of Microsoft keyboards. 2. The Bluetooth connection to my surface book wasn't very reliable either. 3. It arrived with a sulfated battery, which tells me it's been sitting in its box for many years. 4. Given its weight, it should have been at least foldable (or a bit bigger -- the keyboard is just too small to type on comfortably for me).",

I'm not going to be writing essays or doing data entry with it, but its quite adequate for emailing, web surfing, on-line activities. The keyboard cover is a nice touch, takes all the bother out of just tossing the keyboard in a backpack. The cover doubling as a tablet easel is a bonus. Battery life appears good.",

So when I hit a key, it doesn\u2019t really feel like a proper keystroke, more like a half-assed one. * The keyboard cover is a dust magnet. No clue how I am supposed to clean it.

The keys travel just the right amount to make it keel responsive, and I haven't noticed any cursor lag when typing. My only gripe is the battery housing that protrudes from the underside of the keyboard. It adds some bulk to the unit. Perhaps the next iteration of this keyboard will eliminate this protrusion outright, and have an integrated rechargeable battery. Then it will be perfect.",

It also fits snugly onto the keyboard to protect it from dust and dirt. All in all, Microsoft hit this one out of the park. Inexpensive, nicely engineered, designed for Windows tablets, convenient, extremely portable, responsive, and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.",

This is a keyboard that can truly survive in a student's backpack. I don't use the cover as a stand because I purchased the standard case for my Slate that acts as a stand. I recommend this keyboard because it connects every time -- instantly, it is extremely rugged and goes for weeks on a single charge.",
