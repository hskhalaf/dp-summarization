I think it\u2019s very inconsistent with its brewing consistency. Sometimes it fills the cup size correctly and other times it only fills it halfway so your coffe is never the way you like it. The cleaning light came on, I cleaned it. Now it just blinks all the time and won\u2019t shut off. (Like many people on this thread). Called customer service and they could have cared less. They basically told me tough, live with it. Really nice. Horrible experience all around. Get something else, don\u2019t buy this. Trust me it\u2019s a really shoddy product.",

My only complaint, so far, is the cleaning process. It can literally take hours to run through over and over again before the clean light finally goes off. The series of blinks and beeps, as its way of telling you what to do is confusing. I hope they eventually make that part of the process a little easier. Overall, I'm pleased with this machine.",

But this machine comes with sensors a lights and different buttons that do not make the coffee better, nor do they expand the options, it's just marketing; there is no difference between all the options available, except of size. I would not recommend this machine at all.",

This is not a Keurig - type machine. You can either use ground coffee or grind your own. I always use my own fresh ground coffee because buying whole bean that you scoop yourself is the only way to ensure that your coffee is actually fresh.",

      "text": "Really love this coffee machine. We looked for months for something to replace our traditional 10-cup coffee maker that we\u2019d end up wasting so much coffee with. This has changed our lives! The coffee tastes better than from my regular coffee machine, there\u2019s less mess and if I want something fancier than regular coffee, it\u2019s so simple. Would definitely recommend!",
