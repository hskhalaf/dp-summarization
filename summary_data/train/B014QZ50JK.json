I looked at the top cameras that most reviewers look at and glad i steered away from the herd in this instance. The support is excellent too as when i called up and did not leave a message, someone called right back. After a couple of back and forth emails calls, we were able to customize this to our situation.",

By being able to speak, listen, and turn on TVs in line-of-sight, Remocam puts in you your room from anywhere in the world. Highly recommended especially with the very low overhead investment.",

What good is a product you ant use ? Funny too how the brackets ship in 3-4 weeks ! this thing is table top or shelf, some security ! they prob would steal the camera.

My siblings love their units and I can take comfort in knowing that they and my nieces and nephews are safe. The entire experience from purchasing the units and receiving a thank you card to very prompt and polite customer service has my family sold on Remocam and can wait to see what the future holds for this company.",
