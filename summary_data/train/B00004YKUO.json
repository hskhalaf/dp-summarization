I bought the 1000 assorted biscuits with this and love having the different sizes. I just bought a batch of FF size biscuits to further enhance the usefulness. Definitely recommend.",

I love this biscuit joiner, it doesn\u2019t jump like some other discount joiners when you fire it up, so it doesn\u2019t wander off the mark. It also has an adjustable fence so you can change the height of where your cut will be, which is great for those more odd cuts that happen more often than you\u2019d think. If it weren\u2019t for the clogging issue this tool would get 5 stars hands down.",

I like the fact that you place the fence on top of the work piece to make your cut, as compared to joiners that use the bench surface. This helps to insure a flush fit on the top face of your work. I also wanted to note that the earlier problem of a mis-aligned fence has been solved. I have not found any mis-alignment at 0 degree or any other degrees. I think they have solved that problem way back in 2001. Sincerely, Randy",

I do own other Porter Cable power tools and I must say that, that weighed heavily on my decision to buy this one. It was a bit more then most of the others but I wanted the best and I got it, this is a lifetime tool! Oh, make sure you get the 7 amp model, not the 5. More amps equals greater power.",
