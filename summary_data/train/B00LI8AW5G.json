Not great if you want to just add it once every 1-2 weeks. Also once you open the box, there is a sticky blob on the tab to help \"reseal\". It's pretty much useless after a couple times so you have to be really careful where you put it so it doesn't spill. Don't think I'll repurchase after I finish my boxes.",
