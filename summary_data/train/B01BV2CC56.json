      "text": "These are simply awesome heel wheels. They came with two set of spark pads and one set of break pads. Wheels are not too fast and neither too slow. My kids use these in malls and they glide for about 10 feet with every push. Best part is that they will grow with you...i.e. these are not shoes which won't fit the growing kids next year :) Be sure to look at the unboxing and demonstration video on youtube. Just search for \"Razor Jett Heel Wheels - Unboxing and Demo by 1DoctorGenius!!\"",
