    "title": "Royal Purple 18000 Max Atomizer Fuel Injector Cleaner - 6 oz.",
    "description": "Item Package Quantity:1Royal Purple\u2019s Max-Atomizer is a fully-synthetic, highly concentrated, high performance fuel injector cleaner. It is specially formulated to solve problems with today\u2019s direct injection engines, but can be used with any type of fuel injection. Max-Atomizer contains highly concentrated polyether amine (PEA) detergents that quickly clean clogged and coked injectors, restoring 100% of injector flow. This optimizes injector spray patterns and better atomizes fuel as it enters the combustion chamber. The result is improved fuel economy, enhanced power and performance, reduced emissions, smoother idle, and quicker / easier starts. Max-Atomizer is the only fuel injector cleaner that also stabilizes ethanol, which chemically breaks down to cause harmful effects to an engine.",
