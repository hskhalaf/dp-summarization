Btw, the case is kinda cheap but I have no plans on using its wheels, which look like they'll fall to pieces after only a few feet of rolling. I just carry the whole thing and for that, it's good.",

This jackhammer made short work of breaking up 4\" concrete and even worked well for cutting through roots (purchased a wider blade, 3\" scraping chisel for root cutting). I also used the 3\" scraping chisel to cut through compacted clay and roots; so I could plant azaleas. So far absolutely no complaints. The tool is heavy enough to cut through stubborn materials but no so heavy as to be difficult to maneuver. It appears to be well made and, for my occasional use, will probably last me a lifetime.",

Does in a few minutes what my Bosch Bulldog takes hours (the Bulldog is great for tile, but cement slabs are another story). The weight is what's important here, the various wattages are just a distraction. Comes with everything except oil (understandable - as they don't want that leaking during shipping; I used bar-and-chain oil, which seems to work just fine). You can see why it doesn't take SDS bits - they're puny compared to the bits this things takes (which are included anyway). Vibration seemed fine. Certainly no worse than the air-powered jack hammers I've used. And easier to handle than the 90 pounders I've used.",

We dig out basements and use the jackhammer for 5-6 hours (off and on) per digging session. I had to reinstall various screws with Lock Nut but otherwise the machine ran great. We did almost no maintenance for two years and it ran like a champ. It finally broke for good when the locking mechanism that holds the bits in place wore out and would no longer secure the bits. These jackhammers are so inexpensive that it's not worth it to try and repair. The Neiko appears to be the same model or design as my original jackhammer.",

Naturally cannot withstand either the mishandling of transportation or the use for which is meant to. So I returned it and asked for a replacement. I received the replacement (same item) and yes the handle this time was cracked!!!! So, I returned it back and this time asked for my money back. Very frustrating experience.",

      "text": "This unit arrived in days, and coming from the other coast, I consider that that to be excellent service. The unit is heavy duty.... and quite powerful. Update: Over the past 2 years this tool has been used to - bust up a concrete porch, 45 feet of sidewalk, and set of concrete steps. Still functioning perfectly. I am quite impressed with this demo hammer. The unit is large and quite heavy, which means all that needs done is to set it where you want it and hang on..... no pressure needed. For the do-it-yourselfer...... this is a great addition to the tool collection. You will not be disappointed.",

If it was a few hundred dollars more, I'd complain about the weight and the fact that it leaks oil if I leave it upside down, but for the price, you take what you get because it kicks the crap out of a hammer and chisel.

I also read the previous reviews written by customers that had anticipated the design and quality shortcomings and provided remedial instructions to turn a cheap piece of crap into a reliable workhorse. Reviewing and following the wise instructions of the previous users was extremely useful and the reworked jackhammer has worked like a champ for 4 years.",

The tools supplied had bounced around and scratched the hammer. The bits and the oil needs to be shipped separately.",
