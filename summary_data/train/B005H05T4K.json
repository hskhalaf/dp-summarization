      "text": "Bought a beautiful set of Cuisinart 64-13 Contour Hard Anodized 13-Piece Cookware Set; however, unknown to my family and me is the fact that the handles on the lid tops and on the pots (NOT the pans) become scalding and dangerously hot!! How can this be? Is this a design flaw? I'm sorry, but I could not recommend this product due to handles becoming so hot. We have a gas range so maybe that's part of the problem, too. Nonetheless, I would certainly expect a product like this made by a reputable company such as Cuisinart to have tested and thought through a solution to the hot handles.",

It turns out the specs are the non-stick surface of the skillet. Had I not noticed the black spots I would have literally eaten the lining of the skillet. I can't imagine how many times I have done this before. In addition, the rims chip, and the skillets fade. I have followed all instructions on cleaning and using proper cookware. This is a very dangerous product. I am reporting the product.",

These look great enough you can leave them on your stove top if you wish. They work so great so far. Am pleased with the no stick. They are somewhat heavy as well, so if you have compromised hand/wrist strength or arthritis remember you'll need 2 pot holders and use 2 hands. I'll update after I've had them longer on cleaning and how they stand up to wear and tear.",

      "text": "I love these pans. I like them better than similar ones from another brand that I had previously bought at the store. They are sturdy, non stick, easy to clean, and have held up to months of regular use. I use wood or plastic utensils on them (not metal). They are also a great set as far as sizes. You aren\u2019t stuck with some giant pot that almost never gets used. Love them. Great pans, great price, easy and fast shipping.",

      "text": "This is some extremely heavy duty cookware. I bought this set to replace my cheap Walmart set that is worn out. I could immediately tell that these pots and pans are high quality because they are about 5 times heavier than my old set. Handles are sturdy and well-attached. The inside of these are nonstick and food rinses off easily. They also heat really well on an electric stove. Overall, I'm really impressed with this set and I would recommend buying it.",

I looked for this set in stores so that I could make sure that I liked them and to also make sure they were sturdy enough. Went to bed bath and beyond and loved them. checked amazon and realized they had a better deal. I use these pots and pans daily and love how easy it is to clean them. You wont be disappointed!",

I don\u2019t like giving negative reviews, but, when you only buy pans every 6/7 years, these will definitely not last. Shame....feel like I wasted my money. Never buy. Cuisinart again.
