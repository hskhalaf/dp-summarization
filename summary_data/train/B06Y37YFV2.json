The scent is flowery and warm. Supposedly it is meant to be a Spring scent but I intend to wear it year-round. My favorite thing about it is that it lasts all day. It\u2019s pretty remarkable. And just one spray is enough. A lot of perfumes smell great when first applied but minutes later, it\u2019s like you never put it on. This scent truly lasts. So pleased with it!",

This is their Seasonal scent, I have a rollerball from Clinique, and this seller sent my bottle in perfect condition and scent is strong and perfect. Highly recommended!!!",

Happy in Bloom is like the original, but better. Not too sweet, but it's floral and fresh with the same undertones as the original. Happy in Bloom is my absolute all time favourite perfume. I bought it first in 1995 when it was limited edition, and I'm so glad that they made it again and I found it again.",
