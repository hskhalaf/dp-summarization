It's not congesting around the under eye area, I use it from corner to corner and over my eyelids, and I honestly notice fewer fine lines AND fewer expression lines. Love this stuff.",

I like how it doesn\u2019t have a strong fragrance. If glides easily. Doesn\u2019t get into my eyes. And best of all, it hydrates without causing problems.",

My eyes have wrinkles and what bothers me most is that my under eye area is darker than the rest of my face. This eye cream actually seems to lighten the area under my eyes which makes me feel a lot better about how I look. When I put make-up on I don't have to work as hard to cover that area. And, this product seems to keep the darkness away all day. This product is expensive, but if it keeps on working I will continue to buy it.",

The aroma is nice - it actually reminds me a lot of the Aveda skin care products. It's very botanical-smelling. The moisture though.... It's so good. I put it on at night and I can still feel it the next morning. It makes all of the eye area feel so moisturized. This is the first product I've ever used by belif, and I am impressed.
