A different sound than what I was expecting but its much better than our old cymbal. For the price I don't think anything beats it. Great for our Pearl Roadshow kit and sure to last us years down the road. I bought the square trade protection plan as well just in case, haven't had any issues.",

I bought other things but it's roughly $1000 to complete this kit. now I want to go out and get the 18\"",

Being a rock drummer this is a deal breaker as they're a big part of the performance. Next time I would consider trying to find used cymbals or purchase one at a time of a little higher quality.",

But not 5 stars because I was just hoping they'd sound a little better. All in all, would recommend to anyone trying to budget their drum set, just want to play, and aren't audiophiles when it comes to their set. I play punk, metal and post-rock so these are perfect for me. However if you are a jazz musician or recording hi-fidelity sound, you may want to drop another $100-$200 on a nicer set.",
