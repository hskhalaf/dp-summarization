      "text": "I bought both this Orlzly Night Stand and the Spigen one, since I could not decide online. I used this stand for 4 nights. I ended up selecting the Spigen as the keeper for these reasons: the Orzly takes up more space on my night stand, the Orzly required permanent adhesive (included) to stick in place and the Orzly puts a sharp bend in the Watch magnetic charging cable just below the disc. My pictures show the side by side size difference. Product is OK, and not a terrible option, but after side by side use it was not my personal preference.",

I have a Spigen stand that I use at my home-office, and I think that the Spigen dock is actually better than this one - it's much less bulkier and will not crowd your desk as this one does. Also, setting up the cable is a little annoying. Getting the USB to fit through the provided opening without breaking or bending it is a challenge. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars - it does its job, but it's a little bigger than it should. Pic attached shows the size difference between them (Orzly is left, Spigen is right).",

No matter how I position the stand/watch/cable, it never is close enough to charge my watch. Occasionally, I've seen that it's makes a connection and starts charging; however, checking on it a few minutes later, I find that it is not charging, and just there as a watch stand. After a month of trying, I gave up and threw it in the garbage. If you have large sized watch, don't waste your time or money.",

Also, couldn\u2019t use my awesome belkin charger as I was hoping to, because it only fits the oringal iwatch charger that comes with it. So if you have a slightly bigger one like my belkin, then your S.O.L. Which stinks cause my belkin charger was fifty dollars and is of way better material than the original charger the iwatch comes with. Got no use for this stand now unfortunately. Maybe I can use it as a door stopper since it\u2019s got some nice weight to it.",

The stand is made with hard, yet slightly flexible material with ample space to insert your Apple Watch charger. It is pretty straightforward and easy to set up. On the bottom of the stand is 3M adhesive. I have yet to use the adhesive but has been pretty stationary when my Apple watch is resting on it. For anyone on a budget and wants to use their Apple Watch in nightstand mode as an alarm, this is a great option. For the price, it seems to be a steal.",

It also has enough weight in it that it doesn't fall over. I did miss the fine print on the first one thinking it included a charger - should have realized it didn't being this cheap ;).",

      "text": "I'm disappointed by the purchase. The most important part is that charger is not included and that makes this stand just a dumb piece of plastic. Picture/description is not wrong, it is just misleading. Return of the item is not free ($5.99), so it does not make sense to return it either. Bottom of the stand has s sticky, so it either has to be glued on the surface or would slide off.",

The charge cable sits nicely in this stand and it's postponed perfectly so you can put your watch down to charge with no effort. If you're looking for a quality charge stand that supports nightstand mode at a good price, this one is a winner. I use this with a 42mm Apple Watch Sport.",
