The only problem for me with these are that I have already gone through one pair of these and it was quite a short life aswell, one day one of the \"sound engines\" just stopped working. This time around a similar thing happened except that the port in the engine has become faulty. The only reason I can think of for this to happen is when I accidentally yank the wire or get it caught on something. So my advice is that if you are someone that regularly gets the cable caught on something then these will have a very short life span.",

I had my previous pair since I was a sophmore in high school, and Im a junior in college now. these headphones sound great, a perfect mix of Treble, Bass, and mid. I use them for gaming, studio work, and just casually. They are really comfortable, and are good for extensive use. The headphones are phenominal and the price is affordable. Definetly worth my money.",

Sadly, it looks like I'm not even close to the only person with this complaint. I recommended these headphones to two people (and these friends both then bought them) before I learned that the quality was shit so I feel bad about that. Customer support never responded. Interestingly enough, when my girlfriend told Sol customer support, they sent her new ones.",

      "text": "Upgrading from the V10 engines to EX, it had to take some time to notice extreme differences. Unlike the Sol Republic V10s, the bass does not overshadow the treble, the high and lows are simply crisp. These are the headphones that surprise you when listening to your favorite song because you'll hear instruments that you never heard before. Cons: after 30-45mins the outer part of one's ear will begin to hurt. These headphones are big so it's not as fashionable and easy to just wear around the streets. Overall Sol Republic made an amazing piece of headphones",

Nice, spacious sound quality. So why 2 stars? Well, after those 6 months of light use, one of the speakers died, so now they're useless and I'm out $100.",
