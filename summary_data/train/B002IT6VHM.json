If you're super picky, perhaps this won't be your crystal dining-with-royal-diplomats set, but this is certainly an elegant set for your go-to every day wine glass, your casual dinners, the wine glasses that you take in and out a lot. They held up pretty well in the dishwasher, and they came very well packaged (as per photo). They look beautiful. They measure exactly 8.5 inches in length (as per photo), and the opening is 2.5 inches.",

You could pay more and get more but this is a very nice glass at this price point and you won't cry if you break one",

The only thing that bothered me at first (but now I like) is that the edge does have a bit of a lip but it is small. when it said laser cut I thought it was lip-less I was wrong. But without any lip, the glasses tend to drip down the outside wich is sloppy looking. these do not leave drip marks on the outside of the glass. so overall 5 stars!!",

      "Pleasant Drinking - Enjoy the complete wine experience with this Italian Red wine glasses. It is rafted in Italy with the original wine glasses design. Drink like royalty, relishing each moment with this sophisticated wine glass",
      "Wide Bowl - Derive the most pleasure possible out of your red wine. Wine glass is designed with a wide bowl unlike the white wine glasses enabling you to easily swirl your wine, maximizing the flavor and aromas. Swirling the wine allows the aroma and flavor to emerge to the fullest. It is great for all red wines like cabernet sauvignon, merlot, pinot noir, Bordeaux, etc",
      "Perfectly Designed - Laser cut rim is significantly thinner than the standard. When the wine reaches your lips, you will taste it fully without the feel of glass in your mouth. An elegant stem adds to the visual appeal of the glass, prevents your hands from warming the wine, and allows you to swivel it freely. The sturdy base ensures your drink remains steady on the tabletop",
      "For Any Occasion - This Dinner glasses is amazing for parties, dinners, wine tasting, and special events for outdoors and indoors. Makes an appreciated present for men, holiday, wedding shower, or housewarming",
      "Durability and Functionality - Crafted of clear, shatter resistant glass, this will be something you\u2019ll enjoy for many years. Comes in a set four, 18 oz each. It is dishwasher safe and easily cleaned by hand with soap and warm water"
