Instead of putting the transformer in the unit head, they put it into the plug, and that doesn't plug water-tight into my gang box. So, I've got to build a little cover over the unit and run an extension to the outside wall for the GFCI outlet. I've enjoyed using my phone to program and spot water between schedules.",

So you can only start one routine time, where all your zones scheduled cycle through. In other words, if you want your backyard to start in the morning and then your front yard to start at night, that is not possible with the current app. I\u2019m hoping for an update.",

I wanted an upgrade over the inscrutable 20 year old controller in the corner of the garage and so far the Blossom has been simple to setup, looks awesome and easy to control from the attractive Android app and Alexa - couldn't be happier with the way it's working. I'm sure some of the others can provide detail that would make the weather channel jealous but for a major upgrade from a old controller this is a fantastic device.",

    "title": "Blossom 0080-AWICD 7 Zone Wi-Fi Smart Water Controller",
    "description": "Simplify your life with the power of Smart Watering. No more aimless tinkering with your old irrigation controller. The Blossom Smart Watering Controller automatically programs itself based on real-time local weather data collected from the Internet to create an optimized watering schedule for your yard. This means that on the sunniest, hottest days, Blossom will apply extra water to replenish dry soil. On cooler, less sunny days, Blossom adjusts to irrigate less. If measurable rain is in the weather forecast, Blossom skips watering for that day. The result is an automatically adjusted irrigation plan tailored for your lawn and garden that can be monitored from anywhere at any time from your smartphone or tablet over this Wi-Fi enabled system. Compatible only with locations in the continental United States. Blossom 7 has a known compatibility issue with some newer Comcast / Xfinity XB6 Xfi enabled routers. The specific model numbers included are: -Arris TG3482G (XB6) -Technicolor CGM4140COM (XB6). If you have any of the above routers, please contact us at 1-855-976-5315 or mygro-support@scotts for additional details.",
