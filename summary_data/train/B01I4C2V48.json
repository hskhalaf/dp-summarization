But the biggest issue I have is that it tends to fall over or lose its shape. The legs don't stay in one place, they get moved around as my daughter plays, and eventually the entire thing topples over. On the positive side, the canvas does seem to be a strong material and there is a cute little window you can open. All in all I would probably not recommend this product and am currently searching for a playhouse that stays put.",

We've taken it completely apart, retired and adjusted poles and no matter what we do after a few days it looks like the photo included. Don't waste your money. The poles don't sit correctly inside the canvas footings at the bottom so it won't hold.",

Also, there isn\u2019t much to the instructions, basically pictures, and you\u2019re left to figure it out yourself. However, this tent is very cute, and much larger than I had anticiapated. My son especially loves the window in it. He\u2019s played in it all night, so it\u2019s met it\u2019s desired purposes.",

It's made of high quality canvas material, has all the right straps & velcro to close & open tent flaps & window cover, and was a breeze to put together. What's more, it stands up using tension, and not poles along the base, so moving it around the house is so easy -- just collapse, carry & pop it back open in the next room. My 6 year old can do it on her own. It's very spacious. And the blue color is a perfect, rich sky blue.",

The rest of it seems to be ok, but we got rid of it because it wouldn't stay connected to the top of the poles.",

It's not so bad that it's going to fall in on the kids but enough that it's noticeable. Would order again even with the shifting poles. The ties were a bit confusing on top and there werent any instructions, so we just did our own thing and tied it all the best we could. Hope this helps!",

Also the poles had slots in the part that attached to the connector that were pointless. Had to stretch the string so much I'm afraid the canvas will probably rip. Would not buy again, tent does no match the picture and the instructions were so way too simple and the pictures in them were clearly for a different tent.",

Such great quality for an amazing price. Assembly was pretty easy once I figured out how to tie the ropes on the the top of the poles. I would definitely recommend.",
