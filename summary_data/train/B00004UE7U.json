It doesn't take up much room, is very easy to clean and the price was reasonable considering how much use I've gotten out of it. You'll like it!",

I use a bit of food grade mineral oil every few months to keep it nice, but no notice of any sort of chemical smell that others mentioned -- just natural wood. I recommend this over the more expensive and complicated models.",

I just cut my pasta place it on the rack as I go, and then set it on top of the refrigerator until I am ready to use or toss it in a container in a couple days if I don't use it.",

To me, the simple wood is beautiful so even if your pasta sucks the stand looks like a sculpture on your counter while you cook. The one potential glitch I can see is if the wood swells in certain weather but so far that's not been an issue.",

If you don't have great wooden chairs to hang your noodles on the back of the way your amazing Italian grandma had... then go with the next basic thing.. the Norpro Pasta Drying Rack.",

The rack stands 16-1/2 inches high, including a heavy, stable, 7/8-inch-thick base. Assembly (and disassembly for storage) is simple. The 3/4-inch center post screws into the base. Four 18-inch dowels then slide through holes in the post, providing eight arms--cunningly angled so they don't interfere with one another--on which to hang fresh pasta to dry before going into the pot, refrigerator, or freezer. As is traditional, the rack is made of unfinished wood so pasta strands don't slide off. --Fred Brack",
