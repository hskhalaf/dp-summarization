If I must find a negative, the inside is bare metal and it would've been a perfection if the inside was lined. But honestly, I think I am asking too much for the price point. Also, when I open the lid the smell from the inside was a bit unpleasant. Smell of metal.... I am going to air it and throw in some dry rosemary and it should be fine. I am so happy with this product. LOVE",

When I moved my 78 year old uncle in with us to take care of him I found that he still had my aunt in the bag and box that came from having here cremated some time ago. Because he is legally blind and worried about an urn that would break if dropped I focused on a solid construction. This urn is incredibly robust and the build quality was evident upon opening. I would recommend this urn to anyone looking for a quality urn that looks amazing.",

The urn is beautiful, at first I was thinking there would be more definitive markings for the white swirls, but the more I looked at it the more I liked it the way it is. This way it will last much longer. The metal is heavy and very durable. Quality product. The top screws on for a tight fit and the opening was large enough for us to insert the plastic bag top to pour in the ashes. All things to consider when making the transfer.",

Does anyone comment on how lovely a casket was??? It was just perfect for sending mom to heaven.",
