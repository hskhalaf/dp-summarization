      "text": "I really can't recommend this as functionality is severely hobbled by the lack of ability to update the operating system. The latest browser won't install, so this hobbles web surfing functionality. Netflix won't install at all, so that capability isn't existent. I got this to watch movies while on the treadmill and exercise bike, and I've found workarounds for that, but again, that may only be a matter of time. The tablet has extremely limited functionality. Update a month later: this is stuck in a boot loop and is useless. I re-install the OS and it's fine for a few minutes and starts boot looping again.",

To my surprise the process of getting an RMA from Asus customer service went smoothly. Hopefully the tablet will be returned to me functioning as well as it did before the touchscreen failed. If not for the touchscreen failing I would have given this tablet four stars.",

Company would not let me return it because the screen was cracked and they want it to be in perfect condition. However, when I asked them about their knowledge of the tablet overheating prior to selling it to me, they had no comment.",
