The web and app interfaces work great to monitor our sytem settings and remotely control our home HVAC system, even when away from the house. Forgot to shut off the A/C now that the outside temperature has dropped, or want to check if the kids have been messing with the thermostat settings - no problem! The ecobee for the first floor was already installed when we moved in, and I decided to stay with ecobee because I liked the interface and thought I would keep the controls consistent.",

The app is user friendly and was a requirement when I made the purchase.

The installation required some over-the-phone help from a professional, so I'd recommend arranging this in advance or hiring someone to do the installation. Settings are intuitive, adjustments couldn't be much simpler and the vacation setting is great. I highly recommend this thermostat.",

I had to pack it up and send it back to Amazon at my cost. Looks like a great item, but poor quality product. Avoid.",

However their app will not work on my iPhone after upgrading to IOS 6 . Company says they are working on a fix. Do not buy if the ability to control this thermostat with an apple product is important to you or until they fix the problem",
