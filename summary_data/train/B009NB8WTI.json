Reading other reviews here, my guess is that there is a peculiar 'infant mortality' problem with this product that shows up in only a small percentage of new units. I was just unlucky.

Blackmagicdesigns Disk Speed Test writes above 466MB/s and reads around 516MB/s even with the unit almost full. I know this doesn't affect SSDs as it does HDDs, but it is still important, since both are in real life stuffed with files. So this makes the difference still bigger. Haven't compared to other SSDs, but bought this one after some online research. Good luck!",
