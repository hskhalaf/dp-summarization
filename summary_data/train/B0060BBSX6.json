Stretch it over your table, then throw it in the drier for 10mins or so until its warm. Then stretch it back out on your table. All of the lines people were complaining about went away and it fits a lot better now.",

It looks very nice and covers the corner pockets perfectly. It was not tight on the fitting at all (I have an eight foot Olhausen). The color is perfect and true to the pictures. I chose the burgundy color. The wrinkles will need time to flatten out. What I didn't like is how it took so longer to get to me (1 1/2 weeks), considering I live within an hour and a half drive from the Amazon facility.",

Nice and heavy duty and it actually looks very good in person. Better then how it looks in pictures. It fits my older 8ft valley table perfect! We bought a \"like new\" one for like $10 less and of course there was nothing wrong with it. Some people complain about the fold creases not coming out. While this is true I don't find it to be an issue. If you are looking for a great quality pool table cover buy this one!",

No. Does it keep the table safe from respectful kids that sometimes has an oops moment? Yes and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s an excellent cover that\u2019s decent weight with web backing that is also waterproof.",

      "text": "It fits my 8 foot Olhausen pool table perfectly, it is made well and the material is heavy duty. Seems like it will last a long time. I have had this cover for about 5 months now, and the creases in the material from being folded up don't smooth out on their own, but they don't bother me at all. I think that if they bother you, you could try to steam them out or take a medium hot iron and iron the cover's underside and put a towel or some kind of fabric in between the cover and the iron to protect the vinyl from melting. I definitely recommend this cover.",
