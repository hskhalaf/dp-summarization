Imagine my surprise (and horror) when I took a full cookie sheet out of the oven and nearly dropped it from the pan burning my fingers through these mitts. I think the heat rating is really far off the actual resistance level. Sending back.",

At first these seemed huge, but really they are just longer than the old gloves. Also, the silicon on these gloves is super soft and pliable, making it easy to grab a pan handle. The old gloves were stiff in comparison.",

The silicone design is thicker, but grips well and is not slippery at all. I could hold a hot dish for as long as I need to without panic setting in. Great gloves. Glad I bought them.",

I love that they're long 'gauntlet' style because I had a bad habit of burning my arm on the oven door. That's no longer a problem! These would make a great gift. The recipient may think \"Gee, oven gloves\" but once they use them they'll appreciate them.",
