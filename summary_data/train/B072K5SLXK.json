You will want to take extra precaution when using the magnets so two don't hit each other. They will break somewhat easily. Unless you've read this review and know to be really careful with them. They aren't toys and will pinch you if you are careless. If you need a good magnet and handle these with care, you'll be quite pleased.",

May wrap it a couple more times as my revolver is a bit lighter than my pistol and is kind of hard to draw as the magnets are just wickedly strong! 10/10, would recommend. (Also I wrap them mainly so they don\u2019t A) scratch my stuff and B) break. These magnets are prone to breaking if they clank too hard, and they are crazy strong",

It is already difficult to separate these with the dividers, but without them there is NO way to separate these without strong tools. I used pliers and vice grips to try to prior 1 pair apart, and ended up shattering 1 magnet, as they are brittle.",
