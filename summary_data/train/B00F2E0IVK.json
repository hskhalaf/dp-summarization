Assembly went okay until it was nearly completed, then I ran into troubles. One of the pieces was completely stripped and wouldn\u2019t assemble properly. I attempted to remedy it to no avail. Unfortunately this prevented me from being able to assemble further. The shelf piece was also split, which I maybe could have just glued if it wasn\u2019t for the other defective part. I would consider a different purchase - this one isn\u2019t great for the money.",

The unit is space-efficient, super sturdy and handsome to boot. I almost ordered a second one I liked it so much, but I purged some items and got everything to fit in the one. Two thumbs up!",

I was impressed with the very fast shipping (several days before it was promised) and with the incredibly sturdy packaging. For a small pantry, this provides a good amount of shelf space. Simple to put together. If I could give a half-star deduction, I would only because of a few misalignments between holes in the two thin cabinet rear sections and the pilot holes pre-drilled into the cabinet sides. But these weren't really an issue and the rear sections screwed to the cabinet sides just as easily as if the pilot holes had been aligned. Everything else aligned perfectly. Great piece, especially for the price.",

Make sure you put the L shape in the shelves in front so doors will close. The cabinet has a very nice finish and I am pleased with it. Just be prepared for the assembly.",
