This was also EXTREMELY simple to get set up and to fold up and down every day, particularly because the legs automatically come down when you start to unfold it. I slept on this twice myself and it is very comfortable - not bars or ridges in your back at all. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "Good quality; very easy to assemble. Although this looks like a twin mattress at 39\" wide, this is a cot at 30\" wide by 6' long. Removable, washable cover is very nice. I wish it was higher from the floor, but that would make its portability more difficult. This was a better alternative for me than buying a twin mattress set, headboard etc because I hate accumulating many items for sporadic events in my life.",
