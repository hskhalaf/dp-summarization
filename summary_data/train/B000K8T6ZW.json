I will update as to the findings. I also purchased the kiwi flavored as well so we shall see if the is a flavor pref as well.",

I see that my parrot grinds down on it daily which is good to take up some time and gives your parrot some calcium. I bought two more immediately to have in reserve! Great perch for the money!",

So far, he hasn't touched his beak conditioner or the cuttlebone, so I think this gives him the opportunity to trim his beak while enjoying himself -- not to mention the nutritional benefits.
