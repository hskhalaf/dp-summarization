So I sent her to school with them on for her field trip. She got home later that day and I asked her how it went and she never got sick and felt find. Best thing yet!! <3",

I wanted to find an alternative to giving her Dramamine every time we got the car so I ordered these and couldn't be happier. They are so cute, they are comfortable when she wears them and we have not had an accident in the car since we got them. My son even wanted a pair so now every time we get in the car and go on the highway they pull out the handy little plastic case and each put on their wristbands! Tell everyone about these!",
