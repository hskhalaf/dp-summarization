That's totally subjective; have you really heard the wonderful guitar solo at the end of Wuthering Heights? Sparks's Number One Song in Heaven is a huge laugh. A few songs reveal no more detail over good headphones - Debaser, Springsteen's The River until the title track. That said, theese IEMs generally let you appreciate the effort of the artist and mixer involved, be it bass, drums, vocals or synthesiser. Do I have regrets about buying these? Yes. I wish I'd bought them sooner. They are ridiculously good.",

Ideally I wanted isolation without the loss of sound quality. I have Bose 25, 35s which isolate fine but the audio quality is not there. These solve this issue if you can deal with IEM's. The sponge tips work great.",
