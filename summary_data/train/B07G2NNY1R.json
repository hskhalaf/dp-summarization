It makes no sense to me, when you run barefoot your toes splay out to give you stability, why wouldn\u2019t you want your running shoes to allow this? This shoe gives your toes the room they need without making the shoe wide. It is the perfect running shoe. I\u2019ve been running (well, jogging if we\u2019re talking speed hah) for years and continually buy these or the 840\u2019s. It runs true to size and while other companies would suggest buying a half size larger for running, because the toe box allows a little more space, I would order your actual size",
