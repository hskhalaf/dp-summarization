      "text": "I can't say enough good things about this putter. The deep milling creates a super soft feel, but not pillowy like some of the polymer insert putters. Even with the soft feel there is still good feedback. The weight is fantastic, and although the grip feels awkward at first, it grows on you very quickly as it helps you square the putter. I have never been a great putter, and I have always preferred slower greens. Something about this putter just clicked with me, and I am putting better than I ever have been. I've tried pretty much every brand, and recently bagged a Scotty and a Ping; I would take this hands down over any other putter.",

Looks 3x the price. The grip sucks. Too thin and slippery. Maybe I need to upgrade the grip but not sure I want to sink in more money for something that is not working for me.",
