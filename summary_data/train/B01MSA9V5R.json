The screen material is heavier weight. That produces more shade against the sun. The hardware and stitching are heavy duty. We see little chance the material will stretch like other shades we have used. Excellent instructions along with cautions on how not to attach, etc. Heavy duty hardware included, if needed. We purchased both triangle and rectangle shades, and overlaid them to fit our specific dimensions. So glad we found this product!",

The unintended use case was: after replacing a 60-year-old fence between our house and our neighbor's house, we lost a privacy barrier for facing windows that had been provided by the vegetation that had grown around the old fence. So, the sun shade is a perfect privacy screen. The distance between the supporting center 2x4's on the fence and the supporting facia board is a bit short, so there's some vertical slack. But this does not seem to be a problem.",

I purchased and extra set of mounting hardware so that at one end of the triangle there a mounting points at various heights. This allows me to adjust the shade as the angle of the sun changes throughout the day. For the additional expense ($17.99), I highly recommend this add on as it dramatically increases the shades functionality.",

We will actually be ordering a 2nd one soon so we can overlap! Will share pics when we go camping with the sail set up!",
