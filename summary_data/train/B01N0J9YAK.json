I literally had never heard of this before, and didn't know what to expect, but after reading a bit about them on the internet I thought a holistic approach to addressing my problems would be nice. Got the pot and some salt yesterday. The directions are very clear and easy to follow. The 1st time I tried it, it was a success. Have no way of comparing this pot with others, but can say that this pot worked very well for me and was easy to use. Happy I bought it.",

The huge advantage I find with this product is the included silicone tips that create a water tight seal insuring the water goes in one nostril and out the other. I have tried other products but kept seeing water falling from the same nostril I\u2019m pouring into. That defeats the whole purpose. I didn\u2019t have to write this review but if you are someone like me who deals with sinus issues, you will want a product that works extremely for an excellent price. But this now before it sells out !",

I bought Nasaline salt to mix in the wather. It all worked like a charm. Use one cup of distilled water heated 22 seconds in the microwave, add the Nasaline with the tiny scoop that comes with it. Use 1/2 cup of water for one nostril and the remaining water in the other. Great lavage.",
