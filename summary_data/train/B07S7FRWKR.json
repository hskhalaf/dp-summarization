It is gentle enough to be used often. But it soaks in quickly and thoroughly and made a big difference in just a matter of days just by applying twice daily.

I've always liked Cetaphil products and this ultra-healing version works really well to keep my skin hydrated. I had some rough patches along my ankles that completely cleared up after two days of using the product - so, that's really good. There's no scent which is a big plus. Texture is creamy and the pump on the bottle works well. It's a solid product.",

I won\u2019t use this anyplace on me but my hands as I do not like the feel of heavy creams on my body in the summer, it seems to make me miserably hot...lol All in all its a nice enough product but I had a real problem with the price point on this, it\u2019s not a giant bottle its just 16 oz and right at 19.00, to me that's pretty pricey.",

It doesn't really have a scent, and it is pretty easy to apply, even though it's thick. It helps to keep water from washing it off too, since it's so thick. It's like it has a barrier in it, and it's very nice.",
