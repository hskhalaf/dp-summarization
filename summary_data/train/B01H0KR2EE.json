All that said, the price is right and the picture looks good.",

Only negative is that it did not have an optical digital audio out port - not really a deal breaker but would have made my install easier since my audio system and my old DVD player used optical digital audio connections. The WiFi and streaming apps work perfectly. I'd recommend this unit.",
