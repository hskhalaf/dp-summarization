These are easily big enough to use as a U-joint press and for holding extra large items. Plenty of room to put on soft jaws, very nice anvil with plenty of power. Nice action, even better after lubing the screw. I'd like to see a nice brass sleeve bushing on the screw end, but the machining is nice.",
