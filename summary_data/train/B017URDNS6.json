Sturdy, enough power to run everything you like, I've got Arch Linux installed on it and it works a charm (albeit with some synclient customisation but that's a requirement everywhere). It's not for gaming even though it will play Dota 2, just, at an abominable framerate and it can struggle with some tankier programs like Atom editor but for a sysadmin it's perfect. Quite light and the keys are nice.",

The computer took a long time to startup and was slow on the internet. It also froze a number of times while just trying to recover emails. After 10 hours I put it back in the box and sent it back. Very disappointing experience. I only purchased as my old pc of 10 Years was on its way out. To be honest it works better than this one did. I won\u2019t be purchasing another Dell",

Looking at on-line reviews this seems to be a common problem for DELL !!! Not only that, but the packaging used from this company was a disgrace. Bashed and torn box, inferior taping. Used a box which didn't fit and tried to tape it, but it didn't work. Total disgrace",
