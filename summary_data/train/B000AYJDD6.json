The only thing I didn't like is that it takes a SD 2GB card only, Anything higher or non-SD doesn't work, but I just bought some off of Amazon, but I literally thought the camera was broken before I figured out that it only takes a certain memory card.",

There are options for anything from total control to no control, just like all the Powershot cameras I've seen. I really love the size and the swivel display. It's much easier than my DSLR setup and better shots than my iPhone (because of the photo options, f-stops, etc). I'd accidentally given mine away a couple months ago. Went online to see the price was now $699! Then found a used one through Amazon in perfect shape for $100! In my pocket it goes!",

This Canon is fast to start up, almost no noticable shutter lag, and takes perfectly exposed pictures. The auto focus is fast - even in low light. Macro and \"My Colors\" are great features. Also,I can customize exposures, focus points, etc., about any way I choose. Excellent value for the money. I'd definately recommend this camera. Did I mention - Great Pictures?!",

MY last camera was a 3.1 mexapixel Nikon so this is definately an improvement. This camera has a lot of nice features which I am still learning how to use. We debated about getting the Canon powershot A630 but a friend of mine has that camera and I actually think this camera takes better \"out of the box\" pictures. (Of course, the A630 did have a bigger screen which would have been a nice feature.) We've taken a lot of shots of my daughter who just turned 1 and again I cannot be happier with the results of this camera.",

I personally love the custom timer function that allows you to set a delay up to 30\" and take up to 10 pictures! You never have to go back and forth...

The battery life is great, I've taken nearly 500 photos on one set of batteries. There are a ton of settings so you will need to read the instructions. It also has a totally automatic setting which makes it very user friendly. I highly recommend this camera.",

I will also say it has a weight and substance to it that makes it seem \"real\" rather than plastic as some cameras feel. I know some people like a light camera, and this isn't it.

Along, with his advice and my research into this kind of product, I came to buy from Amazon.com, the Canon Powershot A620. A lot of bells and whistles, but I'm enjoying the discovery of how things work. I particularly wanted a good camera for close-up shots of things I sell on Ebay. Before this; my instamatic never took very clear shots, or I had to wait and use up all of my 12 (minimum) shots from my 35mm camera. I hope I'll have many years with this camera.",

    "title": "Canon Powershot A620 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWith 7.1 megapixels, the A620 incorporates a host of high-end features normally reserved for G-series PowerShots. The DIGIC II processor drives a fast, responsive performance, and--in combination with the camera's 4x optical zoom lenses--delivers superior image quality. A wide range of manual, automatic, and special scene modes offer flexibility, creative control, and simplicity when required.\n\n The camera also features a 2.0-inch vari-angle LCD, My Colors, and a macro mode that allows photographers to get as close as 1 centimeter. VGA movies at 30 frames per second can be created. A complete range of optional accessories, including wide and tele-converters and waterproof case, extends shooting flexibility. (Accessories not included--must be purchased separately.) A comprehensive software suite is provided as standard. The A620 is equipped with a Print/Share button, PictBridge printing, as well as ID Photo Print and Movie Print. USB 2.0 Hi-Speed connections provide for high-speed transfer of image data.\n\n Improved resolution, zoom, and image quality\nReplacing the popular PowerShot A95, the new camera has been given a serious performance boost. The A620 features a 7.1-megapixel CCD sensor, delivering image quality suitable for detailed photo-quality prints up to 15 x 20 inches and allowing substantial cropping without loss of print quality.\n\n The precision Canon zoom lens in this new camera follows the design and construction of G-series lenses, with eight elements in seven groups, and incorporating two aspherical elements. The upgrade to a 4x optical zoom provides a 35-140mm focal length (35mm equivalent). With a maximum aperture range of f2.8 (W) to f4.1 (T), the lens is impressively bright at the telephoto end. In addition, focusing performance in low light has improved by up to 2 stops, resulting in greater freedom when shooting in dim conditions.\n\n The lenses' spectral characteristics have been optimized specifically for the configuration of the lens and sensor, providing accurate colors and significantly reducing the chromatic aberrations (such as purple fringing) often found with lower quality lenses.\n\n Advanced processing and focusing\nThe addition of Canon's advanced DIGIC II image processor results in a faster and more responsive camera that delivers improved image quality. Focusing time has been cut by around 60%, and shutter lag is negligible at no more than 0.1 seconds. Smooth continuous shooting is now available at approximately 1.9 frames per second. With DIGIC II's superior assessment of white balance, color rendition accuracy is increased.\n\n The new PowerShot still features Canon's 9-point AiAF for fast, accurate focusing even when subjects are not centerd. FlexiZone AF/AE allows free scrolling anywhere within the frame's auto focus area to select the desired subject, for which exposure is weighted accordingly. Manual focus selection is also available.\n\n Increased versatility\nA larger 2.0-inch vari-angle LCD offers users great versatility in composing shots from awkward angles, such as from ground or waist level, above the head, and when shooting self portraits. The selectable grid line display helps with composition and levelling horizons.\n\n The A620 incorporates a total of 20 shooting modes, including full Manual mode, a Custom mode for allocating preferred shooting settings, and a shutter speed priority mode, with shutter speeds ranging from 15 seconds to 1/2500 second. Eight scene modes--such as Night Snapshot, Snow, and Underwater--maximize results in a variety of shooting situations. The Stitch Assist mode facilitates shooting pictures for panoramas, which can be joined together easily with the supplied PhotoStitch software. My Colors--located on the mode dial--allows the expansion of creativity in digital photography. Special effects, such as Color Swap or Custom Color, which allows users to select their preferred color balance for any given shot, can be performed in-camera and viewed on the LCD while shooting stills and movies. These effects could previously only be achieved using PC software after shooting.\n\n High-quality movies are selectable from VGA (30/15 frames per second), QVGA (30/15 frames per second), Fast Frame Rate (for slow motion replays in camera), and Compact Mode (for clips that are ideal for e-mailing).\n\n Advanced printing\nWhen used in combination with Canon's new Compact Photo Printer Selphy CP510 and Canon's Ink and Paper Set (KP-108IP), prints can be produced very inexpensively. Printing via Selphy CP Compact Photo Printers also allows the user to print handy ID photo prints and movie prints.\n\n When connected to the latest range of PictBridge compatible PIXMA printers, image enhancement is possible with functions such as Noise Reduction and Vivid Photo, as well as the new Face Brightener feature. Also new is Captured Info print, which prints shooting data such as shutter speed, aperture and shooting mode within the photo border.\n\n Printing images without having to connect to a PC is kept simple with the Print/Share button, which also acts as an easy upload button for Windows XP and Mac OS X.\n\n Comprehensive software\nThe new cameras come bundled with a comprehensive software suite, including Canon's browsing and printing software ZoomBrowser EX 5.5 (Windows) and ImageBrowser 5.5 (Mac), easy printing software PhotoRecord 2.2 and PhotoStitch 3.1 for creating stunning panoramas. Also included is the photo manipulation software, ArcSoft PhotoStudio.\n\n Purchasers of the cameras are eligible for membership of Canon iMAGE Gateway , which offers 100 MB of online space for uploading and sharing images, and supports My Camera, which allows users to further customise their camera settings.\n\n Supported operating systems are Windows 98 (SE), Me, 2000 (SP4), XP (SP1/2) and Mac OS X v10.2-v10.3. The cameras support PTP for driverless transfer to supported Windows XP or Mac OS X.\n\n What's in the box\nPowerShot A620 body, four AA-size Alkaline batteries, 32 MB SD memory card SDC-32M, wrist strap WS-200, Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM, USB interface cable IFC-400PCU, audio-video cable AVC-DC300",
