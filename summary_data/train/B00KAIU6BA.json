These pads are heavy duty thick and the fibers clean exceptionally well without streaking. The inside cushion can hold more water than any other pads I have used yet can easily be squeezed out. This is by far the best mop and pads I have ever tried. With that being said....I do not like the dusting pad. The looped edges catch all the hair & dust & get that tangled in it.

The microfiber pads leave the floor a consistent sheen, it fold flat so can get under couches without moving them. The pad for dry mopping is efficient for dusting the floors in between mopping. Best of all the width of the mop makes mopping 2000 sq. ft. a breeze, it takes almost no time at all. Touch ups are great too, just rinse the pad in the sink wring it out and you are done, no bucket needed. Love, Love this mop!!!",

I am a quilter so I create lots of fabric dust when I cut fabric for my quilts. Even after vacuuming with my $2,000 electrolux vacuum, there is still dust when I finish the floors with this mop. I love it as my floors get really clean. We have travertine tile in our home and the extra attachment for wet mopping is wonderful too.",

Much easier than my wet mop that I now use less frequently for really dirty jobs. Costs a little more, but well worth it.",
