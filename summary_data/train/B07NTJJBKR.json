GORE-TEX fabric ensures water remains on the outside while allowing heat and perspiration to escape. Your feet will feel cool, dry and ventilated, helping you go further than you thought possible. Specially designed for running on hard surfaces, this shoe features a dual-layer FLUIDRIDE midsole plus rear and forefoot GEL technology for shock absorption and energised cushioning over long distances. It also boast a springy EVA sockliner and FLYTEFOAM Propel technology, a lightweight foam formulated with a high-energy return elastomer for unrivalled toe-off and superb bounce with every step. Extra support comes from GUIDANCE LINE technology and I.G.S (Impact Guidance System) technology, which work to enhance your natural gait, helping you to move more efficiently as you clock up the miles. An internal heel counter holds your foot in position for added stability. The sturdy outsole features moulded snow rubber and our AHARPLUS heel plug, a highly abrasion-resistant rubber placed at heavy impact areas to help this shoe withstand serious wear overtime. The added reflectivity means you'll attract attention, even when light is in short supply. With all these high-tech features, the GEL-CUMULUS 21 G-TX model is a great choice for runners who want to push themselves further regardless of what the weather throws at them!",
