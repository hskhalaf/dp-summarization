The lights themselves work well and I'd estimate that the warm white LEDs that I purchased are around 2700 kelvin in color and produce around 800 lumens. This is just an estimate based on my eye and not measured. I installed them under a cabinet above our washer and dryer replacing a two tube fluorescent light. It's not as bright as the fluorescent tubes but plenty sufficient for seeing into the washer and dryer area plus these LEDs use 95% less power!",

Giving that additional segments can be added to the \"string\" I will probably buy three more segments and attach them.

My biggest complaint is that the light quality is on the high end of \"warm white.\" Warm White is considered from about 2700K to 3500K - and these are definitely on the cooler end of that spectrum. I was looking for something closer to 2700K and these - I'm guessing - are about 3000K -- and too cool for what I need (a wall sconce that I'm building), hence four stars instead of five.",

Overall though, the strips appear to be manufactured very well and provide good light under the cabinets I have.

I did not install these myself; I hired a workman and it took him about 3 hours to install them to his and my satisfaction; the expensive part is probably the labor to install rather than the lights themselves.

They fit perfectly, the cords and connectors were all the right lengths. Will update later on reliability.",

My only thing I didn't like is that all 3 bars have to be strung together to use them all and the connectors are only about 4 inches long (as pictured in its listing). You can purchase extension wires, but I just rewired them. Installation is otherwise simple and neat. Power consumption is almost non-existent, as with most LED products.",
