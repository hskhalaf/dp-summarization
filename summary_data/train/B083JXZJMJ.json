I know I could have simply cleaned the calcium deposit which accumulated after so many years however, I chose to replace my Rowenta with the exact same model because 10 years of problem free for any small appliance deserves a repeat performance. I\u2019m just glad the price was still reasonable and the iron was still available! I may even clean the calcium deposits from this one on occasion. I\u2019ve cleaned the original iron.

There are no cracks or anything but as soon as you lay it down to iron the water just runs out the holes in the plate. Beware because it only lasted 22 months.",

Its base though is wider than expected, and that can be tricky when ironing in narrow spaces. The steam gets very hot, so one has to bear that in mind. The steam vents located all over the plate is a plus. Nice design though, the good quality of Rowenta, but a few things they could improve.",

Take close look at the handle. The water spray and steam burst functions are integrated into the handle. The iron's center of gravity is such that when balancing the iron my hand rests on the water spray lever causing water to spurt out. Not good. OK, I've tried moving my hand back away from the lever but it naturally rides up the handle when ironing to the center of gravity position. This iron is simply poorly designed. What's happened to that vaunted German engineering?",
