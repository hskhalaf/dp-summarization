Once I purchased this I also got an email for a free kindle download of recipes (of all types) and when my product shipped I received a coupon code for Orblue. I was very impressed with the item and the service and will definitely look to this company's products in the future....what a find!",

In this day and age replacing an old piece of kitchen equipment typically equals ending up with something of poor quality. It was not the case with the pastry cutter. It is actually better than the one I owned for 30+ years. Thank you for such a quality item. Highly recommend to beginning and serious cooks.",

So I went and bought this little beauty and, let me tell you, it works almost magically! The firmest, coldest butter is quickly incorporated into my flour amount so that the butter is still very cold. Voila! Super flaky crusts resulted. I highly recommend this product.

My old cutters suffered from 'flexible ' blades, loose handles, and overall floppy mechanics. This one has a fantastic grip and the cutting blades are STRONG. As pie day progressed, everyone was fighting over this pastry cutter. I highly recommend.",

Therefore, upon opening her gift, she was absolutely delighted and on my visit on New Year\u2019s Day, she proudly showed me that she had really used it and had even washed it in her dishwasher! Delighted is an understatement of her love of this new accessory in her kitchen.",

The blade itself is also a sturdier and thicker steel (with appropriate edge).

I recommend buying this item.",

Many recipes call for mashing the beans with a fork, which is rather tedious. Recently, I heard a person talking about using a pastry cutter to mash beans, so I ordered the Orblue pastry cutter.. Well, it works extremely well, and is much faster and more comfortable than using a fork. I also used it to mash up some potatoes (with skins) and it worked very well for that, as well. This tool will get a lot of use, for sure!",

This doesn't seem like a design issue, but a manufacturing control issue-- the inner blade bends at a different angle than the outer ones. Not a huge deal, it'll cut through flour and butter I'm sure, and I don't need to worry too much about additional bends since the material it's cutting through will be soft. But I'd like to see a product that puts every bit of care into making sure that the cuts it makes are extremely consistent. Good for the price, but it could definitely be better. Also... who uses a pastry blender to make pasta? Seriously weird product photos.",
