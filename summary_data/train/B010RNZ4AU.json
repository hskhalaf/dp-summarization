I can walk all day in them, and the width is great (my feet are slightly wide). If you're wanting to wear thick socks, you'll probably want to size up a half-size. The taupe color does show dirt/grease/water damage after time, but I had my first pair for two years and only gave them up because they were starting to look dingy, so I think I got good use and value out of them.",
