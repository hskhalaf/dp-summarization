Pros: Looks good Good build quality Amazing picture Thin and light weight LED Price DVI to HDMI adapter included Cons: The only con I have is the power button is a little weird to get used to. It's a touch button that you have to have your finger fully on or it won't notice it. If you just tap it with your finger tip it won't turn on or off. But it's not really a big issue and definitely not worth losing a star over.",

My husband and I both have a problem of needing reading glasses to read or see some items up close. With this monitor we don't need the reading glasses but it also has such a beautiful color on the screen. Some of our grandsons have told us what a better screen this has then theirs, We have never had a bit of trouble with it and the colors are as good as when we first purchased it.

The bezel was cracked in the corner when I got it, but I'm not one to care so after warming it up and verifying no dead pixels, super glue did the job. I'm not one to care that much, but many would. At any rate, it plays movies/games just fine and I wouldn't spend a dime more for another monitor.",

I agree with other reviews that the stand is a little weak but if you don't plan on moving it around much, it works great. Also, the control buttons almost seem non-existent--you have to know just where to touch on the rim of the screen to access the controls. Even so, I'm very pleased with my purchase.",

I do a little photo work but mostly just surfing and mail and for my needs it has performed as promised and that's all I ask of a product. I like to believe that you get what you pay for and in this case I feel that this was money well spent. Adjusting the picture to properly fill the screen and maintain the correct aspect ratio is not fully explained but some poking around and I found the solution and that's why it rates a 4 and not a 5.",

It reminds me of looking at an old dot matrix printer output. I gave it my best shot and used it for a few days hoping I'd adjust to it, but with the poor text quality it just was too much work for my eyes, and gave me a headache after using it for a while. Of course this is a 'cheap' display so I could not expect too much. I guess I'll have to pony up and spend a few more bucks to get something that works.",
