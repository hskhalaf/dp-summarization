The zipper was stuck by factory force so consumers cannot unzip to reveal moldy mattress under cover. One reviewer managed to unzip their cover to show the mold underneath, so I think they decided to make it inaccessible purposely. This merits legal action against the company Zinus.

I\u2019ve had this for two years and I\u2019ve tried to ignore the problems it\u2019s causing. I\u2019ve been waking up with an achey back for a year now. We thought our itchy eyes were from pet dander, then I read there\u2019s fiberglass in it. Just overall disappointing and a waste of money. Sleeping on the living room floor is much more comfortable and I wake up feeling more refreshed than I do in this bed.",

      "text": "We have bought several mattresses (memory foam) from amazon that have been great....however-this is the worst one we have gotten! There is a huge dip in the middle that when 2 people lay on it, you roll the the middle. If one person is laying on it, both the side curl up. This also did not expand fully, the corners appear to be missing something and the middle didn\u2019t expand either. We are NOT happy!!!! And we are attempting to return this but are having a hard time getting back in the box!! LOL!",

We used it also when we first moved in our new house because our bed had not arrived. It is soft sided so when you are close to the edge it may feel like you\u2019re going to roll off but it sure is comfortable",

I contacted amazon the next morning and they refunded my $$$ and told me to throw it away, use it , or donate. I\u2019m kind of bummed because it\u2019s really a great queen mattress and so comfortable. I would order another but I\u2019m nervous of the same problem. So bummed because we were about to order a 2nd for our guest room. I\u2019m glad amazon had great customer service.",

      "text": "So this bed is soooo firm that I literally tossed and turn all night. It's a memory foam that definitely catches your shape and holds you, but once you move it will expand out, that part I like. I'm a side sleeper and this just doesn't help me sleep at all. I woke up at I'll now just shop for a really plush mattress topper to go on top because I just can't with this bed alone. I woke up at 2am, didn't fall back asleep until 5am; not to mention my body is aching terribly this morning. I'm guessing a bed is something you really shouldn't buy online if you need something super soft.",
