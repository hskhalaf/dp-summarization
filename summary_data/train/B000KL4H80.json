If you are instead willing to permit some discrepancy in the torque you apply to whatever it is you're fastening, and/or replace the wrench from time to time, then buy a cheaper option. I use mine on brake calipers, and expect it to last a very long time, so spending the little bit extra for that piece of mind was worth it.",

The wrench features inch pounds and newton-meters which is perfect for motorcycles, since many torque values are displayed in newton-meters. The price may seem a bit high to some (its really about mid-range), but if you're worried enough to bother buying a torque wrench, why buy a cheapo one?",
