Not much has changed, and the pictures are still amazing, but does have some nice updated features (love that I can transfer pics via WiFi -great for vacation.) I am a loyal Olympus user and really feel the camera works as well as a quality DSLR. The lens collection continually updates - love the PRO series lenses. This is an easy to use camera with TONS of features. Take terrific pictures even for those who simply want to take photos on the auto function. Love it!",

I saw that the sensors were small and grimaced when I thought of low-light performance. When I got the camera, I was blown away by how it was able to take such nice photos in all conditions. While performance above ISO 1600 is poor, it is able to get nice shots on my constant f2.8 PRO series lenses. I would recommend this to an enthusiast looking to upgrade their photography to a new level. I was able to purchase my camera used, and it gave me amazing value and still wonderful camera, showing a good durability. All in all, great value!",

However after setting it up, and using enough to learn it, this is my definite go-to camera. I am not using my DSLRs these days.",

I've got it paired with a 14mm 2.5 Panasonic lens, the 45mm 1.8, and a Sigma 19mm 2.8 and really love it for a travel setup. Much lighter than my dslr bag/setup. I've had luck shooting 5 second exposure handheld with the built in stabilization. It's amazing. Make sure you update to the newest firmware right away. Very laggy on FW 1.0.",

The E-M5 II has all of the features I want in a camera: small and lightweight, awesome image stabilization, a silent shutter option, fully articulating touch LCD, the ability to customize the camera and excellent image quality. Also, I have tried the high res mode and it works great as long as you are using a tripod. I will update the review if anything changes. Thanks!",
