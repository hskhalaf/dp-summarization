Dreamcloud says Amazon purchases only have a 180 day trial, but at the time I purchase it, Amazon showed the SAME 365 DAY TRIAL. Now I am stuck with a piece of garbage and getting the total run-around from Dreamcloud. Absolutely sickening. Their customer service is just as bad as their mattress!",

I didn\u2019t even need to buy a mattress topper for this one because it felt so nice and soft, but by some sorcery managed to stay pretty firm enough to support my back. Oh and I\u2019m not woken up by my wife getting out of bed at 5am anymore. It really ticked all the boxes for us. Amazing wonderful product.",

I got a DreamCloud after finally getting rid of the old mattress that's been in my life since the days of buying mattresses in stores. And what an upgrade it was! As an avid athlete, I run hot and my back is very picky... and this mattress has been perfect for me. I stay cool and comfortable throughout the night, whether I'm on my back or my side. Cannot recommend enough -- it's the perfect amount of support for the body and cushion for the soul!",

My husband did extensive research and we tried this one out. I wake up in NO PAIN. It is awesome! My only issue is that it \"feels\" like you are going to roll off the mattress if you get too close to the edge. The edges are a little soft; but that is minor compared to the awesome support and cushion you get when you sleep. I LOVE this mattress!",
