      "text": "These headphones sound very good plenty of solid bottom without getting muddy. Nice smooth highs. Build quality is very good. Comfort is good for an hour or two no problem. I will pop the bow of my glasses above the cups for extended wearing. These don't fold flat for travel, But the fact that these don't isolate very well means I'm not likely to travel with them anyway. Beyerdynamic DTX501p are perfect for that use. I have never tried the Momentum over ears so can't compare these to them, But am happy especially for $78, this was a no brainer. Watch for dramatic price differences between the different colors I saved $20 with the pink ones.",

They have good bass response, but don't expect a Beats style headphone, they are not pumped up bass, they play what they are given and sound good doing it. The controls for the iPhone work good, not quite as easy to press as the standard iPhone headphones, but all of the same features are there, (I haven't tested the microphone quality in a phone call yet, but speech to text worked fine. They come with two cords, one with the iPhone controlling switch, and one without. I recommend these headphones!",

They have soft ear cushions of alcantara stainless steel thin bands that the ear covers slide up and down on and a leather headband. They come with a case and a nylon bag and 2 wires one with iPhone controls which work great with my iPad, mac, iPhone and windows phone. The sound is wonderful!

You have to use a special Sennheiser cord since it has a nib at the end that twists and secures the cord to the headset. I bought this when it was on sale for $75 and I use them every day. Sound quality is great, I do want to upgrade to the newer model, since those fold and are easier for carrying (this one is kind of bulky) but until then, these are perfect.",

After a year the psuedo leather as started to split and these things only sound good when turned up really loud and even then they're only okay.

Great bass, good high notes, mid-range more than acceptable. I'm not an audiophile, but the difference between these headphones and some earbuds was noticeable even to my deaf ears, so it should satisfy any but the most tone-deaf people out there.",

They are light, very sturdy with a metal headband to keep your tunes in place during the workout.

The sounds is fantastic. Not over based like so many things are these days. Jazz, classical, Salsa, Timba everything sounds amazing, crisp clear with each instrument definied on these.

The V sound signature (emphasis on bass and the highest parts of sound) leads to an unclear muddled sound. Just inpleasant. I was attracted to these headphones because of its retromodern style, positive reviews and relatively low price (on sale for $84 at time of this review). I wish I would have heeded the warnings about the V sound signature and gone with something else instead.",

Low end is a little much for my tastes, but it is easily adjusted with an amp when necessary. FWIW I have a pretty big head and find no comfort issues with these. These are a good blend of Sennheiser quality and curb appeal to those new to higher end headphones. Certainly better than pretty much any Beats model, and a good \"stylish\" alternative to the P3/P5.",

I can also see why some say they hurt because they do fit tightly. Again, I am happy with purchase because of 50% discount for buying black. I wish the over-the-ears Momentums were discounted like these on-the-ear headphones.",
