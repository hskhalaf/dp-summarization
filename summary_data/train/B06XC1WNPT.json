For the 1.5 minutes that I held this keyboard in my hands, I have to say it felt pretty great. It didn't break in that amount of time so I would say its durability is pretty good, and it was quite easy to clean the 5 specs of dust that collected on it before I put it back in its plastic wrap. I pressed a total of 5 keys on it and the cherry mx reds live up to their hype. From my experience, pretty good, just not what I wanted.",

Well Corsair found a way to make this board as large as possible. It's got large bezels and there's an extra row of multimedia keys that makes the keyboard much deeper than other TKL boards. As for switches they're fine. The action feels like two plastic pieces sliding against each other so it feels okay but I think Cherry MX switches are overrated, especially since they command a price premium. Also, Corsair keyboards have nonstandard bottom rows so if you're wanting to have the option to replace keycaps definitely look elsewhere.",

This keyboard is very solidly built and an excellent value. I only stick with my $350 keyboard because it is much quieter than a Cherry MX keyboard and it is easier on the fingers for long typing sessions, such as being a writer, coder, or chat support specialist. Also, I greatly prefer the genuine Cherry MX keys that Corsair uses compared to the ones that Razor switched over to. Finally, this compact form factor will be great if you're a lower sensitivity FPS player with a larger mouse pad, such as when sniping.",

Caps lock is my voice for Discord/teamspeak/mumble and it will randomly just pop off mid gaming. If you don't click the direct center of it, it WILL pop off. The RGB lighting ONLY works when you turn it on in the software, not when you initially boot your computer. I could look past that though but the keycaps popping off mid gaming while in a competitive game where pausing is impossible is just retarded. Again, makes me never want to buy Corsair again it's beyond frustrating. $125 keyboards should not be made with such crap quality.",

I kept reaching for the 'Enter' key that usually comes on the numberpad. Keys feel great to press, very linear and smooth, and of course a bit different from Logitech's Romer G switches. I'm especially impressed with how balanced the keys feel to press, especially the space bar. Even though the switches are Cherry MX Red, I feel like I've already had a solid typing experience with this board even without tactile feedback or an audible click. All in all, a great budget upgrade if you're looking for a TKL gaming keyboard.",

The media keys do exactly what they're programmed to do, and with Corsair's iCue software it's easy to choose an LED configuration. Since the backlighting on this model is only red, you're losing some of the aesthetic compared to an RGB model. Compact is certainly the way to describe this, so if you want a number pad or a set of programmable macro keys then there are better options. This is a good choice for light typing work, FPS games, and simple RPGs.",

FWIW, I'm finding the red backlighting easier to see and use than my previous Corsair keyboards many colors. But, still, be aware that this is a very good, albeit one color, keyboard.",

      "text": "Cherry MX Red - Great switch, quick response, and not too loud. RGB - A lot of cool settings to give that nice color to your set up. Material - Great materials, base made of metal, nice looking keyboard. It doesn\u2019t feel cheap at all. Overall - I recommend the K65 for gamers who is looking for a great keyboard in the price range of $80 - 130 This keyboard offers a great switch, material, and RGB system for an insane price.",
