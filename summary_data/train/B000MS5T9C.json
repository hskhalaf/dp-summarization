Working out in the pool alleviated the aggravation of the arthritis of my knees. The Aquafins provide a great resistance workout to rehab my hip and strengthen my legs to help support my knees better. I definitely found these to be beneficial and wold recommend to anyone looking for a low impact strengthening program in a pool.",

I find that using them on one ankle and wrist on the same side allows me to hold onto the side of the pool for balance. I also like using them on my wrists while jogging in the pool. I do wish they gave more resistance, tho. Good quality.",
