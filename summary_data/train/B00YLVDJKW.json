I don't have a huge green thumb, I think I'm about average but they started sprouting up like crazy. I ended up putting more than I wanted to because the lady next door feeds the birds and they usually try to eat my seeds. But everything I planted started growing so I've been trying to spread them out a little bit. I'm afraid to thin it out because I don't know which ones are which. Do I need to thin them out? Or will they figure it out on their own? These are really great seeds.",

The price is the most reasonable for seeds that I have seen and I\u2019m beyond happy that I purchased them. If you\u2019re having any doubts I hope I can reassure you that this is the product you should choose.",

My largest one is already 4ft+ in height with all the others around just below it, and they still haven't bloomed! The seeds were all mixed in the bag, and the quality of the seeds were really great. I can't wait for the flowers to bloom! Thank you Seed Needs!",

I wish the seeds were separated or at least came with a chart to identify each one so I could separate myself. Overall the price is more than fair for what you get, so I cannot complain too much.
