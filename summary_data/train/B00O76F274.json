Nice mild scent (hint of ginger) that's not too overwhelming. I was previously using Laneige Lip Mask and I prefer this Ginger Sugar lip mask over that. My lips started to peel after using that product, but I've had no issues with this lip mask. Great value and I will definitely buy this again.",

It has to be removed with a dry cloth and some oil based cleanser. Use the applicator wand to apply, if you get it on your fingers it's hard to wash off. Wipe the applicator wand off with a clean, dry tissue after applying. This works great in cold, dry winter weather when Chapstick won't work. But, it's to be worn while you sleep. You can't eat or drink anything after you apply it or it will get all over and be hard to remove.",

It felt like it was causing my lips so feel more dry or something. It was weird. Maybe it was just my body not agreeing with it.",

I wish it was not sticky but I appreciate that it keeps my lips feeling moist.",

It actually stays on the lips until I wipe it off, and leaves my lips the smoothest they\u2019ve ever been throughout the entire day. Is it the most pleasant feeling when on? No, because it\u2019s a bit sticky which is what allows it to stay on for so long-but you get used to it quickly, and it\u2019s worth it. My one tiny disappointment is the scent. It has a pleasant light orange smell, but I was really hoping it would smell like a sweet and spicy ginger, as the name implied.",
