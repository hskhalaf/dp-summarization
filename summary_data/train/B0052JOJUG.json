      "text": "It's my fault for not really paying attention to the sizing and when you're impulse buying numbers don't mean much. I saw the picture and it looked like a larger one I was going to replace this with that I kept by my door. This would be great for the entry of a door mouse's house or even Tom Thumb. But for normal people, it's itsy bitsy and not even big enough for in front of your sink or getting out of the shower. If you rolled it up, it could pass for an ancient papyrus scroll. Overall the quality is okay, too. Thin strips of wood guled to canvas.",

(Note: our kitchen has a skylight so the mat is exposed to filtered UV sun light everyday which is prob why the fabric is turning to dust.) Every mat I've ever tried has looked like crap after a few months of use and washings. This mat can be vacuumed and mopped and doesn't need to be thrown in a washer. The bamboo part still looks glossy and new. It has a low profile, corners don't curl up and it feels snug on our ceramic tile so it's not a tripping hazard.",

With these, I was able to put one outside the tent, and one directly inside. As long as people kept with the method (i.e. taking their shoes off when entering the tent) it worked wonders! These rinse off nice and easy and can't be beat for the price.",

If on bare floor they are quite sturdy. The cloth backing is thin and not very absorbent as a bath mat unless you dry off before exit. I plan to buy the longer mat to place under my vanity and move the two smaller ones to my shower and separate bath.",

I love that this mat will never have to see the inside of my washing machine.",

I do wish I had ordered the next size up, as this one is a bit small.",
