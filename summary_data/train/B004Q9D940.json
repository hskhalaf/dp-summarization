The quality of this sink in terms of thickness, finish and sound insulation sprayed on the underside is comparable to much more expensive sinks. I bought one which was an open box so I saved even more than the already low price. If you shop around at the big box stores you will find the special application sinks are much more expensive so this was a good buy. I bought the 2\" bar sink drain/strainer separately at a local large chain store for under $10. Highly recommend this sink.",

Or could be just the oilish protection that the Chinese manufacturer puts on that we will find later causes some sort of cancer. Aside from the cancer scare, the bowl seems to do its job. Was a bit temperamental installing a drain, had to use more putty than expected to keep it from leaking. All is fine now.",
