I practically cried with joy when I realized my wife had put this mattress cover on that I ordered the prior week!! While this mattress cover looks and feels like *soft* absorbent fabric, it is 110% waterproof. It looked so soft and light I didn't believe at first that I couldn't\u200b believe it would work. No scent, no dampness under it.. Perfect. Tossed it and the sheets in the washing machine (hot cycle, extra detergent) and it washed up great.",

I forgot to check for special washing instructions and simply washed them on HOT with the rest of the bedding. They're fine! I'm impressed with the quality and the price. We will be buying more for the other children to use.",

They do not make either of our beds sleep hot.

Will update if that ever happens. I sure hope not. Design is where I wish I could take a half star off. The elastic isn't terribly strong and so it was a bit of a tussle to get the sheets on properly without pulling the Lucid pad out of place.",

I decided that, because of my personal hygiene habits, I didn't need the full case protector, but a top fitting one that was still waterproof. I found Lucid and I love that the protector sits flush with my mattress and doesn't leave air gaps under my sheets. I already love this brand! 10/10 from me!",

However, the thin and soft cover, if it is indeed dust mite as well as spill proof will be great, because it fits snug and will not be in the way of sheets fitting well. It looks and feels nice. I particularly like that it is of bamboo rayon, not polyester, since that usually pills and the texture of polyester pilling would be felt through the sheet. So, looking forward to keeping our mattress clean with this cover. Thank you",
