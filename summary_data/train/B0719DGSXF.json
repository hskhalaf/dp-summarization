FYI: Mine had a tiny issue where when I held the spinner vertically, it would make a weird clicking sound. I was able to fix this by simply removing the bearing cap and tightening the silver bearing protector.",

I would not have bought this item in the store once I felt how lose the Caps were.

The caps fit loosely within the center bore of the bearing, and shift back and forth. The bearing was not fully pressed in, and the outer weights are unevenly set in the body. Edit: I realized the bearing isn't pressed into the body, but rather screwed in. Turns out it was cross-threaded, and I was able to correct that.",
