The packaging should have been better and it is fortunate that nothing was damaged in shipment. Pictures of the damage to the inner and outer container are attached. I would recommend having the Amazon box be used as if it were a gift to get the extra protection! The product would have receive 5 stars if there was not so much damage to the container!",

Leg rests attach very easily. A little weird to have the back for the calf support but I also never experienced such a thing. Can't wait for my mom to see it and try it out during our adventures.

I contacted the seller to return because it is not as sturdy as needed and a clip was cracked. It took several attempts. Finally they sent a return label where I would have to pay for shipping!!! Not happy at all!",

It opens and folds easily and once you find out where to grab the collapsed chair it is easy to pick up and put in and take out of the car (I have a hatchback). My husband says it is comfortable (you will need to buy a thick cushion to sit on). It rolls well. Very happy with this purchase",
