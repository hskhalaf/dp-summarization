I have googled various sites to find help, and many say the same thing...it was fine when they first bought it. The sites say to trash it and buy another brand. Needless to say, I wont be buying Canon printers anymore.",

Of course I have no way of knowing if that was the issue, but I suspect it was. So far the new printer has worked flawlessly. It has done a good job of DVD labels and photos. It is slower than my previous Canon, but the price was right and I feel that it is a little more conserving on the ink. I intend to only use Canon ink which I get from Cosco for only a little bit more then the refills.",

We don't use the fax so I can not comment on that feature. This printer uses 4 individual ink tanks so you only replace the color that is empty which saves money.

The printer was very easy to setup and connect to my home network, now we can print from wherever we are in the house. The speed is good and the print quality is excellent. Would strongly recommend this printer, especially at the Amazon price. Bonus feature, our cat loves it too, he will come racing in to watch it when it starts a print job.",

Our usage is so light, we are still using the starter ink so I have no feedback on maintenance.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer This networkable 5-in-1 is all business, able to quickly produce beautiful photos and bold, professional-quality text. You can print photos right from compatible memory cards; selecting and enhancing images on the 1.8 inch color LCD display - or directly from a digital camera or DV camcorder. The Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) holds up to 30 originals, and two paper trays can store both plain and photo paper. You'll achieve up to Super G3 fax speed in color and B&W, and the expanded memory can store 40 speed dial codes and receive 100 incoming pages. Copies will be remarkably true to the originals, and when scanning photos you'll produce impressive 2400-dpi results, with vibrant 48-bit color depth.\n\n \n\nThe Canon Pixma MX700 All-In-One Printer offers:  * 4800 x 1200 dpi prints for spectacular detail and clarity. \n * Print directly from compatible memory cards \n * The Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) holds up to 30 originals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe networkable 5-in-1 MX700 is all business, able to quickly produce beautiful photos and bold, professional-quality text.. View larger. Superb Resolution \nTo achieve 4800 x 1200 color dpi resolution, Canon Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) uses a patented print head with 1,600 precision nozzles, ejecting ink droplets as small as 2 picoliters. The result: Amazing images.\n\nFour High-Performance Ink Tanks \nThis All-in-One uses four high-intensity dye-based color inks for rich photos and graphics, and a pigment black ink for clear, laser-quality text. Replace only the color that runs out, rather than a multi-color tank containing unused ink, helping to reduce your print costs. \n\nFast Printing \nFor extra productivity in the home or small office, you'll be able to produce up to 30 ppm black / up to 20 ppm color. You can also print a superb 4 x 6 inch borderless print in only about 46 seconds. \n\nAutomatic Document Feeder\nThe built-in Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) holds up to 30 originals, so it's faster and easier to copy, scan or fax your larger documents. \n\nAuto Image Fix \nThe built-in Auto Image Fix feature helps you produce amazing results on all your photos. First, it categorizes your images into one of five types - Portrait, Scenery, Night Scenery, Snapshot with Scenery, and Snapshot with Night Scenery - then applies optimal image correction accordingly. For example, it will automatically brighten faces that are backlit and underexposed, and correct color cast to help ensure more accurate skin tones. \n\n \n\n\n\nAuto Image Fix ensures a good print every time. \nTwo Paper Trays\nTwo built-in paper trays let you store photo paper and plain paper of different sizes - so you're always ready to print.\n\nView, Edit and Enhance Images\nWith the 1.8 inchLCD screen you can view images on a compatible memory card without having to download them to your computer, then enhance them before printing. \n\nNetwork Connectivity\nAn Ethernet interface lets you connect to a home or office network, with connected computers sharing the use of this versatile machine. \n\nHigh Performance Faxing\nThis Office All-In-One achieves Super G3 Hi-speed fax in color and B&W, and its memory can store 40 coded speed dials and up to 100 incoming pages. \n\nPrint from Memory Cards / Cameras\nWant to print photos directly from a compatible memory card without using your computer? Just insert the card into a built-in slot, select images on the LCD display, and print! You can also print photos directly from your digital camera/DV camcorder.",
