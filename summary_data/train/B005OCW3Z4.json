I would measure 1/2 cup of two foods into separate bowls. The next day I would measure the remainders to find which food they preferred. This was the favorite and I've been giving it to them since then.",

I have a real good nose, and this is annoying to me just being in the same room with the feeding bowls. Technical quality of the food is pretty good for the price, but as I said, it's not what I need.",
