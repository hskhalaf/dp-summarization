Pay attention to the dimensions and make sure it will physically fit the area immediately below or above your screen. Yes, you need a center channel speaker, even for a a simple non-surround stereo setup.

      "text": "Updated the surround from 6.1 to a 7.2 and needed a good center speaker to go with my Bose cubes. This speaker did a great job of filling the bill. Blended very with the Bose and is clear as bell. I'm getting older now and for some reason having a hard time understanding females with English accents. HBO's NETWORK, PBS and BBC news and even CNBC, English accented women seem to be the rage these days, so I had to make some adjustments or turn off the TV.",

I also noticed the timbre matching between this speaker and the Polk Audio TSi 400 tower speakers I had. Everything was much more clear and even across the board. The one thing that surprised me was the actual size of the speaker. It is quite a bit larger than my old center channel and it took me by surprise. If you are going to buy this product, make sure you measure the dimensions first, as it's quite large. Great sound however.",

I have a set of Polk M20's that I am upgrading to M50's. Don't know if I'll be using the M20's as backs or not, but all in all the Cs10 is a good buy.",

    "description": "Color:BlackThe CS10 center, like its larger brother the CS20 sounds just as good but is a little smaller. It still has an angled top allowing you to invert the speaker and place it below your TV directing sound towards the listening area. CS10 works great with the TSi100, TSi200 and others. Speaking of the cabinet (no, not the Presidential Cabinet), it's extensively braced from MDF with \u00be Inch thick baffles. Cheaper speakers will use other material such as particle board which is flimsy, robbing you of good sound. With pewter accents, a piano black top plate and removable black grille, TSi speakers look awesome and take up less than one square foot. All models are available in a choice of black or cherry wood grain, so don't be ashamed to show off your stereo equipment.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\nUnlike the electronics, your speakers won't go out of date, so bring out the most in your entertainment experience with Polk TSi Series.
