Just yesterday, for example, coffee leaked all over my kitchen counter because the stopper went crooked somehow. I wound up with about half the coffee I was expecting!

In my experience, the felt filter got super grungy after multiple uses and also took forever to filter. The filter bags are so dang easy and then you just dispose of the leftover garbage beans however you deal with that sort of thing.",

You do need to follow the directions to avoid gunking up the filter.

Cons' - Messy to clean up , you have to keep track of tiny little plug for the bottom of the container that holds the cold brew in, filter sometimes comes out or gets loose allowing for grounds to come through, not using the lid (created suction) is best to avoid that, just leave the lid off.",

Tip - Don't pack the coffee in or you will clog the filter and it will not drain after steeping. We let it steep for 48 hours.",

Once you get the process down, it is not cumbersome but if you like a really hot cup of coffee a microwave heat up is necessary. It is now time for me to order another filter as my first one has had seven brews and I will use my second one.",

Let grinds soak overnight, then drip coffee concentrate into pitcher in morning. Dilute with hot water, or milk, cream...whatever your preference.
