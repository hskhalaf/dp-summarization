The Pool Cleaner is the best we have had (out of four brands over the years) because it is so efficient. It wanders to deep and shallow ends, is not bothered by curved walls, and does not get clogged by the little pebbles from our landscape. I know it is picking up because I have to empty the leave catcher I attached to the hose - there is always evidence of Golden Retriever in that bag. There are no negatives about this device.",

Its algorithm keeps it from getting stuck anywhere in the pool. It seems to very rarely twist the hose. The cleaner will climb up the walls and suck air if you have the suction too high but that is adjustable either through your pump, your diverter or the adjustable suction orifices included with the cleaner. I cannot comment on durabilty yet because i have only had it for a few months. I willtry to update in the future.",

When this one dies, I am back to Hayward. I'm sure I'd feel differently if I didn't have to change the direction of the water. If you have a bottom drain that is proud, this vacuum is GREAT for that.

    "title": "Poolvergnuegen PV896584000013 Hayward 896584000-013 The Pool Cleaner Automatic Suction Pool Vacuum, 2-Wheel, White",
    "description": "The 2x Suction PoolCleaner\u2122 uses your existing pump and filter for power. This cleaner plugs into either your designated suction port or the skimmer. The 2x is ideal for most average sized pools. Some of the features that make 2 Wheel POOLCLEANER\u2122 unique: SELF ADJUSTING TURBINE VANES All the POOLCLEANER\u2122 cleaners have the patented self-adjusting turbines, which maximizes the power from the water flow. This turbine is similar to a paddle wheel with blades that are adjustable. This feature allows the POOLCLEANER\u2122 to still move at low suction and low pressure. In addition the folding vanes of the turbine allow for the easy passage of larger debris through the cleaner. STEERING SYSTEM The 2x Suction POOLCLEANER\u2122 has an internal programmed steering system, that causes the left wheel to periodically reverse, allowing the POOLCLEANER\u2122 to turn and then move into another direction. For the 2x Suction POOLCLEANER\u2122 there are five different programmed turns ranging from 90 to 450 degrees. This feature allows the POOLCLEANER\u2122 to cover not only the deep end, but also the shallow end. The POOLCLEANER\u2122 has no problem with uneven surfaces or strange shapes. It won\u2019t stick in a corner, or get hung up by a main drain. ROBUST TIRE TREADS One look and you will see that the patented tire treads give the POOLCLEANER\u2122 better climbing ability and obstacle maneuverability. The tires come with tread wear markers that show you when to replace your tires. The front tires of the POOLCLEANER\u2122 have humps (raised treads) that allow the POOLCLEANER\u2122 to overcome any reasonable obstacles such as the main drain and uneven surfaces. This makes the POOLCLEANER\u2122 ideal for all pool surfaces and shapes. ADJUSTABLE SKIRT The POOLCLEANER\u2122 has patented adjustable skirts that allow the cleaner to maintain optimal suction under the machine even when it encounters obstacles. When the POOLCLEANER\u2122 encounters an obstacle one (or more) of the skirts will lift up (adjust) over the obstacle while maintaining suction under the cleaner. An easy way to determine if you need a 2 Wheel Suction PoolCleaner or a 4 Wheel Suction PoolCleaner is to imagine a 40 ft long pool. If the suction port or skimmer is half way (most newer pools) approx. 20 ft from one end, then the 2 Wheel Model will be sufficient. If however the suction port is all the way at one end AND you have a very deep end the 4 Wheel PoolCleaner would be better suited for your pool. The best way to describe it is that the 4 Wheel model can drag more hose. PLEASE NOTE: Special tires may be needed for certain pool surfaces such as tile, vinyl and fiberglass.",
