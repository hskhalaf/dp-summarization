Fast forward to this morning and it crackles at any volume, the right speaker is blown. Checked my amazon account and no return option is available. Very disappointing.",

We have several bluetooth speakers throughout the house and this one easily took 1st place for sound quality. However, with Youtube videos, there was a significant audio delay and it was really annoying. I did some googling, found out there was a firmware update, and updated it per Anker's website instructions. Afterward, the video delay is fixed! However, now the speaker sounds pretty dull. Audio sounds fine but it's a noticeable, significant downgrade in music quality after the firmware update. Guess you can't have it all? I would almost rather downgrade the firmware and just not use the speaker for Youtube or other video.",

Was able to get it to sound much better with some aggressive equalization from my phone music app. Bass is still a bit weak, but actually stronger than I expected for the tiny speakers. Amazon site says this is Bluetooth 5 and IPX7 water resistance but neither is true based on the manual and Anker site. I would rate this a 4 but get pretty fed up with these errors on Amazon (e.g. lies by sellers).",

Definitely not a dealbreaker though for me though, just plugged in the aux and I'm good.",

I bought this speaker for something to throw in a bag and take to the beach. It's loud enough, the battery is fantastic (4 year old Bose only lasts about 6 hours now), and it sounds good. Not great, but more than adequate for the price paid and intended use. I'd recommend this product based on excellent \"bang for the buck\".",

      "text": "This little guy has been out with me on jobs for about a month. I love the battery life on this thing, it lasts forever. Bluetooth connection is strong, I've yet to loose connection. Audio is of excellent quality, no distortion. That being said, this certainly isn't the loudest speaker, but to me that's a good thing. Just buy this little guy, you won't regret it.",
