However, the top does not knead as advertised. The picture specifically indicates that there is kneading on top and bottom, but there is not. The top only puts pressure on the top of the feet...that\u2019s not a \u201cmassage\u201d to me. The only reason why I bought this model was for the \u201ctop foot massage\u201d.",

The only thing that changes is the pressure on the feet (which make the rollers more or less intense). But the pressure goes on and off at regular, short intervals. There is no way to control that. If I want the pressure to stay on, too bad. A little disappointing, to be honest. It still feels good with the massage action, I just wish I could control the pressure and adjust the heat higher.",

      "text": "So I received my foot messager yesterday and plugged it in, only to find out none of the controls worked and the machine was stuck in the on position. I was able to try it out, although unable to use any of the functions. It did feel good on the feet, so I have ordered another one and am sending the first one back. I will leave more detailed review then. Hopefully, the build quality will be better on the 2nd unit.",

It will actually squeeze your feet so the rollers on bottom are pressed against the sole of your feet. There are 5 different intensity settings, and the lowest setting is pretty strong.",

I did not find it painful at all though it is a deep penetrating message. If you have delicate feet then maybe it could be painful but I did not find it painful at all nor did my husband. Nice pressure and nice deep massage. I would recommend this for sure and may buy one for everyone in my family. I do not have a single complaint.",
