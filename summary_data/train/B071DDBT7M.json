So far i am impressed with the video resolution over the older,480p IP cameras that i have.The camera movement looks pretty responsive and the movement/video/audio lag seems to be minimal. I haven't tried out the more advanced features yet, such as recording to SD or anything since this will serve as a baby crib monitor. I did try out the 2-way audio & it seems to work fine as well. All in all i am satisfied with this camera, especially for the price,and will most likely grab another one for our our next baby.",

We use this for a baby monitor and if our child is crying we want to know instantly what the problem is.

So far, just perfect. Set up in about five minutes and works/paired with my iPhone perfectly. Currently sitting on a table, but will wall mount for better coverage. Picture is clear and motion detection works as designed. Haven\u2019t tried the night vision yet. The sound quality is good, but I\u2019m getting a little channel noise. I need to work with it a bit before I\u2019d say there is a problem. Overall, for the money, this is a great camera.",

Then, every time it loses connection (which is always) it goes through a complete cycle where the camera scrolls through its complete range of motion and ends by pointing at the ceiling. This is both annoying to have to swipe through to change it to redirect each time, and creepy. Furthermore, there\u2019s no on/off feature- you can only unplug- so if you don\u2019t want it\u2019s red ring of LED lights staring at you while you\u2019re home, you\u2019re SOL. Picture quality is decent, once you do manage to connect.",

The camera video can be a little slow to catch up but it is great quality for the price and the night vision and audio works well. The set up was a little frustrating because I had to change my WIFI password and I had to have my cell volume up so it could hear the R2D2 noise on crack. The power cord, is my major complaint because it is so short! All in all good camera if you'd like something inexpensive.",
