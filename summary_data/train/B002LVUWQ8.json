I never thought that a cheap mallet like this would be such a game changer. I do a lot of hand tool work and this mallet has made my work so much more efficient that I felt the need to go out of my way to write a review. It transfers all the energy to the chisel and leaves deapens a marking gauge line 4 times the amount I would get with a wood mallet. If I lost this I would buy it again without thinking",

      "text": "I've used a few shop made mallets in the past but all of them have the same drawback...either too heavy or too light or they tend to be awkward and too bulky for continual use. The Wood Is Good mallet solves both problems. I purchased the 18 oz. mallet. It strikes a good balance between heft and control. It's light enough for delicate chisel work yet beefy enough to chop mortises. The urethane coating really shines when striking a chisel...no bounce, no slipping, just a solid strike. I have added grip tape to the handle on my mallet which aids in controlling mallet strikes. I would definitely recommend this mallet to any serious wood worker.",

There is just enough weight in the tool to make tooling jobs easier and the material on the head of the maul has held up without any damage. The overall construction seems well done and the handle is incredibly smooth. Very pleased, especially for the price since premium mauls for leather craft can easily be twice the price of this tool.",

I have the 18 ounce mallet, which is a good compromise of small size to lessen fatigue, and enough weight that you can do decently heavy work. The handle is comfortable to hold.
