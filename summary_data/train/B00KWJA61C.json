      "text": "This was the answer to our problems. The wood deck for our porch was wearing our rubber door sweep off. It would screech and drag each time we opened the door. This sweep was easy to install and so far is keeping the bugs out. I would recommend holding the sweep up and drilling the outside holes, then securing those then drilling the rest. I had it turned around to be as close to the door as possible and when I was securing it the holes then didn\u2019t match up. I used a 3/32 bit for the holes. Great value for the money.",

      "text": "The biggest problem with this product is that the nylon bristles will fold/twist very easily out of shape. It's designed so that you can slide the bristles out from the rest of the frame. I assume this is so that you can cut them separately from the frame, which I did since I had to cut it down to 34\". The big problem for me was that when I tried to slide it back in, all the bristles got mashed up and warped, no matter how careful I tried to be. It's an eyesore, pretty useless now, and will have to be replaced. Still gets a couple stars for value.",
