He's not getting so worked up (shaking and panting and pacing) when the neighbors are shooting, motorcycles going by or other loud noises. Thunderstorms are still a bit much for him but he calms down more easily. We've only had storms in the distance in the 2 months using this, suspect a direct storm would still unhinge him, but if it helps a bit, that'll be great. I can't imagine this helping for just barking in our other dog.",

Might work for other dogs. At least the return policy is generous.",
