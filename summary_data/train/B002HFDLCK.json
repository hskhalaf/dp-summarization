I have Aussies and they she'd a LOT, as you can see in the photo. 3 weeks of no vacuuming left a furry mess. The Hoover tackled it with no problem! It pulled so much sand and dust out of the carpet. My dogs are working dogs on my farm. Yes, I had to stop and empty the bin FREQUENTLY, but it was doing a great job getting all of the hair out of the carpet. I noted the vacuum has self-propulsion until the bin needs emptied. So, keep the bin cemptied and the vacuum does the work!",

The picture is what came out of the canister after two vacuums. It's about a volleyball mass of fur (remember, it's spring in Las Vegas, so the critters are shedding). Highly recommend!

We still put it together & tried it. We have short pile rugs, hardwood floors & 2 Siberian Husky's. The vacuum left trails of fur behind on the hardwood floors & did not get the hair off the rug in our office where they primarily nap. The suction just wasn\u2019t there. We packed this up & sent it back. We did end up purchasing the bissell pet hair and I can say we are 100% satisfied with that model as it does get all the fur.",

Then you realize that the controls on the Bissell are in a stupid location or non-intuitive. The Hoover on-off switch is at your fingertip on the handle. The pedal at the base release the head to vacuum. Grab the front of the hollow chamber (where the big grab handle is) and the release is right there at your thumb. This is a pleasure to use. It is usually 99.99 and sometimes on sale for 79.99.",

I have always had canister style vacs, and while not perfect in all respects, this upright bagless vac does a great job all around and has a very attractive price/value. Great suction power and cleans all floors very well. Id like to be able to turn brushes off but it doesn't really hamper all around cleaning tasks. The small power brush attachment works great on stairs and furniture. This vac is light weight and quite portable, and takes up little space in the hall storage closet. It handles well and overall I am very pleased with this purchase. A bargain at this price point.",

The top filter is washable, and the bottom HEPA filter is replaceable. I have washed the top filter a couple times and it seems very well-made. Should last through plenty of washings in between the multitude of times I simply bang out the dust.)",
