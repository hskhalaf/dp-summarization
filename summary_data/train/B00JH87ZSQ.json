I have been able to increase longevity with super glue in some spots, but I don't see this case making it another 6 months. The texture is great and it does exactly what I need it to do \u2013 I just wish it would last longer. But for 10 bucks, I suppose I can't really complain.",

This case is very slim and provides minimal protection, so if you are prone to dropping your phone or it gets a lot of wear and tear, I'd recommend a \"beefier\" case such as the Spigen Slim Armor case.

As far as drop protection goes I don't think that that is this case's strong suit, but then again, I have yet to drop my phone while it's in the case.

      "text": "I bought it last month and since then I am in love with it. The case is very sleek and nice looking. The protection was tested last night when I dropped my phone from about 4 feet height on sidewalk with face down. There was no damage to the phone as the sides are slightly raised. This is really a sturdy and great looking protective case. Thumbs Up!!",

The biggest con for me is that the plastic is rather slick and does not aid your grip. I dropped the phone once in the first 4 days of handling it, but am learning to adjust. I like it that the buttons are not covered up and thus the case doesn't get in the way. Because of the slipperiness of the case, I just may have to get another one.",

I don't think it's a con, though. My only complaint is that the thin plastics above the buttons holes are very sensitive. I broke it the first time I tried to remove the case. So you need to be careful with it. I'm a tech guy, and I'm very careful with my devices. I don't think it was my fault when it broke. In a nutshell: it's a nice case, but not that resistant to cracks.",

I should add that I also had the iPhone screen protector from Maxboost, which was smashed in multiple places after the tumble.
