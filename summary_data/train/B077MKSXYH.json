It is narrower than I expected and the length was not consistent with othe models I have had. Unfortunately, my past experience led to me recycling the box before I had a chance to try them on so now I am unable to return them for a larger size.",

    "description": "Stay strong even on the most challenging trails with the lightweight and responsive construction of the Gecko XT running shoe from ASICS\u00ae. Predecessor: N/A. Support Type: Underpronation to Neutral. Cushioning: Lightweight, flexible response. Surface: Road. Differential: 6mm. Heel/Toe: 18mm/12mm. Breathable mesh and synthetic upper. Constructed with a last that allows for more room in the toe box to keep the runner safe and supported even while trekking downhill. Seamless construction reduces the potential for irritation and friction caused by traditional stitches and seams. Gusseted, anti-gravel tongue prevents debris from entering the shoe.
