The food comes out pretty good for most part and I love cooking marinated chicken in it, plus fish...Everything comes out nice and juicy...I haven't tried any red meat, just chicken, fish, & eggs in tin foil...I gave it a four because the plastic containers are really flimsy feeling, so if you press too hard while cleaning them, they will easily break...The plastic containers are somewhat a pain to clean because the food sticks to them easily while cooking, then all the food residue gets stuck in the holes at the bottom...I also wasn't a fan of the rice bowl, so I won't be using that for rice...",

To those that say it's cheap...not so. I think if you are respectful...clean it...that this steamer will last for years. It's a basic steamer under $20. Get real...what do you expect? Interesting that it has 3 stackable layers. It seems to me the first layer closest to the steaming water gets more steam and cooks faster. So that is where I place carrots and items that take more time. Experiment with it...it really is compact and will get the job done.",

I used it for heating face towels when doing in home massages. Other than food of course. I love the other plastic bowl that came with it. I can steam rice in it or shrimp in butter. The picture guide for the timer helps a lot.",

However, I do wish this steamer would have had another light, in the base, that would automatically come on to keep the food warm within the plastic bowl(s) once the timer light would shut off indicating cooking is complete. That's something that Ovente would eventually have to add to the base of the steamer. Other than that, I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, economical food steamer that gets the job done.",

I love that I have plenty of room to steam 3 different things in stead of 2. If you didn't want to steam 3 items you can only do 1. Everything cooks out good. I don't usually eat things like carrots and broccoli but with the steamer I love them now. Directions are very easy to follow. The steam is very easy to clean up and store. Dishwasher safe which is always a plus. Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone who was looking or asking about one.",

Most steamers come with a removable base that the water sits in so you don't have to worry about getting the internals wet when cleaning it. This one does not have that option. The trays and tiers are too small and it started leaking after a few months. To top it all off, the red cover for the indicator light actually melted.... Stopped using it after that. All in all it did do its job of steaming whatever we were able to fit in it but I recommend looking for a different steamer.",
