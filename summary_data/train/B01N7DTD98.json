The taste - I have only tried the vanilla - is almost perfect, except for that odd Stevia aftertaste which I personally hate, but I know others don't mind. Besides that, it's really pretty good. A lot of reviews said it was frothy. I have found it to be smooth and creamy. Please see my video below. I used Califia Almond Milk and a banana. Nothing else.

The vanilla flavor is mild and you can notice the protein profile, but not as much as some other plant based protein powders. I drink this powder mixed with plain water or with a mix of almond milk and frozen fruit. Both get the job done and both go down easy. Keep up the good quality GOL.",
