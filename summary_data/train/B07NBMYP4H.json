The toe box style also provides more room and comfort for the toes. Altra makes a great sneaker, and that's why I have three pair in different colors.",

Front edge has a low partly rigid protective material which prevents from lifting up your big toe. price Could be nice from Altra to make a wider toe-box version with a more flexible cushion in the picture: v3 size 12(46.5) vs v4.5 size 11 (I've used size 12 due to the sole width problem in altra shoes)",

    "description": "Altra Paradigm 4.5 Running Shoes Delivering a stabilised ride with maximum cushioning, the Altra Paradigm 4.5 Running Shoes uses multiple technologies to keep your feet feeling happy no matter what distance you are covering. Engineered Knit Mesh Quick drying engineered knit mesh encases each foot in breathable comfort. The mesh allows air to fully permeate the entire upper, sucking in cool, fresh air while at the same time pushing out hot, muggy air. This system creates a microclimate within the shoes that allows you to feel comfortable throughout the run. Lightweight and breathable allows a more streamlined, comfortable run to reduce any unwanted bulk so you maintain focus. Furthermore, the knitted mesh features a much more closed knit providing structural integrity without the need for overlays that adds weight to the shoes. In addition, as you start to tire and fatigue kicks in during the longer runs, the Guiderail really starts to earn its place. The Guiderail works to keep your foot in the most natural position possible, preventing the early stages of overpronation. The footshape technology allows the toes to be relaxed and allows them to spread out naturally with the big toe remaining in a straight position for additional comfort, speed and stability. Lastly, a traditional lacing system adds familiarity and provides confidence to you, the wearer that you can rely on this system. The laces provide a nice snug and locked in fit which in turn prevents any in shoe slipping that can occur during high-intensity activities. Altra Ego Midsole The midsole unit uses Altra Ego which is a dual-nature midsole compound with a responsive, yet soft feel for increased energy return. the Dual-Layer EVA cushioning reduces the wear and tear placed on joints, lessening the potential risk of injury in susceptible areas. Secondly, the midsole features Altra's zero drop platform. Every Altra shoe features the Zero Drop Platform that places the heel and forefoot the same",
