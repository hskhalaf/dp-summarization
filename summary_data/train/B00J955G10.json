I fixed the broken poles by punching the broken tip out of the metal sleeve with a small screwdriver. Then you can break these small 1 inch sections of fiberglass off of the elastic string with a hammer or I used a flat wire cutter to split mine off. Worked great after that. Now they are the proper length. Another tip is don't stake the corners tight, causing them to tear out. Other than that this is a great roomy, easy to assemble tent.",
