When the batteries died, in the closed position, we had to destroy the safe to get the contents. This safe has backup features in case the batteries die. It is deep enough to fit everything I wanted to put in it. It fits flush enough to the wall that makes it easy to hide it. A great value for your valuables.",

I would not recommend this safe if you have expensive valuables you are looking to protect from thieves. The door does not seal tight and I would suspect a determined thief would be able to pry the door open. I lined the metal shelves with a rubber mat similar to what you would put in your tool box. This helps to keep items in position so they don't slide when you open/close the door.",
