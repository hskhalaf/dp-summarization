Its been years since I had a subwoofer in a vehicle and finally decided to go w/ something shallow mount and a decent amp. I'm very impressed with the output from just a 10 in such a small box. It's underneath passenger side rear seat in 2006 F150 FX4 SCREW. It was a little tight on the hump side in the middle, but it fits and sounds great.",

It\u2019s perfect for my car and personal taste. However, if you like extremely loud/bassy bass this may not be enough for you. I have not had any problems with it whatsoever.
