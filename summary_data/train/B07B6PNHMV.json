      "text": "I love these pills! My dog's vet told me that he had too much tartar on his teeth and suggested to have them cleaned at the next visit. Apart from being expensive, putting my pet under anesthesia for the cleaning worried me more than a bit. I tried brushing his teeth however it was almost impossible, as he doesn't make it easy on you. After using these pills for a couple of months, my dog's teeth look great. I have checked them out and there is no plaque that I can see. Furthermore, there is no bad breath and his teeth are clean and have a nice clean gum line. I'm surely getting more of this product.",

      "text": "My golden retriever had the sweetest breath as a puppy and by 3 years his breath was like a sewer. I initially tried 3 pills a day, which is correct according to the label, but he did throw up a few times so I was suspicious as to the cause of this although his breath had improved. I give him just 1 pill a day now and mix it in with his food and everything is great. I think for some dogs it might be very important to mix it with their food and not give it alone several hours after the stomach has emptied.",

His breath no longer stinks either. We will always use this on him and any other dog we get in the future.",
