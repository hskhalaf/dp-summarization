The variability and mechanics of this game are great. The instructions are fair. I read them several times and there were a handful of times I had to consult Boardgame Geek for clarity. No big deal. The components are also very good. The only problem I have is my wife keeps beating me:) I highly recommend this game. If you are new to 7 Wonders, like I was, watch some tutorial videos on Youtube. I found them very helpful. This is my new favorite game!",

That said, there is a ton of replay ability since the game \"board\" changes each time you play based on how the cards are shuffled, which cards were removed, which wonders each player selected initially (based on what was available), etc. Would highly recommends this to anyone looking for a game they can play one-on-one with someone (seems like so many games these days require at least 3+ or even 4+ players).",

The chance aspect in the way that the cards are dealt out combined with the drafting mechanic makes this game similar to pick up sticks in the drafting of cards. That combines with the natural flavor of 7 wonders makes this game a hit for my home. My wife and I have this game permanently station next to our table for a quick game before dinner or before bed. We love it.",

The downfall of the game is how much time you spend sorting the cards for the different ages and manipulating the play area. The cards are not holding up to the amount of flipping we have to do to reveal them. It would be 4 stars if it came with sleeves or more durable cards.",

In particular, the ability to purchase any resource from the \"bank\" at any time allows for the game to flow and not be locked up just because your neighbors don't have a resource, as in the original game. We played many times on our anniversary cruise, and we now have many memorable experiences to remember. The variety of end game scenarios really makes for variability in game play and overall experience. I recommend it highly, even if you've never played 7 Wonders but would like to play a really solid 2-player game.",

I probably won't bother sleeving this game like I normally do, as the game box insert holds everything very cleanly and the sleeves would probably prevent the cards from fitting in their slots.",
