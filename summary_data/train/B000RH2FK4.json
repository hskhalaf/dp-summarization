We have to keep it outside because the smell is so bad. The bowl looks cheap and it\u2019s overpriced. 2 stars because my daughter liked it, but really on,y worth 1 star in my opinion.",

Surprisingly, in just a few days the seeds had already started to sprout. However, after a few more days we started noticing a foul odor in the room (smelled like dirty laundry). The smell was strong enough to permeate my daughter's room. We quickly determined that the smell was emanating from the garden. I have no idea what is causing the smell but we had to move the garden to a larger room where the smell is less noticeable. If the smell continues we'll need to throw the whole thing away.",

I followed all of the directions for planting the seeds including soaking them for 30 minutes. The grass sprouted in a few days but it seems there either isn\u2019t enough soil or the tray is too shallow. The roots are so strong that the seeds are no longer covered in soil.

She immediately set to work painting the pot, and had so much fun painting all the little pieces, planting the seeds, and watching it all grow. This is a perfect gift for the fairy-loving girl in your life. Quality is good, and instructions are easy to follow... for the adults who want to. Of course the kids just start in on it, which is the way it should be.",
