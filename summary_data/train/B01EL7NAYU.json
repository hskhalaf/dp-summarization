Let's face it, nobody is drinking out of old fashioned whiskey glasses anymore, those plastic stir sticks aren't cutting it. This is for the \"I save Big Buddy's specifically for Martini Monday, Tequila Tuesday, Whiskey Wednesday, 30-pack Thursday, and Fireball Friday\" gang (Dilly, Dilly). And for those of you Not-so-early-birds, they also work wonderfully for stirring coffee thermoses (whether it's a creamer or a Bailey's kind of day). No stains on these - unlike the multiple dinner spoons I've wrecked on coffee.",
