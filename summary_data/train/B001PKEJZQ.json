I have an expensive professional Nikon setup ($3,500.00) with multiple lenses that is wonderful, but this camera delivers quality shots rapidly and with very little effort. It is much faster at the draw than my expensive setup because you never have to change Lenses. (I keep it in my truck so I never miss a Virginia wildlife shot) The Zoom is 26-624mm Optical, so you have a wide range to go along with the image stabilization and the quality 12.1 Megapixel pictures. It turns on quickly and works as it's supposed to.",

Have found use the tilting LCD screen a real aid to shooting in crowds and \"candid/subject unposed\" shots. I'm still discovering features. I recommend this highly for those who don't want to step up to a DSLR. I caught it on a day when the price was in the high 200's. Still a great camera at higher price.",

I specifically got it to take pictures of my children especially when they have performances and I need to zoom. It is obviously a little bulkier than my digital so I will not likely take it to disney or anything, but to take pictures at my childs birthday party or take it to the park for snap shots it has had amazing quality!! I love it! Exactly what I wanted. I am still figuring out all the features of what it can do but am impressed so far.",
