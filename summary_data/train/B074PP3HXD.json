      "text": "Great quad!! I love mine and hands down wouldn't think twice buying one again. Immersion makes great products and this quad is a testimate to that reputation. Planning on many many many more flights with this quad in the future. I agree with another review the props how like a banshee but I kind of like it. I have 3 more brands props to try out as well but for now it stays just how it was out of the box and flies like a dream. Setup was unbelievably easy. Booted, went through the menus with my transmitter and was ready to go in 5 minutes.",
