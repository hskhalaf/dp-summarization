      "text": "After reading all the horror stories of box fans causing barn fires, I decided to replace ours with sealed motor fans. Ordered four of these and easily installed them myself high over the stalls. The fans are not exactly quite but they sure move a lot of air. I like them being up over the stalls, out of the way, they are nice looking (as far as fans go) and I like knowing the horse dust isn't going cause an issue in the motors. I'm pleased to have found and purchased these fans. Shipping from the seller was very fast. As for the noise levels of the fans, well, I don't sleep in the barn and the horses don't care.",

Not only did the fans help my horses cool down, they actually kept those nasty biting flies off of them! No worries about fans heating up! Not a fire hazard!",

Up north you deal with snow and ice but in Florida we deal with heat and humidity and this fan has definitely helped. I am debating on purchasing a second unit since my garage is so large but I would definitely recommend this fan for the amount of air it moves and the price.",

Heavy duty long cord and solid pull chain. However, I am plugging and unplugging the cord to tun on and off to minimize chain pull wear and tugging on the fan because it\u2019s mounted on the ceiling. Definitely a good purchase.

Now it works as it should. Who knows how many were assembled in this way.",
