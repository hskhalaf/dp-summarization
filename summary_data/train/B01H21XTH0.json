We put the 10 lb glass diamonds on top of the lava rock so there is full coverage with no lava rock showing. Maybe having the lava rock on the bottom helps avoid the cracking that many of the reviewers comment about. I would definitely recommend.",

I bought the amber glass (can't remember what they called it) when the fire is on it looks like the fire glass is wet and melting on top plus the glass reflects the fire so it looks like it's burning. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's beautiful!!!! It might take. more than one bag. I ended up having to order a second bag.",
