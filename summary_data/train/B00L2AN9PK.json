      "text": "We've been using this mousepad for over a year. I use it with a Logitech M720. For some reason, which I can't figure out why, the texture of this mouse pad eats away at the rubber/plastic bottom to my mouse. Everything is clean - it's not mold or debris. The bottom of my mouse has been worn smooth. The black spots on the mousepad can easily be scraped off - and it comes off sort of in the same way that the scratcher on a lottery ticket does. So it's easy to clean - but it just comes back immediately. It looks gross enough looking that I'm probably going to end up getting a different mouse pad, which is unfortunate.",

The smell went away after 2 weeks, but it was quite acrid and it took me a while to realize there was not construction happening nearby, it was just the mouse pad off-gassing. Not ideal, but it was so cheap i can't complain. Good value overall. Update: I completely forgot that the pad was off-gassing because it did go away completely. :-) Great pad and months later, I'm very happy with this purchase.",

It takes some extra effort to push it out of a stopped point, which means the target is overshot once it becomes unstuck.

The mouse glides over it and almost never (for the mouse cursor on the screen too) looses contact with the pad. The only reason I took one star off for ergonomics was that it's the standard size, bigger would be useful (for me). The best (functioning) mouse pad I have ever had in over 30 years of computer usage.",
