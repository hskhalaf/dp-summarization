I wanted something smaller, easy to move around, that could double as a seat or table, and sealed well. I love it. The directions were easy to follow. But notice that you are recommended to wear gloves, so you don't pinch yourself snapping the pieces together. And it does take a little patience because they really do have to be pushed into place with a little strength so that they completely snap into place. I posted some photos for an idea of how much it holds and the scale compared to a dining chair.",

The picture I shared shows our 30 foot pool hose coiled up inside. There is still tons of room left. I ordered the second one to store the pool chemicals and the vacuum in. All if it could have easily fit in one container...but I don't like to have to move things to get the hose out and to put it away. These will be a great addition to our pool deck. Great for storage and gives us two more chairs too.",

I only gave it a 4 for sturdiness only because not sure how it would hold up if a heavy person sat on it a lot. If you don't use it for that, I would say sturdy. Someone who is not heavy can sit on it for short periods of time I would think, just could be hard on it if done regularly I would think.",
