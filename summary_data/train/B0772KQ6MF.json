      "text": "This might be more of a review of my child, instead of the product. Started my two year old skiing this year. First time up we rented proper skis with bindings. He had a blast, was very balanced, and wanted his own pair. We ordered him this set thinking \"whatever, he's not on the black diamond slopes, so ....\" The quality of the set is excellent, and the poles are safe for toddler use. The problem is that the binding provide no support. I think my kid was actually using the bindings to lean against and balance. He couldn't stand up, ergo he hated these skis. If your kid can handle the bindings, this is a great deal.",

      "text": "My daughters (ages 5, 4, & 2) got these skis for Christmas and they are adorable! It was so fun to see them enjoy winter! Especially because in Minnesota, we have A LOT of winter! I can see the girls spending lots of time around the yard and in the neighborhood park skiing. My two year old was able to pick it up quickly and had a blast! My five year old is tall for her age so the poles are a bit short, but it didn\u2019t stop her from enjoying herself. These are perfect beginner skis to introduce a love of skiing and outdoor winter sports! Totally recommend.",

His snow boots fit well and they have a pre-made hole in the tips so we added a string to keep his skis together. Only downside was that we pulled on one of the straps and the clip broke off. We were able to tie it and make it work. Hopefully it works again for next time!",
