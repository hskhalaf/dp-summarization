This cleans deep into the cracks and groves. Removed years of grim off in minutes. Took off some stains I could not believe came off. Well worth the money, so pleased I purchased the gal size to finish the interior. The cloths in this kit are fantastic, wish they were available to purchase separately. 5 stars",
