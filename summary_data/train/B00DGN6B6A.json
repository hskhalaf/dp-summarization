The containers are large enough to comfortably hold the almost 32 lb. bags that I bought so I don't need to worry about storing left over dog food anywhere else. The lids fit securely and latch, which keeps the dogs from nudging them open and helping themselves. The lids are hinged, so they can be opened completely without falling off. Very good quality for the price.",

Unfortunately, the lid is a REALLY poor design; it's concave AND has a recessed trench around the perimeter, so it collects a ton of water and it's very hard to get that water out of the trench. This is problematic for a few reasons; 1) even if you lean the container over before opening the lid, some water always still trickles into the previously dry inside area and 2) the pooling water is a constant breeding ground for mosquitoes, so I'm now tasked with remembering to tip it over after every rainfall.",

      "text": "This container serves the function for which it was purchased...it keeps open bags of dog food from cluttering my pantry. What it doesn't do is seal air tight because the plastic latch on the front has never functioned properly. The plastic tabs fit into their corresponding holes on the lid, but the fit is so loose that any amount of jiggling causes the latch to just fall off. I tried to get it to stay numerous times before I gave up. It still keeps my dogs from nose-diving into bags of food, but if the container was knocked on its side it would spill kibble everywhere.",

The second thing I noticed right off the bat was there are only three wheels in the package instead of the four as stated.",
