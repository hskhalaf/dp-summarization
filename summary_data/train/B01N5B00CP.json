Cons: The lack of a completely removable hood. The McMurdo III has this, so it's puzzling why it wasn't done on the Gotham III. Also seems to run a bit big.",

Also, contrary to another reviewers comments, it does in fact have an inside zippered pocket! It's very warm and lightweight and easily handles 20 degrees before having to layer.
