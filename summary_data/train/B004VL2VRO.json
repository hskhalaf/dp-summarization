First the we replaced the battery, then the charging cable wore out (it's pretty stiff) over time by the connector that goes into the monitor. Since it broke on a Friday night and Motorola's customer service was closed on the weekend, we couldn't wait 3-5 days to get a replacement. So we bought a replacement cord at Radio Shack. Then the female piece for the charger broke so we effectively couldn't charge it anymore. Overall it's a great investment for one kid but it might breakdown past one year of usage.",

My guess is that people will care more about changing volume than camera orientation--and at night--no one wants to fiddle with the menu keys. ALSO--and here is the killer--my WiFi keeps interfering with the camera--which causes it to TURN off with an audible alarm/beep. Totally uncool.

They should have used a Li battery in my opinion. Other issue is that in night node, the IR LEDs will completely illuminate and render s opaque any (otherwise see-through) mesh, for instance on the side of portable cribs or play-pens. This requires the camera to be mounted with a downward view instead of a side view, but is an issue with physics, not with this or any camera that uses IR illumination technology.",

Just wish they had the belt clip. The kickstand is better than other mostly because the rubber feet on the bottom keep it from sliding around on your night stand at night. Trust me, that is a pain.",

      "text": "We bought this to replace another Motorola monitor that had lasted approximately 3 years. We also needed another camera b/c of the addition of another child, so this bundle seemed to fit our needs. We've had this product for just over three months and the port for the charger is now malfunctioning. If you actually hold the jack at just the correct angle and pressure, it will charge the monitor. Otherwise, the battery will drain. Of course we are now two weeks past the return deadline. Unacceptable for $180.",

I live in a 3 storie house and the range covers the whole house. The only thing missing is a clip to be able to carry it around hands free. For those living or moving to Europe it is CE compliant.",
