Airbags deployed, things in the car went flying, etc. My SUV was totaled, the SUV that hit us was totaled. My kids, ages 5 and 7, both harnessed in Britax Frontiers, walked away scared but completely unhurt. When I had to replace the accident car seats there was NO question what would replace them. These car seats protected my kids and allowed them to walk away from a serious accident. I cannot express how thankful I am for this company and their car seats.",

The back of it where the belt runs back and forth will rub against your car's seat and make it very hard to adjust the strap when the weight of your child is pushing on it. The solution is to get a thin piece of MDF the height and width of the back to sit behind the Britax so that there is a smooth surface between it and your car. Britax could easily fix this by just having a piece of plastic protecting the belt, but they choose to save 50 cents and make you run to home depot and do it yourself. Frustrating!",

Only differences are that the Pinnacle is 3.5 inches wider and that it has the SICT (Side Impact Custion Technology) which is the main reason it is so much wider. Also, the Pinnacle is significantly more costly. More info on the Britax Frontier vs. Britax Pinnacle: [...] I am not affiliated with Amazon or Britax.",

      "text": "I was reluctant to order this because I've been unhappy with the way the fabric held up on my convertible Britax, but eventually the safety ratings won me over, and I have not been disappointed. First of all, it's attractive. Solid feeling. The fabric is easy to wipe off, more like that on the infant carriers than the awful velvet stuff on the convertibles. It took about 5 minutes to install with the LATCH system, and no time at all to adjust to my son. It seems comfortable for him, and I love that it has two cup holders. Overall, I honestly think it's worth the extra $$ when compared to the cheaper competitors.",

As such, moving it from car to car is very difficult, and bringing it on a plane is next to impossible, given the weight. Also, I wish the arm rests were padded. As well, the safety strap that goes into the car brackets is not very long, barely fits into my accord and I had use effort in order to get it to fit.",

She is in the 90th percentile for height but only the 15th for weight, so we were unsure which car seat would suit her best after she was no longer comfortable in the toddler seat. She loves this car seat and is very comfortable in it. She and I both love the cup holders. The seat converts to a seat with just a back without the five-point harness and then to just a booster so we can get years of use out of it.",
