But how completely stupid to design a screen size which doesn't qualify for free basic MS software. The snag is MS's small print that Office software (free to tablets 10.1 in screens) isn't free to 10.5 in screens. This is an error on Samsung's part not negotiating effectively with MS. I don't want to pay 5.99 or 7.99 a month to use MS office 365 when it isn't fully compatible with MS Office 2010 on my desktop.",

I understand there might be a follow-up S5 model, but this one is what i want anyhow. Doesn't come with a cover, so you should order one. I put a 256GB SD card in this and it works nicely. Screen is excellent and sound great too for movies. Battery life good. My only quibble is that it comes with loads of useless Samsung crapware installed, some things you can uninstall or disable but many of the Samsung core apps CANNOT BE STOPPED OR REMOVED. THis is most annoying. Hey, but all makes do this :-/",

Also the tablet has a different connection for charging so only the lead supplied can be used. Although these seem like minor points they start to become a nuisance pretty quickly. I buy Samsung tablets because the leads were interchangeable so annoyed this is no longer the case. Hence the 3 stars overall",

The processing speed is comparable to my old Z2 so it feels a bit worthless. There are others with more novelty features, on reflection I think that the tablet with a projector built in would have been a better purchase.",

Having used it for a day, there are differences with my old Samsung tablet (tab 10 pro) but they're good differences. It's much easier to open multi apps and change between them. This device is lighter and easy to hold but I don't think you can add a cover for extra protection. Uploading is the same and quicker but restrictions on notification tones limit some customisation. Overall very happy with it but time will tell whether I will feel this way in the future. Would have loved to get a pale blue device but they don't do that colour.",

Processing power. REALLY good. Playing high level games that used to be on PC. USB. Charging, phones, whatever. Really good. But the absolute iPad killer is the expansion port. Unlike an iPad, I've just dropped a half terabyte micro SD for storage. Oh and it's really good for work. And it weighs less than some sandwiches I've bought. Buy one quickly!",
