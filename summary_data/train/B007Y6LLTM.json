I wish there was a lemon law that would force them to buy it back because why would I want them to replace parts that will fail again?!!",

The power flow is crazy awesome, my only negative is once it\u2019s engaged you have to shut off water flow to return to regular. Should have bought this moen to start with.

It comes with a battery pack which you have to mount, and I'm assuming the more you use the sensor feature, the sooner you'll have to replace the batteries. You can have it hardwired, but you have to have an electrician to do that in addition to a plumber. Also the sensor to the left of the faucet gets unintentionally activated if you reach across under the faucet w/your left hand to turn the faucet on. Not a biggie, but just somewhat annoying.",

(Unlike the plastic hosed ones that these replaced.) The faucet has a swivel head so the stream/spray can be directed at an angle which often eliminates the effort of having to bend a hose to direct a spray. The spray is very strong, and when you actuate the turbo button (or whatever they call it) the spray is fantastic! It has a beautiful finish and a lifetime warranty. I couldn't ask for more.",

What the instructions do not tell you is that the faucet needs to be open before you give it power again, so it can go through it's cycles. So my wife proceeded to do the dishes after dinner and AGAIN the faucet would not turn off!!!",

I do not recommend this as I think it will drive many of you crazy. If I could exchange it for another Moen faucet I would.",

Moen sent a new black box that they told me would fix it and that cost $200 to put in and it did not fix the issue. Then, month later continued to go on and off continuously. Finally, I just asked for faucet with no sensors, which is half the price. However, now I have a long wait to receive it an and no water in my kitchen sink. It is terrible! I wish i never bought this product, so much money and effort wasted on sensors that do not work!",

My biggest problem is with the lower pot sensor. I can never tell just where the area is that turns it on so when I'm cleaning the sink, it will come on and soak my arm until I move.
