Indeed, this footgear is a standout thanks to its adorable aesthetics, A-grade comfort level, and jaw-dropping lightness. It is just unfortunate that the criticism it received\u2014its baggy interior\u2014might be viewed as a real cause for concern by some. Nevertheless, the Montara III eVent shoe by Ahnu has more than enough qualities to be considered quite the capable hiking companion.",

      "title": "Loved these shoes!",
      "text": "I tried over 20 pairs of hiking shoes for my Machu Picchu and The Gallapagos trip. These were perfect! I was familiar with this brand (another pair helped me walk all over Italy). These shoes were the perfect combo of function and style. I got them because I was told it was the rainy season where we were going, and I would need something waterproof....but it ended up not raining. The best advice I can give is something I read somewhere.... shoes should feel good the moment you try them on. So glad these guys made the hiking a joy! Can't wait for my next adventure with them!",

Could be that they felt too stiff. Could also be that the lace grommets didn't really allow me to properly tighten my boot. I just wasn't going to take a chance on keeping them and having them hurt my feet on long walks. Too bad. I really like Anhu shoes and Vibram soles.",
