I bought these bags to replace the CLC bags I use to get from Home Depot 8 or so years ago. These are very close to the same bags. Those were GREAT bags. These bags are good, not great. The inner seams on the pouches wears out, creating holes. Holes equals tools falling through. Also, my Malco sheet metal hammer sometimes falls out of the hammer ring. I probably won't get these again. How this helps.",

Please note I am a homeowner and a retired guy that helps with Habitat and other people's projects. Therefore if you are a heavy everyday user, I cannot comment on how well it will work or hold up for you. But this is certainly built well enough and has enough functionality for my use.",

I wear a size 32 & there was no way. On the very last belt loop it fit a little loose & was a real problem with the weight of tools. Also, the excess belt ran out almost 2 ft with nowhere to fasten it to keep it from flapping around. I had to drill a new hole & cut the excess off, then cauterize the frayed end.",
