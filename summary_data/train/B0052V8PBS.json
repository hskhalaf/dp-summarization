      "text": "This Sanitaire Vaccume has so much suction. I wanted one with no attachments. It makes it so easy to go under furniture and I like the 12\" width because it will go between dining chair legs. It's so easy to use and the handle lays flat so you can get under furniture.Also liked that you don't have to replace the whole roller brush after with yrs. of use. You can order the brushes and slide them into the roller bar for upkeep after they wear down.The power cord is so long I can plug in and vacuum my 1800 sq feet home and more with only 1 plug in.Just love it! And my husband Agrees.",
