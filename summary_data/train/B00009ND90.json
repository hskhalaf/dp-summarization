      "text": "I purchased this pan bc it is stainless steel and wanted to make poached eggs. The prodoct works pretty good for that purpose. Even with a lot of butter, ghee, or other oil, the eggs do become stuck easily. However, that is to be expected considering it is stainless steel, not stick-free. I actually like the pan so much, I remove the poacher part and use it as a basic pan. Verh pleased with this purchase considering I couldn't find another stainless steel poacher that didn't have all the chemicals associated with the non-stick pans.",

Next, the egg cups are impossible to empty because the plastic holders get so hot you can't pick the egg cups up until your eggs are cold. Very bad design. Loved the idea of having a nontoxic egg poaching pan but I will live without if it requires burning my hand and fingers each time I use it.",

The quality of build is very good, and by the way, the handle looks like it's attached in a way that will last for years. Conclusion, a high quality product that does all it is designed to do.

      "text": "All stainless steel, no teflon. Other teflon poachers eventually scrape off into your food. Eggs slide out - no stick, just make sure the water is boiling and the cups are already hot when you add the butter and eggs. It's great for family breakfasts with the 5 cups. The best egg poacher I've owned!",

The pan has good weight to it and as long as you give the cups a little swirl of butter or olive oil, the eggs come right out without leaving a mess.
