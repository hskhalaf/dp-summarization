      "text": "My mother side of the family is French and I thought that I would attempt to embrace my heritage. My mother made us crepes all of the time as kids. I loved them and still love them. This crepe maker is divine. Thank god it is non-stick because I do not have the crepe making skills as my mother and I tend to screw up two out of the three crepes that I make. In time I hope to become a pro. ;) You will love this to make crepes, or even to have as an extra griddle for eggs or pancakes.",
