It's larger than many soap dispensers so I won't have to fill it as often. It's sits very sturdy in the holder - the quality is excellent. The pumping action gives you just the right amount of soap. I absolutely recommend this!",

Would have rated five stars if it wasn't for that, but I can handle dealing with it.",

I will update my review if any problems arise. Update Feb 2017: It finally broke and rusted, so I threw it away. According to Amazon, I bought this 4 years old. I guess that's not so bad, right? It lasted a few years.",

If you use a larger handled toothbrush, however, do be aware that it won't fit in the smaller holes.

The very minor downside is the opening for the tube of toothpaste isn't quite large enough to accommodate the largest size tube of toothpaste. Actually the upper half of the large tube fits fine, it's the wide flat bottom of the tube that's slightly too wide. Since we still have 3 large tubes of toothpaste to use up, I simply fold the bottom sides in and crease them until they stay in place. Will buy the next tube size down next time though.",
