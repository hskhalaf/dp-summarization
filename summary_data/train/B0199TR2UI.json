They work just the same as the clapper paddles used in our dojang for a fraction of the price that they sell for in the local shop. I am extremely pleased with the durable construction of these clapper paddles and I am happy to have purchased them.",

So many colors to choose from, but we picked red cuz it's easy to see, and then easier to kick!!",
