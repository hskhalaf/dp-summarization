Iams Perfect Portions was the answer. He gets Iams UTI Protection kibble in the AM and the 3.4 ounce wet in the evening. He just devours the wet and grazes on the kibble during the day while I'm at work. He's happy, healthy, and UTI free after six months. He hasn't had any emesis from Iams wet products. I'm a pharmacist in RL and understand nutrition and additives. He's doing great and I have zero questions about the goodness of Iams products. Ty Iams for keeping my best friend healthy.",

Do you have to make your customers miserable along the way?",

That might just be my thin old-lady skin, but it's a safe bet that i'm not the only old lady with cats to feed.
