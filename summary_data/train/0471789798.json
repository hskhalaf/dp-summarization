Having worked as an accountant for many years, this book was challenging but useful. I would definitely NOT recommend it for the neophyte in the accounting world. One of my pet peeves is books which have numerous typos. Having read the second edition of this book, I found way too many typos to be acceptable. This forces the reader to try to figure out what the author is trying to say rather than trying to grasp the content of the book. This is truly distracting and unnecessary.",

For the small non profit what these books all say to do is unreasonable. The average board member has difficulty understanding a simple P & L.",
