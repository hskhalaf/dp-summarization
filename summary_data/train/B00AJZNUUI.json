Only suggestion for others here is be sure to follow the set up instructions slowly and carefully. We may end up buying a second controller, although it is not that inconvenient to share the one that came with the bundle. We do not care that the Wii Mini does not have internet capability, as we only intend to use it to play games at home ourselves. Something else to get us up and out of our chairs and moving. We find it lots of fun!",

Amazon was fine with the order and shipping; just am disappointed in Nintendo not supporting older game consoles.... always forcing you to buy another BRAND NEW MODEL, which is usually worse than you had and makes your previous games obsolete. I see this one is now an \"obsolete item\" too.",

The only difference is that it doesn't offer Internet access for online game play. My kids are young and personally don't want or need to play online. Graphics are great.",

So if u want a game console thats not that good but is cheap id get this. If you want something more advanced like I did dont get this",
