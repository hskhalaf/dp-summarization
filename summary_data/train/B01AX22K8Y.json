My husband purchased these for me and I have been wearing them whenever I have tennis shoes on. I am so surprised at how much they have helped! My pain has improved significantly. I do warn you, do not wear them constantly when you receive them. The first day I wore them all day and my toes got sore. Now, I wear them an hour or so a day and that is enough to give me pain relief.",
