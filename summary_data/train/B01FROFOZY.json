I NEVER keep anything with Xylitol in my house as it is HIGHLY toxic to dogs. Ingesting even a little Xylitol can be fatal to dogs. I immediately wanted to return it, but found that it is ineligible for return. So disappointing. I really wish that Xylitol would go out of fashion. I have 5 little dogs, so it just isn't worth the risk to keep the stuff in the house.",

The taste is pleasing, with a bit of a bitter natural mint aftertaste. The toothpaste works fine with our Braun electric tooth brush. The overall mouth feel after brushing is comparable to an SLS toothpaste. There is no salty aftertaste. Overall, someone switching from a traditional toothpaste would find the transition very easy. Except for the lack of foam, the experience is very much the same.",
