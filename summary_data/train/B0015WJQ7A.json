The seller I used (not Etymotic) on Amazon would not even address my question but I went straight to Etymotic and they sent me a pair of the larger sized ones immediately. Free. That's a company that stands behind their product! I would definely buy these again but would go directly to Etymotic to do so and avoid these resellers who may not care.",

After reading a bunch about how earplugs are necessary for concert-going if you want to save your hearing, and how these headphone in particular just \"turn down the volume\" without distorting the sound, I was pretty excited to try these out at a Red Rocks show. But they totally took me out of the experience. Rather than turning down the volume everywhere, it only did so well in the low-mid ranges. Sure I could still hear people talking, but all the high tones from the show were completely muffled out and the sound of the music was completely changed. Add in that you can't return these, and I would steer far clear of getting these earplugs.",

You can barely tell the difference in sound quality between when you're wearing them vs when you pull them out. Unfortunately, they provide almost no protection. I could hear a slight volume difference between when I had them in vs when I pulled them out but it was very slight. I tried seating them differently and pushing them in more (ouch) and nothing helped. I left the concert with ringing ears. If they had a 40DB model I might try that but either 20DB isn't much protection or these aren't providing that.",

    "description": "Hearing loss from loud sound affects millions of people, but noise-induced hearing loss is preventable! ETY-Plugs are the world\u2019s first ready-fit, high-fidelity earplugs that reduce sound levels evenly while preserving sound quality and clarity. ETY Plugs replicate the natural response of the ear, so sound quality is the same as the original, only quieter. Music and voices are clear--not muffled--making ETY Plugs ideal for concerts, clubs, theaters, aircraft, construction, yard work, airshows, parades, and athletic or motorsports events. The standard size fits the majority of ears. ETY Plugs are reusable, but with repeated use, the eartips may lose elasticity. For best performance and retention, if you use your ETY Plugs frequently, replace them every 3-6 months. ETY-Plugs are not recommended for use with impulse noises such as gunfire, or for sleeping or swimming.",
