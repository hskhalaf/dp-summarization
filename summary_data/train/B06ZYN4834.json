This is a lifesaver and a back-saver for me. It is easy to slip under her when she is lying down and does not slip to her belly when i walk her. My girl weighs 155lbs and this is very sturdy and supports her. Thank you for great product that makes a difference in our lives!",

Make sure your are purchasing this from All Seasons or you will likely get the knock offs. They may work just fine for you but I much preferred the All Seasons \"Made in America\" product I paid for.",
