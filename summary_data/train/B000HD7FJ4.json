It cleans up nicely in the dishwasher. Has gotten too close to the burners on the stove a couple of times, but shows no sign of getting burned yet. Love that I can hang it with other utensils and find it when I need it. OH, learned that it works REALLY WELL for buttering the sides of bread you're going to make grilled sandwiches with or garlic bread!",

I love this particular OXO - it holds a lot of basting sauce/liquid, washes up like a dream and doesn't mess up the counter when you place it down between bastings. I use it for everything, not just baking. Will buy one with a longer handle for bbq.",

    "description": "Size:LargeHappy with your basting brush but unhappy with how it retains odors and clumps when you clean it? Try the OXO Good Grips Silicone Basting Brush, which works like a natural bristle brush but with the added conveniences of heat resistance, odor resistance and cleanability. Multiple layers of silicone bristles tackle all tasks. Gaps in the center bristles hold liquid as you transfer sauce from the bowl to the work surface, and tapered outer bristles let you baste poultry and roasts with ease. The silicone bristles are heat resistant to 600 degrees F so you can baste in a hot pan or on the grill, and the angled Brush head keeps bristles off the countertop. Cleanup is easy in the dishwasher, and these bristles won't clump, frizz or retain odors.",
