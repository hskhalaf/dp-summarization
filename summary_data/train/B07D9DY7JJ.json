Many have lauded the pair as being excellent shoes to wear daily due to its lightness and the superb material used to make this happen.The shoes are not waterproof though, something that many find a nuisance since the upper is made of leather. This problem can be easily solved though with a quick waxing of the shoes' leather. With a minimalist silhouette, a pair of Merrell Parkway Emboss Lace is a good addition to anyone\u2019s sneaker collection.",

They are a touch stiffer, but not too much, and are a suede leather rather than the tanned leather of my previous shoes. However, they are wonderfully comfortable, and I find I quite like the new 'intergrated' toungue. The tread is more aggressive, and will probably last longer. I would still prefer the old shoes, but these are still very good.",

The Vibram sole provides excellent grip and I have yet to slip. The laces stay fixed with just a single knot unlike many others I have used. I did get them waterproofed however as they may not be suitable in very heavy rain, however they got a lot of testing the week I got them walking 20,000 steps a day in Edinburgh during Autumn with lots of rain and my feet did not get wet at all. Highly recommend.",

They are a quality pair of shoes and having worn them for a few months they haven't disappointed.

Nice and wide in the forefoot, provides arch support, light and comfortable. Look at the styling, the tongue only opens on one side and the lacing is asymmetrical. There is a little stretchy band inside to help hold the shape which you can catch a little toe in. Anyway, I like the \u2018barefoot\u2019, no heel feel and the sole is grippy. I enjoy walking in these. I just wish there was a wider range for casual and maybe even smart wear.",

Fine for walking but they want to run! They are like a second skin, but if like me you have skinny feet you may need to find the right thickness of socks or a plain insole. The Nubuck uppers seem to work well with Nikwax so I expect them to be long-term waterproof and remain smartish. The real problem with these shoes is that no retailer seems to stock them so it's a case of buy and return if necessary.",
