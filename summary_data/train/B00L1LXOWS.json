      "text": "I had heard so many good things about these headphone in the sound department. Not so much for the build quality as a lot of people's headphones had broken. Mine have not broken since the purchase date, however they have encountered other issues. The sound quality started out EXCELLENT but as time went on the bass and treble (mostly bass) started to have major distortion after the volume level reached anything over 30% volume. Very disappointing for a $100 pair of headphones. I have now purchased the Audio Technica ATH-M40x headphones (which was one of my original choices but sadly I went with these headphones). Hopefully my pair was just bad set and it wont happen to any of you.",

I tried EQ to no avail. These headphones were supposed to upgrade my trusted AKG 240 Studio (made in Austria), but they reaffirmed the AKG\u2019s greatness.

Not impressed with Amazon's shipping method. The Grado's arrived unprotected in their flimsy retail box (one corner ripped open), with a UPS label stuck to it. They could have at least shipped them in a padded envelope. Thankfully, the headphones were undamaged. Highly recommended if you love music and on a tight budget.",

Unfortunately, the swiveling mechanism doesn't allow for much slack when considering components, and so the left side died after a month. Pretty cheaply made, not like Grado used to be (parents had some). I was looking for a replacement for my Sennheisers, which isn't as good as they used to be either, but it looks like I'll have to keep searching for a decent manufacturer of real headphones to drop hundreds of dollars on.

Brilliant highs, improved bass over earlier models and exceptional mids, the new e line sets the bar very very high for $200 non- noise canceling headphones. There may be more comfortable headphones but nothing compares to the sound quality of the SR225e in this price range. Pure, wonderful crystal clear sound. These are the ones to buy and I have sampled more headphones than I can shake a stick. You will hear things you never heard before. I am a bass player and have a very sensitive ear.",

The ear cups are free to rotate an unlimited number of times around the posts holding them to the headband. There is no strain relief on the wires going into them, and nothing to prevent them cups from twisting around and back and forth until they begin to fray through the wires causing them to occasionally inject static and then start dropping sound out. Even taking extreme care to prevent them from flopping and spinning around when taking them on/off this causes them to start failing in a year or two.",

I also have a set of Grado SR 80-e series, which cost about a third of the price of the SR325e. Are these 3X better than the 80's? I don't know; they're both terrific. If you're in the market for headphones and have a $100 budget, buy the 80's. If you can spend $300 without hurting your budget, get the 325's. Either way, you win. Grado RULES!",

These are also uncomfortable for me, but they sound so good I'm willing to remove them every 30 minutes and take a break. I love everything about these, of course mostly the sound quality. In my humble opinion they handle every genre with energy and aplomb. They don't \"pop\" for me or leave me stunned or speechless--but they're just so competent. I've tried a LOT of bad headphones over the years and these are keepers.",
