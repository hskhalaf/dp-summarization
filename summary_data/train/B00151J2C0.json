I usually wear 9.5 but Chaco's didn't have half sizes so I went up to 10, good thing I did, they fit perfect, so Chacos may run on the small side in length. Bought the wax teal color which is very pretty. A few reviews complained about the strap being long, and it is when you tighten up the strap, but for heavens sake just tuck it under and its fine.",

The arch support is excellent, but because the top of the shoe is very full--stops right in front of my ankle--I have kind of a hard time wiggling my feet into them. I think I need to buy a shoe horn. They do retain a lot of water once I'm out of the pool, but that's OK. Also, the people who left reviews about the adjustment strap being super long are right. Mine don't drag on the floor, but they're pretty close. Strange.",
