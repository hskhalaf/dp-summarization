I am not preggo at the moment so it's not pregnancy symptoms.

Yet again it could always be each person is different but I did extensive research and these were the best also have to buy DHA apart of these! Also I recommend drinking the pink stork 1-2 months before delivery. I had a 5 minute delivery lol so MAYBE it was these products IDK but worth a try!",

I had to switch to a different prenatal and only got about 1/4 way into this bottle. Just thinking about these giant pills still makes my cheeks tingle.",

They taste gross..Almost like a bitter vitamin C tablet or an Iron pill but you only taste it when you dont take it fast with water or juice. Love love love these pills. ill continue to take even after the baby is here.",
