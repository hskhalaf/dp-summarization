I bought this one thinking that it would probably have to be returned for that reason, but it's a keeper. As some of the reviewers have mentioned, the beaters don't go in or come out easily -- and sometimes shoot out and across the room -- but I'm getting the knack of that. It also doesn't balance on it's heel so it always falls over, but that's a small price to pay for a slow speed.",

It fully kneads two loaves worth of dough in about 4 minutes. 4/5 because the lowest speed is higher than expected and this reduces its versatility a little bit. the highest speed is fantastic for frostings, though, so it may be a fair trade off",

Went to the store to have a look, and lo and behold, some of those suckers weigh as much as a small bowling ball (how absurd - your arm would get so tired from holding them). Anyways, this mixer is relatively lightweight but still has plenty of power. I especially like the extra slow 1st speed, cuz it keeps the flour from flying all over the kitchen counter. Still haven't used the dough hooks - will post an update when I finally give them a try.",

It won't stand on it's end very well (tipping over). I find that I have to use my second hand to use the speed button (whereas I could adjust the speed with the same hand while using the mixer). That may sound trivial, but it isn't very convenient. And, as previously mentioned, the beater eject button does not work. I have to yank the beaters out of the mixer. This will be replaced.",

It would be better if the location of those two buttons were reversed. An up-and-down motion for the speed, with the capability of doing it with my thumb, would be much better.",
