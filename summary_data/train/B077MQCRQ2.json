The toes however were a bit too tight, so if I had changed them for another pair (smaller) the heels may have fitted but the toes would have been far too small. Shame, so I had to return them. They were fun though, lovely chunky laces and there was a pair of shiny ribbon laces enclosed as an alternative. Some people out there must find them to be great, they just weren\u2019t for me I am afraid. I hope my comments help people when choosing their size.",
