I've had many Harmony remotes and they've all worked perfectly right out of the box. This one did not come in a consumer package, but it did come in a Logitech logo cardboard box.",

However, the set-up can be problematic and requires tech support to access certain programming features. tech support is AWFUL. (2 calls over 140 minutes of hold time!) They say they will call back, but have never done so. And when the product fails (this is our second, both of which lost LCD function unexplicably; ie no drops, spills, or power surges), Logitech simply tells you to buy a new one from them with a 50% off coupon. Unfortunately, buying from them cost almost 2x as much as buying it from Amazon. Again, great product, but TERRIBLE support and problem response.",

The support suggestions indicated that the approach I should have taken (nothing like the written instructions)included taking out the battery before plugging the USB connector, turning off my virus protection, and trying an alternative web approach. None of these worked. After four hours wasted trying to make this work I gave up. Way bad for a consumer product.",

By simply pushing the \"help\" button, the remote asks you a couple questions, and your off and running again.

Every change or upgrade to the remote requires you to also disconnect the RF extender from your components and connect it to the computer as well as the remote. Battery life could be better. All in all this is a pretty good remote with a few problems. Firmware and upgrades will hopefully solve the problems.",

The 880 had a well known bug in the tilt sensor mechanism and charging cradle but the 890 does not have either of these problems.

Wireless updating would nice, as would bluetooth, especially given the price tag. The RF controller is an extremely useful accessory (included in box), as it allows everything to be hidden away in cabinets. Support for Linux would also be nice - currently the software is PC/Mac only. Overall though, I would recommend this.

I previously owned a Harmony 880 which is basically identical to the 890 but IR only. After 3.5 years the screen on the 880 is almost unreadable and the volume control is pretty much unusable so I gave this product a lower rating for durability. Not as big an issue with the 880 which is now under $100 but the 890 is almost 3 times that price and I will very dissapointed if I have to replace the unit in a couple of years.",

    "title": "Logitech Harmony 890 Advanced Universal Remote Control (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nImagine\u2026 controlling all your devices using only one remote - without a direct line of sight to the components! With the Harmony 890 Remote, you can wirelessly control your home entertainment system while hiding all those unsightly wires and components behind cabinet doors or a wall.\n\nLogitech's Harmony 890, an upgrade to the Harmony 880 remote control, uses both radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) wireless signals to deliver powerful complete control of your home-entertainment system that may be hidden behind cabinets. With a wireless range of up to 100 feet, the Harmony 890 remote sends RF commands to a wireless receiver, which then blasts infrared signals to the components. The Harmony 890 remote makes universal control for home entertainment and advanced lighting systems simple. \n\nUsing Your Harmony Remote\n\n1. Easy to set up: \nJust connect your Harmony remote to your computer and the Web wizard walks you step-by-step through a simple set up. Enter the model numbers of your components, then answer a few easy questions about how you \"Watch TV\" or \"Watch a DVD.\" Harmony lets you control even the most complex system without the hassle of programming complicated macros.\n\n2. Easy to use: \nThe Harmony Remote is the world's only remote with Smart State Technology\u00ae. Simply press an Activity button, such as \"Watch TV\" or \"Listen to Music,\" and your Harmony Remote automatically sets up each of the devices required for that activity.\n\n3. Easy to get help: \nWith the Harmony remote, you don't have to know anything about your entertainment system to operate it. No sound? No picture? No problem! There's even a handy \"HELP\" button to guide you through simple troubleshooting and get you back in control. \n\n4. Never out of date: \nThe Harmony device database includes 5,000+ manufacturers and 175,000+ devices, everything from HDTVs to DVRs, VCRs to lighting controls. It's constantly updated with new components and fine-tuned settings, so your remote will never be out-of-date. \n\nFeatures\n\nColor display\nBoth functional and stylish, with user-customizable backgrounds, button icons and text. Comfort-grip shape\nFor easy control.\nFully backlit\nEasily navigate in the dark.

Colorful icons accompany text on the LCD screen to allow for quick and easy command of home-entertainment equipment and household appliances that may be out of range for a traditional infrared remote. \n * Integrate up to 15 devices\u2014including lighting and household appliances. \n * Save energy! Each time a new activity is selected, the remote establishes the proper state of all of the components needed for the current activity, and turns off the components that are not needed. \n * Set it up in a snap with an advanced setup wizard. The online setup also makes it easy to update a remote when upgrading your home-entertainment system. The Harmony setup wizard does the programming, so you don't have to. Just connect your remote to your computer and answer a few questions about how you currently use your home theater. Logitech's patented Smart State Technology\u00ae does the rest. \n * Don't worry about using up batterieswith the rechargeable lithium ion battery. Store the remote on the attractive charging station when not in use. \n * Easily view and select.
