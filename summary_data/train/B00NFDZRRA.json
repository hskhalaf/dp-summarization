      "text": "This camera is amazing. I use it primarily for video but it can shoot photos as well. After a few weeks of use I must say that these nothing out there like this. I even customized what the buttons do. I switched the position of some buttons so that record and exposure lock are the same place as a 5dmk3. I also customized the back wheel so I can get quick access to video preview and iso. I also setup nfc to an old nexus tablet I have and when I take photos they automatically get stored in the nexus as a sort of backup HDD. You definitely get more than your money's worth with this.",

      "text": "Samsung really hit it out of the park with this camera. Even though video recording is h.265 instead of h.264, there are now several conversion programs that work great. Beware though, when you convert the compact h.265 files to, say Pro Res LT, the file sizes will increase considerably. But in almost every way, this is an awesome camera And Samsung seems to be responsive to users and supplying firmware upgrades (rather than making us wait for the NX2!) to improve performance. Limited by lens selection, but there are lots of adapters out there and the lenses that are available -- even the 16-50 kit lens -- perform admirably. Very sharp.",
