      "text": "We are keeping as a casual shoe because it fits very nicely, is well cushioned, a very flexible. Therein lies the problem, (flexible) . Purchased to play pickleball which needs a low grip bottom that this one has. (Less likely to tear up your knees with quick lateral moves.) I advanced and one shoe stayed on the court during two different plays. I could not tighten them anymore to allow them to stay on my feet. They allowed a little to much ankle movement. Saying all that, they are so VERY comfortable and look sharp for casual ware. They are a keeper for me but for reasons not intended.",

Ive never been able to put in this type of mileage. My legs would just feel, so beat down. The large foam bottom has trully change my life.",

      "title": "Very cushiony",
      "text": "FOR RUNNING REVIEW: Great cushion to absorb shock. Unless you tie them tightly your foot slides slightly causing warmth on the bottom of foot. The mesh is for forgiving and helps your foot breath. The lacing system is intriguing and hugs the midfoot area real well. When you tie them though, there is no area to snug the lacing around or through like conventional shoe lacing systems which leaves the laces long. I tied them very tight (preference) and they worked satisfactorily. Overall they are great for recreational running, not a LONG RACE....",
