I used it to lift the corner of a refrigerator to get a furniture slider under it (broken wheel), and the lifting edge bent! It's not made from a high enough grade of steel. Also, while I wasn't buying it for the furniture pads, they are made from very thin, flimsy plastic - nowhere close to the quality of the other furniture sliders I've purchased from other vendors. FYI, the return policy is 30 days, so I was unable to return it (didn't use it until about three months after purchase). Buy something else!",

The most dangerous thing is that swing plate that you wedge under the item to be moved. It needs to be an inch or so deeper so you can really get it under what you are trying to lift. Even the pads could be improved. You could use them as permanent carpet protectors under your furniture if they didn't have white backings on them. Paint 'em black guys and they would be better.",

I bought it to lift a heavy antique armoire, and the handle was a bit short for easy lifting, but I managed. I suppose one could use a steel pipe to extend it and provide more leverage, although that would reduce the available lift height. The lifter, combined with some 2x4 wood blocks, did the job well.",

After that, it was pretty easy to push the lever down and slip the sliders into place. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and glad I have this gadget in my tool box. It will make furniture rearranging much less daunting.",

I couldn't push hard enough, and when I tried stepping on it to lift it, I heard a lot of creaking and groaning, and was concerned that at the very least I'd end up with damage to my hardwood floors. So, we left the cabinet where it was. I'm still giving it 3 stars, and am keeping it, because I'm sure it will come in handy for some (lighter) furniture items. I can't really believe the cabinet I had weighed over 400 pounds, but who knows; I certainly can't weigh it, as I can't move it. ;-)",
