Dribbling with it feels smooth enough to be able to comfortably do what you want, and it's grip is secure enough that it doesn't just slip right out of your hand. Shooting with the ball feels natural and doesn't stick to your hand or causes any issues. Overall I would really recommend this ball for general or everyday use. These are meant to last.

After careful review, I choose this one because of all the positive reviews it had. Although I liked the price, I was initially leery about buying this one, as I wanted to get a really good quality basketball. However once my fiance and I received the ball, I realized I had made a great decision! I've always been told \"you get what you paid for\" but in this case, the quality was much more than I anticipated based on the price.",
