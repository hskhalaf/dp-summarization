I have two girls, a 5 month old and a 2 year old and they love it and mommy too! I like to take them on my walks on different terrains and they are very comfy and it's not heavy at all. The front tires have suspension which is great for dirt trails. The price is great if i compare to the Graco Ready2grow which is a little bit over $200.",

Worked fantastic for my 7 yr old and 3 yr old. Works great with my Britax Chaperone infant carrier too, in the back position. Snug no wiggle fit. The front position didn't work with my Britax, but that is okay since I wanted to be closer to the baby. The basket is very large and perfect for snacks, bags and stuffed toys, etc. Overall couldn't beat the price, quality and weight limits which are 50lbs in front and 60lbs in the back. Very happy.",

Not too bulky, sturdy, very easy to maneuver over sides walks, and most importantly simple to fold up and put away.",
