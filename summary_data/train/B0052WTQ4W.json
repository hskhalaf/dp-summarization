      "text": "After reading several good reviews of the Frogg Toggs suit, I was excited to purchase it and give it a try. Unfortunately it basically failed completely at what it was supposed to do. I drove 20 minutes on my motorbike to work in a light rain and had a fairly wet shirt as a result all the way down the front. On the way home from work that day I drove another 20 minutes in a fairly heavy rain and ended up with my front fully soaked from shirt to pants. The suit leaked horribly and did not keep me dry in the least. I cannot recommend this product and I plan on returning mine as soon as possible.",

I\u2019m proportionally built. I wear 16.5\u201dx33\u201d shirts. I wear 34\u201dx32\u201d pants. The jacket was loose fitting in the sleeves, chest and waist. The sleeve length was just right. The pants aren\u2019t snug, but they are just barely big enough to fit over another pair of pants and still have a little room. The length fit just right. I would prefer slightly roomier pants.",

They aren\u2019t exactly compact when folded up, but they fit under my seat with plenty of room for my other crap. Overall, this rain suit is superior to any suit that is supposedly designed for motorcycle riding, and about half the price. If this suit ever wears out, I\u2019m definitely buying another one",
