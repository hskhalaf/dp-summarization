The only con is it is hand wash only, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I have only worn once and haven't hand washed yet, so I can't comment on how long it will last.",

I am in love with this dress and will probably order some more!",

The large more than accommodated my chest so I think the medium will be fine in that respect. I like that the stretchy fabric on top is fairly thick and not see-through.",

Length is a tad short for my liking and not a big difference in the L vs XL. I will return one, just haven\u2019t decided on which one, yet.",

I bought black/taupe and mint/black. As one other reviewer mentioned, the mint is absolutely not mint. It's sky blue. There is nothing green about it. Looks fine if you like sky blue though.",
