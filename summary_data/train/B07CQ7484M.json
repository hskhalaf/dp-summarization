      "text": "I bought one of these as a backup for my existing Eero Pro (2nd generation) series, in case one of them goes bad, as I use the ethernet ports on my existing units. It's only a dual-band first generation unit, but at this price it's a good deal to buy them as backups or even get a few of them and set up your own system much more cheaply than buying a new system. They're refurbished and in plain packaging, as another reviewer has stated, but mine arrived in perfect shape with no scratches or blemishes of any kind on either the eero or its power brick, so they look brand new.",

      "text": "I already had an Eero system in place, with three remote devices. But as part of a troubleshooting exercise, one remote got moved to new location and we noticed a dramatic improvement in speed in one part of the house. So, when troubleshooting is over, and you have to return your remote to the original location - what can you do except buy one more unit? We didn't want to spend what was needed for a full cost additional remote. So we bought this refurbished one for about a third the cost. Works GREAT! Up and working easily and download speed in that location went from 15-20 Mbps to 120-150 Mbps.",

I was having an issue about a year ago where my computer would occasionally lose its connection, and eero support was OUTSTANDING in helping me troubleshoot the problem. I mean, they worked with me for 2 months monitoring what was going on (it only happened every few days), and finally replaced one of the units. (In the end, though, it wasn't a hardware issue, which we only discovered when we got the replacement and the problem continued; it was a settings issue, which had been fixed in a prior release.) BUY THE EERO FOR THE SUPPORT. It is an excellent product, but their support is second to none.",
