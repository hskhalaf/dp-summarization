I almost always love them (however sometimes the GTX versions are sized a bit off, and a pair of Tr12 are a bit less supple than I like). These were terrible. Very hard soles; not forgiving. The left shoe had an extra hard part on the right side just before the heel that felt like a misplaced rock guard/shank. There was also a sewing mistake under the removable foot bed that made this pair even worse. I will not give up on the model because I generally really like the fit and durability of most Excursions I have tried.",
