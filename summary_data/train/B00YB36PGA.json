      "verdict": "The Merrell Moab Edge is an amazingly comfortable, low-cut day hiking shoe that has top-notch durability, arch support and traction. It is a true-to-size piece of hiking gear that\u2019s exceedingly lightweight and breathable. Many people gave this footwear much praise for its versatility and almost non-existent break-in time. Some users, however, didn\u2019t appreciate the roominess of the toe box and heel zone, with the latter blamed for causing heel slippage. The flimsy stitching of the lace loops was also mocked by a very few.",

As usual with Merrell shoes, I need to go up a full size (I'm size UK 11 for most shoe brands but normally need size UK 12 for Merrell shoes). The upper of both shoes are now splitting in multiple places on both shoes (see photos) and I have not really worn them that much... see the lack of wear on the sole. I normally really like Merrell shoes but I am left very disappointed here.",

After 3 months the tread starts to thin and the comfort starts to fade a little. But they are still wearable for another 3 before tears start to form. What would really help is the ability to buy the insoles. They degrade before the shoe looks like a hobo's. Replacing insoles when the inside of the shoe is so perfectly contoured is harder than you would think.",

My only grouse is the fact that the sole is so thick, that when driving with them on, the pedals feel like there's a block of wood between them :) Brilliant otherwise!",

Some other shoes I have my feet feel worse after 3 hours than 10 in these. They are as durable as you could expect. After 3 months the tread looks thin, and the padding does not provide the same comfort. but i still managed to get another month and bit out of them. I replaced the insole after 3 months, which increased comfort but kind of ruined the nice arch support. 5/5 highly recommend",
