I mix this with a face moisturizer to help it spread more easily, as this is like trying to spread honey on your face. If you use more than a small bit, you'll not be able to blend in the whiteness. Definitely not for darker skinned people, unless you want to look very odd. I use a makeup sponge to blend it and I still look like a mild ghost. But it beats the chemical sunscreen. This will dry out your skin ifdomt wash it off at the end of the day. Also, hard to get off as it's water resistant.",

We were out under the California sun for hours at the beach and I had this cream on, topping up every hour or so - he did not burn - he did get a nice tan though! The cream has rich consistency - so you do need to rub it in well - it was challenging as he wiggles a lot. But, once it is on, it protects him very well. Smell wise, it is quite subtle and pleasant actually! I highly recommend this one!",
