This as other have said as well, is the nicest case I have had on my phone and is not bulky at all. The internal metal plate is a nice touch as the Ring attachments get old after a while. Simply an awesome case",

I\u2019ve dropped the phone multiple times on hard rocky surfaces and it has not caused any dents, scratches or breaks on the phone. My only complaint is the outer layer that wraps the case started to peel very early, ~2 months of use. At first it was minimal and wasn\u2019t too bad but since there have been about 10 different spots where it\u2019s begun to peel. From what I can tell all this layer does it provide it a more glossy look.",
