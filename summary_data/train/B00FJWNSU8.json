      "text": "Very fun game. Mortal Kombat is one of my all time favorite fighting games and this shares studios (and Scorpion!) so it's practically the same experience. Great fluid gameplay and solid fighting mechanics. The super moves are hit and miss with some characters having very visually appealing and over the top scenes play out while others have simple boring supermoves that seem like they were added in 10 minutes before the publishing deadline. This game may also represent the only time in history where Aquaman doesn't completely suck - in fact I see him as overpowered. Well played.",

This version has some additional content and it only makes the game even stronger. These player vs. player fighting games usually do not have a good story but this one has a pretty compelling story. The story within the game is similar to some of the storylines within the comics. The graphics within the game are great and most importantly the fighting mechanics are solid as well. If you like fighting game you will love this one. I would definitely recommend this game.",

I mostly got this because I don't have a PS3 anymore, and this came with all the DLC, so why not? The game lags an awful lot despite being a port. It actuallybotherd me a lot how much it lagged considering it's on a much more powerful system than the original. But, if you're a huge DC fan, you should enjoy the game. that's the primary reason I wanted this game. AS a fighting game, it's decent. Not much to say about it from what others already have. Better suited to casuals and just a party game.",

The characters and their moves are for each characters are authentic for the character from batman ad his counter moves to superman and his special moves, each character has their movies and their own fighting style. The story is good but short but the star missions extend things a little a lot and they can also be used as good training for the story and multiplayer. I have not played multiplayer yet but if it is anything like the offline mode it is good",

We expected more. There wasn't a whole lof of improvement from the PS3 edition in our eyes. I personally would recommend someone to rent the game then buy it and that goes for all games. Good luck and happy gaming to all! :)",
