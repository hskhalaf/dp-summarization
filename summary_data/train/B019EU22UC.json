You will be wasting your money. I've given these glove just about 16 hours of ride time and still very uncomfortable. There are hundreds of other products that are a much better choice than this.",

Good fit and definitely holds up to the heat of firing my rifle. All around use and very effective. I think most people reporting the tear on the wrist area are forgetting to undo the strap. It has two levels of wrist retention. The strap and another strap above the wrist. My guess. Make sure you properly UNDO BOTH before removing or putting on. That said the fit is so secure I could see them ripping if you take them on and off like this. Use your equipment properly for long life. A+",

Id honestly say i could have potentially fit a small in these if they offered them. I ordered the Black, but do like them enough Ill likely order the OD Green pair in the future.

Difference maker is the anti slip surface covers more space and the wrist strap is about covers more of your wrist. Too new to rate on the other factors but these seem very well made, initial quality gets a thumbs up. Recommend buying.",
