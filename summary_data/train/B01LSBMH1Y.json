With iPlugmate there is still a software defect on handling tif files for pictures. (They don\u2019t show up at all, although tif is included in product spec.) Also, there is a potential improvement to become more user friendly.

This left her with thousands of photos of her children all the way back to their births stranded on her deactivated phone. This flash drive has worked great and fast in transferring all her photos and videos so that they can be saved. She was especially happy that it works with both her Mac laptop and PC desktop! So now she has copies of all her photos and videos - as well as a mobile backup. It\u2019s got plenty of storage, speed and even looks good!",

The only downside was I had to be careful of the size of downloads. I have videos that are greater than 4 GB. Wish I could have gotten those on as well. I like the storage box it comes in, nice to keep and not lose the flash drive.",
