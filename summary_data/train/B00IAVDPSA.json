This little remote fixed most of those problems and I am now very happy. The remote works perfectly with Blu-Ray, FandangoNow, Netflix, Youtube & Amazon but not all the buttons work with Hulu & Vudu. The remote itself has a great matte texture, the perfect weight, nice button actuation and fits great in the hand. The only minor complaint that I have is that the Xbox button looks kinda cheap.",

If you have your Xbox inside an entertainment box, or otherwise partially or fully obscured, this remote won't work. And even if you have the console it full view, it is incredibly particular in how you have to point the remote to get it to work. The Xbox controller and most other modern remotes don't rely on this outdated technology, so I'm not sure why they went for it here while also charging $40 for it. It feels nice in your hand and is well designed otherwise, but the line of sight requirement is a total deal killer for me.",

      "text": "I originally bought an Xbox One media remote with a cheap knockoff design. The buttons didn't work consistently, it have to be aimed very carefully at the Xbox and generally wasn't useful as much as frustrating. This one made by Microsoft is so much better that I can't begin to explain it. It is reliable, it lights up when picked up or touched, it has a soft feeling to the surface, it fits the hand nicely. Only complaint with it is the all black design makes it disappear in the dark, especially with its small size.",

This remote is motion sensors and connects right away. We bought this awhile back now and still love it.",

(Y is usually search so thats still acceptable by scrolling to the top). I use this all the time. People have challenged me to try and use this one a game but no- not going to try that.",

Only thing that other people have disliked is that you actually have to point it to the xbox as you would with a tv remote. That's not too much of a problem for us though. Our puppy ended up eating and destroying this remote, but we loved it so much we had to order another one.",

Also, it would be nice to have the button names more closely align with the on-screen command options, which are designed around the controller. For example, a screen might tell you to push the red 'B' button to go back. Well, there is no 'B' button on this remote. Nowhere near as nice to use or as intuitive as a Roku or AFTV remote.",
