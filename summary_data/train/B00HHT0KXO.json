However they are NOT comfortable to sit in on their own. I'm 5\"2\" and my husband is 5'9\" and neither of us feel they are comfortable due to the weird angle. We have two cheapo plastic Adirondack chairs that are far more comfortable to sit in than these. So now that we've invested in four of these chairs, we are throwing more money at them and buying the ottomans and some lumbar pillows in an attempt to make them more comfy.",

The material it is made from does have a nice wood look with even slight color variations as naturally weathered outdoor wood furniture would without all the upkeep and splinters.",

That being said the assembly was not as easy as some of the reviews. We ended up going to our local hardware store to buy several of the longer stainless steel screws because the shorter screws did not catch. The protective packaging was spectacular. We highly recommend them.",
