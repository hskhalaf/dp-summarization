The 25 model was fantastic, lasted me over a year and felt great from the moment I put them on until the moment I retired them. Why mess with the formula? Walking and running are extremely important exercises to feel comfortable doing. I skipped the 26 model, and waited for the 27. The toe box on 27 is made of a cheap material that folds inwards, cuts into my big toes and causes blisters. The shoe looks great, but if I'm going to spend a small fortune for a top of the line running shoe, it better feel great, too.",

    "description": "Enjoy excellent comfort and advanced support with the GEL-KAYANO 27 running shoe. The redesigned mesh upper helps keep feet cool, while the sole is more flexible to help promote a more natural roll through the gait cycle. This starts in the heel with added flex grooves that assist in isolating initial impact to force a softer and smoother feeling at footstrike. At midstance, the foot should stop pronating and re-supinate for an efficient toe-off. To help this natural motion, we incorporate DYNAMIC DUOMAX technology to help support the foot and increase stability for runners whose feet roll inward too much (overpronate). The midsole also integrates SPACE TRUSSTIC technology, which provides stability and reduces the overall weight to help promote a smoother transition from foot strike to toe-off. This added stability is complemented by deeper forefoot flex grooves for a smoother roll through toe-off, allowing the shoe to move more naturally with the foot. Lastly, a large section of reflective materials in the rearfoot helps keep runners visible when running in low-light conditions. The GEL-KAYANO 27 model is an excellent choice for both competitive and noncompetitive runners looking for an everyday trainer that combines comfort with support.",
