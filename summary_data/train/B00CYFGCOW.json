Great buy though, I would definitely like to buy another one.",

You need a tablet or smartphone to get the most out of this Furby. They are very soft and fun and you can turn it off by pulling the tail for 10 seconds or at least leave it alone for a little bit.",

The furby is so much fun that my other brother also wanted one, so now that we have 2 they actually talk with each other.
