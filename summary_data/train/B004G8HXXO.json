      "text": "I bought this in February 2012 and it stopped receiving Wi-Fi four or five times, at least, became a horrible ordeal each time. The last time it stopped working, I called the 800 number and the automated answering service asked if I bought it in the last twenty-four months and no matter whether I said yes or no, the robot kept saying, \"I'm sorry. Did you buy it in the last twenty-four months?\" and I could never get past that. I emailed Panasonic and told them the problem, and they replied that I should call the 800 number! I'll never buy another Panasonic product nor will I recommend one, unless it's to an enemy.",

      "text": "I suppose this is a fine blue-ray player in the sense that it plays blu-ray discs and has wifi. But the interface is HORRIBLE. Specifically, it's excruciatingly slow. Push a button on the remote, wait anywhere from 2 to 10 seconds (yes, I said 10 seconds), and the device responds. The delay is so long that you begin to wonder if the device received the signal, so you push the button again only to get the effect of 2 button presses when it finally decides to respond. It is absolutely infuriating to use. I love Panasonic products in general, but this thing suffers from a terribly slow interface.",

I read reviews with that complaint but figured it couldn't be that big of a deal. IT IS. Several times I've had to pull out the manual and hunt thru it to figure out operations. When I got a new wireless router, there was no easy way to simply find/connect to it. Again, ANNOYING. It takes a long time to connect to Netflix (both wired & wirelessly) and the on screen menu layout is non-intuitive. Would not buy again. I know there are better options out there.",

Best in class according to consumer reports. 2. Simple on screen menus. 3. Integrated WiFi. 4. Fun sensor on the top of the player that opens the disk tray. 5. Excellent image quality. 6. Small foot print. Cons: 1. Occasional disk read error if there are ANY finger prints on the disk. Not a deal breaker since it's infrequent. 2. Slightly expensive, but worth it. I would recommend this Blu Ray player as a worthy addition to anyone's home theater system.",

Got it, installed it, downloaded firmware update, and it was hot. Looks great, very compact yet slick looking device. The touch-free opening feature is a neat gimmick. The only nitpick (and this is true of my Panasonic Plasma as well) is the GUI/menus aren't intuitive in their design. I'm sure once I've used it for a bit it will make more sense. Overall however for the $100 it is a great device and it's inclusion of Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon's streaming content make it a wonderfully useful media device.",

The integrated Wi-Fi is amazing stuff, set-up was (Netflix) easy, and everything worked on the first try. We were looking for a player with a small footprint and this machine met our dimensional requirements nicely. With HDMI the new connection standard, there are only two cables: power + HDMI, making for tidier cabling management. Suggestion to Panasonic (or any other manufacturer): consider adding power and HDMI input sockets on one, or both, side panels, allowing for the device to be shoved back against a wall or cabinet and cables to trail off to the side, deftly hidden behind stacks of BDs.",

Even using both hands, I often clicked on the \"Vierra cast\" button when I wanted the up arrow. This took me out of set-up and meant working back to the screen I had inadvertently left.

It turns out you can only play .mkv through the usb port, and apparently only windows format media files over the home network, effectively making almost all my videos useless for this player.

Besides being able to play the standard media I needed something that was reasonably priced, wifi capable and simple to operate. I had read some reviews criticizing this product for its inability to connect to Netflix etc. I've not had that problem. It has worked as it is supposed to, no problems with Netflix. Although I do wish it had a web browser. If you are looking for an affordable BR player, simple to connect and operate. This is the product for you.",

It's my first Blu Ray player and I'm really excited that I was able to get such a nice one for a great affordable price. It has gone up now that Christmas is over but it's still a good value. We've watched YouTube videos and most of them still manage a nice picture with little graininess. I highly recommend this player.",

You tube only plays half screen, the other half has the search information and video que, similar to your computer display. There is no option for full screen that I can find. I have a Panasonic TV so it is also convenient to only need one remote while using the DVD player. Highly recommended.",

It's connected to my LG TV via a decent HDMI cable, so it shouldn't be the cable's fault. Dealing with 800-211-PANA is a PAINA to say the least.

These displays have more processing power than standard 2D models for displaying 3D images in rapid succession.

This can be a cable box with a subscription to a 3D channel, a 3D Blu-ray Disc player, or a PlayStation 3 system. 3D Content\n3D content--the actual entertainment, in other words--will be played back using the source mentioned above, whether it's a 3D broadcast from your cable provider, a 3D Blu-ray Disc, or a 3D video game. 3D Glasses\nFor now, the vast majority of 3D HDTVs require glasses for 3D viewing. Many use powered \"active shutter\" glasses, others polarized \"passive\" glasses. You'll need one pair per viewer, and they'll have to be compatible with your display, whether they're the same brand, or a pair of \"universal\" glasses designed to work across brands. HDMI Cable\nTo connect your source (such as a 3D Blu-ray Disc player) to your display, you'll need a high-speed HDMI cable. Cables with this designation feature bandwidth speeds up to 10.2 Gbps (gigabits per second), for carrying the 3D signal without any loss of quality. \nIf you want to get more information about 3D, shop our 3D products, watch videos, or interact with other customers, we invite you to visit 3D 101, our customer center about everything 3D. \n\n\n\nINTERNET-READY TELEVISION\nInternet-ready TVs use your broadband connection to deliver dynamic content, whether it's streaming video from Netflix, new music from Pandora, or a quick glance at today's weather forecast.\n\nAlthough there is overlap, each manufacturer offers a unique bundle of free or paid services, including streaming video and music, social networking apps, online photo galleries, news and financial updates, weather info, sports scores, and a variety of other smartphone-like applications.\n\nManufacturers continue to add new content to their offerings, keeping customers current through firmware updates, and making a bit of research a prudent step in your buying decision.\n\nLearn more about Internet TVs, how they work, what services are offered by different manufacturers, and exactly what you'll need to get started at our Internet TV 101 customer center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(March 2011)\n\n\nStep into the 3D World.
