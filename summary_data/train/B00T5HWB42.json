Like other reviewers have said, you do have to take the shade off in order to change the flow/direction but I've never used this feature with any other fan, so I doubt I will care too much about that. The lighting is extremely dim, more like mood lighting. Would definitely not be enough lighting for my living room if I didn't already have can lights. I typically put the fans together by myself, total time from start to finish is typically about 2 hours. I included some pictures to show how to properly attach the blades as it seems from other reviewers that this was a difficult thing for some.",

The slow and medium speeds are pretty much pointless to use. The high speed is high. The only reason we didn't return it was because we really liked the looks of this one for our porch and the fact that my husband is super handy and was able to work through the flaws.",

To fix this problem you need to add spacers between the motor housing and light kit. I used the weighted strips that come with the fandoms are supposed to be used for balancing the blades. Cut them into pieces and stick them, 4 layer thickness, on the disk below the motor housing as you see in the photo. You also want to make sure to get good balanced coverage over this disk as the light kit will be pressed up against the spacers. Hope this helps!",
