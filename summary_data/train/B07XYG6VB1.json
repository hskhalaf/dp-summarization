It folds up so I stand it next to my bread maker on one of my counters. I especially enjoy the crumb catcher, no mess anymore! This is a great product.",

None of my bread knives can reach from one side to the other. I wish the width was adjustable. 2. While it folds up flat, the end piece is loose. I wish it fit into the folded bundle somehow to keep it all together.",

Otherwise, this is VERY nicely constructed, the guides lock into place with a solid and satisfying \"snap\", and the fact that it folds flat for storage is an added bonus. Highly recommended...",

      "text": "This slicer is very nice. I love the Bamboo. My previous slicer was plastic. I prefer to eat bamboo dust over plastic dust because the knife does cut into the slicer. But I make my bread in a bread maker so my loaves are taller than the slicing tines. If I can find a slicer with taller tines I will return this one.",
