If you camp alot, get one of these before they go up in price again, I got mine with a discount when I singed up for the AMAZON Credit Card. Best deal ever.",

The 3500 BTU oven burner heats up quickly, but the oven temperature gauge isn\u2019t terribly accurate, however, I anticipated this and had a second thermometer to check it. My first attempt at baking was a total success as was my second. As advertised, the cooktop was easy to clean. Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase!",

      "text": "I love camping and yes I do have a travel trailer, but I prefer to cook outside, weather permitting. I have tried at least 15 or 20 different stoves through the years, but this is the 1st one I've bought that fulfills all the requirements of camping, The oven works beautifully I have baked, biscuits, cakes, pie, pizza, scalloped potatoes, roast, etc. The top burners are excellent for a 2 burner grill for making breakfast or just general cooking. I highly recommend this product to those who like to camp.",

Even on low I have to crack the door open a little to keep it from going over 350 degrees. It is a little easier to regulate the temp if it is colder in the room. I have learned to rotate pans around when baking brownies or cookies so they don't burn on the bottom. I got some nice pans at the discount store that fit perfect. It is also pretty easy to clean. You won't be sorry if you purchase this. The price is right compared to places like Gander Mountain.",

Set up was really easy and with the camp table, the combination will more than take care of our needs. Although some of the reviews mentioned inadeqate handles for lifting, the manufacturer resolved this with easy to grasp handles on both ends. In addition, another review mentioned the oven temperature guage would get in the way, that guage is permanently mounted on the front panel with the burner and oven controls. Works like a charm and I love have the flexibility with the oven feature in addition to the burners.",
