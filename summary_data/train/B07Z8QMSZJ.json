I purchased it with the intent of using it on my TV in my living room or on travel, but I am using it at work for the ability to do school work during my lunch since I can't use work resources for that. It has Windows Home on it and can be upgraded to Professional for about $99. It boots quickly and is responsive to the opening and closing of programs. It is nice that it has many USB ports so that you can plug just about anything into it you might need and two HDMI display ports to run dual displays",

When there were 1,000+ units on the map on AOE it did start to have a little bit of a stutter, but it was minor and not incredibly noticeable. Needless to say, for casual gaming, it's a pretty nice little box. I use it for work too, and that's not even a question -- it can easily handle basic work tasks (word, excel, wordpress, social media networks, etc).",

I can install any software or download/buffer any movie as much as I like, with a dedicated device. This mini computer also has a nice look and fit into the room nicely, if that's a plus.",
