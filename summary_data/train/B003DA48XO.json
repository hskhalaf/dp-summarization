Amazon doesn\u2019t handle the return and you have to go through Franklin and pay all the shipping-which is about the cost of a new tee.",

A child would have to hit the ball exactly right for the junky item to not fly all over the place and function as pictured in the video. Very disappointed.",

I paid a little over $5, so it was worth it, but I wouldn't suggest paying full price for this thing. Also, we store it indoors! I would be afraid of the state of this thing if it were left in the storage building. The heat it was exposed to was in the car on a trip to the park. That's IT. Imagine leaving it outside all summer. >.<",

The base will slide around when my son hits and then he has to reposition all over. Not a big deal, but a rubber sole would be a nice feature.",
