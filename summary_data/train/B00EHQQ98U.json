      "text": "This product looks good in my home but if you are not one keen on putting things together, get it put together by someone because all of this takes quite a bit of time to assemble. The directions are good and all pieces were there but plan on spending time putting this whole thing together. My only gripe is the larger filing cabinet I got as part of the package does not have a sturdy bottom. If you don't use the hanging files thing, you wont be able to put much into the bottom of both drawers. I'm surprised it wasnt designed with a cross beam of some kind to support at least a little weight.",

      "text": "This is one of the best desks that I have every had. Large for storage and desk top space with the added lateral file cabinet. It was very very easy to put together, just took some time. I was able to put all five pieces together in about 5 or 6 hours. I have received lots of compliments on the desk and the look. One small issues, I was missing a 1 screw and I contact Bush. They sent a package of the screw overnight when I only needed 1 and in the middle of this COVID-19 crisis. Highly impressed with the customer service. I would recommend this desk to anyone with a home office.",

Love the bookshelf and the file cabinet, they create a wonderful look and complete the desk and hutch to make a great home office. Lots of storage space and a large work surface on the desk. Very pleased with purchase, but glad I didn't buy the set at it's full retail value of over $1,200. The approximate $700 value here on Amazon was much more reasonable for the quality of furniture, but I'm very pleased at the nicer quality than Ikea or Walmart typically bring on their lower end furniture.",

I replaced the handle pulls on the drawer of the desk and the double file cabinet, they were plastic and my kid stripped one installing it, so went to local hardware store that weekend and just picked up a few metal pulls. Color (coffee) is great and in my opinion looks better than many desk stations I have seen for hundreds more.",

Note: the bars for the file cabinets are a little hard to put together, you have to literally slam them together with all your might (I had to get a friend's help!).",
