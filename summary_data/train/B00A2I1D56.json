The lens was fine and then just seemed to fall off from the main body...always check that its im secure and had been using it and even holding the lens part too. No idea what went wrong but have to assume design flaw with this particular lens as all years i have had other lens this has never happened so this is why a lower review. For the price these lens go for I could not believe this happened.",
