The mini games actually steal a lot of the thunder away from the main campaign here and are a lot of fun to play with friends. Though, after a few play throughs the minigames begin to show their shallow nature. Once you beat this there isn't a whole lot to return too, though.",

Kirby's first 3DS game contains (1) Story (2) Music/Rhythm and (3) Battle Mode. Story Mode: Clever plot, great dynamic change with background and foreground, awesome new copy abilities, and cool boss battles Music/Rhythm: Good song selections and remixes, and unique gameplay Battle Mode: Fantastic arenas, wonderful selection of copy abilities, and fun chaotic matches Overall, the entire package is stunning and perfect. Triple Deluxe is the best Kirby game I ever enjoy. Die-hard fans must recommend this 3DS title.",

My biggest concern was visibility on a tiny little screen compared to the tv but it holds up nicely.",
