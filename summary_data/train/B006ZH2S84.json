I used the snap case that came with the product to protect them while they were not in use but that did not seem to help. I am disappointed in the lack of longevity of this product.",

The product was said to be \"brand new\" but when I would start running, the music would skip out. I tried connections to other devices other than the iPhone and the same thing happens. Sure enough, one ear bud is now completely not working. I have been unable to reach the seller, although they contacted me directly previously about taking down a \"somewhat positive\" review. I would have loved to return these for a new pair but have not been given the option. As of now I am extremely unsatisfied.",

Only one side worked. After reading the reviews of quality control I decided not to even bother with a like replacement. Yeah yeah I know a few bad apples get thru the batch from ANY brand. Thing is after reading reviews I was reluctant to purchase these already thanks to other reviews and low and behold I should have listened. Shame because they LOOK well built, are very attractive and got pretty good sound quality reviews on head-fi and everywhere else.",
