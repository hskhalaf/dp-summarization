      "text": "So there's a 'mechanism; on the solution tank that stops the water from flowing out when you initially flip the tank over after you fill it . There's a little White Piece.. a black grommet .. and a spring . The water pushes on it to stop the water from coming out.. until you put it in the device. After about 4 uses that thing fell out of the solution tank.. so NOW when i flip it over ALL the water comes gushing out before i can put the thing in the unit. Kinda makes it useless :p .",

This is not something I feel like I could use on a daily basis due to the time it takes to clean all the compartments of the unit. I would not buy again.",

Tip: Don't spray too much of the water soap solution on the couch. A little goes a long way & I ended up soaking my couch the first time! The cord reaches fairly far but I have a big couch so I had to unplug & relocate twice. Simple to put together & pretty straight forward to use.",
