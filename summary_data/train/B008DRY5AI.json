I use it a lot for cutting off screws, etc. that are sticking out of things that I am working with (such as screws through rough cabinet doors, barn doors, etc.). I also use it often to sharpen the chain on my saw. I would have the Dremel for that use alone. It cuts way down on the time and effort involved in sharpening the chains. I get the correct size bit and the job is done in minutes. This also saves money on professional sharpening. Since this is a cordless model, I can take it out into the woods with me and use it as needed.",

This part should be included with the kit, or AT LEAST be VERY CLEAR ***on the packaging*** that you additionally need to buy a particular collet or the Keyless Chuck to use which accessories in the kit. For a better customer experience, include the Chuck in the kit for free (or add $5 to the cost of the kit).",

If you will use this tool over 1 hour per year, I'd go with this fantastic 12 volt one. No need to have a plug in model if you have this very powerful 12 v battery model. The last few months I've been using this for maybe 3 hrs per week for grinding, shaping, sanding & polishing. It's my favorite by far. If you are doing long hard sessions (over 30 min) an extra battery can give you nonstop high power grinding. (If you polish stainless, go buy a bar of green jewelry polish)",

      "text": "I purchased this to replace the 7700 model which mainly was used to trim my dog's nails. We also had a really old electric Dremel which seemed too powerful for the dog and was also in need of repair. So I splurged with the 225-01 Flex shaft and I have to say nail trimming is now a breeze. The handle of the flex shaft is light weight and easy to manipulate to get at the correct angle for the dog nail. My dog's nails were too long when I got her so I am trying to get them back to a healthy length by trimming at least every two weeks. This tool will make it less stressful for us both.",
