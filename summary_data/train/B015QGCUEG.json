I am a professional athlete, so keeping fit is on the forefront of my mind. I wear out my trainers within months (as I use them so much) so finding a good quality shoe at a great value is of importance to me. I am not bothered about the colour, but it is very bright, which some might find a problem - for me it is of no consequence.",

Very comfortable, the thicker sole has definitely helped me. Most reviews for Asics tend to say that the fit is smaller than expected and I'd go along with that. Possibly order half a size bigger than you would normally go for. Decent ankle support. Very impressed",

    "description": "The Asics Gel Phoenix 7 Running Shoes are constructed with a breathable mesh upper, allowing the air to fully permeate the shoe. The upper is stitched around a canvas and attached directly to the midsole which helps to provide better support underfoot during training. A removable sockliner keeps the foot snug, but gives the added option of being able to remove when needed. Effective shock absorption is provided thanks to the new SpEVA 55 Midsole material, meaning improved bounce back characteristics and a reduction in muscle fatigue during those longer runs. The rear and forefoot GEL cushioning systems also help to attenuate shock during impact and toe-off phases, allowing movement in multiple planes as the foot transitions through the gait cycle. The Dynamic DuoMax Support System is comprised of a dual density midsole system, positioned to enhance support and stability. A Trusstic System reduces the weight of the sole unit while retaining the structural integrity of the shoe for a lightweight ride underfoot. With 3M reflectivity, these shoes also provide improved visibility when running in low-light conditions. The durable outsole is reinforced with ASICS (AHAR+) High Abrasion Resistance rubber, built for exceptional durability.",
