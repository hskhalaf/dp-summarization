The rollers are sturdy and the cooler is easy to pull without the wheels getting locked up or stuck like cheaper versions sometimes do. There's plenty of room in the cooler between the cooler part, the pockets and using the bungees on top for my weekly shopping trips. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something that would be good for taking to sporting events, the beach, camping or, like me, the Farmers Market.",

I wont buy a soft sided cooler without it. It means my cooler wont leak all over the floor, carpet, car, etc. And it makes it super easy to keep clean!

Main problem is that when the handle is fully retracted and you're pulling it along, if you stop suddenly or need to maneuver the cooler around and only slightly push down on the handle it starts to retract back into the body of the cooler. Our previous cooler had locking handles so if you wanted to retract it you had to push two small buttons on the cooler. A much better design in my opinion.",

Works like a charm! I like the removable inner plastic liner: It helps to keep the cooler clean. The elastic pouches on the sides work well for water bottles and little odds and ends. Very good product overall!",

While it's a soft sided cooler, it's got a rigid plastic liner that maintains the shape and is very easy to pull out and clean. Highly recommended.",
