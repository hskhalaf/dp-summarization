Because a lot of people were saying that laser printers can't handle card stock, at first I was worried that my really thick card stock (120 lb. card stock/~236gsm) wouldn't go through. However, it works perfectly! I just use the single-sheet manual bypass and it goes through without a problem. I had to adjust the settings a little bit to get the toner to lay on densely to get the foil to stick properly to it. I set it to 600 DPI, Print density: 6, and set it to print 'Text' instead of 'Graphics'.",

One black cartridge for my old HP Deskjet sells for ~$48, which is equal to the price of a high-yield toner for the 2300. Buying a printer cable for an additional $5is a reasonable add-on; and using a 10-foot USB cable posed no problem--Brother suggests a maximum length of 6 feet, but the 10-foot cable works with the 2300. Setup was simple and the device began working on the first print command. I'm using Windows 8.1 with Start8 installed on a Dell PC.",
