The first bottle (from dermatologist) was thick creamy texture and had no smell to it, the second bottle (that I order from Amazon) has a watery texture to it and has a very sour smell to it. I will be going back to my dermatologist to buy it from now on.",

Note that you don't need to apply as much as you do your regular moisturizer. Bit Pricy (Still less that dermatologist office) but well worth it.",

I've always had dry skin though and never could find a moisturizer that truly kept my skin feeling soft. I buy this creme on Amazon now so that I don't have to go to the doctor every time to purchase it, plus it is more affordable on here! I went from having to put lotion on every day, to now not even needing it but a few times a week since this creme actually renews skin cells. Would totally recommend!!",

It absorbs quickly, and leaves your hands feeling silky smooth! Sure it costs more, but as far as I am concerned it is worth every penny. Great product!",

I knocked it down 1 star though because it has kind of an odd smell. I don't really understand why they wouldn't put a light fragrance or try to fix it in some way, seems like an easy fix for a nice product. I usually just use this at night so the smell doesn't bother me.",
