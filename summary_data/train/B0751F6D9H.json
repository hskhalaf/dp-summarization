Received a shipping confirmation within hours of placing order and then the box arrived only 3 days later. I researched for a long time on which mat to get, but when I found the 16ft in her favorite teal color it was perfect. And it come with a 500W electric motor which is a must. Blows up within minutes and has Velcro ends should we ever want to add on. For now the length is perfect for a round off backhandspring layouts, or running ariels, switchleaps, or backhandspring layout stepouts.",

Within 2 uses the hose broke off of the attachment adapter so we are duct taping it for now, with reasonable success. Does anyone know of a way to get a better hose?",
