      "text": "This is my first android phone and I am not particularly technically minded but I found this fairly easy to use and have added contacts, apps etc with no real problems. The fingerprint reader seems to work o'k but I do also have to put in a pin code at times. I do seem to have a problem receiving MMS messages (photos) for which I have to make a call to my provider, who sort the problem for me but then I stop being able to receive them again. Getting a bit tired of having to keep ringing up to solve this problem. Overall though , I am pretty happy with my new phone and certainly pleased with the price.",

      "text": "I have bought this refurbished phone a couple of months ago. The phone does not work properly and is basically always frozen. Since I started using it, it was not possible to use Google Maps and most of the other apps because the phone was getting frozen. After 1-2 months of usage, it has started freezing also when using WhatsApp. Also, the touch scree does not work properly and it is not possible to answer phone calls with this phone. This phone is pure trash. I will have to buy a new one. Total waste of money. Avoid it.",
