Whoever invented NATO style watch straps is a genius, and this watch looks the best with this kind of straps",

I must commend amazon.com for their excellent (as usual) customer service! Thanks, amazon! Edited several wks later: new replacemt watch, same issues, not working! Return 2d watch for full refund.

I only have 2 complaints about the watch: 1. being something already mentioned from other reviewers, to adjust the date, you need to wind the minute hand all the way around, there's no separate adjustment for the date 2. the watch is quite thick Besides that, the watch is very nice for the price. I've received many compliments on it, and I think the color combination of the dark blue watch face and the brown band goes very nice together.",

I have not yet purchased another band, though I see that as one of the best features - the ability to change the appearance inexpensively and easily. The only real downside to the watch is that the hands are not easy to read depending on the lighting you are in. The silver/chrome color is reflective. Also, the stopwatch second hand (the large one that rests on the 12 when not in use) can cause you to mistake the time because it looks like the hour hand.",

It's a little thin and cheap feeling but that just seems to be the way it goes with these cheap watches. It can easily be improved with a $10 strap but the one it comes with is fine.",

Indiglo issue \u2014 the Indiglo engaged when I pushed the chronograph plungers, but my understanding/expectation is that it should only engage when pushing the main crown. 3. Thickness \u2014 This isn\u2019t a defect, but I simply wanted to mention that the watch case is VERY thick, and definitely feels that way. Too thick for my 6 inch wrist. Of course, that\u2019s on me for not researching that closely enough, but still worth mentioning.",

      "text": "I would recommend this watch to anyone from a watch enthusiasts to casual wearer. It's a gorgeous looking watch. The watch looks pricer and has a higher quality feel than the image. Yes, it also has a little weight to it. This watch will be my go-to casual watch! Also, I would advice to buy a couple of additional straps for added variety. I have the brown leather and blue nylon straps.",

It just gets replaced by another Timex.",

I don't know how long the watch band will last, but it will be easy to replace. I find the band to be more comfortable than the NATO or rubber watchbands. The Indiglo function is better to see the watch at night than most of the glow in the night of other watches. The 1/20 chonograph subdial seems to me a useless function. I find most chonograph funtion to be useless, but it looks good.",

Pros - Not too big - Easy to read - Built in light is very bright in the night - Can be used with almost every type of clothing but formal (of course) Cons - Case thickness could be lower - The original NATO band could be a bit thicker - Sometimes the cronograph hands don't allign with the indicators automatically when reset. That can be fixed manually pressing the button several times, however, shouldn't be necessary.",

This was also my first watch where the second hand doesn't actually tell time.

It's comfortable and Timex is always a good brand, but I felt that the strap should have been a better quality for the price.",
