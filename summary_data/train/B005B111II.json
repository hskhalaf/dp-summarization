The 2.4ghz is another story. Weak would be ok if that's all it was. The 2.4 band seems to drop data for 1-4 seconds every 30seconds-1 minute. It's not a weak signal causing it either. I have well over 70% signal on my laptop and about 50% on my phone and they both show the data drops at the same time. It's not the signal that's dropping, wifi analyzer shows a consistent signal level. It just refuses to send data for a little bit.",
