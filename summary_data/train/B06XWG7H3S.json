I've had friends of all shapes and sizes on it and they all have liked it. I even had a friend have her baby sleep on it next to her and it was not an issue at all, no sagging or feeling like the mattress was going to shift. Amazing. I would buy it again!",

When you reach the firmness you want, close the valve and turn off the inflator (built into the bed). To deflate, just open the valve and start the blower. The bed is rugged and can be moved easily. Fitted sheets work with it. I do recommend you put a blanket under the sheet so you don't get cold overnight. The slight raised head works great to keep pillows on the bed. Other beds do not have it and pillows slid off.",

The only negative is I have a hard time rolling it back up for storage.",

I have recommended King Coil to many of my friends and family and would not buy any other mattress This item is a bit spendy but totally worth it, if you are looking to sleep on an air mattress that you can actually be comfortable and get sleep on.

The queen bed is very comfortable and it is easy to add the air and easay to deflate. Really a great bargain for the price too. We would highly recommend this product to anyone searching for an additional for visitiors, taking on road trips, etc.",
