The \"fine\" sharpener for the left side of the blades does a very good job, the right one has an imperfection and leaves a small texture on the blade. I'm guessing this will vary from sharpener to sharpener and is due to the quality you get at this price point. The guards that you can adjust for blade width/angle are easily pushed out of the way so you have to be careful to not force the blade to a different angle. Overall a good product for the price but it does have some weaknesses.",

Like other reviewers said, the guides will move in and out freely, no matter where they're set. Overall, it works best on light knives, and you better not care about the finish it leaves, because it's not smooth, but the knives are sharp.

But if you use them as a mainly visual guide to holding the knife blade at the proper angle, the sharpener works great. Ran all of our kitchen knives through all three grits at first to get the proper bevel, and now I just run them once over the fine grit disk every couple weeks to spruce up the edges, or sometimes the medium grit and then the fine one if the blade has been abused.",

If it is a large knife that you are sharpening it can stop the rotation of the sharpener. I recommend gently gliding the knife through, apply zero pressure, do not press down, it is not necessary. If it is a larger - heavier knife support its weight, if you do not do this, the sharpener will jam due to the weight of the knife.",

      "text": "After looking at reviews of various home knife sharpeners, selected Presto 08810 based on favorable ratings.This machine is easy to learn to use, and sharpens as advertised. One caution: be careful when using the first, heavy duty slot to the far left. It is meant for quite dull blades and you need to know that if not used with a long slow pull through the slots, it can nick a blade. The finer sharpening options on the right, with the adjustments for three different widths of blades gives a very good edge to many sizes of knives. It is a quick sharpener and angles the blades correctly. Beats using sharpening stones which we have used for years.",

My only complaint is the motor is somewhat weak so you cannot use much pressure when sliding a knife against the grinding stones. I sharpened all my carving, steak and serrated knifes just fine.

The course with the knives are really dull, then to medium to fine. If the blades are not really dull, just use the medium or the fine grinding stones. Be careful as you knives will be really sharp. If you are reaching into a sink with sudsy soap, it is easy to cut yourself by reaching under the suds. I don't think you'll be disappointed with the piece of kitchen equipment. Be sharp!",

I now just make several swipes on a honing steel before each use and have knives that make easy work of cutting everything from bread to roasts. I have only one suggestion. A video demonstrating use of the sharpener would have been useful. It's not rocket science, but I would have liked to see how to use the sharpener properly beforehand.",
