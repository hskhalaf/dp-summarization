Which ended up with him somehow wrapped around my other dog's midsection so tightly I had to cut first this belt then both dog's harness to untangle them. I have never been so panicked!! To think my poor boy could have been seriously, seriously injured or worse had I not heard a strange noise from the back and turned around.",

This attaches easily to the seat latch bars meant to attach car seats with a safety lock. The safety lock is easy to remove but will not accidentally unlatch The other end is a carabiner that is secure but easy to attach and detach.

Much better than the flimsy booster seat attachment we were using. I would love it if someone made a dog booster that utilized that latch system like this. In the meantime, the adjustability of the strap lets us continue to use the booster, and actually lets her sit or sniff at the window more comfortably. This is a great inexpensive option for dog car safety.",

In a collision, the webbing will hold, the carabiner will remain intact (probably...there's no kN rating on it) but I very much doubt that even 10 pounds of dog suddenly hurled forward will be held by that. The forces involved are so great that the only dog harness independently collision rated is certified using a passthrough seatbelt attachment.",

I love that it securely mounts to the baby seat loop build into every late model car and the carabiner side easily hooks onto my dog's harness. If there were a single complaint, it would be that i wish there was more room for adjusting it shorter. I have it at it's shortest length and half of my dog's body could probably hang off the front edge of the back seat. Would be perfect for anything larger than my dog.",
