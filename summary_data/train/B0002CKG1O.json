      "text": "This is a well made caulking gun, but far from perfect. The mecanism takes the pressure off the cartridge when the trigger is released, so that the tube doesn't continue getting pressure and flow. However, this also makes it hard to apply enough pressure to thicker caulks - the rod just does not move under high pressure. And thinner caulks still drip, regardless. The hanging hook and ease of loading is nice. The puncture rod is barely long enough for some caulk tubes and not quite long enough for some of the more professional caulks that have long spouts. I am still searching for the \"best\" caulking gun.",

If you have weak or arthritic hands, know this caulk gun requires so little pressure to squeeze that it even felt like I wasn\u2019t depressing the trigger when I was. The built-in slicer to cut the tip off the caulk tube is an added bonus. I don\u2019t know how long it will stay sharp as I\u2019ve only used two tubes, but the caulk gun is worth it even without it.",

It's light and has good leverage for squeezing out thicker caulk easily, but best of all, no dripping and running-on after you release the handle! No having to pop the release after each pass! This gun makes caulking much faster and easier, and that means the quality of your beads will improve. And no having to clean up drips and hanging strings of goo that lesser caulking guns will leave on your finished surfaces. I just wish I had bought this years ago!",

Also, the run is very long compared to other brands I've used (I've used plenty). There is one brand that rates a bit higher for a couple bucks more. I've owned that brand and before I purchased this one, I was looking to replace it, but it was inconveniently out of stock..

But when it comes to the thicker adhesives like gorilla glue max it barely pushes it out. It performed so badly I thought the adhesive was bad at first and dry......but further inspection I realized it was the gun. 2 stars for a great start but I would not buy again.

    "title": "Dripless Inc. ETS2000 Ergo Composite Caulk Gun",
    "description": "The Dripless ETS2000 Industrial Grade caulking gun has a lightweight composite revolving frame that fits 10 oz. cartridges and has a 12:1 thrust ratio for use with latex, acrylic, and silicone. The revolving frame allows the barrel to rotate for maintaining the same bead orientation when caulking around corners. A spout cutter is built into the side of gun for opening cartridges without a knife, and the hook on the back allows it to hang on a ladder.\n\nCaulking guns, also called caulk or cartridge guns, dispense a controlled flow of products such as caulk, sealants, and adhesives from a tube or cartridge. A manual caulking gun consists of a frame which holds the tube, a trigger, and a rod which moves forward when the trigger is depressed, dispensing the product. Manual caulking guns have a thrust ratio; the higher the thrust ratio, the easier it is to dispense the caulk, sealant, or adhesive. Air-powered or pneumatic caulking guns also have a frame and a trigger, but are used with an air pressure regulator that pushes the product from the tube using air pressure instead of a rod.\n\nDripless, Inc. manufactures caulking guns and caulking and painting accessories. The company, founded in 1992, is headquartered in Santa Rosa, CA.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThis contractor ergo composite caulk gun is engineered to provide superior performance due to its many enhanced features including a precision cutter with a viewing port to check the angle of the cut, an extra-long clean out rod that snaps in place when not in use and a rotating barrel for corners and hard-to-reach places. Reduces stress in hand and arm. The rugged composite construction weighs up to 40-percent less than other models. 12:1 ratio is recommended for acrylics, silicones, elastomeric, or latex. The ironic grip has been designed to keep the wrist in a natural and balanced position. Available in 10-ounce cartridge.",
