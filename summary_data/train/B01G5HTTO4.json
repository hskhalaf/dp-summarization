After borrowing a lens from a friend I found that it worked well accept some minor issues including the build which is a little too 'plasticky' for my taste. While camera was performed well, I still returned it due to the missing lens which is really unfortunate. Overall, I recommend this camera but so many issues made me reduce the score to a 4 rather than 5.",
