They have all the answers to your questions with no hassell to buy something. Great people. The one problem with the the kit is the cheap plastic corker, very hard to use. Would be better to not include it & charge less and give you the option to buy one with handles (about $35.00). Thanks for the great support. Tim does really good on the DVD except for the \"corker\"!",

Wow! Nobody does customer service like that anymore!! The kit came even earlier than it was scheduled. Everything was as it was supposed to be. I watched the DVD and started my first batch of wine EVER! If it doesn't work it, it would be to no fault of Northern Brewers. The DVD was very helpful since I didn't know anything about wine except what I like to drink! Thank you Northern Brewers!! I'm looking forward to my first batch in 28 days!!!",

I read some stories of messes happening when the air locks got clogged, so we opted to run a hose from the top of the air lock into a jar to avoid the possibility. This kit with a larger primary fermenter would be a no brainer.",
