No tent just these bivvys and a tarp over head. Slept along a creek. I think my major mistake was putting my sleeping bag inside the bivvy. Bc around 2am I woke up with soooo much condensation lining the inside walls of the bivvy from head to toe. At 2am in the chilly woods that was not a fun discovery. FACTS: I did stay warm the whole night despite the condensation. It is tough and reusable. I did not die.",

These bags should provide enough solar protection to avoid heat stroke in daytime temps reaching over 110 degrees.
