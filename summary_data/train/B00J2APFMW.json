I cannot use the cheap disposables as they cut my legs, resulting in blood, a mess, and scars. No one wants that. So I think it's important to invest in a more expensive razor. That being said, the price is great. This shaves smoothly and easily, gliding over my legs well. I would recommend this product to a friend. Is it pink and girls? No. But, it works well and that's what matters.",

This is fairly fast but not as quick as its predecessor but shaves better as it hugs the skin great (but I have a smooth/round face so its pretty easy for me anyway).",

    "description": "Style Name:Fusion Proglide (New Version)| Size:1 Razor, 1 CartridgeFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nGillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Technology, the men\u2019s razor that responds to contours for Gillette\u2019s best shave. Gillette's best razor blades are 2X preferred when used with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology (overall preference vs. former ProGlide, among ProGlide users). Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor blades feature a precision beard trimmer for accurate edging. Reengineered Low Cutting Force razor blades feature thinner, finer blades (first four blades vs. Fusion) with advanced low-resistance coating to cut effortlessly through hair with less tug and pull than Fusion. A Blade Stabilizer maintains optimal razor blade spacing for comfort, while allowing the razor blades to respond to the contours of a man\u2019s face. Plus, the Streamlined Comfort Guard channels excess shaving cream to produce optimal blade contact, stretching the skin for a close, comfortable shave. And the razor\u2019s Enhanced Lubrastrip (vs. MACH3) is infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers that allow the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor blade to move smoothly over skin, even on repeat strokes.",
