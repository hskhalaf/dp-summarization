The still shots and intelligent auto on this camera are amazing and I've taken several thousand pictures with this camera already. If you're in the market for a great CONSUMER-level camera, then this is definitely a choice you should consider. If you're a professional you're probably not even looking at this camera. Keep in mind that the \"lens selection\" for this camera is consumer grade. If you are thinking of getting extra lenses and stuff like that, then you need a higher grade camera. This camera deserves 5 stars for the price and function regardless!",

I used it to video a swim meet recently, then converted the files to a DVD and the quality was outstanding. The camera has settings for night, dusk, portrait, landscapes, etc, or you can use the automatic feature and the camera will pick the best setting for you. Pictures are clear and crisp. It's easy to use the flash and charging the battery is very simple. This is our second camera like this. I would recommend it highly as a good easy to use digital camera that takes quality photos and videos.",

Before buying, I had read reviews claiming lowlight conditions are difficult, but the camera is much better than my Samsung Z73 and I expected low light (like night vision googles low light) photos to be a problem for most commercial cameras. But there is little or no blurring. If it is grainy, you can edit in Photoshop or Picasa. In low light, best use the flash. The flash is good. Camera adjusts when flash is used so it does not wash out subjects that are nearer or really white.",

Many more features than I need but it's not so complicated that I couldn't take a few photos within a couple of minutes without having to even crack open the manual. The controls are laid out very logically and the camera is easy to hold and shoot. The optical zoom is great and coupled with the digital zoom allows unbelievable closeups. Changing megapixel settings if very fast and can be done easily using the Quick Menu thumb button while still looking through the viewfinder. I'm very impressed with the camera and I know I'll be more impressed as I use more features.",

The 18x zoom was so fantastic that I used the camera instead of binoculars. The shots taken at 18x zoom look as though they were taken right up close - the autofocus is incredible. After a whole day out on safari the battery was still going strong. The video looks stunning and the anti shake makes it possible to casually film without a tripod. The camera is really light yet durable. I was able to figure out how to use it in an hour without touching the manual. I highly recommend this camera.",

I used to buy only nikon and canon cameras, even point and shoot models and slr's as well but never though to purchase Panasonic models. I'm surprised how good this camera is. The photos quality are outstanding and the controls are so helpful. Great zoom, great vibration stability mechanism too. I'm so satisfied about this camera and for shure this is a great deal. This camera stands between PS and SLR's camera, so if you think to go to a SLR's model and your experience is only about Point and Shoot cameras, FZ28 is a great bridge to take you to most advanced cameras on the market.",

      "text": "We are having the same experience as Byron Bunge (review on December 14): using the iA (Intelligent Automatic) setting, we are getting consistently bad indoor photographs. Without the flash, the pictures are correctly exposed but almost invariably blurry, apparently due to camera shake or incorrect focus. With the flash activated, there is a HUGE shutter lag. We had to go back to our point and shoot camera to capture our holiday pictures. After reading all these glowing reviews, we have to presume that we got a lemon. Anyway, we're calling Panasonic and will be returning the camera unless they can help.",

The zoom range on the high end is still the same (35 mm equivalent of 468 mm)as that of the FZ7 with the 12 power zoom. It's a great camera, easy to use but I'm disappointed over the zoom range.",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28K 10MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Panasonic's Lumix DMC-FZ28 digital camera boasts a premium 27mm wide-angle Leica lens with an 18x optical zoom, ideal for tight indoor shots and long-distance action photos. The 10.1-megapixel digital camera also features an enhanced Intelligent Auto Mode (iA), with the new AF (auto focus) Tracking function, making it easier for photographers at any level to shoot sharp, well-focused photos, even when the subject is moving -- making it ideal for action shots. \n\nThe AF Tracking function, the latest component to be added to Panasonic\u2019s iA system, allows users to lock focus on a moving subject. The camera then automatically tracks the subject as it moves, keeping it in focus without the need to hold the shutter halfway down. AF Tracking makes it easier to capture moving subjects and spur-of-the-moment action shots. The AF Tracking technology also improves Face Detection (up to 15 faces), by providing continuous adjustment of the focus and exposure, even if the face is turned away from the camera. \n\nIn addition to the AF Tracking functionality, Panasonic\u2019s other iA technologies include: \n\n *  Intelligent Exposure: Helps prevents photos from being under- or over-exposed by instantly analyzing the framed image and adjusting the brightness in areas that are too dark because of dim lighting, backlighting or the use of the flash. The camera will automatically adjust the brightness accordingly. \n *  Digital Red-eye Correction: This feature helps to eliminate the red-eye problem that sometimes results when taking flash shots at night. Incorporated into the camera, the built-in flash emits a small preliminary flash before the main flash, detects red-eye and will digitally correct it. \n *  MEGA O.I.S.: Gyrosensors detect hand-shake and the lens system shifts to compensate, helping to prevent hand-shake from creating a blurry image. \n *  Intelligent ISO: Determines if the photo subject is moving and changes the ISO setting and shutter speed accordingly, thus giving a blur-free photo. \n *  Intelligent Scene Selector: Senses the ambient conditions, recognizes the shooting environment and will automatically select the appropriate scene mode from: Scenery, Portrait, Macro, Night Portrait or Night Scenery mode. This intuitive technology, helps the consumer use the most common scene modes that are built into the camera, but often go unused, without making any manual adjustments. \n *  Face Detection: Detects faces in the frame (up to 15 faces), even if they are moving, and selects optimal focus and exposure settings so portraits come out clear. \n *  Quick AF (Auto Focus): Starts focus on the subject by just pointing the camera at the subject, thus minimizing the AF time. \n\nThe high-quality, high-performance Venus Engine IV supports a faster response time, allowing the camera to shoot 2.5 shots per second at full resolution and 13 shots per second in High-Speed Burst mode. In High Sensitivity mode, the FZ28 can shoot up to ISO 6400 in extremely low-lit situations. The Lumix DMC-FZ28 also is equipped with a 2.7-inch large, high resolution LCD with 230,000 pixels, and a high resolution electric viewfinder equivalent to 201,600 pixels. \n\nThe DMC-FZ28 also features High Defintion (HD) video capabilities with a resolution of 1280 x 720p at 30fps. Still photos can also be shot in a 16:9 aspect ratio for optimal full-screen viewing on a HDTV. Panasonic VIERA Plasma or LCD HDTVs also feature an integrated SD Memory Card slot, allowing users to easily view photos by simply inserting the SD Memory Card into the convenient SD Card slot built into the TV. Consumer can also enjoy watching videos in HD quality and view still images by connecting the DMC-FXZ28 via an optional Panasonic component cable (DMW-HDC2). \n\nAdditional features of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 include:  *  Image Leveling: When a captured image \"leans\" to the right or left because the camera was held at a slight angle when the photo was taken, the Image Leveling function rotates the image to straighten it and crops the unnecessary edges. No computer needed! \n * Scene Modes: The DMC-FZ28 offers a total of 37 scene modes to respond easily to any shooting situation. The new Pin Hole and Film Grain modes add unique, film camera-like effects and ambiences to images. Additionally, the actual effects of the scene mode can be viewed on the LCD before taking the shot. \n *  Flash: Reaches a distance of 8.5 meters at the wide setting and 5.4 meters at the telephoto setting (ISO AUTO). \n *  SILKYPIX Developer Studio 3.0 SE: Software application comes bundled with the DMC-FZ28 for editing and developing images in the RAW file format.",
