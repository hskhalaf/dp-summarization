In each, there is a strange and obvious sound you can hear and you hear it ever 30 seconds and it's irritating instead of soothing. This item has a 30 second loop on sounds and it kept me awake instead of put me to sleep. Returned today. Have had another model in the past and it broke down after several years of use. I'll go back to that other brand as it was so much better.",

Overall the one that is working is fine and that one has been dropped a few times and handled by the baby. We always plug ours in but yes you can use batteries. Volume gets pretty loud and it does have a timer. I primarily select the white noise and that is perfect but the other sounds are just as good.",

The white noise is perfect, drowns our background noise, and helps signal to them that it is \u201ctime to sleep\u201d. I love that this machine allows you to keep the sound on all night. Runs in batteries (great for travel) or a plug-in cord (included). Way cheaper than the sound machines that are marketed specifically for babies.",

I use this machine every single night. Very happy with it.",

I would not recommend this product as a sleep machine (the white noise setting was horrendous) or as an office product. (I work in a mental health setting and we often use white noise machines for privacy. I tried to take the cheap way out with this, which was a poor choice on my part.) The product itself seemed durable and well-made. It could be useful for theatrical purposes or for children. Regardless, I returned it the day after I received it.",

I am confused because my mom and my sister both have one and never has this ever happened to them.",

If you plan to use it in a bedroom to help put noise spikes in the background so you can sleep, forget it. All of the white noise settings have a rhythmic \"backbeat\" that sounds like the unit is riding on a rocking chair there beside you. Its lowest volume setting is very sensitive and difficult to get low enough so that the sheer volume of it doesn't defeat its purpose.",

And it has fewer noise options, but we only use 3 (waves, white noise or heart beat) and it has those. It uses batteries organ be plugged in. We love it too.",

I also like that it doesn't dry out the room like a fan (especially when kids are sick). I am curious to see how the Heart Beat setting works for my newborn in a few months. I think I am actually going to buy one or two more! Great product, great price!",

It seem to do it every few hours. Can't quite figure out why. It is now not worth using due to that issue. Although I did love the product while it was working I wish it was better quality.",

The volume is adjustable and the sounds are clear. I just wish it had a timer for how long we can play the sound. It automatically shuts off around 40 minutes.

We only use the white noise setting but my son likes to listen to the others and they are soothing. Overall, perfect for children who need white noise and easy to use and small.
