I\u2019m not a pro golfer by any means, but my form isn\u2019t bad either, not bad enough to justify the damage. Maybe this club was an anomaly, but I\u2019m gonna see what else I can find for the price.",

No dents or dings from bad hits. I get good distance on solid hits. The hybrid clubs feel and perform great as do all the irons and putter. Handles feel fine. Bag is very nice and functional.
