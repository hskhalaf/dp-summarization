The only problem I've had with it is that when placed on soft carpet, the failsafe switch doesn't get activated leaving the heater not on. So we usually use it on a table. Overall it's okay.",

Flip the switch on the back to turn the heater on and press the button on the front to start the oscillating! The auto shut-off is pretty sensitive. If it tilts even a little, it will shut off, making this safe to use inside. Overall, this is one of my favorite heaters that I have purchased!",

One thing to note is that it only has one settings, so if you want a heater that has different heat levels or fan levels then this doesn't have that, but if you just want a simple heater for a small room then it works well. There are only 2 buttons. 1 Button for power and 1 button for oscillation. Only having 2 buttons gives it a nice minimalist style. It works perfect for what I need it for.",
