With clear air line of sight, maximum distance in real life was 500 to 1000 feet, even with the controller pointed directly at the aircraft. On the second flight, the Disco reported \"Drone Disconnected\" or \"Max Range Exceeded\" at 1000 feet distance max in clear air line of sight. Upon receiving \"Drone Disconnected\", and with 85% battery remaining, the Disco circled a few times and then crashed. To say I am disappointed is to understate. We awaited this delivery anxiously; perhaps the lesson here is \"never buy anything at Version 1.0.\"",

It would be fantastic if you could do acro and then if you got into trouble toggle it back to \"save me\" mode. Limited to shallow turns and climbs is great for the first few flights but I don't see flying this thing for long. I guess that's why they are being dumped for $300 at other sites like BuyDig.",
