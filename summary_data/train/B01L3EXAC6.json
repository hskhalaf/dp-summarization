Small excel documents make the screen flicker (stop using for work, shame it seem to be a nice little laptop to carry around) - Contacted support - They gave me list of solution which none worked. Had to read and dig through online forums about solutions which leaded to uninstalled killer internet and razer synapse in order for the laptop to stop freezing. Regrets buying this laptop, may become paper weight pretty soon.",
