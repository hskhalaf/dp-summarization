Pros: * Light weight but sturdy. * Good design and quality for the price. * Yeyyy to RECHARGEABLE BATTERY, charges very quickly. * Comes with the screwdriver, doesn't have to search for one from the toolkit that may or may not fit. * Comes with an extra battery, each lasts around 15 to 20 mins. * The front wheel is independent, which offers the speed. Cons: - The back wheel isn't independent, if it was it would have been much faster. - The instructions could be better, but that's not a turnoff. Overall a very good startup race car for the price (below $50 when I bought it).",

It is fast and drives well. It handles bumps and turns with no issue. The steering is very sensitive, so it does take a little practice, but so much fun when you have that down. The only minor complaint we have is the clearance underneath. It drove ok on grass, but did slow down quite a bit because of the clearance. It was easy to get going and even comes with its own screwdriver for the battery cover. Overall great car!!",

PROS + Included 2 rechargeable battery cells for the vehicle itself. + Lightweight, but also feels quality. + Has a good range from vehicle to receiver. + Responsive controller. + Include screwdriver. + Very awesome design + Multi-terrain compatible. + Speedy! + Inexpensive! CONS - The wheel turn radius is a bit tighter than I would\u2019ve like making it difficult to do tight turns.",

Its a relief that it has rechargeable battery so no need to buy replacement batteries and fully charge battery lasts around 15-20 minutes. Overall its great race car for the price.

This reminds me of the RC cars you find at Target. Steering servo doesnt stop when turning so it makes a grinding noise. Rear suspension is more about looks than functional as the rear axle is restricted above so it cant utilize the shocks properly. Decent toy for indoor use but wont even travel through fresh cut grass. My daughter did love it for the hour she used it though so I can see why this item is popular.",

Other than that, I like the car very much, especially the shock absorbers. Attached couple of pics. They look very realistic.",
