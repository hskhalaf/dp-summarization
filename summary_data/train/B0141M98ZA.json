I use it several times daily and repeatedly change out material and containers. The scale has a very quick response time, so I'm not waiting on it between measures. I would recommend this to anyone needing the range and features this has. I was concerned about the shipping, but when it arrived it was very well packed by amazon and the manufacturer original packaging is superb. So, with that, it has two layers of protection.",
