When it comes to the specs, speakers are great, specially for a laptop, I use it manly for editing, photoshop, lightroom, bridge, .... and it works great, I can even have them open at the same time.

Only grip is the info is wrong on the item, the usb c doesn't support display port modes but I was able to buy a cheap usb 3 to vga adaptor and plug in my second monitor. Overall this is a great laptop for anyone, never mind on a budget :)",

Great for gaming, runs Sims 4 and WOW on the highest settings with ease. It's great for work as well so your definitely getting the best of both worlds. Don't waste your money on the other brands.

It's really good performing in all aspects, specially I'm surprised with the battery performance in normal use without gaming, you can really see 5 hours no problem. I added one SSD also, but only bad side is the material quality. It's so cheap material plastic.
