Longlasting, comfort, ease of use, non staining, gels allow much wider range of fragrance and some will even get you comments on your \"cologne\" or \"aftershave\". Obviously like any fragrance they are different on each individual just like colognes, but just a bit of experiment (like col.or as) and you'll find your fit. I love Gillette as well as Right Guards gels. I mix-it-up just to have different fragrances that \"work\" better with certain colognes. Some are just better fits to the nose. All* are fantastic deodorants though. Buy this and you will enjoy & never buy a solid again.",

Gillette Clear Gel also provides Fast Drying Technology.\n\nWhy do we perspire?\nSweating is your body's way of cooling itself by releasing excess heat. Therefore, while sweating is natural under any condition, it can be intensified for any number of reasons, including warm weather, exercise and stress.\n\nWhat's antiperspirant?\nAntiperspirants help block the flow of sweat from sweat glands to reduce wetness. In addition, because perspiration stimulates odor-causing bacteria, antiperspirants also reduce body odor, with scented antiperspirants fighting odor even more.\n\nHow do antiperspirants work?\nAntiperspirants use sweat against itself. Once applied, the antiperspirant is dissolved by sweat, and the dissolved particles form superficial plugs just below the skin\u2019s surface. These plugs help block the release of perspiration. Generally, the plugs stay in place for about 24 hours and wash away over time.\n\nIf sweating is natural, is there any danger in preventing it?\nActually, no. Antiperspirants are designed for usage in your underarm only. Since you have sweat glands all over your body, controlling underarm perspiration has virtually no effect on your body\u2019s ability to cool itself.\n\nWhat are the varieties of Gillette Clear Gel?\nGillette Clear Gel is available in Cool Wave, Sport, Arctic Ice, Power Rush, and Brisa Tropical scents.\n\nPICK YOUR FORM.
