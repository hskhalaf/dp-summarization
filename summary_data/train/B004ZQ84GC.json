I used a 20 vol on my hair so I had to bleach twice.. so I'd recommend using a 30 vol developer for anyone wanting maximum results and I'd advise against bleaching dyed hair.. Unfortunately Any bleach will damage your hair.. But this bleach overall is the best I've used, it doesn't smell bad and it causes less damage but if you're looking for maximum lift on previous dyed hair this isn't the product for you just because you'd need 2 sessions and that's better done at a salon .. But for virgin hair this will lift probably in one bleach, great smell though.",

My only suggestion for anyone who orders this is if your hair is black you will have to do the process twice because sometimes the blonde doesn\u2019t get as light as you may want like a platinum so if you are going for a very light blonde shade do the process twice take two days if you have two And make sure the hair is dry. It\u2019s great value for the price.
