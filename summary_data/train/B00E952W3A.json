The version with the built in microphone does not seem to have any noise cancelling functionality, which I was led to believe when it was included with other such headphones when I searched for \"noise cancelling in ear headphones\". 2. And I wouldn't use them for working out, I don't think they'd stay in. I use them for studying in a large classroom, with a white noise app to block out background sounds, and they're great for that.",

I'd rate the sound good, but they come up short compared to my Audio-Technica ATH ANC23 QuietPoint - Headphones at $41, which are more delicate. Bass is a bit weak (use your equalizer) and the treble less than natural. Unlike the Audio-Technica, these don't have any active noise canceling as advertised, other than the benefits of having your ear hole plugged. All that said, I would still buy them again because they are so sturdy.",

My truck is pretty loud driving on the freeway with offroad tires and yet these do a great job cancelling that noise out. Good purchase",

The mic has received varying reviews from parties on the other end of phone calls, but mostly positive. The variability might be related to where I position the mic (normal), but it also might have to do with the zippered wire picking up sound when rubbing against clothing because its weight generates a little friction. I now tend to hold the cord slightly away from my body when speaking and that addresses both the mic and friction issues. The zippering does keep them from tangling.",

      "text": "Who would have thought that a zipper could solve that annoying problem with tangled earbuds? I like them. The sound is as good as comparable earbuds. The zipper is well made and easy to use. Only slight complaint is that the zipper is somewhat heavier than normal earbud cords so they want to pull out of your ears. Using the right size buds should solve that problem.",

      "text": "The zipper function is a GREAT idea and helps to keep things 'neat and tiddie'. The 'buds' come with multiple silicone earpieces for a custom fit that is comfortable for extended listening sessions. As for sound quality, I wouldn't call these 'audiophile' by any stretch of the imagination, but for casual MP3 listening they are more than adequate and voice conversations are clear and distinct. I've not had any complaints from callers reporting that they had any difficulty hearing me, but wind noise could be an issue as these do not feature any sort of active noise suppression. Finally, they appear to be well made and should hold-up well under reasonable, normal use.",

They are a bit heavier than headphones that I've had before, and I found that I needed to loop the earbuds around my ear to keep them from coming out as I walk. Also, \"noise cancelling\" is an oversell - I don't know of a way to get noise cancelling through a standard audio jack (with no battery pack).",

I don't mind the weight because it keeps the cords from blowing around. I did notice that there is more noise from bumping the cords versus other headphones. I wish there were volume buttons along with the pause play button.",

I have tried to tangle these guys, but short of tying a knot on purpose, I am not sure how they would tangle. I was a Boy Scout too, so I know my knots! The small caveat is that the unit is a little heavy, since there is literally a zipper running accross the length of 90% of the wire. I should say it isnt to TOO distracting, but if you want to use this unit for excercise, it might be a little too unbalanced and come out to easily. Otherwise, great pair of earbuds.",

      "text": "I've had the Zipbuds PRO for about two weeks now and they do not tangle, which has been my biggest frustration with every other earbud I've used. I listen primarily to spoken word (podcasts, audiobooks) and the sound is perfectly acceptable for these media. My limited music listening is also perfectly fine for my untrained ear. The only complaint I have is that there is no volume control on the earbuds, requiring me to pull out my mobile device to modulate the volume. Other than that, it does just what I was looking for, provide a quick access, tangle-free way to plug into my device.",

And it is not tangling at all, actually there's no way you can make it tangle! The product comes with 3 different sizes of ear bud tips, so you'll surely find an easy way to stay comfortable with it.",

After plugging them in and out a 6 or 7 times and wiggling a bit, I got them to keep stereo pretty consistently. Still does cut out if I wiggle the connector.

One drawback vs. the iPhone earbuds is that the mic doesn't have the volume/track control that the iPhone earbuds do. Also, the zipper does add some heft to the earphones which is not a big deal but does take some getting used when wearing them. Overall, a solid set of earphones which does what is advertised.",

All in all, they are decent earbuds, but probably not what I was looking for, and certainly not worth the extra cost for me.
