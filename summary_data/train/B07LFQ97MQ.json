      "text": "I drive on the Los Angeles freeways for over 50 miles every day (110 Harbor FWY, 105 Century FWY, 405 San Diego FWY, 91 FWY). There are places where many of these freeways intersect and the air is always (often visibly) bad. The Atem car air purifier is a life changer. With all the exhaust, dust, and POLLEN, no longer IN my car, it is so much easy to breathe. I wish I had found this earlier. It even clears the horrible smell that I drive through every single day at the 605/91 intersection. It must be a water treatment facility and it is quite awful, but not for me... anymore.",

We wondered \"how would we have clean air to breathe when so many wildfires pollute the air?\" Answer: IQAir ATEM car air HyperHEPA system. A GREAT system with easy to use bluetooth connection to my smartphone. We love it.",

It was incredibly easy to set-up, the app feels intuitive and I've no complaints thus far.",

Does it seem reasonable that a machine could HEPA scrub the air in your car many times per hour using 18 watts?",

I like that it is nice and quiet so when I drive to my appointments and daily errands I can have clean air without too much noise. Good device, does what it says.",

Running on low to medium it does a great job inside. I highly recommend this for asthma and allergy sufferers in the car.",

Most important is that it can eliminate the odor that I hate in a very short time so that I can stay awake and comfortable when driving. Overall, I am gratifying and would recommend it to anyone who wants a healthy lifestyle!",
