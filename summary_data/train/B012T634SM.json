We used it just about every morning for smoothies with either ice or a frozen banana and it couldn't cut it, sadly. Since I imagine most people plan to use this similarly, I have to recommend against this one. It's nice that all the parts can go in the dishwasher, but that's the case for most single serve blenders, so spend the money on something that will last.",

It\u2019s past time to send back through Amazon. Would like to know what recourse there is with this. Our last bullet lasted about 15 years. This one two months.

This started happening since start of Jan 2019, I kept ignoring it (My fault). But today, I could taste the rotor oil/fumes in my juice. Proposed solution - Please replace or refund me.
