Good thing about that, winter is coming! Downside, Summer time is going to suck :'-) But yes, for the price, I highly recommend this. I love this so much, it's my second Cyberpower PC I've bought x",

This thing rips up most games on MAX settings at 1080. I plan on adding a 2nd stick of ram so it will run in dual channel mode and maybe add some Optane memory. Also because this system has and AMD RX580 it qualifies for the RAISE THE GAME promotion. Amazon sent me the promo code several days later and i was able to redeem it for 3 free games, Assassins Creed Odyssey, Strange Brigade, and Star Control Origins. What an amazing value.",

I knew that prebuilt computers were always terrible and I should've known better than to purchase this. The RX580 has officially died in my PC as of yesterday after 4 months, and the computer is essentially a brick. Now I have to call cyberpower and probably send my computer away for a few months for warranty, OR I'll have to put $350 in for a new GPU.",

He was surprised that the mouse wasn't as cheaply made like some come with computers and I haven't had any problems with it falling apart or anything. I also like the buttons being higher than other keyboards I've used but that's just personal preference. This was definitely worth the price and I'm glad I invested in it.",

It plays Overwatch with no stutter on Ultra and is capable of streaming in HD as well, The people at CyberPower our heaven sends, since I been playing on a Pentium for a few years. Oh boy was this a great upgrade.. It's also very quiet and has neat lights on it! If you're looking for a budget Rig that'll play modern games and won't become obsolete right away, this is for you!",

The keyboard and the mouse they include is okay, but that's only an addition so I'm not complaining. I payed for the pc, not the mouse and keyboard. I have ran some benchmark tests and it does great. The temperature stays around 30 degrees. Haven't used VR yet but will update my review once I get a headset! Great product and really recommend!",
