Keep in mind that this doesn\u2019t have a zipper to secure it around your waist so it has to stretch over your shoulders or hips to get it on. If you have bigger hips and shoulders but a smaller waist you may want to size up.",

      "text": "I wear a Cadd Duopa infusion pump 16 hours a day and the Stashbandz holds it perfectly. Much more comfortable than any of the options available through Duopa. The Stashbandz has additional pockets with room for i.d., credit cards and even a phone, but I prefer to house only the pump in the front pocket for easy access. I still carry a purse for other necessities. If I wear a loose fitting top, my Stashbandz completey conceals the pump! I have black and nude, but will definitely order more. Occasionally, I carry pump on the outside of my clothing in a fanny pack, but I much prefer the security and comfort provided by Stashbandz.",

No more worries about my tubing getting caught on things or burned on the stove, etc! I LOVE IT!",

      "text": "Traveled to Jamaica with this one and it worked great. I was able to have this completely concealed while walking around. Only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is due to it being hard to get things out of the pouches which kind of breaks the concealment. It takes a while fidgeting with the pouches to get say a passport or some money out. Lastly, it's not practical to stick any larger sized phone inside the pouches due to the imprint and how hard it is to get things out. I also didn't find the back pouches quite as useful but I am going to keep it as it met my expectations.",

It scrunches up or down easily and can wind up in a narrow band around your body. It is easy to pull up or down to get it out of the way, but then might come back to place upside down or inside out, depending on how you pull it. A bit of a sturdier backing would have insured that it did not scrunch up or out and would stay in the right position to provide pockets. I have a 35\" waist and the size medium fits perfectly.",
