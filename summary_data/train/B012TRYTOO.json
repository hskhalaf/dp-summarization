I think it's a great addition to my arsenal of workout tools. Recommend for everyone for the simple fact that it completely changes what muscles are worked. Regular can work for a different muscle set and this enhances the effects.",

      "BICEPS - The Cannon Curl perfectly supports your elbows and enables you to keep the correct posture during curls. Our design properly mimics using a preacher curl system and prevents users from \"cheating\" during bicep curls. Users immediately notice proper bicep isolation when curling with the Cannon Curl Arm Blaster.",
      "COMFORTABLE - This tough bicep support now has a padded abdomen region in addition to elbow and neck pads (now thicker) for comfort, support, and stability.",
      "STRONG - There is no comparison as to the strongest arm blaster on the market. Constructed of thick gauge aluminum. Stack on the weight on your curl bar or dumbbells and have no worry about our arm blaster bending.",
      "SUPPORT - The Cannon Curl's adjustable belt is made of heavy duty webbed nylon. The neck pad is made of thick neoprene. Double brass rivets are used to properly secure nylon strap. Now made with thicker gauge aluminum to support higher weight levels. Our arm blaster also has a padding for the abdomen.",
      "TRUSTED - Core Prodigy designs and manufactures high quality fitness equipment that you can rely on."
