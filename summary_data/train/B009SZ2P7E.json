The main issues with all of them was that they stayed wet a long time and they were difficult to wash - so it didn't happen too often. In addition, when we did wash them, they tended to break down pretty fast. These towels are basically like the ones you find in every hotel. They are thick enough to keep your feet warm when you step out of the shower and soak up the dripping water. They also wash up great with weekly laundry. Having two, we just rotate a fresh one every week when it's laundry time.",

They are thin and there is no rubber-like bottom to keep the mats in place so they slide around and bunch up. I went to Target and bought a mat that is so thick and cushy that when you step on it, it feels nice and plump and your feet sink right in. And it stays in place since there is rubber on the bottom. These ones, I'm literally gonna use them as hand towels cuz no one will no the difference. Go buy yourself a quality bath mat if you care about quality. The 1 star is for absorbency.",

Sure, they're not fluffy like microfiber or polyester rugs, but these cotton mats never get matted down and gross either. I will never buy synthetic rugs or bath mats again.",

Over all, I couldn't be more pleased. Great color, great price, and with Prime they were delivered the day after I ordered them.",
