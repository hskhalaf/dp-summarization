I was reluctant to keep it, as it might have caused problems in the future. The set was quickly replaced, and they all are working perfectly at this time.. Thankfully, I haven't had need of them yet, but I am glad to have them ready if I ever do. They are very solidly made and the brightness should be easily seen.",

My only negatives are that they are somewhat difficult to turn on and I would have expected to recharge them via a USB port on the flares. However, I have to remind myself that they are water resistant/ waterproof. A USB rechargeable port might defeat that feature.",
