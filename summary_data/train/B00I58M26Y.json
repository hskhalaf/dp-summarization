I'm very satisfied with the photo quality and with some technique it will work great. Really good price, but get an additional battery and a carry case; no brainer with any electronic camera. Wears out? Buy another one in a couple of years, they'll be better by then and it's not we're buying a Canon SLR to hand down to our children.",

In bright ambient light, the glare off the back screen can make it impossible to see what you're aiming the camera at. I just took a lot of pictures while pointed in the right general direction, and several were adequately framed, but I'd rather see what I'm aiming at.",

What's more, the camera's advanced technology ensures truly impressive quality in every shot, even at the long end of the zoom. The Canon HS System - a 16.1 megapixel high-sensitivity CMOS sensor and DIGIC 6 image processor - provides excellent detail and color in low light. Smart AUTO makes high-quality imaging easy in any situation, and Intelligent IS keeps shots clear and steady. Best of all, built-in Wi-Fi lets you transfer images and video directly to select social networking sites, mobile devices and your computer, so you can share from almost anywhere. Plus simply touch the camera to a compatible Android device using built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) for easy wireless connectivity.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nEXPERIENCE ULTRA ZOOMING POWER\nWhether you're capturing family activities, seeing the sights on vacation, or pursuing your favorite hobbies, you'll want the amazing zooming power of PowerShot SX700 HS at your side. With the camera's powerful 30x Optical Zoom, you can get right down onto the field to preserve a big play, reach deep into the forest for spectacular wildlife close-ups, and capture majestic architecture just the way you see it. What's more, the camera's advanced technology ensures truly impressive quality in every shot, even at the long end of the zoom. The Canon HS SYSTEM \u2013 a 16.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor and DIGIC 6 Image Processor \u2013 provides excellent detail and color in low light. Smart AUTO makes high-quality imaging easy in any situation, and Intelligent IS keeps shots clear and steady. Best of all, built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae lets you transfer images and video* directly to select social networking sites, mobile devices** and your computer, so you can share from almost anywhere. And simply touch the camera to a compatible Android\u2122 device*** using built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) for easy wireless connectivity.\n\n* Compatible with iOS versions 6.0/6.1/7.0, Android smartphone versions 2.3.3/4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3 and Android tablet versions 4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3. Data charges may apply.\n** With the download of the free Canon CameraWindow app. This software enables you to upload images to social network services. Before uploading images, please be aware that image files may contain privacy related information such as people and places. If necessary, please delete such information. Canon does not obtain, collect or use such images or any information included in such images through this software.\n*** Compatible with Android devices version 4.0 or later.\n\nPOWERFUL ZOOM, SPECTACULAR IMAGE QUALITY\n30X OPTICAL ZOOM\nNo matter the situation, you can be confident that the PowerShot SX700 HS camera's genuine Canon 30x Optical Zoom (35mm equivalent: 25\u2013750mm) will capture images with exceptional brilliance and clarity. Canon's innovative Intelligent IS system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. And Zoom Framing Assist delivers automatic tracking, so you can easily reframe long-zoom shots without losing your subject. Even the camera's easy-to-grip shape is specifically designed for a secure hold and steady shooting.\n\nZOOM FRAMING ASSIST\nThe PowerShot SX700 HS camera has the telephoto reach to capture subjects a long distance away using its powerful 30x Optical Zoom. At maximum telephoto, however, it can be challenging to track a moving subject. The Zoom Framing Assist seek function makes it much easier to use the camera's powerful zoom lens. When you press and hold the Zoom Framing Assist function button, the camera will automatically zoom out to include a wider angle of view, enabling you to more easily locate your moving subject. Once you find it, releasing the button will cause the lens to return to its original zoom position, intelligently keeping the subject in focus until you're ready to shoot and capture the perfect close-up moment. You can even make zoom adjustments while the button is pressed, with an animated assist frame that makes viewing easy. When the button is released, the lens will return to the adjusted zoom position.\n\nYou can also use Zoom Framing Assist to keep your subject's face the same size in your frame no matter how they move. Tap the Zoom Framing Assist function button to detect your subject's face. As your subject retreats and advances the camera automatically zooms in and out so their face remains the same size. It's especially useful for capturing the expressions of fast-moving children. And, for even more convenience, the Zoom Framing Assist function is also available when shooting video.\n\nSHARE IMAGES AND VIDEO WHEREVER AND WHENEVER\nBUILT-IN WI-FI\u00ae MAKES SHARING QUICK AND EASY\nThe PowerShot SX700 HS camera is equipped with built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae technology for on-the-go convenience when you want to share your photos and videos with friends, family and the whole world.

Canon does not obtain, collect or use such images or any information included in such images through this software.\n** Compatible with Android devices version 4.0 or later.\n\nPHENOMENAL IMAGES AND INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE START HERE\n16.1 MEGAPIXEL HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nThe PowerShot SX700 HS camera features a 16.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor to make even your everyday photography remarkable. The large sensor takes in more light, so images are clear and beautifully detailed. High ISO shots are particularly impressive, with less noise and expanded dynamic range. And the 16.1 Megapixel resolution gives you the flexibility to be more creative with your shots: crop and enlarge any part of an image \u2013 you can be confident that the detail and resolution you need are there.\n\nDIGIC 6 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe PowerShot SX700 HS camera is equipped with the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which makes several important advancements to image quality both in stills and video. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. The processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot SX700 HS, enabling high-speed, high quality continuous still image shooting at up to 8.5 frames per second. And video recording is better than ever, as the DIGIC 6 Image Processor enables Full HD at 60p, as well as MP4 recording. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices. Plus, with MF Peaking possible thanks to the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, you'll have a pro-level focusing tool at your disposal.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM\nThe PowerShot SX700 HS gives you the power to capture beautifully detailed, naturally lit images even in low light \u2013 reducing the need for flash and the occasionally unwelcome effects it produces. That's because the camera's 16.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works with the camera's latest generation DIGIC 6 Image Processor to create the Canon HS SYSTEM, specifically engineered for spectacular low-light performance. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you'll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality at ISO speeds up to ISO 3200; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.\n\nSTUNNING FULL HD VIDEO THAT'S BETTER THAN EVER\nCAPTURE STUNNING 1080P/60P FULL HD VIDEO WITH A DEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON\nThe PowerShot SX700 HS not only preserves your special video memories with spectacular realism and detail, but also does it in a format that makes them easy to share. You can simply press the dedicated movie button to start and stop video recording, so you're always ready to capture the moment as it happens. The camera records in stunningly realistic 1080p Full HD so even when played back on a big-screen HDTV, your videos are crystal clear, with smooth action and beautifully natural color. You can choose to record in 30 fps or 60 fps, so even fast-moving subjects are captured with crisp detail. And videos are recorded in MP4 format, perfectly sized for quick online sharing \u2013 whether you're showing relatives what the kids are up to or posting status updates on social networking sites.\n\nRETHINK PHOTOGRAPHY WITH CREATIVE SHOT\nCREATIVE SHOT MODE\nIn addition to its super-powerful 30x Optical Zoom, the PowerShot SX700 HS also turns out impressive artistic photos with Creative Shot mode. Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of advanced Canon technologies to analyze the individual scene, subject and exposure to apply any of 46 filter options. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five additional variations of the composition. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.\n\nSHARE WITH A SINGLE TOUCH\nMOBILE DEVICE CONNECT BUTTON\nIt's now easier than ever to connect your PowerShot SX700 HS camera to an iOS\u00ae or Android\u2122 device* using the Mobile Device Connect Button. The button allows you to choose to transfer images to your smartphone or tablet for immediate sharing with the CameraWindow app**, or to your computer on the same network with Image Sync to make saving and organizing your images easier. Once your device is registered on the camera, simply press the Mobile Device Connect button for easy connection.\n\nBy connecting to a smartphone with the CameraWindow app using the Mobile Device Connect Button, you can browse and share images while still leaving the camera inside a bag. It is also possible to turn off the PowerShot SX700 HS quickly and easily, directly from a smartphone. Once your camera is linked to your computer on the same wireless network, you can automatically transfer images to it, for easy saving and organizing of your photos. The Mobile Device Connect Button is great for quick and easy sharing from a fun day out with friends and family.\n\n* Compatible with iOS versions 6.0/6.1/7.0, Android smartphone versions 2.3.3/4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3 and Android tablet versions 4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3.

Canon does not obtain, collect or use such images or any information included in such images through this software.\n\nREMEMBER THE DAY IN CRISP HD\nHYBRID AUTO\nCapture the essence of special days \u2013 vacations, important occasions or any time you're shooting many shots in a day \u2013 using Hybrid Auto on the PowerShot SX700 HS. Hybrid Auto records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the day's clips and pictures* into a video. The feature also makes sure the \"highlight reel\" is stunningly beautiful by automatically recognizing the scene and optimizing camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.\n\n* Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS AND VIDEOS\nSMART AUTO\nSmart AUTO on the PowerShot SX700 HS makes capturing sharp, bright colorful images and video as simple as pressing the shutter button. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58 predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results. Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects, and landscapes at evening or on a bright snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as \"keeper\" shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot SX700 HS ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.\n\nSHOOTING MODES\nManual You have complete control of exposure, selecting both aperture and shutter speed manually. Aperture-priority You set the aperture, controlling depth-of-field. The camera automatically selects the shutter speed. Shutter-priority You select the shutter speed, and the camera automatically selects the appropriate aperture. Smart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Movie Digest & Hybrid Auto Automatically selects shooting settings for optimal quality and records a video clip every time you capture a still image. One day's worth of clips are then combined into a single video. Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions. Live View Control Enables Brightness, Color, and Tone adjustments to your images using easy-to-understand controls.

That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're shooting still images or video.\n\nStill Image Shooting Normal IS Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning IS Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. Video Recording Dynamic IS Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered IS Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting. Active Tripod IS When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake. ECO MODE\nThe PowerShot SX700 HS features ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when you're out shooting for the day or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. The mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed. With ECO Mode activated to conserve power, you can even stay connected for longer with the built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae featured on the camera. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the night, you can be assured your camera can keep up.",
