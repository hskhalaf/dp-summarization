Why are there these bumps everywhere?! It would probably be less painful if the bumps were not there. Seriously, who can do this long enough to get real exercise?",

I really like this hoop because you can add ir subtract the weights if you purchase the combo like I did. The only thing I expected to be different as said was the comfort around your waist or area after your session. I am still sore afterwards but it could be because I hoop daily for 1 hour nonstop and go at high speed intervals as well. But for a beginner hoopist this may be a little intimidating at first. But no pain. No gain.",
