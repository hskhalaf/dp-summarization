Tip: put your cream and sugar in the cup before you pour-over the coffee - that way it will mix as it brews! If you found my review helpful, please click Yes below! :)",

The best freshest tasting coffee ever! You can control how much coffee and water. I gave half away as gifts and I kept the other half. When I am done, I throw it in the dishwasher and it comes out clean. It is much better than a coffee maker in my opinion. It doesn't take up room on your counter and you don't get limescale buildup. The only disadvantage is heating up the water before pouring but it's worth it.",
