Small enough to be able to handle it easily but still has enough room to last the next 2 seasons. The glove pocket and middle 3 fingers are very soft. The thumb and pinky finger pockets seemed a little stiff but didn't seem to have any trouble closing it right out of box and I'm sure with use they will loosen up some as well. Great mit for ages 6-8.",
