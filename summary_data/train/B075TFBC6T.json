I am able to take the pallets apart by myself, only needing to use a longer bar over the handle once in a while for the really hard to lift boards. The nails are easy to remove after the boards are off, not like using the sawzaw where you still have the nail heads to deal with. Highly recommend this product.",

      "title": "Does the job, but the bar is flimsy",
      "text": "I picked this one out of the other pallet busters on Amazon because the two prongs on the bottom are flat instead of rounded, which helps me get between and under 2 pieces of wood that are close together. It actually works surprisingly and saved a lot of effort. The only downside to this piece compared to others is it ships in multiple sections that you have to assemble with nut and bolt tightening. Not hard to do, but during operation, that causes the bar to flex and wobble a lot more than if it were one solid bar, which makes it slightly harder to operate. Would have been 5 stars if it were 1 piece like others on Amazon.",

As a petite 51 year old, I have no idea how I would have dismantled a pallet without this tool. Now it still takes a little elbow grease and sweat but this worked exactly as stated. I took apart 2 pallets in about 1 hour 15 min. No broken boards. Struggled the most getting nails out. I know I will get faster as I already figured out a few tricks. The gloves are nice but way too big for a girl. And the extra tool probably has merit but I had much better luck with a hammer.",
