      "title": "True RAIN jacket",
      "text": "If you want a true rain jacket this is it, but bear in mind, this is actually more of a \"slicker\". The outer layer is a very lightweight, almost rubbery material, but is very flexible, very light. I should've realized this may be the case when the description states it's waterPROOF. It looks nice, fits nice, but I'll be returning it because it's not a jacket I would wear unless I was intending to be out in the rain or possibly in some boating instances. I'm looking for a light-weight jacket I can wear at anytime, and if it happens to start raining I have some protection.",

The color was perfect, and the size was too big, which means I could have gone smaller, which is a nice change for me. The only reason I did not keep it was it was not light weight enough for me. I would recommend it to anyone who may be traveling to a cooler climate, it seems very easy to pack.",

      "text": "First off, yes - it is WATERPROOF, not just \"water resistant\" or \"water repellent.\" If your goal is to stay dry, this jacket is for you. The reflective accents are well placed and very visible. Overall quality/construction is excellent. The ventilation is good for casual walking/normal activities, but beware if you run or engage in other vigorous activities (e.g biking to work) - break a serious sweat in this things and it could double as a sauna suit. As to fit, I'm 5'4\", 135 pounds and athletic, and a medium has plenty of room for layering (plus the sleeves are just the right length). Paired with the right rain boots, it's even kinda cute.",

The fabric does not have one ounce of stretch and does not breathe, so it's great for waterproof just gets stuffy. They do have some vents cut in which is nice. I guess I just wish it was roomier in the stomach and hips. Black color looked nice and half the price of most similar products.",

Sleeves are a little long but it is a rain jacket and helps keep your hands dry. Velcro straps at wrists to help keep sleeves up and fitted should you choose to. Excellent waterproofness and breathes VERY well to spite a few other comments. Excellent rain jacket.",

It is definitelty waterproof and will keep you dry on the rainiest days.",

I just want it just to, to have another color. I would love to have the red and black, but obviously that one is very popular.",

I used it in the rain and then hung it on a hook on the inside of my closet door to drip dry. The wet sleeve was touching the painted door and when it dried the sleeve stuck to the paint on the door. I had to peel the sleeve from the door and when I did that it pulled the paint off the door and the paint is now adhered to my jacket. So be careful where you hang it when it is wet.",

I've worn it in the rain a couple of times and it kept me dry. I didn't get sweaty as you sometimes do with rain wear in the summer. I'm really looking forward to getting a lot of use for it this fall. Its a tapered fit, so it won't take a lot of bulk underneath, but a cardigan should fit nicely with it. Well worth the money.",
