The hand strengthener is my favorite out of the bunch. It seems very sturdy and has a lot of resistance.",

In addition the highest setting, supposedly 40 kg, can't be anywhere near that difficulty. I ended up putting a sticky note around the handle to prevent blisters. The original \"slick\" handle that I had on my prior grip strengthener was definitely more comfortable.",

It also helps you understand which hand is stronger than the other and how much work you need to even them out. I bought my dad a set and he's a weight lifter and he loves this set. He likes that there are options in the set for strengthening because these items weren't around when he was younger.",
