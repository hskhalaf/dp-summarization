      "title": "INSTALLATION WAS A CHALLENGE",
      "text": "Shipping was very quick and the oven/microwave arrived in perfect condition. Installation was a bit of a challenge because of how the electric was routed through this unit as compared to the one we were replacing. This is no fault of the new unit, just the way it was for us. The look of this unit is great, and we love all of the features. It looks as though you can replace the microwave in the future if there are issues with it. With our old unit, we couldn't replace just the microwave. This one appears that you can. So far, so good. We like it!",

I love this unit! It's beautiful. Was pretty easy to install. I've read some reviews about the fan running for a long period of time after you turn the oven off, It doesn't seem to bother me.",

By the time it arrived everything was ready and by the end of the day it was installed and running. My wife just loves it. Huge amount of special features.",

The reason i rated it four stars is because was i missing two screws that held the microwave to the oven.The microwave light is very dim, needs to brighter. I had to run my power cord through the top because my power plug was located at the top. After i got it installed i was very happy with the purchase.I like the idea that you can replace the microwave by removing the 4 screws at the bottom if needed.",

This one the blower on the convection literally blows your breads, muffins and such so they cook with a windblown side bent look, the heat is uneven, the bottom of baked goods will burn while the top does not brown. We are trying to make do and learn this oven but it has been a trial. As this is one of Frigidaire's flagship line of appliances I certainly expected more. The microwave works like a standard microwave.",

I chose this model because of the price, reviews, and looks, plus the free Prime Shipping to my house. It looks nice, works great. It's small but all I use it for is heating up frozen meals, warming dinner plates and hot water for tea/coffee. I bought the smaller one, and it uses less power, which is a good thing. I live alone so there are no big meals to cook. Perfect for a single person. Hope this lasts as long as the last one did.",
