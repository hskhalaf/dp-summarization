Have had many problems with humidifiers that had filters collecting tons of mold etc....Which caused me to continually replace filters which got very expensive. But this one is great. Just note that you need to do cleaning on a regular basis... And specifically on the \u201cmuffler\u201d...You can see that part shown on page 7 in the instruction book. I actually found out that you can Snap it right out and soak it in vinegar water then use a Q-tip to wipe down each segment. I do that also to the nozzle... And then take a paper towel to clean in the tube between the nozzle and the muffler. Hopefully that helps... Enjoy Hydrated skin!!!!",

The light does not turn off when you turn of the humidifier- not a negative but just something to be aware of if you don\u2019t want to hit an extra button but it is nice to just use as a nightlight when you don\u2019t need the extra humidity.

You also have to soak it in vinegar water every week to prevent scale buildup. It\u2019s too high maintenance for me. I\u2019m using a Vick\u2019s one now that doesn\u2019t have the mildew smell problem. I wish I had realized this before my return period was up so I could have returned it!",

To me, the fact that It is BPA-free was the most attractive factor. It means you can keep yourself from potentially hazardous chemicals. After using it, I could start breathing well again. It runs on high at least for 10 hours, so I can sleep with it turned on. Overall, I am happy with this purchase!",
