The power switch is a joystick like button.",

Running now on 2560x1080 native at 75hz. Anyone debating do not hisitate. I love love love this monitor. The colors are perfect.

I will say that this will not work natively with Apple products. They do not support the 2560x1080 resolution that this screen requires. I had to buy a third party app called SwitchResX in order to use it properly. It is only a $5 one time by for it so it is well worth it in my book!",

(I know its a minor thing but I will forever be asking why they could not make it adjustable...) The 2nd reason.. it is too small. To compensate for the wide resolution, the height resolution is much smaller than I had realized. I had read other reviews that made this point and I should have listened to them.",

      "text": "Beautiful monitor, great image (at least for general use -- I'm not doing video or image editing). The main reason I took away one star is the placement of the jacks in the back seems a little short-sighted; they are right in the middle, so when trying to hook up a monitor to a mount they can get in the way, especially as the HDMI cable sticks out quite a bit. I had to get a 90 degree HDMI adapter, and even then it's in the way. Aside from that I'm happy with the purchase. Split screen feels like two proper work spaces.",

The only downside is the response time of 5ms however overclocking your refresh rate makes it feel more responsive and overall a great monitor. I would not use this for FPS because there is a noticeable response time. My wife loves it and everything is beautiful as it has a IPS screen.",

So much screen rel-estate. Only downside I could think of is manually setting the ratios for all of my games but who cares really. Also movies and stuff play with the black bars ofcourse but there are google chrome extensions to fix this. Over all, I love it.",
