Straps a very comfortable and the cross chest straps are removable and repositionable for a number of different heights. The straps are really durable, too. They connect to the bag with super heavyweight material, and I can't see them ever working loose or fraying. A bulletproof bag for commuting or travel.",

The laptop sleeve that only unzips halfway is a nice touch as it does not have the option to fly open all the way at the weight of the rest of your bag. My computer always feels secure.",

I like that the shoulder straps are able to twist a little at the connection with the bag to make getting it on and off easier. My only gripe, and I think it's a big one is that the laptop opening is a little awkward because the zipper does not open all the way across the top of the bag. They say it is for convenience and quick access to your laptop, but I find it more annoying than anything else. Had a known or paid closer attention, I may have chosen another of their bags.",

My only issue with it is the shoulder straps aren't quite as comfortable as I was hoping for, but I haven't had any major issues and I have stuffed this bag full and carried it around for awhile, so it may just be some primary discomfort, not long term. All of the pockets are perfect and function just the way I had hoped. Would highly recommend to anyone who needs a backpack for work.",
