Unfortunately the packaging for the two 37/80 locks I received had been cut open and the main cardboard piece that contains the lock name and information was missing. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal to me if it had been any other product, but the locks include coding cards in the event you lose the keys or need to get new ones cut. Who knows who has this information since the packaging had been cut open? The lock deserves 5 stars - but I'm leaving 1 star because the item wasn't new as described.",

      "text": "Seriously secure, but at a premium price. It's a no-nonsense lock for sure. It's quite big and quite heavy, so it's great for storing my bike at home, but would be hard to use on anything you want to take with you. My only complaint is that the hasp is not captive, when you unlock it you can remove it entirely. Not a big deal, but I'd personally prefer if it stayed affixed and just swiveled out of the way. Easier to prevent it from getting lost.",

It would be really easy to jack someones trailer so I suggest y'all lock up your boat trailers while you're out playing on the lake.
