I'm afraid all the pieces will start to peel if the cookie sheet's coating is this weak. You also can't return just one piece of the set, it's all or nothing. So it seems neither Chef Land or Amazon will help me unless I ship everything back, not very customer service friendly. Either I have one defective piece or the entire set is very low quality - time will tell.",

Lo and behold, the sheet had buckled horribly, and with enough force to not only dislodge a couple of the snickerdoodles I'd been making but to launch them clear off the cookie sheet and onto the oven rack.
