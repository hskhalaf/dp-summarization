So with her vet's opinion, she's been on it for over a year and probably will stay on it forever. It seems to keep her system smooth and plus, she loves the taste and getting some \"gravy\" on her dinner every night!",

Unfortunately pro-biotics have a limited effect on gut flora, lasting approximately two weeks. I wish they worked better for long term management of chronic GI issues, but that is no fault of Fortiflora, just simply a limitation that is important to understand. Acute issues, fantastic. Chronic issues, leaves much to be desired.",

I decided to try Fortiflora, after trying another probiotic unsuccessfully, to help minimize this problem. This is a miracle product! She's been on Fortiflora for over a year and hasn't had a single incident of vomiting. It works wonders for her digestive system. Purchasing it from amazon ensures quick and reliable delivery, and a good price!",

This product makes a noticeable difference in his stool quality as well as his general demeanor. While it isn't an inexpensive product, it is worth every penny. He doesn't seem to even notice, or perhaps just doesn't mind it, when It is sprinkled on top of his dry food. I use this product daily when I notice symptoms of his allergies and 3/4 times weekly the rest of the year. Overall, this product seems to improve my dogs general health.",

With good food (Iams for older dogs), strict portion control, and this supplement, we've seen a dramatic difference in his energy level, along with healthy, regular stool output and stable weight control. Dry Yougurt for dogs. . . it works! Absolutely buy it on line through Amazon or one of their sponsored vendors. The local vet gouges everyone for it at $32 per box--that's over a dollar a day--we got it on line in a bundle of 3 for half the cost per box.",

It's been over 2 months since his last (sorry for the bluntness!) bloody stool and his energy level and overall mood have been great.
