After wearing these gloves for three hours, my hands were still more dry and cool compared to the pair of gloves I ordered 6 months ago from a more mainstream company. The wrist strap goes all the way around your wrist which makes this pair of gloves safer than those pairs that only strap a little bit over the wrist. I'm very happy with this product. I found my new pair of gloves! Excellent work, Elite Sports.",

Anyone who has ever blocked a flurry of punches and been caught on the wrist knows it sucks. These eliminate that issue in a pretty simple way. I'll also say these things are very comfortable. Easy to slide on over hand wraps and quick to get off as well. 5 stars!",

I'm pretty petite, but the gloves do not feel too big or bulky and I'm very happy with how they've felt when hitting the bag hard. Would definitely recommend!",

The wrap around the wrist area is wide and has a very snug feel once secured. I have dedicated bag gloves, so these are more for light sparring and kickboxing combos. On the sparring side, they are not too big to where they are easily blocked and have enough cushion to protect both sides. No issues hitting the bag hard a few times, though. Simply hard to beat at the price point!",

They are comfortable and fit so well on my hands I absolutely love them and all Elite products. And the prices are amazing for such top quality gear. I highly recommend Elite products to everyone looking to buy combat sports equipment.",

But within a couple of month of using them, the black leather started to come off on one of the gloves and then after using them regularly for less than 6 months one of the gloves developed a tear along its stitching on the wrist. I would not recommend these gloves if you want them for long-term use.",

They are way more comfortable than I anticipated, which is surprising because I knew they would be the nicest gloves I've owned to date. The gel really makes a difference in the ring, which makes them my new go-to gloves. These top-of-the-line gloves are light, durable, and most importantly comfortable.
