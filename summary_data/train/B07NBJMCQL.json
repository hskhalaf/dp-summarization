In the medical field I\u2019m on my feet a lot and the cushion these provide is amazing. I laugh at those comments that they were a little heavy, really?! How can you tell such a tiny bit of difference? The comfort more then makes up for that insignificant thing. Great shoe for walking as well as running you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

    "description": "Altra Olympus 3.5 Trail Running Shoes The Olympus 3.5 has been revamped for more support, stability and traction on any terrain. A breathable mesh upper is coupled with a flexible and responsive midsole whilst a Vibram Megagrip outsole ensure traction in varied conditions. Breathable Mesh Upper Engineered mesh uppers will encase each foot in breathable comfort. Lightweight and highly breathable for all-temperature comfort, the mesh acts as a lightweight second skin, providing a supportive and comfortable fit. Its perforated construction allows air to fully permeate the entire upper, letting your feet breathe when the temperature starts to rise or your training session heats up. The upper is also highly durable thanks to synthetic overlays which swathe the upper for increased support. The abrasion-resistant overlays provide enhanced durability to reduce the risks of chafing and irritation. The upper construction also features foot-shape technology which allows the toes to be relaxed within the shoe. It allows them to spread out naturally with the big toe remaining in a straight position for additional comfort, speed and stability. An Altra-exclusive GaiterTrap has been updated to a new 4-point system to keep an attached gaiter even more secure than before, thus preventing debris from entering the shoe. Completing the upper is a lacing system which locks down the midfoot to reduce in-shoe slippage so you can enjoy distraction-free strides. EVA Midsole A full-length platform of EVA resides underfoot for lightweight, responsive cushioning. Generous, soft and durable, it spares your joints as you strike down onto hard, unforgiving surfaces. Exceptionally lightweight, the EVA ensures long-lasting cushioning to keep you comfortable on long-distance days. EVA is extremely firm, which will absorb shocks instantly and effectively, preventing them from causing any damage to the sole of the foot. The energy produced from this will also be returned as rebound, which",
