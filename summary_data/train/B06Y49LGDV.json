A few weeks ago, I came across the lavender and bergamot candle. I got 2, and presented one as a gift to a friend (by the way, she loved it). I hadn't lit mine until now. Wow. The subtle smell is so relaxing and elegant that I'm very tempted to leave it on all the time. In summary, I highly recommend this candle to everybody, perfect gift, incredible for meditating and to give that touch (smell) of luxury to your home.",

I'm sure that many people would really enjoy the smell but it reminded me too much of birthday cake.",
