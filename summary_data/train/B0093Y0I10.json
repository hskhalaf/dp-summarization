One container will last me anywhere from 6 months to a year, depending on how often I wear it and and how much I put on. I do wear it at least five times a week and wear my eyeliner on the heavier side. It comes with a small brush that makes it incredibly easy to apply. I will never go back to pencils or liquid liner.",

It will last forever and it doesn't transfer when I use it underneath my upper lash line (especially once it sets), nor does it smudge once it's set. Honestly, this is huge for me. I didn't think I'd love it as much as I do but it's seriously a game changer for me that I had to write this review.",

The product applied fine, nothing special but it did not have that much color. When I put on black eyeliner I expect it to look black. But what my real problem with the product is that it had no staying power. An hour after applying it I looked like I did not have eye liner on. Very disappointing.",

This is just right. Almost a creamy clay texture. And can I just say, where have you been all my life sepia??? I love that color. It reads black, but isn't so harsh with more natural colors, or light clothes/hair. I use them both all the time. And boy do they last a long time. I think I'll never hit bottom. Oh, an angled liner brush has been a godsend with gel eyeliner for me.",
