Very comfortable and suitable for a long day of walking the course. The soles don't offer as much grip as a spike, but are great because they are almost self clearing. Only on the wettest days do I have to clean any dirt and debris from the sole. And they're good on a variety of surfaces, safe for carpet, tile, wood, etc. And speaking of the wettest days, the shoes keep my feet perfectly dry. And the leather has held up very well from multiple soakings. Couldn't be happier with these shoes.",

The leather is soft and the insoles are supportive. Recently, I played 36 holes with one of my sons and I couldn't believe how I didn't have that worn out feeling when I wore my Adidas 360s. I've worn them in wet conditions and they held up well. The quality build is unmatched. Excellent job, ECCO!",

I was hoping with wear this would go away but they are still popping. Also they are constantly coming untied which is also annoying. Disappointed with these shoes that I paid close to 200.00 for.",
