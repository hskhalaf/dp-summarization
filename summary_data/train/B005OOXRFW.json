Pack-n-Play mattresses are segmented, so standard fitted sheets with elastic compress them, causing the foam to buckle and a creating a gap between the end of the mattress and the side of the Pack-n-Play. These fitted sheets are perfectly sized for the mattress, but don't have elastic, so they stay in place without any creasing while allowing the mattress to lie flat and fully expanded. The fabric isn't ultra-soft, but it's fine, perfectly comfortable for baby.",

It's baggy and has no way to be fitted to the mattress for the play yard bassinet. It's probably okay, but I paid for a specialized product, not something okay for my newborn. Trying to reduce the risk of SIDS here Graco.....come on.",
