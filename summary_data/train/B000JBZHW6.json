Has thin, non-cushioned upper material (the previous pairs had thicker cushiony insulated straps), and they are decidedly uncomfortable. My teenage daughter is wearing and doesn't have issues like me, a mom who has thinner skin and needs more comfort than looks. Heck, even the looks are much less quality too. Disappointed with the quality which is not up to the Reef standards I am used to. And I would have NEVER paid $28 for these cheezy flip flops knowing this. I will look and buy in-person next time",

Why keep changing a product for the worst?? I've read countless reviews (which I agree with) about how much better the old style of sole is. Now they're shrinking the size?

The textured sole makes them grip the ground better, so you're less likely to trip in slippery areas. They also last FOREVER.",

      "text": "I have bought and re-bought this pair of flip-flops for several years. It's my go-to style; as a Floridian, these are practically year round wardrobe staples. The Ginger model is sleek while still maintaining the Reef \"squish\" that is so appealing. The strap part is a ribbony-fabric style that is smooth on feet unlike the plastic thongs many similar pairs seem to be favoring now. I especially like this style in black and brown particularly. In my experience these fit true to size, and are best for average to narrower feet.",

      "text": "Well, I was pleasantly surprised by these Reef Flip Flops. I am a devoted Reef wearer but I have never ordered them online. This was a new style of flip flop for me (with the knit like stitching instead of the leather straps) so I wasn't sure if I would like them. I really love them! They felt small at first, however after wearing them around for one day they stretched enough to fit perfectly on my feet. I wear them daily. My last pair of Reefs lasted about 10 years so they are WORTH every penny. I highly recommend getting yourself a pair!",

      "text": "I have always been a fan of Reef flip flops and these are an excellent pair. The thin straps are perfect for people who have small or narrow feet because they over-power your foot like the thick strap of other flip flops like Rainbow. These flip flops are also very comfortable and form to your feet. The straps on them do not rub or cause blisters either and the flip flop itself is very bendable so it works with you when you walk and won't make your feet feel achy at all.",

They're comfortable enough to wear all day and provide some arch support. They mold to your foot so they become even more comfortable after a while. And the straps are light and soft, so they don't dig in even when brand new. The slim straps also look great on the foot and have an understated look. You can wear these with anything...skirts, shorts, dresses, etc.",
