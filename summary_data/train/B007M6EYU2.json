Add a 32GB microSD card and you can have a Samsung quality 40GB media player for about $120, Who needs a fancy Android 4.x device when you really just want to listen to music, watch movies and check the weather and Google maps? It is also small enough to fit in a normal pocket, which is untrue for many of the monstrous \"mobile\" devices they make these days. Do you really need something with a 5\" screen with you all the time?",

I didn't want to spend the hundred of dollars to get a new iPod. While this is a good player, and I like it, here's my review. Pros: -Music plays well. -Video isn't bad. -Size makes it convenient to carry around. -You can have up to 32 extra GBs if you place a microsd card in it. Cons: -Battery life sucks. Lasts only about 3 hours. -The small size does make this not good for playing games.",

I can listen to from when I wake up (about 9 a.m.) and won't turn it off until 10 p.m. then I won't turn it off or charge it that night and when I play it again the next morning, I'll still have at least 50% battery left. But I usually don't have the WiFi on. I haven't taken pictures with it so I can't comment on the quality. Overall, I love it.",

For some reason the thing goes back to the desktop and the music has to be restarted. This seems to only happen once but that is still one time to many in my opinion. Once restarted things go just fine. Also as a music player the battery life is to short with under two hours play time. Really was just not the item that I was looking for. Maybe just to many other functions other than playing music.",

She has previously destroyed a tablet and a HTC Windows phone so I really was hesitant to make an expensive purchase again. When I started looking at touch screen MP3's I knew that I wanted a name brand (besides APPLE). I first was hesitant because it is a refurbished product. Just the ideas that it had been fixed for whatever reason didn't sit well with me, but after comparing prices and products I know that this was the best decision. This is perfect for her. It's even great for us adults. It has everything my S5 has but in a smaller version. Samsung rock's.",

Best of luck browsers. Edit: If you're still interested in buying, go with BigOutlet. They were quick to respond to my issue and replaced the broken device without question.

      "text": "So sad that this great little player is discontinued by Samsung! We were very happy to find it here, even refurbished. It does everything you would want. Was worried about being refurbished, but it works great right out of the box, no problems at all. Connects to wifi, download apps, plays music, games, photos. Only negative is the lack of cases available. It is not the same size as any of the other Samsung products, and the buttons etc are in the wrong spots for similar size cases, so still working on that.",

However, I didnt buy it for that. I bought it solely to play music, which is does a great of. I love android, absolutely think its better than apple. Buy this and toss in a 32GB microSD card, youll have all the room for music you need. definitely recommend this to anyone who loves android, but doesn't want to store all their music on their phone.",

Next time I think I will just spend the extra to get it brand new rather than refurbished and hopefully, it will last a little bit longer. I only gave it two stars because it lasted less than a month, otherwise I would've given it at least a four.",
