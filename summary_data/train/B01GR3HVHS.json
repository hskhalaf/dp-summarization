I was about to buy it in Sephora but the amazon price was cheaper, so I order it from here, but after a few weeks I'm very dissapointed; I've had sunburns even few minutes after application, now I'm concerned about the fact that could be fake and that would explain the price difference... is this even possible been Tatcha the seller?",

Similar to the silk canvas, this does have a slightly pink-ish/purplish cast when spread over the skin, but for me it does go away (I currently Have light-medium skin with yellow/neutral undertones). It definitely feels like a primer and I wanted to try using it that way as well since I do feel it makes my face slightly matte. Even without makeup, this lasts pretty well and doesn\u2019t leave me feeling totally greasy (I have oily acne prone skin).",
