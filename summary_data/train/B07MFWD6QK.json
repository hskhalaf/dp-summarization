      "text": "You get a strong sound from impact with the ball. If you hit it well you will have much improved distance over older clubs. I used iron shafts for the Burner set and these also. I think the clubs are better than my ability, I make at least 10 to 15 years more distance out of the new clubs. Well worth the upgrade. The other day we were at a water hole, at least a 120 yard carry over water to a thin green. 135 yards to the pin. I used a 9 iron and over drove the green. My partner used a 7 iron and landed in the water. Very happy with the upgrade.",
