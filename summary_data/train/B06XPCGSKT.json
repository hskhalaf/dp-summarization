      "text": "I have been using a friends washer and decided I needed my own. This Champion was an awesome choice. It is powerful and portable and easy to operate. It started on the second pull and works just like I'd hoped. My sons are already taking dibbs on who gets to use it next. I don't know why I waited so long to get this Champion pressure washer. It does what its advertised. 2600 psi is more than enough for any household project on my to do list. What a great tool!",

The old one died half way through cleaning my 20'x 20' deck. With the Champion, I finished in half the time it took to do the first half. Setting up the machine was simple. Instructions were easy to follow and it started on the first pull. Great power, great price. Wish I'd bought sooner.",

Worked great and saved a lot of time. Then while I was at it, power washed the siding of the house. Made our white shutters look new again. Along with our patio furniture! This thing was so nice I pretty much washed everything!! So nice for cars too, especially being in a dirt road. Made our pavers look new again too. This is so easy to use and does so much. Saves a lot of time you would otherwise be scrubbing. Haven't had an issue yet.",
