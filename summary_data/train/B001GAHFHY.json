Pros: They're strong plastic looms They are basic so most patterns online will work with it Four different sizes including kid's and infant hat sizes Cons: The plastic is not durable and I already broke a peg The knitting instructions were really confusing The knitting tools are NOT durable. I've already had to purchase a new knitting needle. I would recommend this loom set for new knitters. There are lots of tutorials online and I have made several hats. I want some more looms (maybe a little more durable).",

You can round Loom even blankets, cloths, socks, sky is the limit. This set is very sturdy! Very thick! I really love that! Great price!",

I used two stands of No 4 Lion Brand Yarn (very good yarn) and it will not fit all size lower grade children. I am very disappointed. The hat turned out great with the knitted-in brim. I love the looms, just need one more for a little large size childs hat. Thank You. I would order it immediately.",

I know this sounds cheesy, but its true, most places that sell looms individually charge 10+ dollars, but then this deal saved me so much cash. I love my looms.",
