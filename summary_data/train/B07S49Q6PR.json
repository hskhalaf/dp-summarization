Fungus nails are thick with broken edges and \"crud\" buildup at the tips. Options were cuticle chemicals which can burn skin and can't be used very often. Regular flat nail files & nail blocks abrade the good tissue/nail while not often touching the fungus areas. Plus... its just plain hard work!

This box is annoying and if you have arthritic hands somewhat difficult and inconvenient to open. I think I will take the molded plastic base and just put the tools in the zippered case, leaving them loose. Power seems good and the attachments are as described.",

I also love that it is cordless because then your not stuck to doing your nails in one spot or being connected to a cord. The battery life is also very good I can do my nails at least two times off one charge.I have had mine for a few months now and the only complaint I have is now that I have used it so much it is noisier and sometimes makes a mound grinding noise when I first turn it on, this usually stops though. It still works great though and I would highly recommend to anyone especially at home nails.",

I like the fact that the speed can be controlled by pressing a + or - button on the device. You twist the base of the handle to turn it on or off.
