It takes the camera 2 to 3 seconds to focus and by the time the camera captures the picture you miss the moment. In addition the picture quality is very poor. I would not recommend buying this camera unless you want a rechargeable battery, slow focus, and poor quality pictures.",

I am not sure if they are functions or not but, in both modes I tried tapping the button to focus what I am looking at. If in picture mode then the hold the button to snap the picture. If in movie mode tap to focus works or hold the button and it will try to focus and record at once. Try to freak tweak it, it will try to do some of your bidding,,,,",
