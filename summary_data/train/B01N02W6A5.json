They also appreciated its lightweight disposition and its versatile construction. But there were those who noticed a bevy of discrepancies which made the product less appealing. These inconsistencies in the design prevented it from becoming a go-to choice for those who desire form and function in a stylish package.",

        "The lightweight disposition of this product was lauded by most runners",
        "People have used this running shoe for various activities such as casual walks and even weightlifting",

I have been having a difficult time finding a pair of all black running shoes, so I'm going to hope these stretch to fit, since I believe going up another half size may be too much. At best these could be OKAY casual walking shoes. Running shoes they are definitely not.",

Also the seller i got it from sent me a customer return obviously as the laces were undone (not tied together like when its new) and soles were slightly dirty. Shoes still looked new but i can tell someone tried it one and walked around outside with it but i guess thats Amazon for you these days, all 2nd rate, customer returns, open box, blemished/refurb or closeout stuff sold as new.",

It stretched out after two weeks so it\u2019s OK now. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s black. It always irritates me when you buy pants or shirts the black color always runs tighter. ====== Update 8/14/2018 ====== Today, part of the coral-colored tread insert de-laminated. I'm noticing other portions of the tread are separating on the other shoe as well. Dropping from 4 stars to 3 stars.",
