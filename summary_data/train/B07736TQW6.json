I love that I can match the tag colors to the collars. The only thing I don't like is that the glow-in-the-dark silencer ring pops off the tag from time to time.

After less than a month the shallow engraving has becomes defaced and scratched, and some lines cannot be deciphered at all. It's back to the lesser expensive, longer lasting tags for us.",
