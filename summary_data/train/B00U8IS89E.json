For air cooling your only options will be stock cooler or an extremely low profile aftermarket cooler as the PSU is directly above the CPU.",

With it being so small It does run on the hot side as idle temps are in the 60c range so a front fan is essential unless you're running a watercooler. I'm running AMD's supplied heat sink, although it fits a water cooler is recommended. There's definitely no room for an aftermarket heat sink.

      "text": "It's a great tiny case for the money with a couple of caveats.. One of the LEDs came loose out of its tube but wiring was intact so just re-hot-glued it in place. I would recommend a modular SFX sized power supply due to space. 140mm front case fan doesn't fit with 10.5 inch (maximum for case) EVGA gtx-1080 SC card unless you drill new holes (too wide) so easier to go with 120mm fan. Don't put the power supply in until last! Connect the wires from the case to the motherboard before putting in the video card. Plan on using 2.5\" SSDs due to space constraints and heat. Have fun!",

Removing the top cover can be a bit finicky unless you take your time to line to line the two sides and top carefully. The screws seem a bit rough to install sometimes. I like the lighting on the front panel. Plenty of room, but still not a big footprint.",

I personally fit a 140mm ATX PSU in here (turned downward to act as an exhaust) with a Corsair H60 AIO (Silverstone recommends an AIO for this case, due to the lack of clearance for tall air coolers).

Only have one fan for the H90 (upgraded to Noctural 140mm fan) and asrock mini 2011-v3 mb controls the speed to low unless temp spikes on heavy load which is no big deal (rare). Do yourself a favor and get the reduced length power supply by coolermaster or silverstone which makes fitting stuff like the watercooler easier.",
