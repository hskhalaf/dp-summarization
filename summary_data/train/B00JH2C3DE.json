She is extremely picky about personal care products. She loves this dryer. Faster and more gentle on her hair even after prolonged drying. The water infusion technology works for her.

Every other blow dryer I've ever used has made my hair feel dry and brittle, but this one makes it feel soft and healthy. I would buy this product 100x over.",

    "description": "The powerful Panasonic nanoe EH-NA65-K Moisture Infusion Hair Dryer with advanced nanoe ionic hair dryer technology makes it quick and easy to blow dry and style hair. Unlike other ionic hair dryers and blow dryers, the 1875-Watt nanoe Panasonic hair dryer draws naturally occurring moisture from the air and transforms it into micro-size particles containing 1,000 times more moisture than regular ionic hair dryers. As you blow dry and style, the micro nanoe moisture particles are infused into each hair shaft to minimize frizz while strengthen and shielding hair from over-drying and damage often caused by everyday brushing after using a typical blow dryer. The result is smooth, shiny, beautiful-looking hair. The EH-NA65 Panasonic nanoe Hair Dryer features two hair dryer professional speeds \u2014 high and low \u2014 and three temperature settings \u2014 hot, warm and cool \u2014 to accommodate different hair styles and types. This Panasonic hair dryer also includes three professional quality nanoe hair dryer - attachments for styling and touchups. The Panasonic nanoe Quick-Dry Nozzle delivers both soft and strong airflows designed for faster, more even drying. A Concentrator Nozzle focuses nanoe hair dryer airflow for targeted, precision styling and a Diffuser creates body and volume. The Panasonic nanoe hair dryer also features a cool-shot button, heavy-duty hair dryer professional 9-ft., 360\u00b0 rotating power cord with a hanging loop and a removable, easy-to-clean filter.",
