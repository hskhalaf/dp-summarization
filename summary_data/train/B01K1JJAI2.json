      "text": "Absolutely horrible. Nearly impossible to operate because of the \"safety\" button. It's positioned on the trigger, and you can't operate it with one hand. The button is spring-loaded and does not stay in--as soon as you release the trigger, it locks. You have to press the button with your other hand which is dangerous! Ridiculous design. There is so much side-to-side wobble in the blades (and yes, they're properly connected and inserted) that you can't even cut crusty bread. I have a 30+ year old Kenmore electric knife that I will keep using. This is the worst product I have ever purchased, and I've purchased a lot.",

      "text": "This Electric Knife was reviewed at American Test Kitchen as the best. We decided to buy it. The price was excellent. This was very easy to use and extremely easy to clean. There is a button to lock it for safety. The on button is very easy to press with one's thumb. We carved a turkey and were extremely impressed about how well it worked to carve the turkey. We wish that we had bought this last Thanksgiving. We had it for this year's Thanksgiving and it did an excellent job. Plus the price was only $19.99 and it arrived a day early via our Prime Membership. We suggest that anyone who needs an electric knife try this one.",

However, the knife doesn't cut very well and was barely able to cut a flat iron steak without helping it along. I soon gave up and went with a regular knife, which cut the steak like butter. The motor seems good but the blades are much duller compared to the cuisinart blades. I guess I'll be buying the brushes for the cuisinart.",

The locking feature is fantastic to have in a house with three kids in it. The blades are easy to remove for cleanup and have held up well to multiple runs through the dishwasher.
