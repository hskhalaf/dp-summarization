The bottom right is created with this product AND a flash diffuser made by the same company. I highly recommend this product to someone in the same position as me. It's half the price of other speedlites and works flawlessly.",

If it's not working on your camera, you have to first turn your camera to \"manual\" then turn the display off. Then the flash works. For some reason, it would not flash when I had the display screen on. However, right after you take the picture, it will still display on your screen for 3 seconds. You just do not have the ability to live view through the screen.",

While the mounting shoe may be standard, it does not mean it's 100% compatible with this camera, in my experience. The other issue was the weight and size compared to the camera. It made the camera feel really heavy and cumbersome.",

This works great when you have it as master on your hotshoe. However when it is a slave flash, kind of hard to get it to sync. I have a a6500 and sony flash. For reason unknown, the camera is not able to capture Neewer's flash consistently and presents issues in the expected light scheme. Maybe its cuz i just don't know what I am doing, but I think i'll stick with the original manufacturer stuff. Really wish I could like this flash because its well built and solid.

If you want high end, or are a professional that can't use a flash without meter and other itens to tell you how to set up this is wrong for you. If you know what you're doing or just want it for family photos it's worth the price but not much more.",

My oldest one just recently broke (the head got stuck & wouldn't tilt anymore) but considering that it lasted over 4 years with heavy use, I consider it a great value and I didn't mind replacing it for $30! Many of my photographer friends are surprised to learn that I use a manual flash, especially because it has been more reliable than some of their name-brand TTL speedlites!",

Worked quick for fast paced movements and caught dancing and laughter well with ample lighting that suits it just right. So simple and easy to use both on or off my panasonic camera! They reacted together and formed a great team! Eight levels of power level adjustments so I can achieve bright as well as low lighting. So portable since it takes batteries, I love using it.",

It syncs well with other flashes in slave mode, or can control them itself. Plenty of settings and options to get that perfect lighting. I've used it to take photos of people for portraits, product photos, macro lighting, outdoor evenings with reflectors and so on. It's a versatile flash.

TIPS: This flash uses a standard hotshoe so you should be able to use it on any camera except some old Sony/Minoltas. The flash will recycle faster with rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries last longer per charge too. The Yongnuo YN560IV will recycle about twice as fast but the power output appears to be the same. It does cost over twice as much though.",
