We have actually (the UW Transplant group) have made the decision to change from our screen spirometers to this hand held and app product because it is so user friendly and it tracks more accurately with out having you as the patient blow too many times, because lets face it, when you have bad lungs- reblowing to get the machine to register actually makes things worse! Very pleased with it.",

Optical sensors in the unit measure the rpm and duration to determine you measurements. Very ingenious!",

I'd like to have all three to be able to say confidently it wasn't an aberrant reading. If it reads 720, 610 and 605 it will just keep the 720 when the low 600s is more likely the correct reading. #2. I can't find replacement spacers. I know it's supposed to be a personal spirometer, but who isn't going to let others try it when it is so cool and who wants to share a spacer!?",
