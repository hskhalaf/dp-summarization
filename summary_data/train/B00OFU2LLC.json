One negative is that the metal ladder to climb up on top hurts your feet - the ladder rings aren\u2019t wide enough maybe? The price is amazing though, especially when you pick up one of the Zinus mattresses from amazon to go with it. Can\u2019t get any more affordable. My preteen son loves this in his room.",

We did anchor it to the wall just for more security. This was a great purchase. Low price for a high quality item.",

It's nice and sturdy (I've even climbed up), and it's nice and tall to allow for a desk, chair, or other things under the loft. I also love that the safety railing goes all the way around (except for the opening for the ladder). I feel very comfortable with her sleeping up there because of that. It does require a mattress no thicker than 6\" in order for the safety railing to be effective. We will recommend this bed to anyone looking for one!",

Only complaint from me is it\u2019s a little shaky even after making sure all bolts were properly tight enough but it\u2019s still sturdy enough that it really doesn\u2019t concern me. I may try adding washers to see if that will help. Only complaint from kids is the ladder hurts their feet climbing up. I bought some pool noodles from the dollar store and let them pick out their own duct tape and problem solved!",

It is easy to assemble in the sense that there are clear instructions, items are clearly marked, and no additional tools are required. However, this is a heavy, tall bed and it does require two people to assemble. I'm a single mom with lots of experience assembling large heavy pieces of furniture alone - but this is not one of them. It's not a drawback to the product, just something I wish I would have known to expect so I could have planned ahead for it.",
