They are a bit bulky but I cannot imagine how anyone could ever get a knee or shin blow in them. You will need to adjust and cut unless you are Earl Campbell. He has kept the foot guards on for now but I can see how they might get in the way. We paired this with the G3 chest protector and he is pretty much bulletproof as long as it hits the pad",

This took a couple hours of manipulating the plastic which initially made her legs about twice as wide as they are. If I hadn't formed them to her legs they would have continued to stick out on both sides and get in the way when she moved. Now that the fitting is correct, she loves them.",
