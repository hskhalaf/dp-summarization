They love to lick it and tumble around with it (chili one) - the only issue is that it punctures very easily. Within the first play with it, there were tons of clat claw punctures.

      "text": "My cat really goes nuts for cat nip but also would make a mess rolling around in loose cat nip, so I was really looking for a neater but still fun solution. This toy neatly encases the cat nip in an elongated carrot form which really is the ideal shape for cats to be able to cuddle and really revel in the cat nip. I love the details like the feather end which adds to the playful, sensory experience. The tweed fabric is sturdy and also a nice, luxe touch that feels quality and like it will last. A great price for endless, blissful entertainment for my cat!",

She bites & puts her claws into the fabric so there are many holes and it gets extremely dirty from where the catnip comes through those holes.
