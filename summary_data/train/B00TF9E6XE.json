      "text": "I am extremely disappointed with VIVOSUN's new gallon, which is no longer a gallon. They shrank their bags. The old (dirty) bag was purchased only 4 months ago. The diameters of both bags still measure 6 inches. However, as you can see, the new 1gallon bags have shrank from 8 inches tall to only 6.5 inches tall. Therefore, the product information is now wrong. Volume was reduced from 226 to 184 cubic inches, a 20% reduction from 1 gallon to 0.8 of a gallon. I want a refund! Also, I now must check the 3 gallon VIVOSUN bags I just purchased for shrinkage as well. Maybe they are shorting customers on all their bags.",

I am not a green thumb by any means and gave these a shot, mainly due to price. They really work. My plants took quicker, grew taller, and looked much healthier by harvest time. All for a fraction of the cost. 5 stars of awesomeness!",

I have them resting directly on the ground and on rubber tiles, depending on their location. I moved some frequently as the angle of the sun changed - I don\u2019t get much sun. They are easy to move dry and weigh a LOT wet at 25 gallons, but everything held up well. The handles are really helpful. We had endless rain this summer, they drained very well.",

      "text": "I've been using fabric grow bags for several years now. They work great as they prune the root system while bringing it oxygen. The major brand that's sold at my local grow shop works great but is kinda pricey. I bought some cheaper ones but the problem was they were thin, flimsy and water would just run right through them. It would be pouring out the sides of the bags as soon as I started watering. These vivosun bags are every bit as good, if not better them the expensive ones, at a much better price. If you're thinking about trying fabric grow bags, try these.",

Great drainage too while holding water on the sides.

Attributing this to the thickness of the cloth. Over all great purchase and I will definitely be buying again.",

No sign or sound of the stitching coming loose. Id definitely say the quality is unmatched . Once plants were done, we dumped the soil and are able to reuse them.
