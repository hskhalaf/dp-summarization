I thought it might have been the battery failing so I replaced it with a brand new battery that I knew was good and it worked again for about another hour. Now, just reads \"Err\". It was never dropped or abused - always kept inside (30% humidity/74 degrees).",

After using a digital thermometer and multimeter with a temperature probe, I can see this IR Gun is nearly 10 degrees off actual readings. Really wish I had been able to better test it when it was first purchased, I would have returned it immediately. Unfortunately I am stuck with a piece of junk that doesn't work right at all.",

Nice and simple to use, good for ballpark measurements and finding hot-spots, not for anything that requires precise temperature measurement. The same goes for the more advanced thermal imaging cameras, infrared can run into sources of error like emissivity. My only complaint is that the thermometer beeps when you release the trigger which I don't particularly think has any use and annoys somewhat. If it was easy to take apart and remove/disconnect the speaker I would do it.",
