Low in fat which our older baby requires due to a recent health scare, we are now using it in place of Royal Canin Low Fat Gastro-Intestinal canned food. They haven't gotten bored with this and nearly jump out of their skins when I take it out at feeding time! It's also helping with their constipation issues which is common to the breed, no longer have to add pumpkin to their food to soften stool, this has completely taken care of that problem! Will feed this to them exclusively from now on.",
