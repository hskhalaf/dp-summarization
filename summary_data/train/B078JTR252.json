Once I installed the 8 batteries required for the set, it worked better than I expected. They work smooth, quiet and consistent. The button on top is easy to use and they are now the conversation piece in the kitchen. Purchased through amazon but received a personal hand written thank you from the owner. That happens very infrequent in this day and age. I feel confident that if I have any issues they would take care of it. Highly recommend!",

THESE SUCK compared to similar-priced grinders. Just need a little more torque from the motor, or a little more gear reduction to get the added torque instead - but it needs more of it. New batteries = grinder works great for a couple weeks... then the batteries don't supply enough power to turn the grinders. Worst thing is - the batteries AREN'T bad, just not at full charge. So, it doesn't really \"eat\" batteries so much as the designed power input was sized terribly.",

It\u2019s not easy to control when you need one hand on your food (like one hand to hold corn on the cob and another to grind salt onto it). These electric grinders solve that problem. Also, I\u2019ve replaced many grinders after a short time because they no longer grind peppercorns. Hopefully, these grinder blades are of better quality. Another feature I like is the cap at the bottom so that we don\u2019t have salt and pepper flakes all over the table.",
