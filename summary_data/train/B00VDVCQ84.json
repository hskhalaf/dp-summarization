      "text": "I have been a fan of Anker for years, but I have to say this hub is a really big disappointment. Considering what I paid for this a year or so ago, I was amazed at how it just stopped working completely after a short time. It just fails, first, the \"IQ\" ports stop charging, then the other posts give up the ghost as well. Sad, as I had really hoped to continue to buy a quality product. I had raved about them in the past, but with this simple item failing in a year, I have to say they will not be getting any free advertising from this ex-fan.",

Pros, Design is very solid and simple Additional power source(adapter) provides putting more than 4 usb-based devices. Reduce power loads on my laptop. Led light indicates what ports are used as a data source or not (e.g., led light of the port for a laptop cooler is not turned on.) Data transfer speed is very close to the original speed when i put the USB to my macbook. Cons Power adapter is little big than what i thought.",

I have the feeling I can likely attach 4 2.5 drives but I haven't tried yet. If you are looking to power multiple 2.5 drives, this hub is perfect.",

The other powered hubs that I have used would randomly not allow access to attached drives or would randomly disconnect a drive or two. Upon getting this Anker powered hub, I immediately unpacked it and attached 6 different drives to it. I then accessed these drives to copy files, make backups, etc for several hours. All with none of the problems with previous hubs that I had experienced. A feature that I did not realize that this hub had is that the hub is surge protected! A very nice, and unexpected, feature. This is a recommended powered USB 3 hub on Livewire.",

When I restart the computer all the drives get mounted properly. So all in all very happy with this purchase. I didn't rate for durability because I have only had the hub for a week.
