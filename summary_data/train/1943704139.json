Though the original PMBOK is definitely an essential to have while reading this book the Rita version makes it so much more interesting and gives you many tricks to take into account when taking the test. For anyone studying for their CAPM this is a must have! I read the entire pmbok 6th edition a few months back before purchasing this and the comparison of how much I learned from this book compared to the pmbok guide is not comparable",

This book explains the concepts in layman terms and gives both high and low-level examples. Not only will it help for the exam, it\u2019ll also help for real life project management situations",

They lose a star, though, because someone thought it'd be a good idea to only allow a single color in the entire book (bad design) and chose yellow for that color (shocking stupid) making some of the figures nearly impossible to read (see images as examples). How that decision made it through review is just beyond me. Ignoring that glaring flaw, the rest of the book is great.",
