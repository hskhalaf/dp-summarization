Im not a huge fan of the smell, It kind of reminds me of old floral perfume but it's not overbearing and most people think it smells nice. All in all the mask is great. It's super relaxing, doesn't make your skin feel tight afterwards, and it works. You can use this every other day, it's not harsh on your skin at all.",
