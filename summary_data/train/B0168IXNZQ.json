Soon after it started working, the battery indicator on the August App showed 20% capacity. By morning it showed 5% battery level and asked me to change the battery. I replaced with 4 new batteries. It started working well. But, next morning, it showed 20% battery capacity. The new set of 4 batteries also lasted only 1+ day. I have to remove and return this device.

This is how our AirBnB guests enter our space, and no one has ever had a problem. It's easy to install and easy to use.

Hopefully August will fix the glitches soon. Everything else works well. I don't know if I would be happy with it without the keypad. I will say that it works 95% of the time. Every so often I have to enter my code twice but that doesn't bother me much.",
