But no, it's not. Just plastic. Also the USB 3.0 cable is very short - like 6 inches or so. Very annoying ! Update: One of the partitions (I repartitioned the drive) somehow lost its content (my personal data). I was eventually able to fix it, but it made not trust this drive as the sole backup drive ! I ended buying an additional drive by LaCie (the Rikiki) which I admire & trust. The Seagate S/W did not install or work for me.",

The annoying problem that I have discovered is that, every time I try to remove the cable for travel...the entire back part of the drive comes off too! To resolve this issue I have put small pieces of tape on the sides of the drive so...no big deal.",

    "description": "Size:500 GB| Color:SilverThe Seagate Backup Plus portable external hard drive simplifies backup for consumers who want to protect their entire digital life locally, in the cloud or from social networks. Via the Seagate Dashboard, use the Protect function to set up a one-click plan or customize your scheduled local backup. Keep multiple copies of your files in case disaster strikes. With the Save feature, user-generated content can be backed up from your favorite social networks. Many people now use their smartphones to capture priceless moments.
