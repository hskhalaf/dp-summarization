      "text": "Best oven cleaning product I've ever used! It had been 6 months since I last cleaned my oven. Last time I tried a home made vinegar paste. It worked well but I didn't like the residual it left in its wake. No residuals with the 409, I went with an overnight soak, outside of a couple very tough spots, it easily wiped clean with a sponge. Have some newspaper or paper towel on hand as you will have a bit of a pond in the bottom of your oven to mop up. I'm using it on the racks as well. I had to dock it one start because you do not want to breathe this stuff in, very irritating!",
