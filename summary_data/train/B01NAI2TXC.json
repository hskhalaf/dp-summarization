If you install RedDragon drivers (which should be totally unnecessary for a keyboard in the first place) the keyboard will work for a few days, then revert back to the previous non-working behavior. Googling around it looks like a lot of other people experience similar issues. Can't recommend this product.",

The keys would be unresponsive / partially responsive for a few days, and then spontaneously start working again.

      "text": "I really wanted to love this keyboard. The feel is really nice, it's honestly aesthetically pleasing. However if it doesn't function like a keyboard, then this product truly has no use. It took me 6 retakes on typing this review because when pressed, some of the keys don't register the first time around. I am by no means a \"light\" typer, and I type very accurately. I have isolated the problem to the keyboard because when i switch back to my other membrane Logitech Keyboard, i have no issues at all..",

The build quality is incredible, packaged well on delivery and the back lighting works like a charm. I plan on purchasing more in the future for other computers. I've had zero issues. Coming from regular keyboards to mechanical, I'll never go back. Love typing on these things. Really impressive. Kudos to Red Dragon for making affordable mechanical keyboards.",

The mechanical keys (brown) are clicky to the ear, noticable to touch. A comfortable mix. The extra switches are a cool added touch. Cons: There is an echoing \"ting\" (key clicks echoing through metal case) sound, as mentioned in another review, when typing. It's difficult to notice during gameplay, and unnoticable with headset equipped. I also own a Red Dragon mouse and love both products. I would absolutely buy this keyboard again.",

      "text": "It appears to be solidly constructed as the base is very heavy - much heavier than other boards that I've owned. On the other hand, the overall size is much smaller than any other keyboard I've owned. Worked as soon as I plugged it in. Has sort of a pulsing rainbow effect - pretty. The keys click satisfyingly, but the caps are very plasticky. No wrist rest, but you do get a mechanical keyboard with RGB and a num pad for 55 bucks. Personally, I'd pay another 20 for a more spacious layout, a wrist rest, and maybe some media controls; but I'm not complaining.",

It's simple, I love the colors and color changing, the base of the key board is the sturdiest I have found so far. I do wish that there was a rest for your wrist, however, it is a very basic keyboard. At first, before receiving the product, I had low expectations, thinking \"oh this is gonna be another cheap keyboard\", but after it arrived and had it unboxed, I was blown away. I highly recommend this for anyone!",
