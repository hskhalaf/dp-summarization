I just now forced apart the cap and was so grossed out to see green and black mold inside! With an odor! I unfortunately ordered some more yesterday, I will be sending it back when it arrives tomorrow. Amazon packages it great, but the product is flawed, maybe they\u2019re buying it from somewhere bad? I will be going to Target tomorrow and checking the viscosity myself before purchasing. I will not buy this from Amazon again.",

How, we buy it in bulk from Amazon and our entire family uses this shampoo/body wash. I even use it as a mild face wash...a little does a long way. Oh, and did I mention that it smells amazing?! Thanks, Burt's Bees for making such an awesome product and thank you Amazon for giving us such an awesome price!",

It is mild and gentle and has a pleasant, natural odor. I am allergic to artificial fragrances so it's nice to have something that smells but is not overpowering and does not make me sick. We have never had any problems with skin irritation or dryness on sensitive baby skin; over a year later and I refuse to use anything else!",

Picked it because of its high ratings on EWG skin deep as very low toxicity. When I ordered more I noticed the ingredients were different..... filed a data report on EWG (since they didn't have the updated ingredients on their site) and it scored a 2 which used to be a 1. So burts bees has changed it to be slightly more toxic than it was before. A score of 2 is considered \"fair\" by EWG so it is not terrible but it says something about the company.",
