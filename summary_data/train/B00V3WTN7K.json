From the blinking lights they are able to access the WIFI but not the ION server. I tried several times to re- program them with no results. There is no customer support. I found a contact method which acknowledges your note but no one responds. It appears their server went belly up and no one is fixing it. I don't understand how they can still be for sale but I recommend you not waste your money and look for another solution. (besides ION the home)",

The software update is a load of nonsense as well. Will not download things from those sites they reroute you too, doesn't seem legit. Great for short term use, not so much long term.",

Almost any power outage or WiFi glitch throws it off the server. I can spend hours attempting setup, give up, and a week later it\u2019s working out of the blue. I\u2019m confused as to why this camera is so terrible.",

It says there is firmware update and go to a particular screen, but that screen doesn't exist. Back to the store this goes!!!",

I will then feel better than I have felt since I bought this thing.",

They have suggested re-installing the app, restarting my phone, etc. All of which I have done several times. Then they suggested I simply not use my phone at all but a PC instead. This camera has never worked right and I would not recommend it to anyone.",
