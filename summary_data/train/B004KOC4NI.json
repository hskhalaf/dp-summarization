It's easy to apply. For someone who doesn't like spending time doing makeup, it just takes a few seconds. It lasts all day. I don't ever have to worry about it rubbing off.",

It looks like I just spent a couple of hours in the sun (I have olive skin). It looks gorgeous. The slight shimmer really wakes up more mature skin.
