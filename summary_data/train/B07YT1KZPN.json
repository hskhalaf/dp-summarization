My old headset used to ache after a while as they\u2019d press my glasses against my ears or squash my piercings. However, these have completely removed this problem from gaming for me. The extendable mic is also a nice touch as it means you can move it away from your face when you\u2019re not in a party. The comfort and sound quality are both high quality :)",

I have recently replaced this headset with the HyperX cloud II which are amazing and well worth spending the extra money on.",

Worked fine on my phone but thats not what i bought them for. Comfort wise its fine but it doesnt add up for all the problems. Overall just avoid i'd say just buy the kraken v2 pro maybe or the chroma 7.1",

The USB hub makes it easy to control the computer volume/bass/game chat/game volume, and then when you wish to use on a different device with a 3.5mm jack, it's a case of simply unplugging fgrom the HUB and into the other device.",

Actually the passive noise cancellation is acceptable, when playing music/games I can't barely hear environmental noise. Regarding the sound quality, is not as sharp as other headsets, but nothing (treble/mid/bass) is overcompensated, maybe the mids a little bit muddy but nothing too bad. The microphone is really good for its purpose, my friends hear me way better than using previous mics. Is not an studio quality mic, but if you just need your voice to sound clear, this mic is perfect.",

Fit perfectly around ears with/without glasses on. The Kraken have 50mm drivers compared to Kraken X, thus the sound capability is better. The 7.1 surround on the Kraken X is gimmick since you can set your audio settings through console or PC and it will give you the surround sound you need. Most games in the last 10 years give you the ability to set audio settings. One more thing. They are cheaper on the Microsoft store and actually get delivered unlike my experience here on prime.

I would advise against getting these if you intend to use them for the xbox though - you can't use the USB audio box connection at all as the way the xbox uses it's ports prevents you from running any audio signal through them so you're stuck with just the 3.5mm jack connection. This would be fine normally but you can't use all the functions or potential of the headphones without connecting the audio control box. Perfect for Playstation users and PC though!",

Simply put, this is a BUDGET gaming headset that offers 7.1 surround (which actually works), that's extremely comfortable for long gaming hours, and that gives you mic and volume control. Sound quality cannot be compared to high end products, but they're at least double or triple the price. It's made of plastic, but is extremely light and covers the ears in full making it all the more comfortable. Would highly recommend knowing that you're buying a higher end BUDGET headset. Last advice: avoid the cheap Chinese headsets on amazon, they look nice and work well at first, but don't last long and aren't as comfortable.",

      "text": "Mixed feeling on these, if your pc overheats, it\u2019s causes sound crackling, or if dust in the port. I often have to change ports to fix the crackling. The noise cancellation is awful. I can still hear the tv while wearing these. These also cause issues with my sound settings, I often have to disable other outlets in order for the mic or speakers to work. Very comfortable to wear and great sound quality. Too many issues to give it positive review",

The mic boom is flexible and easy to shape. Voice quality is great. Mute button is useful and easy to access I can wear these without pulling out the extensions on the head band, so they may be little bit of a larger than average size. Only down side compared to premium head phones is that the cable is moulded into the headphones and is not detachable. Overall I would recommend these and I would buy them again.",

Due to them not being USB they don't just work when you plug them in and you need to download drivers and change settings on your machine. You also need to download the 5.1 Surround Sound drivers from Razer, and even then you might not be able to work out exactly whether they're working or not! If you're confident with making adjustments and changing registry files on your computer then you'll probably be ok, but if you just want something that works out of the box then I'd recommend not buying these.",

They're alright for listening to music, however, I've noticed the left-hand speaker driver is rattling a bit, which isn't great seeing as I've only owned them for about 2 months. (Review from someone who's played COD religiously since 2007) Please don't be fooled by the good reviews, if you're serious about gaming DO NOT buy these. S.",

Main reason for the review is to help anyone looking to buy these purely on a surround sound basis - not as a headset. I've got to say the 5.1 surround sound is incredible, sound has a lot of depth. Having previously been used to a full 5.1 set up these offer a great alternative. You can use the USB, this isn't always clear but the ps4 recognises it straight away and it works, alternatively you can plug the 3.5mm jack directly into the controller but I've found the usb controller easier to use as it has more control options. Highly recommend",

It doesn\u2019t get really hot but it can definitely be a discomfort to some. It disappoints me the headset is dragged down by the fact it says it should work on ps4 but it doesn\u2019t. Even when the dongle works for 10 seconds the THX feature doesn\u2019t work and is one of the main reasons why I bought this.

The sound quality is, I would say, average at best. Not tinny, not bassy, but not hi fi either. The 'cooling gel ' ear pieces are not much more than a gimmick, though they aren't uncomfortable even for longer plays. Overall not bad, just not worth the coin imho.",
