Just something to eat if we were ever stuck in a ditch or snowed in on a Interstate or need something to shove in the mouth of a unruly passenger.

They do have a bit of a 'sugar high' energy effect if you eat one all at once. I would probably split it and use it as 2 servings or have it with some other food to reduce that blood sugar high/low bounce. Didnt make me thirsty, but might if you are in a water rationing scenario and already in a semi-dehydration state. Will update when I've eaten all the other flavors.",
