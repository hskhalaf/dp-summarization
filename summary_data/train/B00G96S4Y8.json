I have 2 small rooms and they heat perfectly at 68. Sidebar 2: My power bill, operating 24/7 at 68 cost me about and additional $15 a month each.",

I just can't figure out any logical reason why it would cycle on and off three times within a single minute, as it often does. Maybe if you live in a place that's terribly cold, it will just stay on in perpetuity and not wake you up.",

      "text": "This is a very effective heater. We're using it in a cold bedroom (of a very old house) that is heated only by convection floor vents from the first floor. The legal warnings in the instruction manual made me almost afraid to use it, but I positioned it against a wall with no problem. The thermostat works well. The only problem I've encountered is that it makes a slight popping sound (due, I suppose, to differential expansion of the metal casing) every 20 seconds or so, which can be quite loud in the night stillness, and so my wife requested that I move it further from the bed.",

Only downside is that on the max setting the heater gives off an odd chemical smell. Supposedly it'll burn off, but it's been a couple of weeks and it's still making the smell.",

Once cleaned, I ran the unit on high for a day in my garage. This did make my garage smelly for about 4 hours. I haven't noticed any off putting smells from this unit since.",
