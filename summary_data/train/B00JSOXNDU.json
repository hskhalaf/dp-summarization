After unpacking, they further had smears/scuffs on the undersides that looked to me like they'd previously been handled, if not thrown. The worst part: the aerodynamics are HORRIBLE. Throwing backhand yields OK results, although these discs have serious fade. A forehand throw results in a right-to-left rotating INVERSION of the disc in midair (think Maverick keeping up foreign relations with the MiG in \"Top Gun\") -- enough that they dive to the ground, typically landing UPSIDE-DOWN. Unacceptable.",
