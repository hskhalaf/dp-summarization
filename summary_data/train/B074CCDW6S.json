However I was under the assumption that these were meant for adults as a size was not indicated in the description. The warning on the front states that they are not an adequate size for adult clothing fires. Not that I anticipate needing these for that specific reason, but it would have been nice to see that included in the product description. Overall I\u2019m happy with the product and feel safer knowing I have them on hand!",
