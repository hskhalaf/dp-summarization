It is like they took the liner out of a real winter jacket and sold it separately and for a HIGH PRICE. These things must cost about $5 to manufacture in Chinanam. It serves its purpose, but it is like getting a hamburger for a steak price. It is lightweight, but then everything that has little material is lightweight. If they sold it by the pound it would cost 5 cents.",

More practical to fashionable although the color really stands out.",
