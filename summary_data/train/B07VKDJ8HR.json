It was a success on the trip. A week after getting home she accidentally left the Yeti on the ground behind a car. Yup it was run over. As you can see by the picture there are a few scratches but it works great. I Don\u2019t know of any other thermo cup that can withstand being run over by a car. Guess what all the grandkids are getting for Christmas?",

I hesitated due to the price, but this should theoretically last me forever. I'll replace the straws or lid if that is ever needed, but the body should really last me as long as I need it. It's solid, durable, and you can tell the quality through the feel. I'm not necessarily into name brands, but I do think there's a difference between this product and similar cheaper options.",
