Some reviews said that the blade says \"China\" on it, but mine does not (happy about that). I rated it only 4 stars because there is a tiny hairline crack in the handle (see pic, right side going into metal end). This doesn't bother me, in fact, I think it adds a little more ruggedness, but you expect a brand new knife to be flawless until you make the dings yourself.",
