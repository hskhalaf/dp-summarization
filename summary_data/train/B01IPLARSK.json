It comes in three pieces and is extremely easy to assemble - just screw then together on the pre-installed threaded bolts. Ypu just need to make certain that you hand tighten them well, otherwise it could be a little wobbly. The lamp and shade are good quality and look very nice. We would definitely purchase this item again",

We have tried multiple bulbs but the switch is broken and only works on one setting. It's frustrating for a lamp that I paid good money for. Otherwise I love how it looks. Update: 1.5 years later. The company replaced the lamp which had the switch going out which was great. We actually have two of these lamps now but both of them randomly flicker. We're going to have to rewire them.",

Unlike other lamps at this price range the base is pretty heavy which makes the lamp pretty sturdy even on a thick carpet like I have in my living room. The best thing about this lamp is the shade. It spreads the light out pretty evenly and the light that comes out is beautiful and soft. I just wish it was a little taller.",

It lasted about 6 months tops. Super disappointing, and I am not sure I can return it at this point. I would love a replacement, but worry it would happen a second time if I went to the hassle. (I swapped the shade out for a smaller one BTW, cuz the one it came with was ginormous! It was nice, but I needed something more compact to walk by.)",
