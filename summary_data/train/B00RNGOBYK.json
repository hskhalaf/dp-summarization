My brand new iPad is ruined from having this product on there for less than a minute. I tried reusing the wet wipe to remove it, the dry wipe, the cleaning cloth and I even put a blow dryer near it thinking maybe there was some water in there because it appears ring like. The spots are not coming off. I am so angry.",

When I received this from Amazon, I was expecting to install a [ temporary ] screen protector just long enough until the other one from BB arrived but after i installed and compared the two, the only thing I regretted was not being able to return the one I bought for $39.99 from best Buy ! This is great, looks like the same thing, has same thickness, easy to install and 1/4 of the price ! Great product , thank you .",

There really should have been a warning that you get one chance to seal it correctly or you will have air bubbles that you can't remove as multiple attempts to realign and restick do not work.

If you register your product on their website (you\u2019ll need your amazon order number), you get 2 replacements free of charge if it ever breaks. It does not cover replacement of the iPad or iPhone you\u2019re placing the screen protector on. The registration process was very easy and only took me a couple minutes to complete. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product and would buy again.",

On every model of phone or tablet they manufacture for. They call that case friendly. Well so is this one and it doesn't have ugly gaps. This brand also follows the EXACT same protocol for registering it for a warranty as Zagg. And they profess to honor it the same way Zagg does.",

I'm happy to report that the installation went well and the protector is clear and responsive. Installation is made easy by the tabs that can be used to get a precise alignment before you commit to sticking it all down for good. The stiffer tempered glass also helps, as opposed to a softer film which is harder to align and has more problems with bubbles. During installation, dust is your biggest enemy so prepare a clean work area, wash your hands well, and use the dust removal stickies before installing the film.",

Ultimately, sadly, I had to throw this out almost immediately after installing it because it does NOT work if you have a heavy duty ipad cover. It won't stay on the screen at all. Wasted money...so I would probably only suggest this for people with a regular, nonprotective iPad cover.",

The iPad is not a cell phone it is much larger and more difficult to install glass unless you know how to do it. Knowledge is power!",
