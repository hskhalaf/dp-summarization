You exceeded my expectations once again! The first pair I bought in 1994 got me all the way through basic training and then lasted several years beyond that! Seriously!

Maybe not the most stylish looking shoe, but they feel comfortable so far.",

But since im a hefty gal with wide feet i decided to try on the 10s. Perfect fit! I adore the bits of fushia pink accents. My only issue... The padding isn't glued down. But i will still continue to use them.",

It took me a couple of days to get used to it, but this style was less than half the price of the last pair of Guide 8's I bought so small sacrifice. I just don't tie them as tightly. Fits my orthodic inserts well. I would buy these again as long as the price point stays steady. I paid $39.95.",

My only complaint is that they have started to show signs of significant wear after only 3 months and by 6 months need to be replaced.

I am very rough on my sneakers so for the average person these would be fine and I\u2019m not even opposed to buying another pair for myself again. While these are not my La Sportivas they are overall a really good sneaker that are comfortable for everyday use and even some light walking trails (dirt roads, not actually hiking trails).",
