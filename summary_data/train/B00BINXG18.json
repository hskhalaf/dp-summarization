The box says that it takes 2 hours for assembly; that is a stretch unless you have a 4-man team of 8 foot tall mechanical engineers on amphetamines. The assembly isn't bad if there isn't a medium breeze, but it did take me longer than two hours and I have assembled them before. It seems to be well made with decent materials. I bought this one because of the two others I helped assemble and knew they were pretty decent.",

If someone at Shelterlogic would create better instructions or better yet a 3 minute step by step video, assembly would take much less time. I gave it four stars because I think it's a good product. Had the instructions been better it might have been 5 stars. For some reason they don't include pipe for the bottom of the two end sections. I added pipe to add weight, to hold the end sections down when it's windy.",

I also fastened the back ground flap to a 6 by 6 I had laying around. Bought 5 foot long 1 1/2 inch steel pipe and inserted them into thenside and front ground flap pockets. It does diffuse incoming light a little, since it is a thicker rip resistant material. Worth the purchase price.",

I think the only thing we will have to watch out for are the zippers. the back window doesnt go up and down very well and if they breaks there are not string ties to close up the window.",

The sides only roll up a tiny bit, too you can't tell from the picture, I thought the sides would roll up at least halfway, allowing for better air circulation.

To be fair, I have it in the middle of one of the largest wind farms in North America, so I assumed its shelf life would be short. Burying the corners and sides a foot or so below ground would help, but also nullify the side flaps. The plants loved it. Keeps them from freezing even when its in the teens and blowing. The tarp seems almost too thick, but nevertheless the good sun gets into those plants. Its a good introduction to greenhouse growing.",

I will be using it for a hydroponics greenhouse and I know I will not have to worry about my plants. This greenhouse is well worth the money. I will be purchasing another one.

    "description": "Size:10' x 20'The ShelterLogic 10\u2019 x 20\u2019 GrowIT Greenhouse-in-a-Box with Easy Flow Vents is ready to build right out of the box. This easy access greenhouse delivers quality construction, easy assembly, and best-in-class value. Constructed from a 1-3/8\u201d tubular high-grade steel frame, the greenhouse provides protection and a natural light source to your plants, herbs, and flowers. The steel frame has a premium powder coat protective finish to help resist chipping, peeling, rust, and corrosion. ShelterLock steel stabilizers add strength and stability to your greenhouse frame for a more durable plant shelter. Made from ClearView, a triple-layer heat bonded ripstop fabric, the cover is 5. 5 oz thick, waterproof, and has been UV-treated inside and out. The translucent greenhouse cover provides enhanced illumination, which is ideal for plant growth and protection. The Easy Flow roll-up side panels provide your plants with maximum airflow and temperature control. The included bungee cord fasteners hold the sides open while the hook and loop fasteners keep the sides down. With the Easy Slide Cross Rail tensioning system, the cover is locked down for a snug fit and squares up the frame, while Ratchet-Tite tensioning provides solid cover anchoring to the frame. The double-zippered front door allows walk-in access and can be rolled up and secured to your preferred height. The front door and back rear panel both have vents to keep air circulating. The greenhouse can be assembled in about 2 hours with 2 people. When your growing demands change, this portable greenhouse can be disassembled and transported easily. 15\u201d auger anchors are included with your greenhouse kit for easy anchoring.
