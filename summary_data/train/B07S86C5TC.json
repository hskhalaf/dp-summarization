      "text": "With the great toilet paper shortage of 2020 I decided to splurge and upgrade my bidet to this electric bidet. Such a fantastic upgrade. I didn't think living in Arizona I would care about the heated seat or water but its fantastic. I removed the old seat and installed this in less than 15 minutes. If you are considering a bidet this one wont disappoint.",

Well when ordering you need to make sure that you get the correct one for your toilet, round or elongated, I have a round toilet. I made sure to pick round. What came in the post? Elongated. It is frustrating. I processed the return but am waiting what seems forever for the replacement. I will update the review when I get the correct one.",

I even tried calling the company to get replacement parts but was put on hold for ever. Had them for too long to return so now I'm ordering new ones from a different manufacturer.",
