      "verdict": "The Lenovo Erazer X700 is a fairly good entry-level gaming desktop in its own right, but unlike competing systems, it also boasts liquid cooling, simple overclocking, and plenty of opportunities to dip a toe into the murky waters of upgrading and tweaking PCs.",
      "pros": [
        "Built-in liquid cooling and OneKey Overclocking",
        "Hot swappable drive bays",
        "Lots of room for expandability",

        "Combination of solid-state drive and hard drive offers zippy performance and lots of space"

      "cons": [
        "Design is a bit garish",
        "Third-generation processor and middle-of-the-road GPU offer good, but not great, performance"

      "text": "I purchased this system for light video processing, photos, the internet, and word processing. It replaced a 5 year old quad core system. The new system reduced video rendering time from over night to less than an hour in my tests. I did not like the pre-loaded bloat-ware and I am a little annoyed with Windows 8 (free upgrade to 8.1), but I can learn to work around those issues. With the easy access case it was a breeze to replace the DVD burner with a BD burner.",
