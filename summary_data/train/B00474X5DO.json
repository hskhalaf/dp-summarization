The only caution I have for anyone is the medium is harder (to us) than what we expected. I know it\u2019s a matter of preference and for us we were trying to relieve pain in joints. We are ordering another topper to help take pressure off of trigger points. It may just be us and maybe the soft would have been too soft. I just wanted to give a heads up for those with chronic pain - the medium is on the hard side of medium in my opinion.",

Not aesthetic whatsoever, not to mention how it would erode the construction of the gel holding up that end of the mattress over time. Had to send it back. Good try - better quality control is required for sure.",

In 3 mo this I\u2019ll do an update, but for now : Very little odor that dissipated in a few hours. I. In just Two days mattress swelled up to normal and is quite thick and cool to lay on.

    "title": "LUCID 10 Inch 2019 Gel Memory Foam Mattress - Medium Firm Feel - CertiPUR-US Certified (Queen)",
    "description": "Style:2019 Model Medium| Size:QueenA combined 2.5-inch layer of ventilated gel memory foam and a 7.5-inch layer of high density support foam gives a pressure-relieving and supportive mattress for a MEDIUM-FIRM feel. The top memory foam layer is designed to prevent heat build-up; microscopic gel beads capture heat and move it away from the body to help regulate temperature as you sleep. This surface layer of memory foam has a ventilated design that improves airflow. The open cell structure of LUCID memory foam makes for a longer lasting, more resilient foam that will not leave long-lasting body impressions. Soft, Breathable CoverMade of a cozy TENCEL blend fabric (10 percent TENCEL lyocell, 90 percent polyester), the soft cover creates a breathable air layer at the top of the mattress. This mattress is CertiPUR-US certified, which means the foam has been independently tested for safety of materials used, physical performance and environmental stewardship. Careful construction guarantees no prohibited phthalates, no ozone depleters, no CFCs, no mercury, no formaldehyde, no PBDEs, and low emission (VOCs) for indoor air quality. This mattress does not contain synthetic or natural latex of any kind. We offer a 10-Year that protects the mattress and cover against manufacturer defect.

      "Warranty Description": "25-year limited warranty guarantees that your lucid mattress will be replaced, repaired or refunded at our discretion if it is deemed defective due to faulty workmanship or structural defects. The warranty does not cover normal changes in softness or resilience that do not affect the performance of the mattress. Small body impressions less than 1. 5 inches are normal and not covered under the warranty. The warranty applies only to the original purchaser. Abuse, stains on the cover or mattress, or platform or box foundation support will void any warranty. Lucid shall not be liable for any consequential losses arising from the purchase, installation and/or use of this product. For complete warranty information go to lucidmattress. Com read before opening: carefully remove plastic packaging being careful not to cut through to the mattress. Place compressed mattress on a flat surface in a well-ventilated room and allow 48 hours for expansion. Due to the unique properties of memory foam, dimensions after expansion will vary; this is normal and will not affect the performance of your new mattress. New memory foam may initially have a slight odor; it is completely harmless and will dissipate over a short time with regular use.",
