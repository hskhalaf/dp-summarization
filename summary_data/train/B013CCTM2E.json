One quirk is while it works fine on my Linux pc, on a windows pc, windows wouldn't recognize it on the front panel but did on the back panel so I use a USB extension cable to the back. According to Google it's a common problem with flash drives that I hadn't run into before that some flash drives won't work with some USB hubs, which is basically what the front panel USB is.",

      "text": "I have had a lot of nice(more expensive) and cheap (cruzers) flash drives and never had one stop working. After 21 months this flash drive has given up. Constantly connecting and disconnecting from computer. 4 laptops were used. Finally copied the contents, used windows scan and repair, then reformatted to NTFS. Worked for 2 days and then the problems began. Not so sure it's the drive as much as the actual connector. The reason I purchased this drive was to limit the flexibility of the drive at it's weakest point, the USB connector. This is the shortest lived drive I've ever had. I still have a 16GB USB 2.0 drive that functions from 2009. Disappointed",

I looked around the house for short / old lanyards to attach to the two drives I purchased, because these come without any cord attached. I would recommend something like the camera lanyards be included, but a little consumer ingenuity helps - even a shoe string would suffice to ensure the drive doesn't get lost in the bottom of a backpack or elsewhere. Nice product.",
