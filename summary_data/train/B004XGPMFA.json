It was super easy to apply-not like that thick, white, glue that some of the newer sunscreens are. It smelled absolutely amazing-a fresh banana smell-not chemically. It absorbed well and didn't feel greasy. It was moisturizing and felt good on my skin. I usually don't get any color if I use spf 30, but if I use spf 15 I burn. This actually gave me a pretty deep tan-but I didn't burn at all! Seems more like a really good spf 15.",
