The only difficulty I had was in mounting it - it was so lightweight and small I almost just let it dangle from the power cable, but in the end slid it into one of the hard drive shelves in the case and just left it sit there. Scotch tape would be more than sufficient for mounting.",

The mini PC boots in 12 seconds, about 4 times faster than the traditional drive. I also own 120gb Samsung 470, 830 and 840 SSDs. The 750 EVO is way faster than the 470. So far, this drive looks like another trouble free winner from Samsung!",

The other reason is that the price is not competitive to other vendors. You can find larger capacity SSD drives for less price that this one. Keep in mind that the MacOS will eat up 45 gig of this disk drive!! So, with any decent size applications you are going to have less than 80 gigs to work with. And 80 gigs is not a lot of storage these days.",
