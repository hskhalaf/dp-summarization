This product is deemed versatile and accommodating, particularly to those who welcome a near-the-ground experience.

Fit is perfect (just took my usual shoe size) - snug around the foot and plenty of room in the toe box for me. I like the elastic laces. I still prefer five-fingers for a truly barefoot experience, but these are a very close second and more than enough of a compromise based on costs (or if the look of toes bother you!). I'll adjust if needed but these suit me perfectly.",

Given the quanitiy of materials used to make them the profit margin must be, well, rather good. But I regret buying them, especially as the price dropped from \u00a380 to \u00a360 right after they were delivered. They come in quite a nice box, though, so that might be useful.",

Secondly, these come up very big. I normally take a 8 to 8.5, but the 8.5 was like a clown's shoe and the 8 was just too big. A 7.5 was the perfect length but all the sizes were too narrow for me so had to send them back. Instead I want back to the Glove 3.",

The cotton grey ones look really nice but are expensive and have much less traction. Good for long distance running as well as sprinting. Not water proof or resistant. Good for gym if you like a flat shoe when lifting. Been using them for a 3 months and I've never used a more comfortable shoe. You'll need to buy low socks for these.",

I will definitely be buying these again when needed. They fort perfectly, so much foot movement but also very snug so you feel like you can run and jump around as much as you want.",
