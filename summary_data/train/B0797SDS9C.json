      "text": "I have been searching for an affordable pet hair roller for some time, and this set is blowing me away. To get 4 total rolls (3 refill's and one in the actual roller) makes this set more of a value. The roller itself is made of high quality plastic and seems indestructible, which is great in case the dogs get a hold of it. I find that we are using this just as much for regular lint as we are for pet hair. It works great for both applications.",

      "text": "Because the roller is perpendicular to the handle, the sticky roll doesn't fly off the handle every 4 seconds like other lint rollers do. This makes it a pleasure to use. With two cats and a dog that you'd think is allergic to her own fur given the volume of hair she sheds (anyone planning on making some cushions? I have plenty of filler available) this gets used all the time. Why is it that the cat that hardly sheds is always asleep under someone's bed but the one that sheds like crazy always wants to sit in my chair? Only small complaint is that the sticky part could be a bit stickier. Still gets 5 stars from me, though.",

It works pretty quick too - no need to do multiple rolls over the same area. Recommend buying it if you want to make your life easier :)",

Does remove lint well and the sheets are pretty sticky. In the future, I will probably go with a different lint roller. 6/10. Probably would not buy again.",

Impossible with this thing. Will have to schedule in my planner time to assemble and deassemble the thing to replace the tape. I gave it one star because the lid is an excellent idea. There's enough stress in my life without having to stress over a cat hair roller! Don't even know if it can be returned.",

The next sheet end will be on the opposite side. Edward, the cat, seems to enjoy being rolled. Rollers work. Takes about 3 sheets to properly roll the cat. Also great on furniture, my clothes, and even my nose.",

I am nearly destroying this thing trying to find the edge. Because it\u2019s on a slant instead of straight across, you don\u2019t see that defining edge and it\u2019s so frustrating.
