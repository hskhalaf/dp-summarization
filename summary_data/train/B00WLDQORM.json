      "text": "My daughter is 7 months old and loves this teether! It is easy to clean (I have hand washed and machine washed without concerns) and is easy to hang onto. My daughter actually gets excited when she sees this toy and offers entertainment for her. I usually keep this in the freezer. It doesn't get very cold or stay cold for long, buy my daughter doesn't seem to mind. I have read that these types of toys (the teethers with brushes on them) are very popular to teething babies because their gums can feel itchy - this toy helps with that! Highly recommend! Biggest con: this toy is silicon, so everything sticks to it....including dog hair!",

I monitored the first couple times she used it and she didn't seem to have any problems at all, and she likes it, so, bonus points lol. I washed it before and I wash it after every time she uses it so the toothbrush part doesn't get filled with fuzzies. It's not too bad to clean, definitely better than cleaning an actual toothbrush.

She's not super coordinated with her hands yet, so sometimes she has trouble hanging on to it, but when she can manage to keep ahold of it she loves to chew on it. I imagine the better she gets with her hands, the more she will use it. Besides being an awesome teether and a first toothbrush, it is super cute! The only small downside is it does gather a lot of hair when it gets dropped, but it easy to rinse off so it's not a big deal.",

Eventually, my curiosity got the best of me after reading reviews, etc. and hoping my daughter would actually like it. It is certainty worth the money, especially if your little one is teething. The first time I gave her this, she probably chewed on it for 30 or 45 minutes straight. Slobber was everywhere (she was cutting teeth at the time), so for her it was perfect. The entire thing is soft, pliable, and ok to chew on. It is very well made. I only wish I had bought this sooner.",

She LOVES, so much so I purchased a second one to keep at my home for her. Big hit. As an extra tip we use a pacifier clip to attach this to her car seat, stroller, etc. This prevents drops and the \u201chandle\u201d of the banana is perfect for attachment.",

It's really easy for her to hold onto and it keeps her entertained for quite a while. I like that you can loop a dropper-stopper around the handle to prevent it from dropping to the ground.",
