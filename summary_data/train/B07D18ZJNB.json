      "text": "The design of this laptop seems to be causing issues, trying to make it as small and thin as possible has introduced some problems which, to me, do not justify the very high cost. Light bleed on the LCD, heats up and fans start spinning at idle for no discernible reason, battery life nowhere near advertised, terrible sound (to the point where i'm wondering if the speakers on my unit are faulty) Buggy software (Razer synapse) keyboard commands such as screen brightness and key brightness intermittently stop working. Shame as the laptop looks very nice and feels premium (as it should) but is let down by all the above.",

I did a Windows system backup via USB3 to an external SSD then replaced the internal 256 SSD with a 1TB version, installed Windows fresh and restored the system backup. Worked perfectly... Battery lasts ages when working in a coffee shop and gaming on power at home is a pleasure. Thermals are fine, display is great, keyboard and touchpad are great... How could it be improved? Illuminated shifted keys, Windows hello... and if they can keep this price range and battery life with a 4k 144HZ screen to go with the new 2080 MaxQ - Or maybe that would take a 3080 to drive?",

New models have flat not folded cables which is an obvious design flaw. If I could return it I would but only to buy a replacement.",
