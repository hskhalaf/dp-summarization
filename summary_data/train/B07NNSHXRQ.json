I personally dont like how store tankinis are designed for only short people. At 5'8 No one needs to see my muffin top, I dont want to see it either, and this is long enough to cover up my chubby torso!",

It's modest and feminine (I was seeking modest) without being frumpy, and it still flatters my chest and gives me a waist. I did choose a different bottom to go with the top, as I prefer a high waisted retro style rather than a bikini style.",
