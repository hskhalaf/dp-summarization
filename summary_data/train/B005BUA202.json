We live in Oregon so it rains a lot. The clear cover that goes up over the top to keep the kids dry is perfect. When it's nice out, we keep the plastic part rolled up and only the mesh one covering them. So glad I purchased this.",

It only takes a few minutes to transition the bike trailer to a stroller which makes running into stores stress free. This trailer has truly exceeded our expectations. I highly recommend to anyone.",

We plan to run around Washington, DC with a 9 month old. Well, this trailer met all those requirement and the price was perfect. Not a $400+ trailer but only <$150 so grandparents and parents are very, very happy. (first time for parents and grandparents, so we were all very picky)",

The only time I had trouble was when I had 40lbs of ice + the 2 kids. Then it was a little hard to push. My only complaints... 1) The instructions were not very good, especially when hooking up the trailer to bike, 2) the front wheel was kind of hard to remove because the screws were so long. 3) the front wheel was hard to keep in the \"free spin\" position... the little pin for allowing/disallowing this would not stay in place.",

Don't attach the bumpers if you wish to actually make it through doors. Minus 1 star because the placement of the holder for the front wheel while not in use is asinine. Unusable because it requires the back canvas to be removed in order to place on it.",

The material is good quality and velcro is strong. This is real value for money.

I did have to take the tire shields off to fit it through the door way (standard size residential front door). I highly recommend it. I also haven't folded it down to transport to the park bike path so I'm not sure how easy or portable it is. But for the smooth ride and effortless pull it's great.",

Also, the front wheel is supposed to be straight when it's locked in place and the one I received is slightly off to the right about 5 degrees which makes it rather difficult to push in a straight line in stroller mode without constantly having to lift the front wheel up to correct the direction.",

The instructions aren't written by an English-speaker, but we were able to assemble in about 40 minutes from trial and error. I also like the cushion for the child to sit on instead of a hammock-like fabric like the others have.",

That's a little bit obnoxious but the rest of the trailer makes up for it especially considering the price. All in all, I'd suggest this to anyone on a budget.",

We had to remove the side railings off the wheels in order for the trailer to fit through out doorway. Overall this is a good product for the price.",
