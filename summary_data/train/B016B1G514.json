Additionally, the links and the rings are not welded, with small gaps that potentially catch a talon. No doubt a lot of fun, but not worth the risks for us. Definitely raises questions about Booda Bird toys, especially when reading of foam parts in their chewable toys in reviews here.",

Now, the African Grey loves to play with the spoons and plastic pieces on the table. He beats the spoons on the table, making an awful racket, and throws the plastics over the side for us to fetch. He has a ball with them daily? We keep them just for table playtime. He didn't like them when hanging. Our conure still has no interest in them. Note - the chain is cheap metal and begin to rust. I wish they would make this in just the pieces. We threw away the chain.",

      "text": "This toy is a high-quality build. My macaw hadn't seen anything quite like it, so he was very excited to explore and chew on the various goodies. The metal spoons are brilliant - safe and fun to play with. This seems like a durable toy that will last a long time. I can see it'll do fine in the dishwasher when it gets dirty. Great investment. Highly recommend.",
