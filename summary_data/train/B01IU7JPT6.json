The plastic broke off at the hinge at the back where it attaches to the base, the bearing and spring fell out. I'm so disappointed because I thought for the money and the brand name it would last a long time.",

Not the easiest to clean, but as long as you spray non stick on it, it's not to bad to clean. Overall we are happy with it for the price we paid for it.",

It also comes with a spill tray for extra protection, which is also super handy and easy to clean as well.

I've used the included measuring cup and even added more batter to see if that helps. Batter will ooze out the sides instead of keeping a full waffle all around. It works, but there are much better units out there for the money. I'll be buying another brand to replace this one.",
