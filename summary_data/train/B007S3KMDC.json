I scratched up the back of my RV after I climbed the 3rd step. The steps swayed to the left and which made it very unstable. Returning them due to a safety concern.",

The ladder does not fold, so it has to be removed before driving. I\u2019m not sure I can use this at all.",

When we are camping in Georgia there is always leaves falling on the roof of it and I have to go up to sweep them off our roof. the ladder on the motor home itself is quit a bit off the ground and this additional ladder helps me to get up off the ground it is a lot safer then using a step ladder against the permanent ladder on the back of our motor home.",
