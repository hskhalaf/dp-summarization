Fit was comfortable and I had no issues with water leaking. The anti fog performance was poor. Within one or two laps it was fogging up. 5/6/2018 Update - the second goggles broke again on the strap. This happens 4 days after the return window closed AND I took one week off from swimming. Never buying this brand again. Poor quality if the head strap consistently breaks within one month of solid use.",

The trick for these I have found is to apply a very light coat of vaseline along the edge that touches your face before use, keeps the rubber supple. Another trick - don't push these on your face to try to get better suction, it has the opposite effect. You need to place them on with a comfortable elastic length, not too tight, they will provide the suction you need no problem.",

      "text": "I bought these bc I own a pair of Aqua Sphere Seal Goggles and love them. But I wanted a low profile pair that seals and can handle a dive into the water. They definitely can handle a dive but there is something odd about the nose area. The eye seals are great, never fail, no leaks. But the eye seals touch each other leaving no space for my nose. They still work but are just odd. I still prefer the Seal one piece goggles bc there is no distortion with your eyes since they are like they are in a mask.",

      "text": "I am a huge Aqua Sphere fan and was excited to move from my favorite tri style to the Kayenne for indoor lap swimming. However something is really messed up with the lenses for me. They are clear out of the water, but when I go under water they are horribly blurry. It is like I'm wearing prescription goggles...it is horrible, I can't focus on the pool bottom. It is really strange, why only under water and not above water I cannot say. Really disappointing. I see only one other similar complaint on reviews here so maybe it is a rare defect?",

They do get a little bit tight after wearing them for awhile and will leave some goggle rings, but that is fairly unavoidable if you want them to also be tight enough to keep the water out while moving quickly through the water.",

I thought it might be me, but then I tried my wife's Speedo goggles, and those were sharp and distortion free underwater.

Wow - that's the word that came to mind when I tried these on. I swam for almost an hour without needing to de-fog my goggles or empty water out. This is in stark contrast to my old Speedo goggles that fogged up and leaked almost every other lap. I found that I was subconsciously reaching for my goggles every so often (to dump out the water) and then realizing that I didn't actually need to! Such a huge difference, I'm just upset I didn't purchase these earlier.",
