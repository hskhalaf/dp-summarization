It seems obvious, but If you follow the directions it will probably be quicker to assemble than it was for...us ;) Pre drilled holes were well aligned. Extra pieces were provided, or that was because we didn\u2019t always follow directions. I bought two 6 inch twin memory foam mattresses that fit perfectly. I personally would not feel comfortable for my younger kids to have an 8 inch mattress for the top bunk at least. I don\u2019t feel the guardrail would be as effective. In any case, my kids love this bunk bed set and so do I! I highly recommend it!",

One tip, buy some better screws for the slats and use a screw gun. Broke a screw which I will blame myself as it clearly states not to use power tools. That was the only part I used a power tool. For the price you will not find anything better. For the reviewer who said they didn\u2019t receive white plugs, there are none and the picture clearly shows that. Does it diminish the appearance?
