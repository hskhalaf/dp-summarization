I'm still learning how to use it but all my attempts have been a success from baked potatoes to delicious pulled pork. It appears easy to use but remember its not exactly \"instant\" as it does need to get up to pressure and then again release at the end of cooking so this needs to be factored in to cooking times. But it definitely does cut down on traditional methods and hopefully will save energy in the long run not needing to use my stove every night. So far it has been worth the wait and every penny!",

Size comes in very handy for steaming whole (smallish) fish or whole veg. But when cooking rice, the size is ridiculous unless you have 12 kids. Slow cooking... not as good as a slowcooker, only heating from the bottom... which means stirring while slow cooking is pretty essential really. Haven't tried their recipe book yet... nothing to write home about. Worth it... but if you're only one or two people, maybe a smaller size would be just fine. Good value and build.",

Extra silicon ring would be nice since you cannot 100% get rid of the smell on the thing, get extra rings for difference categories of food.",

You can keep the food for preparation in the morning and when back to home by evening hot food is ready to be served.
