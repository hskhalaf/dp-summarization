This shampoo leaves my hair moisturized yet still curly and not flat! It's a little more watery than I like, but four pumps into my hand washes and moisturizes my hair without needing any separate conditioner. I've also sent this shampoo and the hair masque to my mother-in-law, who also has fine hair, and she loves it too.",
