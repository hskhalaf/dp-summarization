By \"best,\" I mean has the most features and receives the most different types of transmissions right out of the box or with a quick, free upgrade. That being said, it is not a scanner for beginners. But for anyone who is up to speed on object oriented scanners and how to program them, it will be easy to get going with a TRX-1.",

That being said I had to buy $40 programming software because I don't want to spend whatever amount of time would be required to figure that out. The case, although nice, is not very durable, do I felt the need to add a $30 carry case from Radio Shack just to make sure the nice case doesn't get cracked. So, I have an extra $70 wrapped up in extras thus far. No biggie, but very disappointed that the programming software was not included with the scanner.",
