      "verdict": "Like most retro Air Jordan basketball shoes (e.g. Air Jordan 6 and Air Jordan 11), the Fila 96 Low is a stylish and comfortable basketball shoe that will take you back to the good old \u201890s. At this point, it is hard to tell if these low-top basketball sneakers are any good on-court. However, players can pretty much expect more of the same as its mid-top counterpart since the only difference is the shoe\u2019s cut. Overall, the low-top version of the Fila 96 is a must-try sneaker especially if you are a fan of Grant Hill.",

        "Most owners just love the Fila 96 Low",
        "They claim that it is a great basketball sneaker",
        "Many are commenting that these low-top basketball shoes are very comfortable to wear",
        "According to one tester, the 2A cushioning of the 2013 version is very soft and provides a lot of impact protection",
        "The full grain leather is of excellent quality, a reviewer describes",

      "cons": [
        "One tester gripes that only the side panels feature full grain leather",
        "He claims that the forefoot is made of synthetic leather",
        "There are hardly any reviews for the 2019 version of the Fila 96 Low"
