I like that it\u2019s easy to simple and easy to use, the picture quality isn\u2019t bad. Sometimes I wish I could zoom a little more and have the focus quality better, but overall, it\u2019s the best thing ever for the price! I figured I don\u2019t always zoom since I\u2019m using it to show text but sometimes it takes a little bit of time for the focus feature to adjust, esp. when I hit the \u201cfocus\u201d button.",

      "text": "We purchased the DC-21 primarily to use as a document scanner while doing research in university libraries. We found that the image quality (for PDFs) is very poor - fuzzy at best, problems with glare, auto-focus often just a bit off the mark - manual adjustment required. Doubtless it is great for its other intended uses such as classroom projection, but other document cameras that don't handle those tasks as well have better scan-to-file capabilities and editing/cropping features.",

This is nice if you want to rehearse, make lessons available for future use, or upload to YouTube. Another nice feature is the ability to mark and annotate. We often work with historical or otherwise one-of-a-kind documents that shouldn't be altered, so this is a nice way to mark on a document without altering the original. Nice with paintings as well to draw attention to brushstrokes and other difficult -to-see details.",
