      "title": "SUPER Edible Image Printer",
      "text": "This printer is used strictly as an edible image printer. Perfect for decorating cakes, cookies, cupcakes, and other baked goods. For cakes, you can use the full-size edible icing sheets. The cupcake and cookie sheets have pre-cut circles so that you can just punch them out and apply to the cookies and cupcakes after printing. This printer, with the edible ink, makes excellent looking images. How is this for printing on paper? I don't know, and I don't intend to find out. I don't recommend switching inks between edible ones and the regular (non-edible) ones. You don't want to be eating ink residue that could be toxic.",

[2] The ink cartridge position drive screeched for a moment for each print job. [3] After each print, the sysem flased error message and had to be shut down and re-started. Even generous time provided by Canon customer service never solved the problem. The error message said: \"return for repairs\" which of course would have cost more than the printer was worth.",

I use this printer primarily for printing invoices for our small business and church projects. It does a great job and I think the cartridges last a reasonable amount of time. I had a Cannon Bubblejet many years ago and those cartridges seemed to last FOREVER! Wish I still had that printer. However, this is a great printer. Worth the price.",

I do use it to print my photographs. Like most reviewers agree can be a bit noisey, especially at start up.I leave mine always on, also out of fear the ink heads may clog. Not taking any chances.
