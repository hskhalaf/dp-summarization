And the battery life is incredible, lasts all day on heavy usage. Plus it takes a 64gb SD card so plenty storage. My best purchase this year.",

Nice bright screen, really fast and responsive. No issues with charging. Knocks the socks off the Asus Transformer Prime it is replacing.",

I like the built in kick stand On the down side is the shape of the Lenovo the case's are few and far between",

The glass screen and metallic body gives this device an expensive and well made feel. We experienced only one problem - most of the memory (20+gb) was used up as miscellaneous memory and we could not access this to rectify. Once we updated the OS to latest version, the problem disappeared. The children also have this tablet and love it - we have not experienced any memory issues with theirs so might only be related to updating software.",

Handy, versatile, built in stand which can be used in many positions.

Still like it though and as I saw a video on how to replace the Yoga 2 battery I thought I should upgrade. Better quality screen and better speaker quality. A win, win. Just hope I can get a replacement battery when needed. Only issue I have found in this one is that the battery is only lasting 8 hours. Saw somewhere else that someone played with the settings and got the promised 18 hours. ( I didn't have that particular issue with the first Yoga Tablet though).",
