I knew it was January...I thought paddling along might mess with the sensors but it is super fun and really seems to know what you\u2019re thinking. It does not try to run away from me or throw me off. The remote did not work and the replacement they sent does not either. The replacement is a different remote and has no high/low speed setting switch and is slightly larger than a bic lighter. This is irritating but it\u2019s so fun to ride hands free I can wait...I hope they\u2019ll get me a working remote.",

The board can achieve roughly 20 MPH, and there it takes hills with ease. Charges really fast and the battery lasts for hours. Its perfect compact skate its liter hevy that give you more stability to ride. More maneuverable than the longboard, but a slightly harsher ride due to not having the flex of the longboard. Overall, this is a great purchase for my son. He is enjoying it everyday.",

I\u2019m a person who with no skill and balance every time when I play always fell and get hurt but when I first bought this board, it\u2019s very simple if I want to move forward just simply lean forward on the front sensors, if I need it to slow down, stop or reverse? Just lean back. Also this motorized longboard also comes with a remote that can control every aspect of the ride, from accelerating to switching speed modes. It was a cool product!!!!!",

But one of the two of the bolts to hold on the front truck are broken and you can't remove them so this means you can't replace the trucks unless you send it in. So I'm returning it cause there broken but my second one will be here in two days just like that. Still it is awesome. High speed has some serious tourqe and when you go up hill the tourqe kicks in. You have to learn to tougle the remote so you don't fall off cause when you hit the breaks or gos you better hold on and did I mention it has a reverse?!!!!?!",

The board has large wheels, unfortunately they are rock hard and you feel the smallest bumps. Rolling over moderate cracks makes it feel like you are hitting a curb. To the manufacturer: upgrade the remote and make the wheels bigger and softer and this board will sellout! Even if you increase the price $100... but as of now the board is dangerous.",

The deck is too narrow, and the wheels are small and lack any ability to grip. This board will dump you on the pavement.",

I can't give it a better review than 2 stars because the delay for the remote to stop the motor from accelerating is so long that it is not fun and gets pretty dangerous when you are going fast. IMO this is a software/hardware issue. On other boards I have owned the motor immediately stops accelerating when you let go of the accelerator. This one does not do that, be warned. Every thing else about the board is amazing. The trucks are a little soft even after you tighten them up.",
