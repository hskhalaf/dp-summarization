The case fits exactly as expected, and protects well (note: this protects against scratches and bumps. It will NOT protect your MacBook against falls and drops). It does have a bit of a \"stickier\" surface than other cases I've used, but not quite as \"sticky\" as I expected. Overall, I like this case and am happy with the purchase.",

I think Kuzy also saw these reviews, because the rubber feet are no longer even glued in. They\u2019re snapped into place. I don\u2019t see them ever coming out. #2: This case does not have a rubberized feel. It\u2019s more of a matte finish type feel - but in no way does it feel or look like those cheap, shiny, super plastic-y looking cases. However, if you\u2019re looking for something with a lot of grip, this isn\u2019t it. Overall 5/5 for me Update: This case is prone to fingerprint marks. They can be removed easily with a babywipe.",

You could have told me this cost 69.99 at the Mac store and I would believe it. Easy to snap on and the rubber grippers work fantastic. I got it in the dark grey/black - the apple logo is still visible. Fingerprints do show but wipe up nicely. Soft to the touch. Would buy again 10x over!",

The only thing that I wish was different about this case is the Kuzy name/logo on the top of the case, it's hardly noticeable but the name is already on the bottom case so I wish the top was completely logo/name free.",

I bought the case to cover up a ding in the upper right hand corner of the air and it does a great job, i hardly notice it. I think i'm in LOVE ; ) Thank U!!!",

This looks and feels like it will last at least that long. Perhaps that is just the life expectancy for this type of plastic case. Buy it! You won't be disappointed.",

I liked it while it lasted and for the price it's not terrible; just wish it'd lasted longer.",

Additionally, the feet to EVERY Kuzy case I have purchased comes off after a couple months of use. Therefore, I usually take them off and superglue them back on as to not lose them. The quality control of the cases seem to be subpar.",

I have resigned to just taking them off. It wont scratch your table or desk, but it would be nice if the black rubber pieces were built into the case and not little sticky pieces that are poorly made and attached",
