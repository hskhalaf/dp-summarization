In hindsight, I would\u2019ve purchased the 20lb bag initially. I have watered it everyday, it\u2019s in a mostly shady area, and I live in Portland Oregon.

The grass started growing in about two weeks! It is kind of patchy in certain areas but that could be due to uneven distribution of the seeds with the spreader. I really think the success is with the preparation of the soil: I raked the soil to loosen it up, spread the seeds and raked top soil onto the existing soil to cover the seeds. I watered the lawn every day for about 15 minutes. It seemed to do the job!",
