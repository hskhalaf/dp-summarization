Some mattes I\u2019ve tried wore off in patches or got clumpy on my lips as I drank stuff, not this one!! First pic is wear half way through the day, after eating and drinking with no touch up.

It's a thin liquid and doesn't set right away, although the pigmentation is bright. I just can't get over the bizarre, chemical sensation on my lips and have to toss this. I have had similarly unpleasant experiences with L'Oreal's Pro Matte Lip Gloss and Maybelline's Vivid Matte Liquid, which both caused a weird numbing sensation. The only drugstore liquid lip formulas that so far get my seal of approval are by NYX and Wet'n'Wild, because they don't feel cooling or numbing when you put them on.",
