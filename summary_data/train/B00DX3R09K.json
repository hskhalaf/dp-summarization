I think it is a good value for the money and the table is very sturdy. It doesn't wobble at all! Which is awesome. The arm is removeable and adjustable and I think the table is a good height. I am rather short though, only 5'4. The only thing I don't like is the loop that is included. Dogs can still get out of it and it wouldn't be good for a bad dog. But you can purchase those separately for a small amount. Overall I would recommend this product.",

I brush out my dog 3 to 4 times a week and without this table it would be drudgery. Great purchase!",

I have 2 dogs, 55lbs and 68lbs and the harness that was included with purchase was definitely not strong enough for my boys. For small dog probably ok. I recommend the table.",
