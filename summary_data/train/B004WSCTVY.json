I had chairs in my cart for less than half the price of these (about 100 bucks) but I just couldn't pull the trigger to \"complete purchase.\" Something just didn't feel right, even though the price was great. But I am SO glad I sprung for the more expensive chairs. They are so worth it! The vintage lantern color is a deep brown. I can tell these are going to last a long time. Assembly was easy--I am a 56 year old woman and was able to put them together by myself!",

Assembly was straight-forward, though you may need to loosen side assembly to get rocking feet on (took me a few minutes to figure out, as the holes don\u2019t line up). Chairs are constructed well and they provide stainless screws, so it should outlast me. They are moderately comfortable (back is a bit rigid) and rock well. I will purchase cushion to soften. In photo, they appear shiny, which is not the case. Typical of composite, it\u2019s dull, but uniform and sturdy. Overall, very nice and you\u2019re paying for the luxury of leaving outside year after year after year, without rot, damage, decay or loss of function.",
