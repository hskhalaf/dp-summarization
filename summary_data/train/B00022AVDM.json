I bought it for my wife as a gift. She was a bit weary about how well the printer would actually work. Last weekend I bought the printer and some paper and I have to say ... WOW! A one armed monkey could work this whole package. Great investment and well put together. Blows the HP / EPSON stuff away.",

The optical viewfinder allows the use of the full zoom with the confidence that you're pointing the camera toward the subject. Sadly, modern view screens can be easily obscured by glare and are nearly unusable in full daylight.",
