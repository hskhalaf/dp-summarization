I also haven\u2019t figured out the WiFi piece of this. I\u2019ll play music, through Alexa, yetbit still seems to play from my phone via Bluetooth. If I walk too far the music cuts out as Bluetooth typically would. I would recommend getting the regular ua speaker as they are great, for just a speaker.",
