Thought I\u2019d be getting a platter like I\u2019ve seen in the better steak houses. It\u2019s impossible to get a normal sized steak to fit this one without flopping over the edges and getting juices everywhere. And forget about adding a side dish unless you\u2019re talking a hockey puck size petit filet and a few stalks of asparagus. I already used these and threw away the packaging, so no returns possible. My mistake. I\u2019ll be buying a larger version for dining, maybe use these as side dish warmers or something.",
