The ball appears to be the same thing a bowling ball is made from, the base is very ergonomic, and there's also a rubber ring to help grip it. I've rolled it all over my face, head, neck, and shoulders, and I can apply so much more pressure than simply using my fingers, which tire fast. I just got it yesterday, and have barely put it down. Five starts all the way.",

They come with a little storage bag, packed in a box. These are a MUST HAVE! Especially for the great low price!",
