    "title": "Ironwood Pacific Anchor Ring Anchor Puller with 11\" Buoy (up to 30 lb Lift) or 15\" Buoy (up to 60 lb Lift)",
    "description": "Our easy to use Ironwood Pacific Anchor Ring takes the challenge out of hauling your anchor by hand. It has been specially designed for offshore anchoring, where longer lengths of chain are frequently used and proves stronger than similar welded rings due to the specific engineering of this Anchor Ring. If you are looking for exceptional performance and value \u2013 this Anchor Ring is for you!\n\nDirections For Use\n\nTo use the Anchor Ring, you would begin by slipping the ring over the anchor line and attaching the shackle-buoy assembly. You would then motor your boat forward at around 5 knots to start, keeping the anchor line clear of the prop. Increase your speed slightly when the anchor starts to break free and the anchor line will slide through the ring, raising the anchor, as the buoy floats on the surface.\n\nAnchor Ring Construction\n\nThe Anchor Ring is available in two models; our standard model, constructed form \u00bc\u201d stainless steel, is ideal for use with anchors up to 20 pounds while our heavy-duty model, constructed from 5/16\u201d stainless steel and can lift up to 80 pounds. Both Anchor rings are made in the USA and come with a lifetime warranty.\n\nBuoy \n\nThe Polyform Buoy is a favorite among fishermen as it can endure even the most adverse conditions. Made from extra strength, flexible vinyl, the polyform makes a great marker or mooring buoy and can also work effectively as a boat fender. The reinforced rope-hold is molded to the body in a single process and won\u2019t separate with the strongest pull. Choose between the 11\u201d for a 28 pound lift and the 14.5\u201d for a 60 pound lift. All Polyform products are manufactured in the USA and come with a lifetime warranty.",
