We removed the vibrating part, infant insert, and the toy bar and placed it in the cover bag inside of our infant carseat in the carseat travel bag (tyke gear 3 way travel protection carseat...also purchased on Amazon) so we didn't have to pay to check the pack n play. It's wider on the bottom than the top part when it's open, which wasn't a problem at all. We didn't use the infant part, but the bottom fit my daughter's Dock-A-Tot perfectly. Set up was a breeze and I would definitely recommend.",

The vibrating feature helps keep our baby sleeping and even helps with collic. It easily moves room to room as needed. The bassinet insert is the perfect size for my 6 week old. Shipping was fast and the price was great. I highly recommend!",

I recommend getting a quilted pad to place on bottom since it's not made for sheets, as this will help keep the surface clean.",

If GRACO makes a product that isn't standard to all the rest of their pack & plays then they need to make a special sized sheet customers can purchase for it. The pad is not waterproof and therefore is hard to clean when baby makes a mess. It will serve it's purpose I suppose which is to give the baby a place to be in outside besides the pram. I wouldn't recommend it though. I have actually been very disappointed in the quality of Graco products when they are a childrens company.",

I thought it was going to be slightly larger than a traditional one because it advertises being larger at the bottom. It was quite small. More for a very young baby than a toddler. And second, within moments of being placed into it, my 16 month old grandson poked a hole through the mesh with his bare finger. Not safe! He could have easily torn a hole big enough to get caught in and injured. This is why I returned it. Does anyone know if there is a recall on this item?",
