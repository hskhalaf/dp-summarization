And also that doing all the paperwork at work to explain why I\u2019ll return this is so much work that I rather dump it. In short, this is overpriced garbage. Portability as expected so is good there. But why would that matter if: 1) scanning quality in JPG and PDF sucks. I have an old one from other manufacturer and its lower DPI beats this one for a mile!!! 2) Am I supposed to use the auto feed dock as a paper weight???!!! If it doesn\u2019t feed the paper what\u2019s the use of it!!!??? VuPoint = overprice garbage",

First, it doesn't do anything unless you have a microSD card in it, and that's not included. It's not a scanner when you plug it into your computer, it's just an expensive microSD reader (or being charged). It partially works with SDXC cards but stops working and doesn't display any errors. Just scans, and continues on without saving If you rename any scan files on the card, it will stop saving scans without error. If you delete a file on the card leaving a break in the serial # of the filenames, it will stop saving scans without error.",

The scans I've done were mostly by hand (without the bridge) and mostly images. It took a little practice, but the results were good enough to use right away. A real sleeper in this package is the OCR software; it took awhile to load but really does the job of converting imaged or pdf text to an editable state.
