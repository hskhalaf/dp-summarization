The board is made of a solid quality wood, which I was extremely impress with. It was super sturdy. It comes with black and white letter with extra symbols (smile face, heart, thumbs up), and tiny hook to twist into pre-drilled holes if you wanted to hang it up. If you want to keep it standing, it comes with a base that slides in easily. I recommend using tiny scissors to cut out the letter faster. Thanks for making my grad pics look great (attached)!",

The seller Richard is very prompt at communicating. Would 100% recommend this board & this seller, and will be looking into future purchases with him. I\u2019ve seen letter boards at places like BuyBuy Baby and Target; their quality is unmatchable to this board. This is something that will last years. Plus, I love that it is double sided and can be used for both genders if using as a birth announcement, or to just have a choice of different colors for different rooms/decor. Highly recommend. Thank you.",

Seriously - if I'd had any idea this would turn into such a fun part of my life, I'd have bought one of these a long time ago! (Of course, if you don't have teenage boys in the house, you will have to do all of the work yourself, which takes a moderate amount of time.)",
