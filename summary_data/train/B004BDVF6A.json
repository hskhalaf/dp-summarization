It tends to break off in the sharpener which leaves the pencil flat, so it's hard to get a really fine line. I think I'll look for something else.",

Application feels a bit chalky, picks up other product, and drags, while the color can apply inconsistently and won't always fully show without going over and over the line (carbon black). It smudges easily, and may work well when used as a lighter color and for a more lived in or smokey eye. Also package is cheap - the smudge end fell out (and keeps falling out) just picking up the liner.",

Has tendency to run if you have slightly oily skin, which nearly everyone does around the eyes.It works really well as in inner-eye lid liner because the liner is very soft - you don't have to warm it before applying. Given its softness you will not get a very precise line, even after sharpening, but it blends well for smudging purposes if you want a soft, blendable eyeliner.",
