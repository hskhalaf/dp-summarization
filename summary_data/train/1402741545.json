It is rather large, too large to carry in the field unless you carry a backpack (which I do). But it is absolutely the best for study and reference. I particularly like the close up pictures of the flowers in the front by color. You cannot go wrong with this guide. The price is great for such a wonderful book.",

The book is well organized and has a lot of photos. It is easy to navigate through and look up any flowers you are looking for. Each flower name is alphabetically organized in the index. I recommend this for anyone who is interested in learning about the wildflowers of North America.",

      "text": "The book is titled a Field Guide to Wildflowers of North America, which is why I bought it, Canada being the greater land mass of North America. Plus it had lots of photos. But the book is most certainly not a catalogue of the wildflowers of North America. It illustrates only the wildflowers of the Continental United States. How could such a glaring missrepresentation of its contents pass editorial scrutiny? Pretty much a waste of my money.",

It won't always have the species that you're looking for but it has enough to at least get you more than just in the ballpark. It's not a technical book and a basic understanding of plant familes will help the user navigate through the vast number of species presented. I hope the NWF reprints this book because there are no equal options out there. The price of this book can get insane when there are few available used copies on the market.",

      "title": "A Good Comprehensive Guide",
      "text": "The book is a good all-around one, but a bit overwhelming. I bought the book mainly because the front part divides the flowers by colors which I thought would be very helpful. But often it will show just one of the colors and doesn't includes others. So if you see a pink flower and they show it in blue it might be a little more difficult to identify. The maps of where the flowers are found are very helpful. The flower descriptions well done. The book itself is thick thus making it a little difficult to carry around as a field guide. It's best left home as a reference tool.",
