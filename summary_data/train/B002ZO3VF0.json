I really wanted to try out this product, but I feel it probably had gone rancid. It was what I would consider to be brand new packaging. It looked untampered with. Maybe it was old.",

I had to use it daily for a few weeks to see a real difference, but it was there. I wish they would change the bottle top. You can never really tighten the top down. You can close it, but I can\u2019t throw it in my gym bag or purse for travel because the top unscrews too easily.",

As a test, I applied to the tops of my hands (some sun damage) after a scrub for a couple of weeks and haven't seen anything superior to the body butters with Shea I've used. I've tried Argan oil too, and this product seems to provide a slightly better result on the face. The price, however, would have me rethinking a second purchase. Not to say, I wouldn't, but I'd seriously give it thought.",
