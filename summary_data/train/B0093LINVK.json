Quiet and discreet. Hidden behind the TV out of sight. Only con is no IR on the box, so had to add FLIRC (from Amazon) to use a remote control with it. Very pleased with the purchase. Slightly expensive after you add memory and mSATA drive. This should be priced <$150 then it's good value. Thinking of getting another as a router (1 port router with VLAN tagging from a managed switch).",

The Core i3 processor is the equivalent of what is found in a basic notebook computer. I assembled mine with a 256GB SSD and 16 GB of RAM. I also installed the Intel WiFi/Bluetooth combo wireless card. That's more than enough computer for most applications. Models with i5 and i7 CPU's will be coming from Intel later in 2013.",
