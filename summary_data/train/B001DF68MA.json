My daughter started riding here at 9 months old, but this is not designed for that age, so she kept falling asleep and falling sideways. I resolved that with a strap to keep her straight, but it really started getting confy for her around the year. She is almost two and still loves it.",

My husband is tall and didn\u2019t have any real trouble with pedaling after the seat was installed. It took about 30 minutes to assemble, and came with very clear instructions.

Mom loves it because the kids feel safe and secure and in case of crash they are basically surrounded by parent to take the impact. On a cruiser bike we find that our legs are forced into sort of an odd position while pedaling, but it isn't difficult to get used to. Maybe the best part is that the positioning of the seat doesn't throw off the balance of the bike so it feels just like riding a regular bike. This makes everything feel so much easier and safer.",

The knob did not grip enough to keep the seat from moving closer and closer to my seat while in use. I would recommend reconsidering your other options prior to purchase.

My husband had a little bit of a hard time installing it but once we figured out it had to be on the seat bar (that goes up and down) it was better. That's the only place the hardwere fit around the bar. That was probably more builder error than product error though. All in all, GREAT PRODUCT.

We followed the directions but then realized one of the steps was incorrectly misplaced and had to do it all over again, however, once everything was in place worked perfectly. We tried it at home first and then went for a ride to a trail nearby. Our baby loved it! He almost fell asleep on it. It is the perfect fit for our 9 mo who is 22lbs and 30in long. My husband had no problem riding the bike. He was concerned about having to ride with the seat in between his knees but it wasn't a problem at all. Highly recommended!",

Fine for a mile ride to the park, maybe, but not for a long ride or commute. So I switched to using a rear seat, and while I really miss the great aspects of the front seat, I don't miss hitting my knees with every rotation of the pedals.",

      "text": "I'm giving it a 4 star because the way it came would not work with a modern bike frame. We had to manipulate it to make it work which made me neevous. Also the seat is only held on by 1 bolt. However, when using it its very cute and fun for my 10 month old son ( we actually used it when he was 9.5 months). He is 23 lbs and it fits him well. It is small like others say about it and won't last us much longer but it allowed us to enjoy our bike ride.",
