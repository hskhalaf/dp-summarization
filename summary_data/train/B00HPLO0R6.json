      "text": "I was excited to find this here on Amazon.com after I had borrowed my mom's older 6-donut maker. These donuts were very flat and did not cook as well as the older model. We ran the two units side by side for comparison. The wells for each donut is very shallow resulting in more of a flattened-donut shape rather than a tubular shape. Pretty disappointing. It works alright, although the finished product is not cooked as evenly as the older model.",

Dusted with powdered sugar as they came out of the machine. My son gives it \"one MILLION thumbs up.\" Tried piping it out of a plastic baggie, which, yes, was easier, but far messier to get it into the bag. May try mixing it in a Pyrex measuring cup with a pour spout next time. The donuts themselves are about the same diameter as Donettes, but not as thick or dense. Overall, well worth the purchase price.",

Using regular flour is fine, but the texture is not as soft as fried dough of course. So that's why coconut flour works great.",

I just eyeballed. *The only drawback is the cord is rather short (2ft est.) so if you don\u2019t have an outlet right next to you, an extension cord may be helpful. *for those that said they turned out sticky or uneven.

I plan on making batches of donuts for parties and other events in this. The opportunities are endless... Product is a bit chintzy, if you hold it up and shake it, it may rattle a bit, but it was pretty inexpensive. Far exceeds expectations for the price.",
