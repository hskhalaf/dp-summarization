      "text": "These headphones have fantastic sound. I would easily give these five stars if there wasn't the problem of the headphones periodically cutting out and back in. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to it... it cuts out when I'm walking and listening to a podcast. It cuts out when I'm standing still and listening to music. I have a bluetooth device in my car that connects to the same iPhone and it never cuts out, so I don't believe the device is the problem. TL;DR: Great sound, but cuts out too much.",

I had the prior version that connected to your phone via wire and they were the most comfortable earbuds I've ever worn - by far. I barely felt them in my ears.

Previously, I bought another pair for $34 that sounded just as good, had the magnetic feature and we're less bulky, however I kept the Bose because the less expensive pair, like all others, we're uncomfortable for me.",

Amazon was nice enough to refund me, and I decided (from reading multiple reviews), that the Bose SoundSport were a good choice for me. I am very satisfied that I went with them! Their sound, especially the bass, is by far better than the Powerbeats2. The fit is also really nice, considering I have glasses, so the Powerbeats were a bit annoying. The SoundSport fit nicely in my small ears, and do not shift at all. I will definitely recommend to anyone looking for wireless headphones for every day life or working out!",

Wetness doesnt seem to affect them and they stay put in the ear for long runs. I dont really count the loudness against them, since they get to about as loud as I need them, just sometimes for youtube videos with abnormally quiet sound I wish there was a few more levels up. Most music wont be an issue.",

But it\u2019s incredibly clunky (and frustrating) to switch from device to device. Unlike other headphones, you can\u2019t just hold the Bluetooth button until it\u2019s in pairing mode and select whichever device you want. The app automatically connects to the most recent two devices, whether those are what you\u2019ll be using or not. And trying to get it to disconnect from one requires physically disconnecting on one of the two devices...so carry them all around with you. And usually then the app crashes.",

      "text": "Well after going through over 2 dozen different styles and types of ear buds looking for sound quality Bose came through Everything I tried wa either all bass and no treble or all treble and no bass. Looking for a clean smooth full range sound is a lot harder than I ever imagined and when I was about to give up all hope i found the Bose SoundSport wireless earbud style headphones. One thing that was not good was the many reports of the control switch coming apart from the seam. But I'm hoping if I only use the phones basic sound controls and not touch the problemed control switch at all it should not be a problem.",

      "text": "Love these headphones and basically you never go wrong with Bose products (at least in my experience with their products) but the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the battery life on here only last about 6-8 hours and the bulky earbuds and the useless clip it comes with. Comparing it to other brands of earbuds, you can usually let it go without charging it for a few days. Other than that, the sound is far better than any other set of wireless earbuds I have had and if you can put up with the short(er) battery life and bulky ear buds then these are hands down awesome!",

      "text": "These have become an essential part of my day. I use them constantly for calls at work, for listening to music on my Mac, and for listening to audiobooks on my phone when I'm walking or at the gym. The handoff between devices is nearly seamless, and it just seems to know the priority -- calls from my phone are more important than tunes from the computer. The charge lasts a long time, although I am somewhat strategic about when I charge them at my desk during the day.",
