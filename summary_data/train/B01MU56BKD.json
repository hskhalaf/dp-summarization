I was really hoping this different mechanism would have more leverage in a tighter package, but I didn't see that with this. I do suspect if the leveraging surfaces were posished and the bolts has roller bearings, an improvement could be achieved. The concept is there, but the execution where it counts is poor. I am not saying it doesn't cut what they claim it does, Im saying it didn't cut what ai needed it to with the claimed reduction in effort. You may have better results with standard grades of metal.",
