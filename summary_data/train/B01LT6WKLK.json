In other words, when the suction is attached to the tub and you try to pull the foam pillow off, I had two suction cups tear off of the foam. Perhaps this is my fault, but it should be easier to get the foam pillow off the tub without having to pull so hard...but if you do, then the foam should be stronger as to not lose the suction cup altogether. I like the comfort and stability, but the brand has some work to do in terms of user-friendliness.",
