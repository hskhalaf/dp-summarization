He loves it and the only drawback I see with it is that the cartridge attachment that makes the \"sparks\" doesn't last very long. The scooter came with one attached plus an extra and they were used up within a couple weeks. The cartridges cost around $15 for 2 so it can become costly to keep replacing them. He doesn't seem to want to ride it unless he can dazzle the big kids on the block with the sparks. I think once the spark novelty wears off he'll be satisfied to just ride the scooter (hope so anyway).",
