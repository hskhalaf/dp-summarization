      "text": "These are amazing. Normally, I buy the cotton/lace highcut briefs in this brand. But, they did not have this color tone (sand). My nude version showed right through my light pink scrubs and looked like dark underwear showing through (white girl probs). I tried these even though I hesitate as a nurse to wear nylon/spandex undies. These were perfect for fair skin, the fit feels like a hug and the quality is much higher than what I was wearing. Now the complaint is that by the time you pay shipping, they dang well better be amazing. If it were a little cheaper, I would replace all of my old ones!",

These fit the bill. The fabric is soft and easily launders or hand washes. I am not aware of wearing them. They do not show through my pants. And they flatter my curves. I thought they were pretty expensive but they are worth it. I am over cheap panties!",
