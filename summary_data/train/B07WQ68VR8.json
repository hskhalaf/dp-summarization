Only one disappointment. The water cooler was not installed correctly. There are two screws that hold the unit in place on the front. The back has tabs that should be secured (slotted) in the back of the case - holding the fan/radiator securely in place once the screws are tightened. The tabs on mine were not secured and, as a result, under load there was significant amount of vibration created. Didn't take long to fix but I expect better quality control at this price point.",

The graphics card can get up to 100% usage without an appreciable noise difference from idle. There's space inside for 2 hard drives, in addition to the supplied 1 TB SSD.

I was only playing World of Warcraft also, which is not as demanding as other games (and i limited my frame-rate to 60 and reduced resolution to 2440). I was able to cool the GPU by installing EVGAs software and changing the fan profile (although this caused it to be extremely loud). The CPU however reached excess temperatures of 80-85 degrees Celsius at 55%. Don't waste your time with HP desktops, spend the extra money and buy quality products.",

I also put furniture risers under the legs to lift it up some since their is airflow from the bottom. Do not hesitate to buy this if you are worried about temperature issues.",

A lot of bang for your buck and it is an aesthetically pleasing tower as well with the customizable lightning, clear case with neatly managed cables inside, and somewhat smaller form factor (for a gaming PC). The only grip I have is with the coil whine. It runs quiet until you use anything that heavily taxes the GPU, then it emits a high-pitched whine that can be a bit annoying. I normally use headphones connected to separate speakers, so I do not notice it a lot, but it could be a deal-breaker for those with sensitive hearing. Overall though, a great deal with just that one issue so far.",
