Washing my hands is pretty much an all day every hour or so occurence and I love foaming hand soap. This dispenser gives you a nice, dense foam(you have to fill it with foaming hand soap) and as soon as I put my hand under it it dispenses it perfectly in my hand. Makes hand washing quicker and easier for all of us. My 3 and 5 year old oftens struggled with the other dispenser. Im hoping the batteries last a long time in it and dont need frequent replacements .",

The only thing I can 'complain' is it being 'too sensitive'. It dispenses foamy soap whenever there's movement detached.

I especially like the smiley face that flash for about 15 seconds after dispensing soap, which I use as a reminder for my toddler to scrub and rinse.

So, I would suggest just adding more water if you're not getting enough foam. I tried the adjustment buttons but it was still not enough foam (not long enough). Also, if you wear black gloves it will not dispense. Sometimes it also dispenses if the light in the room changes (very rare).",
