I set it up in five minutes for both my 2.4 GHz and 5GHz home WiFi networks. I plugged in both Playstations to the ethernet ports and am finally getting download speeds of 40+ Mbps. These gaming consoles are finally working the way they've always supposed to have been. Great product.",

When extending an Apple Airport Extreme (Latest Gerenation 802.11ac) it causes that Airport Extreme to endlessly disconnect and reconnect with its status light changing from yellow to green on 15 second intervals. Resetting and reconfiguring AC1200 does not stop this. Unplugging and leaving AC1200 unplugged is the only solution. ALSO: Cannot extend both the main and the Apple Airport Extreme guest SSIDs. It is limited to a single SSID. Was not able to see the Apple 5GHz signal although it could see the 2.4 GHz. In short: Not suitable for Apple Airport Extreme environments. Too many problems. Sending back.",

While the basement has an excellent signal, my second floor and bedroom off to one side of my house, had a very weak signal. I bought this and placed this right about the center of my house and so far, have been very pleased. Setup is a breeze, just put it within range of your existing router and then move it wherever you need. One thing to note is this does require power so make sure where you intend to put it, there is an outlet. Signal strength is very good and I have had zero issues.",
