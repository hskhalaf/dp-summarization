The only, very slight criticism I have is the temp accuracy. In the deeper bin, it's three degrees off, i.e. showing 34 means it's actually 38. The upper, smaller, bin is about a degree off.",

In fact I had to turn the thermostat up because I was getting ice inside. Using a battery monitor it draws 1 or 2 amps, while the led light I have off the same battery draws 20 amps. Absolutely Amazing!",

The only drawback is that the frig is more tall and than it is wide. Since the weight is not evenly distributed in the frig, it flipped over and fell off the cart when we were taking it to the car.

You can run a strap around the whole fridge to keep it closed. You would have to figured out by yourself. Other than that fridge works well so far for my first month using it in my van. Oh!! use the auto mode after you setup the best temperature for your use. Other options can be tricky, read blogs and manual before using it. I read some people mest it up by using the freeze mode for long period of time.",
