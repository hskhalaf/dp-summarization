It comes in a nice padded case that you don't worry about it getting damaged. I would advise that folks who are thinking they'll dispose mouthpieces after a few uses and are going to buy a bag of extras..to wait. It doesn't seem very well advertised - at least when I purchased, that these things are dishwasher safe...I find I am still using the original. Hope this helps!",
