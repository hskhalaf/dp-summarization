For backups, this isn't a big deal, but for normal use as an expansion drive it's not good. Unplug this drive from the computer when you're not using it to make sure it spins down.

But if 50% of their products have a 2 year or more survival rate, and an insufficient quality assessment is part of the process, it's becomes a consumer's gamble and Seagate is the casino.

Below is a breakdown I found online: The drive has 4,000,000,000 bytes or 3.72529GB. 1024 bytes = 1kb 1024 kb = 1mb 1024 mb = 1gb 1024 X 1024 X 1024 = GB So 4,000,000,000/1024/1024/1024 = 3.72529GB So by looking at the title, I was expecting my Xbox One to actually detect 4TB and not 3.6 TB, that's a few extra games that I would fit.",
