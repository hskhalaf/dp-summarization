It also says to wet the surface before having the kids slide to that they can glide across it. Water isn't nearly enough. You need to apply something to it to make it more slippery, like detergent. So, if you have a somewhat inclined surface that's smooth and grassy and you apply a little detergent then this can be fun. Otherwise, it's a waste of $20. I'm gonna donate ours to the local landfill. The kids hated it, and immediately went back to their blow up kiddie pool, which was a far better buy.",

The pool at the end of the slide only half fills. Most of the water drains out the side. I will be contacting them for return and refund, I will keep you updated on how that goes.",

It\u2019s definitely a one time/event backyard toy. I find it so strange that only one lane has the water sprayer leaving the other drier and harder to use. It\u2019s really only one lane.",
