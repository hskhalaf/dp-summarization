I had experienced several of the dreaded \"BLUE SCREEN\" error messages immediately after installing it, but after downloading the Symantec patches and updates, it works very well. The only time I get an error now is if I fire up my computer with the cable modem off line. This product allows a great deal of customization although you can use the \"recommended settings\" for a quick and adequate setup. It also seems to work well with Norton Anti-Virus, if you are concerned about that interface.",

      "text": "Norton Personal Firewall 2002 is neither the easiest-to-use product of its type, nor does it offer the best protection. I found the program to be very tempermental: it worked very well when I first installed it, but it stopped working altogether shortly thereafter. Even after I got it working again, it failed to protect against TCP probes (a very common hacker attack). I am not a internet security expert, although I am generally very comfortable with complex software, and I simply could not get this program to work reliably. Do yourself a favor and try ZoneAlarm Pro instead: I found it to offer much better security, more reliable operation, and to be much easier to control.",

However, at times my user resources get incredibly low - such that my PC clock even stops keeping time. Norton says \"they are working on this\". My most important recommendation is that you always disable Norton when downloading new software to your PC!!!!!!! Don't let Norton be incharge of what you want installed and what you don't. We found this out the hard way when installing our new software for our cable internet service. This caused slow slow slow service and it was like our mouse had terrets!",

However, the sad truth is that any battle-tested cyber-intruder or hacking whiz kid will have enough water to douse this Firewall. Another fact is that unless your PC's processing speed is second only to the velocity of light, expect Firewall 2002 to slow down web-page loading. But that said, my personal experience indicates that the pros of having this inexpensive protection still outweighs the cons.",

This is my favorite feature! If it did nothing but stop pop-ups it would still be worth the $$.",
