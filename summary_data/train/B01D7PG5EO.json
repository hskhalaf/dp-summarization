I reordered another chair in the hopes that it will not be as defective as the first but that was my only chance given the packaging was ruined during shipping and I will be reusing the second chairs box to return the first. I guess I will have the opportunity to do the same thang till I win the chair lottery. Wish me luck. Give this chair a HARD pass unless you are feeling lucky.",

If you're on the short side (I'm 5'5\"), the over bolstered front edge of the seat will cut off your circulation and make the back part of your knees hurt that rest on it. The tilt only goes backwards for the overall seat positioning, which would be fine, if the seat's starting position wasn't reclining already. Can't position the back to sit up straight, or only be slightly reclined. Do not buy for a desk chair if you are going to need to sit up and work on a computer/laptop on it.

I weigh 240 lbs, which is hefty, but not obese. I should be able to lean back in a chair without worrying. So far...this one's a winner.",

      "text": "Great over all build quality. I think there is no doubt about it. However, I think the ergonomics are not of top standards. The place where thigh rests is higher than where your butt rests. Hence, you tend to bend further to reach the keyboard if you are of average height... 5'5\" - 5'9\" ish. This puts enormous amount of stress on the back and prompts for a bad posture. If you do not spend much time on the chair, I would say go for it. If you work from home most of the time or spend more time than normal, I would recommend looking for a better chair.",

One year out--the back of the chair is separating from where it is bolted into the armrests. so the thing is basically junk. I regret the purchase--don't buy this one.",

I'm going to contact Amazon for some sort of adjustment as it's beyond the return window. Unfortunately I threw out the packaging along with the old chair that this one was supposed to replace, so I couldn't return it anyhow.",
