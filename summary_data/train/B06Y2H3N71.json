I could smell the oils through two boxes, right away knew they had leaked. I like my dropper to drop one drop at a time, rather than poor out really fast and uncontrollable. The \"oil\" consistency is that of water. Possibly another reason it comes out so fast. There is no information where the oil itself came from, yet package states \"100% pure and natural. Therapeutic grade essential oils\" but they provide no proof of this. I would not use these on my body for this reason. Overall, stick with what you know. You get what you pay for.",

I bought one bottle of Thieves essential oil which is a yummy blend of cinnamon and clove. It actually smells like those Xmas ribbon candy from my childhood. It\u2019s worth the money and it leaves a nice fragrance all day. I do not recommend the Artizen oils.",

A reason for the amended response is the price, $19 is extremely cheap for 14 oils, even in small bottles. I felt these oils are watered down - mainly because just turning some bottles upside down 5-7 drops would fall out like spilling water. Other bottles a turn upside might yield 1-2 thick drops (not watered down). Some of the oils were thicken in substance than others, in any event they all smell pretty good. I was disappointed initially, but for the price and amount it is more than reasonable.",

It has a strong cinnamon or clove like scent that is addicting. Highly recommended. Eligible for Prime. Seller is ultra communicative, soliciting feedback at every juncture of the sale. I will definitely broaden my horizons with other products from this company. Great product, price and service. A+ all the way",

I had an issue where my Lemon essential oil managed to show up empty, so I contacted the company and they offered to send me a free replacement. For that alone, I'd recommend this kit, this brand, these oils, and these people, to anybody!",

Thought they were bigger but they are sample sized. Must have not read the description correct. Still a great price for the large variety. Put about 5 drops of the \"breathe\" one in my new diffuser and it's very potent. Would buy again. Especially if there's another set of different scents.",
