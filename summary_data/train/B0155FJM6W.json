The build quality is out standing. This watch easily stands up to the quality of my 400 dollar Bulova. I am extremely impressed. Overall 1. Stylish 2. Superbly effective and useful 3.

I\u2019ve only owned it about a week but I foresee no real problems and as a watch and an accessory, it\u2019s really nice. A bit pricier than many other Casios but you get what you pay for.

    "description": "\u200b\n\nCasioWith the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.\n\nToday, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.\n\n\n\nFrom G-SHOCK, the watch brand that is constantly setting new standards for timekeeping toughness, comes G-STEEL, a watch series with a new \"layer guard structure\". Different materials are used for the bezel to create a two-layer structure that adds a new dimension of shock resistant. For models that use stainless steel in the upper part, shock absorbing resin is employed in the lower part. If resin is used in the upper part, fine resin is used in the lower part to cushion against impact from the upper part. This also has made it possible create a wide range of different designs. The GST-S110 model expresses the hardness and beauty of metal. A hand shift feature temporarily moves hands out of the way with the press of a button for easy reading of digital display contents, while double LED face illumination keeps information easy to read at all times.\n\n\n\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS\n * Product Warranty: For warranty information about this product, please click here.
