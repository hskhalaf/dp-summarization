I feel that you can use like 40% less than what's listed, so lasts longer than the other biodegradable organically blah blah laundry soaps out there.

Unfortunately, not sure if it's the combo, but the scent doesnt really come out in clothing once washed. Still, I'd rather no scent than too strong of one.",
