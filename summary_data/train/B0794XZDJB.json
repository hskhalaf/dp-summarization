Otherwise it has the same features as the AVH-200EX, so if you use digital music these days, forget the complexity of a DVD/CD headunit and buy this one instead for less money! Works great with my phone. I'm now taking my calls handsfree, playing my music from the phone without a cord over Bluetooth, playing music from USB, and enjoying my backup camera. I replaced the stock speakers in my FJ Cruiser at the same time, and wow, what a difference! Life is good. Thanks, Pioneer!",

This has to do with bluetooth, which is the feature I use the most, and when it happens it literally cuts the audio and won't let you play any type of bluetooth. It completely quits out. It's fixable, but you have to turn the whole car off then back on, which is inconvenient while driving, for obvious reasons. Not sure if my radio is just a dud and this problem doesn't happen to most, but it's been pretty irritating thus far.",

My favorite feature is that you can connect up to three blue tooth devices and switch back and forth between them with ease. You can even have two of them hooked up at the same time. One phone can be set to receive and dial calls and the other can play music. Very nice unit and well worth the price I payed.",
