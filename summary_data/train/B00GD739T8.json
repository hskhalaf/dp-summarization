      "text": "I bought this primarily for practicing lacrosse with my son. I couldn't be any happier with it. The return angles are perfect... everything from pop-flys to ground balls, even without having to adjust the back legs. Lacrosse balls are heavier than baseballs, so I know it'll work great for baseball too. Between the price and performance of this piece of equipment, I'm completely satisfied. Money well spent. Update - After 2 years of use/ownership enough of the bungee straps have broken and I'm back in the market for another one. I'm not deducting any stars from my review, because I have left it outside during the entire 2 years, exposed to every weather condition possible.",

The construction is very durable...if it can stand up to the abuse my nephew gives it, then it will stand up to anything! He loves playing with this...making up games to incorporate the flyback net into even if multiple people are playing with him. It has also helped with teaching him about hitting/strike zone, control and accuracy of his throwing, playing unpredictable bounces when catching and so on. Many ways to use this to teach baseball but also have fun at the same time!",

This is not too hard to assemble, directions could be improved, I am mechanically inclined, ended up looking at the picture to get the legs and net fastened. One thing about this, the pins to hold the back legs, they are essentially useless, best to find replacements that will stay in the holes during a tossing session. The stakes are pretty useless, they also come out of the ground since they are too short and too thin, these also need replaced. They function to a point, maybe for kids..overall product worth the money but can use improvement.",

You can actually have two players use it at the same time, alternating throwing and catching. I opened the box and made sure that all the pieces were sent. I found no issues with the quality of this product and no parts were missing. The only difficult assembly part was installing the net bungee cords on the sides of the frame. You have to stretch them further than the others to connect them. I would suggest buying this Flyback to everyone.",

I was concerned about the netting as some reviews stated their's was too small. I was nervous at first because it looked small, however as we stretched the net (can be difficult) the net fits just fine. The bungee cords can be rough on your fingers, but that's expected with how it's suppose to be put together. Works just as described. Happy birthday kiddo~happy parents!",
