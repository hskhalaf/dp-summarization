The problem with this set up is the piece that had the mold is not removable and has a very small small cut which allows moisture but no way to clean it. After trying to open up the gap with a knife and scraping a rather large amount of mold I decided just to cut off the piece and I\u2019m so glad I did. I did enjoy being able to mix a large amount of formula at once and it was ove very convenient to use. The mold I cannot overlook though, especially when feeding my baby!",

Got all of the formula in and mixed it really well. Shook the container too. Still a good sized clump of formula stuck to the bottom that the mixer in the middle won't touch - almost half a scoop worth of powder.",

I've used them both for about 2-3 weeks, now. The only pro Dr Brown's has over Munchkin is that DB can hold larger batches.

The formula has time to settle in the fridge so there's no foam or bubbles. I wish I bought this sooner. Honestly I almost bought a baby breeza for $200. This is better for ten bucks!

I know this is ideally made for bulk formula mixing but I am currently using for exclusively pumping and feeding breast milk. Anything that is pumped goes in the pitcher, before bed I make bottles for the next day, wash the pitcher and then in the morning its ready to go. It will make paternity leave for my husband easy as well! Thanks Munchkin!!!",
