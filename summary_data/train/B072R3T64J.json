However the Large is too long even though the girth was ok but couldn\u2019t get it tighter on her. See attached pictures wearing this Large with the garment tape. My 7yo fits in the Medium much better! The Medium was too large for my 1yoa GSP, so I\u2019m ordering her the Small.",

I was worried he wouldn't want too wear it, but on cold days he actually stands quietly and waits for me to put the coat on him. And he stays out longer on cold days when he's got it on. It isn't restrictive as far as I can tell, and he seems perfectly happy wearing it. I've owned a few other dog coats, this is BY FAR the nicest one. It even keeps his tummy warm, but it doesn't get in the way when he, um, you know. I raved about it so much that my daughter bought one for her dog, and he also likes it!",

However, I knew it would be, according to the stated measurements (which are pretty accurate, by the way). Has velcro to adjust the fit and generous head and leg openings, so it's not a struggle to get this on and off. The quality seems good and it's cute too!",

Good fit, good quality, and boy, does he look dapper. We live in a very rainy climate so this waterproof coat might be the thing that keeps me from going crazy with a perpetually wet dog. Very, VERY nice",
