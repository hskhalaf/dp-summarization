So I decided to buy this, which has a 6 inch escutcheon to cover two extra holes on left and right side. Only problem I have with this item is it is constricting water flow so much that it feels like the valve is a half way open when it is opened fully. I had to take out the 1/4 inch O ring from the constrictor and I see the full pressure of water flowing through.",

He had not run the water to check. He came back and fixed. Said it had never happened before! Probably a dyslectic worker at the factory.\ud83d\ude07",

      "text": "What isn't completely obvious from the picture unless you look closely is that the outer surface of the spout is in two halves, an upper and lower half, and they meet on the sides. With the copy I got, there was close to a 1/16\" gap on the right side, so you could see right in, and at best it would be a pain in the behind to keep clean. Another copy might be better but it seems like an unfortunate design.",
