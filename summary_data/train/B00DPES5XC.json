      "text": "Really great tablet. Feels very solid than many other tablets on the market from that category. Screen is not the best but its ok and speakers as well on the front is a plus. The only negative is that its loosing wifi connection frequent (especially when many devices are connected to the same router) and cant find a way to fix it. It looks like a hardware problem on that model based and other reviews as well.",

The second tablet 'died' yesterday so it's 14 days outside the return date. My 5 year old is in pieces. We thought Lenovo was a good make and would be sturdy and robust enough for kids. When the tablets worked they were brilliant but to both break within 2 months is totally not acceptable.",

Mediocre equaliser which does little to rescue the muddy bass heavy audio. Poor screen viewing angles. Poor screen resolution. Two people would not enjoy watching video. Bass heavy audio is so bad it makes me mad to think this product could reach the marketplace! I bought this as an mp3 player : (",
