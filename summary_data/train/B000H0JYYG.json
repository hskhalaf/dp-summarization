I used this & the pain was brought down to a tolerable level, which helped my migraine calm down too. I'm shocked! Only negative is that the smell is kinda odd. It doesn't smell bad, but definitely not a good smell. On a scale of 1-10 (1 is bad, 5 is neutral, 10 is good) I would say a 4. It's almost a neutral smell lol But TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!!",

It does work and I'm so happy to be able to sleep on my side again and walk more normally. My suggestion is to give it a try.",
