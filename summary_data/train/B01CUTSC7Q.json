I think the sugar bowl is entirely too small in proportion to the creamer. It's looks as though they belong to different sets. I didn't return it. It's too much trouble. I'll keep looking for a larger sugar bowl. I also think the tiny ceramic spoon is incongruous. I found a small metal one at Bed, Bath, & Beyond that's more utilitarian and doesn't require tweezers to hold.",
