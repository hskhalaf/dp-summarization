      "text": "This product is great! This is the first product that enable me to show 4K 60 hertz on my Dell monitor. Can't say I notice a difference though. Also, unlike other cheapo USB C hub, it doesn't cut out and it glitches out when outputting to the 4K monitor. It's a bit pricey but does the job. Also, it doesn't clutter the table and you have to connect a single usb c cable to the laptop. The entire dock can sit out of sight behind the monitor.",

We also use this configuration in a Citrix virtual desktop environment and it works with that too. I tired the Dell D3100 Dock thinking it would be a quality dock with DisplayLink compatibility but had some trouble utilizing multiple monitors (docking and undocking cause monitors to not work). This Pluggable Dock solved all the issues - very happy with it! I bought several!",
