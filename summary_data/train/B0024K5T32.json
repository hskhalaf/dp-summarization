The size is most ideal for use and is MUCH more convenient than the taller but narrower designs offered by others. The cover fits perfectly and allows for use of a plastic bag and still be able to seal well and not pinch off or damage the bag. Our friends saw this at a distance and WOW what a great container. Got to get one of those, she said. Never-the-less the container suits our needs to greater expectations. Suggest that anyone looking for a product like this to compost or just hold your table/food preparations should definitely purchase this product.",

The only thing it needs is an easy to empty plastic container inside so the stainless steel exterior doesn't get banged up. I found a large plastic candy container fit it perfectly. Expensive but looks good and very durable. Replacement carbon filters are included.",

The \"fit and finish\" is not nearly as good as on my old one -- too bad -- but it's still a great product.",

Not only is it large capacity, but the mouth is large, which reduces spillage when scraping in food scraps. The lid is so easy to use. Others have complained about its not fitting tightly, but I always hated trying to cram a lid closed. It slides on easily and fairly quietly, and we have not had an odor issue. This is the most we've ever spent on a compost pail, but I think it's going to last forever! Definitely worth the price.",
