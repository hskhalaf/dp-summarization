Both he and his older cousin frequently practice in the backyard and this chipping target has given him a physical target to chip towards. It is small, easy to store, and has held up to outside elements so far (several months). I would recommend this for any beginning to advanced golfer that wants to perfect his/her shot...it's a simple tool that, when used, can really impact one's game. A definite recommended buy!",
