Or you want your computer to work like your phone, so you don't have to deal with two systems constantly, this is the computer Apple should have made 30 years ago when they were Saying that the Mac was \"intuitive\". Of course, if you have never used a smartphone before, or Android, then sure, there will be a learning curve, just a mercifully shorter one. It's too bad that the concept of the Desktop phone-Companion seems to have died. Because this is a sweet little machine, and I know a lot of especially older people that would take to this like butter on toast.",

It is a nice looking unit, great display, touchscreen is very nice, keyboard and mouse work as they should. Our needs require advanced word processing capability and that is where the software offering are still a bit limited, otherwise very happy with the purchase!",

It is advertised as an all in one computer but tends to run slow, is not optimized for so many websites and isn't amazing to use I wouldn't suggest this as a buy for anyone other than maybe toddlers that need an oversized tablet",
