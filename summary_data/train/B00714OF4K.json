      "text": "I ordered the Petflect Reflective Dog Vest in size small for my Beagle (20-25 lbs.) The sizing is perfect for him, and it fits great (I posted 2 photos in the customer photos.) The material is lightweight and comfortable. The orange is very bright, and the silver portions are highly reflective-- both of which provide great visibility! I would recommend this product for leash walks on roadways and on trails, especially at night or dawn/dusk and during hunting season. The material probably wouldn't hold up for use in thick brush where it might get snagged. I would definitely purchase this product again!",

He was easily seen in the woods wearing this vest which made our family feel better about letting him off the leash in the woods. The size large fit our dog great.

It probably helps that I bought my own reflective vest and wore it for a week of walks before her vest arrived. Hopefully, it will be somewhat durable.

The fabric is a bit flimsy, and I don't see it standing up to a great deal of use. However, it is definitely worth the price. A word of advice - go by the actual measurements. I went by the weight, not by the actual measurements and have to reinforce our vest with an additional piece of velcro....maybe the walking will help my fat doggy fit into the vest better in the future. This is my fault, though, and I did not let that affect my review.",
