This should do the trick! 6.7.17- well, it isn't working. The brain of it isn't functioning correctly so now I will have to get a hold of the manufacturer to get a replacement. When I will I will follow up again. 3-12-2019 update I added a battery disconnect switch so my camper when parked can no longer drain the battery when parked. I have the battery tender hooked directly to the battery and it now seems to be keeping the battery charged. Supper happy",

The corner mounting holes stick out from the panel frame when It doesn't look like the needed to this just wastes space and doesn't allow for multiple panels to be mounted flush against each other. 2. Charge controller should be at the other end of the cord who wants to crawl on the roof of there shed to check the batteries status. Other than those it's great. :)",
