The straps will wear, and could eventually break, but as with all Great Gear, they are Easily (and relatively inexpensively) replaced. Was able to traverse steep terrain in very deep powder conditions, hike comfortably for a few hours, and even gracefully glissade the descent. Love these snowshoes and the fact that you can put floats on them, though they performed well enough without to not warrant need for them! Also they Seem Indestructible, so far GREAT product and I don't think my mind will be changing any time soon!",

I am pleased with these and have already recommended them to 2 friends who are also frustrated with old straps and shoes.",

If there is a lot of snow, I find snowmobile or cross country tracks and follow them since I did not purchase the tails. If you want to snowshoe off the beaten track, you definitely need tails, but if you are mostly snowshoeing for exercise or walking the dog I would definitely recommend them as they are super light and great for long distances.",

These are tank-like in their efficiency and ease of putting on/taking off. The tails make the snowshoes so versatile that I would recommend them to anyone. I'm using these for 3+ foot deep powder and digging snow pits. If I'm in a tight pit I can just take the tails off and keep the crampon-like traction while saving maneuverability. So far no mechanical failure other than a broken retaining clip (they should give you extras).",

They are excellent if you're also light (I'm probably 190 with pack and gear), but you may sink if you weigh more and aren't using the tails. They articulate very well and the strap mechanisms are easy to use once they are properly adjusted for your boots.",
