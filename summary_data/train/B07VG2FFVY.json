      "text": "These shoes are awesome so far. I have Morton's neuroma in my foot so I'm always looking for a shoe with a wider toe box and cushion. I have played with these twice on hard court and I have had no toe jam and there is plenty of cushion. I tried the B width as well but those were a little too snug. The wide which felt really roomy but in the end worked great on court. There is no break in period. I am a 5.0 player and i'm rough on my shoes so we will see how well these hold up.",

Although snug in the forefoot, with a standard light sport sock they were very comfortable and lightweight. Heel slipped slightly until I \"lock-laced\" them at the top. Great lateral support, no break-in time. Many of the newest tennis styles of Nike, Asics, and NB fit the forefoot like a glove, very snug, so finding a pair with a deep enough toe box that is fabric (not leather) and will take an orthotic was a big challenge. Foot doc ok'd this shoe for this overpronator.",
