As good as the manual carbonator was this is even better. Just push the filled Sodastream bottle onto the One Touch, you don't even have to screw it in, hit the start button twice and in about 10 seconds you have a liter of fresh carbonated water. Can't emphasize enough how simple this is. We drink 4 or more liters of seltzer a day in the summer so this machine has gotten a fair bit of use since we set it up...100% reliable to date.",

There are adapters you can get to put aluminum CO2 (i.e. paintball) bottles and I've done that, but they are only 12 oz versus the 18 from the SodaStream versions and I haven't yet found a larger bottle that'll fit... so basically they did this horrible design due to the risk some people modify their unit in a more cost-effective and environmental way.",
