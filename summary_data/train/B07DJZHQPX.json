Is it a racing game, not really, if you're looking for racing games, go to the Forza motorsports series of games, if you're looking for driving games, the Horizon series is where its at. So far my only complaint really and the game's downfall fall for me at least, is all the stupid dance moves and clothes you win to dress your avatar in the game, its pretty pointless. 9 times out of 10, you'll win pointless clothes or something else to add to your avatar. I want CR points and cars, not clothes to outfit my avatar.",

I think you can still upgrade those items. I started off above average, but couldn't finish better than 5th in the racing games. So I went back to average and win 1st and 2nd now.",
