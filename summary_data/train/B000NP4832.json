The questions are ridiculously simple, and with the number of spaces you can move per turn, you can easily go from Start --> Finish within 4 or 5 rounds. We tried doubling up and going around the board twice, but were bored of it by the time it got to the end. There's no room for creativity or joking. You know the answer or you don't, and calling out a wrong answer (say for laughs) voids your turn. Buy something else.",

I suppose you can opt to change the rules... maybe we'll try that next time... to make it more 'party' like. That being said, it's mostly a trivia game... so if you like trivia you'll probably like this game.",

The game gives everyone a chance to get a few questions right and interact with loved ones in a time honored tradition of playing a board game at a kitchen counter.

There have even been a few expansions added to liven up gameplay. My one very small critique is that I liked the original artwork for the board better than the new design.

It's a good range of niche knowledge vs. pieces many of us know.

I also sometimes play by the rule that the adults can not guess until clue #3--just to even the playing field a bit. It would be great if the cards were sorted a bit by age range, just so we can easily focus on those that the kids have a shot of knowing. Alas, they do not know who Fred Astaire is (well, they do know....). Love the variety of topics.",
