I need to protect it as well as I do my camera, but also not trip over it when I am traveling. This case is extremely well-padded and yet not heavy to carry. Its over-the-shoulder carrying capability fits my needs perfectly. I will probably never have to re-purchase this heavy duty carrying case again, but if I did, I would buy this again.",

The reason im putting 3 stars on this review its because on the first use with the long strap, one of the D rings on one end just came off, it was poorly sewn, since then ive been carrying it with the handle. Besides that issue, its been ok for 4 months no other issues. I suppose i was the unlucky one that got a defect on that D ring poorly sewn :)",

      "text": "Well made bag,great quality, real padding and full length zipper, 5 stars for quality and construction but the size was not as described, mine was 36\" x 7\" x 9\" unfortunately the extra inch in length and height just leaves too much room to securely carry my single tripod. I'll say this is the best bag I have ordered ( I've tried 5 from manufactures) and the size issue seems to be universal, most were smaller than described and a few were bigger so it's trial and error...I ended up returning with no hassle....thanks Amazon..",
