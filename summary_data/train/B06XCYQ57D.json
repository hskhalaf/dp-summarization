      "text": "Bought for my son's dorm room. Air output was great, easy to setup for vent to the outside window. Problem was that the drip pan filled up too quickly, at least 2 gallons of water a day had to be dumped. I bought this unit because I thought it would not drip since the description indicated self-evaporating unit. Probably my misunderstanding, but would not recommend this unit if you do not want to deal with the drip pan.",

For next summer, I will have to think of another option because I won't use this for another year. EDIT: I didn't make it through the whole heat wave. I returned it and slept in another room with a window unit. I don't know if it is the floor unit technology or just this brand, but the air quality feels heavy and not cool.",
