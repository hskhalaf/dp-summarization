Problem is guide strings on the underside of the umbrella are made of COTTON and will eventually break. This causes the metal supports to go out of alignment and break. I coated the top with water repellant and it does work. Umbrella was outside in the elements for 3mths. If they fixed this problem I believe you could get a good season or more out of it but until they do I would not recommend.",

High winds might challenge it, but that's true with any umbrella. I'd buy this product again.",
