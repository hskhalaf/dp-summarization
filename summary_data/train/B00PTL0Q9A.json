My biggest complaint is that the buttons to move the handle is in the front of the car seat in the area of my thumb rather than the back like my older car seats. I found the thumb buttons to be somewhat difficult. The handle could not move back and forth without pushing the canopy up and down. It's almost like the two were connected to each other. We are returning and getting a different car seat.",
