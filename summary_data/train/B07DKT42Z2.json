Let me tell you I honestly don\u2019t even think someone who is a size 12 could wear these comfortably without them being tight. In my opinion they probably wouldn\u2019t fit anyone above a 8 or 10. They were tiny! If you are a \u201cthicker\u201d girl don\u2019t buy these!! Cause they aren\u2019t made for us \u201cthicker\u201d women!",
