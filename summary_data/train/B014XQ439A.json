      "text": "Upgraded my stock speakers in my 2016 Ram 2500. Speakers sound 100X better than stock! Very clear sound and a little but better bass. The clarity is great and can crank them up with no distortion. I researched several speakers before doing my install (kicker, Kenwood, Memphis, other pioneers) but these sounded wayyy better and clear than the others (went into a retail store to listen to several before I picked one). I would highly recommend that because you can find the speakers that sound the best to you (more bass, clarity or loudness).",
