As others have said, the paper very easily jams, the nozzles clog frequently and easily, and the printer drinks quite a bit of ink. I currently also use an Epson 2200, which has ended up costing less because it does better with the ink (ink is where these companies make their money of course).",

It has been a constant headache, frequent paper jams, firmware glitches, inkjets clogging over and over (I lose a lot of ink by having to clean jets at least 2-3 times in succession to get ink flowing again). Stay away from it. Go with a Canon or HP. Those seem to get the best reviews. It's a shame... the output really is beautiful, but it's not worth tearing your hair out.",

They have a chip that disables them after a certain amount of use, whether they are really used up or not. You'll spend more time and ink cleaning heads than printing. Print quality is okay if you can get the heads clean, and if you have any ink left by then. Built-in media card reader is nice.",
