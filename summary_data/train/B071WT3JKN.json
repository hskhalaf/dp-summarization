His shoulder, wrist, and neck joints can rotate 360 degrees, and his head can be posed to look slightly downward. Excellent toy for the price.",

Also, the back has a big cutout to connect with some other accessory that was not included. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone since it doesn\u2019t include the extras it is made to connect with, so the arm just looks ugly and weird.

I purchased 3 of the action figures thinking they would all work together, but none of them came with the Titan Hero Power Fx Port to make them interact. We were very disappointed. Now I cannot find it to buy it separately leaving my grandson with just the action figure.",
