I was a little hesitant to order the turquoise one because I didnt want it to be more green than anything but I love it. Personally it isn't really turquoise its a pretty mint color. Which I love the color. I've seen several reviews say that the card holder is hard to open but I haven't really had that problem. It holds the two cards, plus a couple bills easily. I havent had a single problem with this phone case. I will definitely purchase again for myself and family members.",

I'm just a little bummed because the picture for this shows a stylus pen, but it didn't come with it. It did come with a screen protector, but I was more so looking forward to the applicator since I downloaded a cool app called \"Animation Desk\" where you can draw and make it come to life haha. Anyways, the case itself is great otherwise.",
