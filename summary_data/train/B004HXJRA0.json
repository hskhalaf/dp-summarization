It's truly one of the top U-locks and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Since bike theft is relatively common in the area I'm in, I bought 2 Abus - one to lock my rear wheels through the triangle to the rack, and the other to lock my front wheel to my bike frame. So far, things are going great! This lock is good because not only is it small enough, but it's also quite thick and is double bolted. Highly recommended!",

The size, unfortunately, is a problem -- it's too short to get around the frame, a wheel, and the bike rack in almost every case. I bought a separate cable to use with it, but frankly having to carry and use both the lock and the cable every time is a pain, and I end up avoiding situations where I need to lock it. Eventually I'll probably buy another, technically less secure lock that's more convenient considering my needs.",

Key and shackle design are not the best for ease of use but you get the hang of it quick. Hold up great after months rain, getting dropped, etc.",

The other benefit is that these locks aren't as popular in the US, so it's less likely that people will have a matching key for it or know how to break it. Oh, and it has a locking mechanism on both sides of the lock, so if one end is compromised, the other will still hold. So far so good. Sometimes it's hard to lock up with such a small lock, but I think it's worth the hassle for better protection and something a little lighter.",

      "INDUSTRY LEADING CORROSION RESISTANCE- Don\u2019t open yourself to easy thefts by using a degraded and corroded lock. Abus\u2019s corrosion resistant coating and through-body shackle technology featured on the U-Lock keeps your bike secure for years.",
      "LIGHT WEIGHT AND COMPACT- The U-Mini 40 lives up to its name by wrapping an incredibly strong, durable and secure bike lock into a small unit that can easily fit in your back pocket, won\u2019t weigh your bag down in transit, and easily mounts to your frame.",
      "ABUS PREMIUM CYLINDER PROTECTION- The general idea of a bike theft is that someone came with bolt-cutters and after slicing and dicing through your bike lock, they took off on your ride. This isn\u2019t the only form of attack though and this is why in conjunction with the absolute best torsion resistance, Abus offers you their Premium Cylinder technology that protects the entire locking keyed mechanism from lock picking.",
      "DOUBLE BOLTING SHACKLE- The Bolting Mechanism locks in two places, offering an elite level of security and doesn\u2019t leave any weak spots in the armor for a bike thief to take advantage of. The U-Mini 40 makes it incredibly simple for you to ride where and when you want without fear of what could happen to your bike when you\u2019re not rolling. The Soft Touch Coating even ensures that your paint job won\u2019t get the slightest hint of a scuff."
