What a breeze to use! It starts repeatedly in a flash -- and the starting cord is easy to pull. And once it gets running, it takes just a couple minutes to \"get the hang of it.\" After that, it almost edges by itself. The blade tends to apply enough forward pressure to draw the edger along the sidewalk or driveway, and it seems to hold a straight path with very little guiding effort by the user. Okay, so it hasn't made this whole \"edging chore\" FUN, but it's certainly a LOT easier.",

All in all a great bang for your buck compared to other machines.",
