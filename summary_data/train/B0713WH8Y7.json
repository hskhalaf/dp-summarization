      "text": "GREAT for pain in sinus area--brows, between brows and cheeks! I love the soothing cold of ice. Can also be warmed in microwave if preferred. I got the full mask since I anticipate some dental work, and am already sure this will really help. The very soft thin layer of fabric is perfect to let the cold through, but not enough that I have to wait at all to use it straight out of the freezer. The two elastic bands with a little bit of velcro holds it in place in the back even enables you to get up and walk around. Highly recommend!",

Used it for my knee once, same problem. Too small and thin so it loses its heat and cold very quickly. I had one before, so I am comparing it to that one. Problem there was I put it in the microwave to long twice and the beads started dissolving.",
