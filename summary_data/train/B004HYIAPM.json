One of the more frustrating things is the beginning of the game. It is fun to watch once, maybe twice, but you have to sit through it every time you create a new character. In previous games you could skip it but not this time around. There are more annoying aspects to the game but I do not wish to post any type of spoilers for those who decide to ignore the negatives and venture forth on their own.",

It is a \"cross-genre\" game, meaning it is part FPS (first-person shooter, \"first-person\" refers to the camera view), part RPG (role-playing game), part action game. HUGE open world play - do what you want when you want to do it. Really needs SkyUI & Skyrim script extender (mods) to make the game interface nice. Problems? Search the UESP wiki for the solution.

Awesome graphics, great story line, versatile...and so on...the only thing that really bugs me about this game is the number of glitches. I didn't experience any glitches in the main story line; however, some of the interesting side bars, well...there just wasn't any work arounds except one... and that one I had to use a check to end the glitche on one segment of the school of wizardry...but I ran into another....so I started one of the other journeys...wham...another glitche...very disappointing..",
