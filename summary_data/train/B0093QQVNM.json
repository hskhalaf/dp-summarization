      "text": "My blind grandmother has used an older model of this watch for a while now, but they've all worn out over the years. This new model is way better in almost every way imaginable. The buttons are easier to press, the band is very soft and flexible whereas the old one was fairly stiff and hard. I am very impressed because basically every complaint she had about the old one has been taken care of completely with this newer model. And it is still just as loud, which is what really sets this watch apart from every other talking watch I've ever seen.",

By pressing one more button; you can turn the Hourly Time Announce feature on or off. And at the touch of a few more buttons; you can set a beeping alarm to wake you. Perhaps best of all; every feature of this watch is totally accessible by a blind person. It's a piece of cake to tell whether the alarm is set to go off - and when; and to check if Hourly Report is toggled on or off. You can also set it to speak the time in either 12-hour or 24-hour military style. And of course; the watch has a large LCD display; and a fully adjustable plastic strap - meaning it can fit kids and adults alike. So; whether you're buying this attractive; nicely-boxed talking watch as a special treat for yourself or a friend; it's sure to be a practical tool that'll be used all the time!
