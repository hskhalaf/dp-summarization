From what I could tell it looks to be informative based on the ToC. Just not easy to read. It would be wonderful to have a corrected copy.",

The 10 tips the book provides to prepare for this diet are very useful, for any dieter. I also loved the shopping lists and sample recipes!

As well, the menu is for 2000 calories a day and you are left to figure out how to reduce the calories for your needs.",
