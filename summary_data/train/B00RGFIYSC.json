The only downside I'm noticing is that a few of them (I bought the brown ones) are starting to discolor, turning a tint of green. This is perhaps due to facing our back door with some sun exposure. Not a huge deal as they still function but if you really look at them they are not all brown any longer.",

It was unfinished anyway. Had it been on a painted surface im sure it would have been fine. But they work as they should I'm assuming. Update the sticky residue just rubbed off fine.",

Giving 4 stars only because on one of the tables I have them on they kept coming off after about 3 weeks and I had to super glue them on, but I think that was due to the table corners being rounded because they have stayed perfectly intact on my other table with more blunt corners.",
