However after almost 2.5 years BOTH of these had the same problem: they would get stuck in one position and would not oscillate. This happened on the return oscillation and must be a design problem where something is wearing/sticking. Unfortunately I could not take these apart. Obviously this is a very major problem for an oscillating sprinkler. At this price I would expect better quality. I gave an extra star because I got almost 3 years use but I really was leaning to a one star rating!",

The really cool feature is how you can adjust the range of coverage. This gives you the ability to adjust the depth of coverage incrementally with the adjustment levers...a great idea and works really well.

I like to tweak it so that it is getting the plantings, but not the patio or buildings. It feels quite heavy. If it is on the ground, it doesn't move around. If I elevate it on a patio table, the weight of the hose sometimes makes it move around, so I just stick a somewhat large stone between the 2 black bars on the bottom, and then it doesn't slide around at all, and doesn't interfere with the oscillating part.",
