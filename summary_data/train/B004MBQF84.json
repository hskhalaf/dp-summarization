I thought they sounded great, and did an amazing job at blocking out external noises (probably because they were clamped so tight onto my head). I ended up buying thewhich sounds great and is substantially more comfortable to wear (and has larger cups, which I think will help with the ear pressure).",

Compared to other professional studio quality headphones these seem \"cheap\" and I'm not sure they would last long after daily use. I can't comment on the sound because after seeing them, I simply put them back in the box for the return. A major problem is that the wiring comes down from both ear pieces and then merges, in front, similar to the wiring on ear buds. This would make them uncomfortable for all day use in a studio. They were not that expensive, so I guess \"you get what you pay for\".",
