I was hopeful for better things from this model, despite the unnecessary gimmick of connecting it to my mobile phone. Whoever thought of that nonsense? But after only a couple of weeks, the \"Cross Action\" head shows significant deterioration, so it looks like Braun have managed to build in obsolescence to their over-priced heads at an even fast rate than before. Not impressed.",

      "text": "Having tried different oral B brushes in the past, this was the best . It is sturdy and well made with a great battery life. The power is impressive and gives a thorough clean. Not oral B electric brushes are the same in terms of power and this is top of the range . I must say i haven't utilised the Bluetooth as much as i should but its definitely not a gimmick and allows polishing teeth, brushing tongue etc.",

I have seen the original Oral-B carry case (when bought as a single toothbrush ) and I have used Philips Diamond 3 Sonicare. They all have premium cases - this feels like it has been delivered from a 1 pound shop. You can't charge, it is a literally a plastic case wannabe. In addition, you get less toothbrush heads and 1 silicon phone handler. I understand these makes sense but at least put in the original carry case not a 1 pound shop replica!!!",

The toothbrush charge for me lasts about 3 weeks, and only take a few hours to charge. The only down side is it doesn't give you very much visible warning of it going flat, and then you wlil go to use it and it will die mid brush...maybe if i used the app more it will tell me on this.",

The brush itself consists of functions which suit your own personal preferences. It cleans your teeth profoundly and makes them squeaky clean and shiny white. I'm a bit unhappy with advertisements of 2 brushes for 1, as the pack is only equipt with 1 brush worth. However, overall I'm very happy and it has been a long term investment for better.",
