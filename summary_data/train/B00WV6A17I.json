That is something to get used to. But if you cut out the center of the picture, it is reasonable. From the accessories, I only use the little remote, the bike handle bar clamp and the GoPro connector. The instructions could be more elaborate but in the end you will figure out what works and what not. I bought a sturdy selfie-stick (Fugetek) and ordered a suction cup mount (Sametop) and I'm good to go.",
