Since it had some pretty good reviews and is a fraction of the cost compared to the brands at the drug store, I thought I would give it a try. The first test I took was positive. Due to the test being more sensitive compared to prior tests I've used, I figured I should wait a few extra days to take the test again. About 6 days after taking the last test, I took the test again and got a negative result.",

Seriously buy the competitors for 20NG so you don't have to stress out thinking you are just seeing things.",

Measures thc metabolites at 20ng/dL which is less than half of the normal cut-off level for most drug tests so it gives you a certain degree of confidence knowing you passed a more sensitive test. However, the test line is often very lightly colored making interpretation of results a bit more difficult. The company does offer the option of sending in a photo of the drug test for confirmation of the test results. Overall good buy for anyone who needs to pass a drug screen for work",
