The menu etc. became extremely slow to respond and there is no picture whatsoever. People with similar issues on the A/V forums are saying that it's $700-$1000 to have this issue fixed. No thanks.. I had also purchased a very expensive standby replacement bulb that is now useless. If someone is happy with a 3 year product, go for it. Otherwise, find something else.",

The lens shift works great and I appreciate that that there is an automatic lens cover that closes when the unit is turned off. I can almost watch with the shades up, but that much better in the controlled light man cave. Ambient light seems fine. Have not tried the 3D yet, but the included 3D glasses seem well made. Have it running with my harmony one remote flawlessly. Would recommend this hands down just based on my 2-week experience.",

We used it on our living room wall while finishing our theater room. The wall is builders grade beige and the only effect that had on the picture was an added warmth compared to the same picture on our tv. We aren't big gamers but didn't notice any lag when using our PS4. Never going to the theater again to watch a movie.",

The warranty only covers for 2 years so I had to buy a new projector after that. After researching it, I learned that these failing HDMI ports are a common problem for this model.",

The RF 3d glasses work much better then the infrared ones on the 5010 I had before. Only downside is this doesn't handle 4k but at least it isn't fake 4k either.

My only complaint is that for the best image it requires a very dark room. The image looks pretty washed out in normal light conditions. At night or with all of the blinds closed and the lights off, however, it is unbelievable. I'm pretty sure there is no reason to pay to go to the theater again.",

I installed about 12 ft from the wall and display 110\". If I pull the curtain, it is just amazing. I didn't buy it for 3D but after watching a couple of movies I am looking for more.
