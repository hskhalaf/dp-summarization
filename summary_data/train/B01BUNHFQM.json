Additionally, I have never had them stain clothing or not dissolve properly. I toss them in before the machine is loaded with clothing or water. A bit pricier than a bottle of detergent, but they're even more worth it when you can get them on a deal! (And no, I don't eat them. Strictly laundering purposes only.)",

It keeps the clothes smelling good even after coming out of the dryer, The only complaint I have is the cost and that sometimes they stick together. However the good outstays the bad and I will continue to use and order this product!",
