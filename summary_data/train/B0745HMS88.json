Unbelievable! I'm really careful with my cookware too. I'm pretty bummed out as I had opened it and stupidly threw out the box it came in as it was trash day, so now i'm stuck. I used some special high temperature epoxy putty to hold the crack and it seems like it will work, but I just bought this! Anyway, good concept, but make the frame stronger!!",

    "title": "Hamilton Beach Durathon Ceramic Griddle Electric with 200 square inch PTFE & PFOA Free Cooking Surface (38519R)",
    "description": "Wake your family to fluffy, golden brown pancakes made on the Hamilton Beach Duration Ceramic Griddle. Hashbrowns, eggs, sausage? It can handle it all. With its ceramic nonstick coating and 200 square inch cooking surface, you can make a whole meal with little fuss and easy cleanup. Made with Duration ceramic, this griddle provides you with superior nonstick performance that is four times more durable than traditional nonstick coatings. You won't have to scrape your meal off the cooking surface because hotcakes and fried eggs flip with ease. The heat is adjustable for a greater range of cooking options, and the handles remain cool to the touch throughout the cooking cycle. Griddles are commonly used at breakfast because they are perfect for pancakes, French toast and fried eggs, but they are flexible enough to be used all day. Try grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch and you'll be amazed at how evenly the cheese is melted and the bread browned. For dinner, make tender, juicy hamburgers and hotdogs. And the griddle is as easy to clean up as it is to use.",
