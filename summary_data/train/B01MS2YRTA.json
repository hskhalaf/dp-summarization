Heard from others that the sound quality and microphone is totally useless after 45-50 MPH. What's the point? If I only rode 30 MPH everywhere I could just shout to my buddies instead of having bluetooth.",

The only reason I did not give the helmet a perfect score was due to the adaptive wind suppression ear covers, the fit doesn't hold fast, requiring numerous rechecks. Here is an Ideal, create a zipper removable wind suppression ear cover. Over all, this is a great unit, much easier to use in comparison to the SENA 20s.",

I agree with a few comments that sound is good with the ear pads, but gets rather muffled at highway speeds (I do not have a windshield). Clear as day below 55-60 mph. Easy to use once you study the quick star guide. One thing I would caution is that the Matte Black is easily scratched. My first ride out, got on the bike without any scratches, got off 20 miles later and a big while scratch on the top. I have a feeling the helmet with be black matte Plastidip in the very near future.",

I have the Sph10h-fm from 2009 and it is far superior to the Cavalry in mic clarity. I sent the Cavalry back and will wait for the 30K release before replacing my sph10h. The Cavalry does not have the feature that allows you to hear your voice in the speakers while on the phone or intercom. Major oversight in the design. Also, the controls are less intuitive and less glove friendly than the jog dial units.",

As an FYI - sizing helmets is always tricky. I normally wear an XL (that's what my Aria full face is) but XL on this one is a touch loose on this - nothing I can't remedy by tightening the chin strap, though.",

I am accustomed to a Sena SPH-10H with the high quality noise cancelling boom mic that provides flawless clarity of your voice with the mic touching your lips. The SPH model also has a feature where you can hear your voice through the helmet speakers, giving you a sense of the volume and clarity of your voice. The Calvary's mic did not do well above 40 mph and not being able to hear myself was frustrating. The boom mic models work great at highway speeds (60-80 mph).",
