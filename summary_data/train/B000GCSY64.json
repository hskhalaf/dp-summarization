It looked great at first, but after about a month, the dye had been almost washed out and I could see my light brown hair again (keep in mind, I wash my hair every other day). I'm really surprised because this is the first time a hair dye has faded out this fast for me.",

Maybe if left on longer than the instructions say the roots would have been colored enough, but following the instructions didn't yield good results. The conditioner is nice but seems smaller than other brands.",

Smell has always been pretty strong and long lasting, wish something could be done about that. Not a big deal though. I bought 2 because I have a lot of long curly hair. One of the tubes was broken or not sealed correctly on the bottom and some leaked.",
