Today is only day 2 and let me say, my toenail is so much better already! It is already coming back into shape, and it's still tender, but way better! Worth every penny and more.",

Tonight, the part that hooks onto the toenail edge caused the side of my other big toenail to crack off. It seemed to be working ok over the past 2 days but I'm just hoping I don't have to have surgery on it. It isn't infected but if it grows inward where it cracked off it may. NUTS! Wanted this to work so badly.",
