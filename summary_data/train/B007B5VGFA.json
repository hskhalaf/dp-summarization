No combination of button presses or battery removals has made any difference. Unsatisfactory. Recommend \"do not buy\". Just get a completely new base and set of phones.",

If you are making supper this is a great feature, because usually that is when all the people who are selling something usually call.

Cons: buttons on both base and wireless phone are not lighted for use in the dark I would definitely recommend.",

However, since they are accessories of the landline, I am having the same problem with the date that I have on the landline--I reset the date; however, when a call comes in, the date displays as one hour later than it actually is. This is something I have reset many times on the landline phone, but the date still reverts. This is my reason for the 4-star rating. Perhaps this annoyance would not bother someone else, in which case, I would recommend the phone.",

The back lit LCD display is large with block style letters, very easy to read without eye glasses; and it announces the caller, a feature I have decided to leave enabled. The display dims after a few seconds when the hand set is hung up. Works during power outages if you have standard service. If it only the large number buttons were lit, I would give the coveted fifth star.",
