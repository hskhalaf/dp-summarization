I spend months in the sun every spring summer and fall and can never quite get that dark Mediterranean tan that I\u2019ve always longed for. I decided to give this a try for my evenings of sitting out in the sun with a brew, and in less than a week I noticed that my skin retained much more of the color I was hoping for. I will say, it IS an oil NOT a lotion, so don\u2019t be surprised when you spray it on, sweat, and all of a sudden are slipperier than Shamoo in a car wash.",
