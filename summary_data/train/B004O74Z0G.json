One important thing I didn't realize when I bought it was that almost all campgrounds are configured with the living area on the passenger side of the vehicle parking place (if you back it in). This means that with the tent attached to the vehicle the opening is toward the back & the screen room facing the campground next to you. Most places won't allow you to park the vehicle off the designated parking place which are not usually long enough to accommodate the vehicle.",

      "text": "We love this tent! It is easy to set up, and even though it has several sections only the main section can be set up which is nice for the light camping days. You can walk anywhere in the tent without stooping. It stays cool even in the summer heat (cool enough to camp in Texas), and dry in heavy rain. We have used the screen porch for extra sleeping with the footprint tarp for the bottom. Unfortunately, we lost our beloved tent to 81 mph winds and 3 barbwire fences...... so we are buying another one.",
