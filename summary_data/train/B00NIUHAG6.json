      "text": "Really pleased with signal boost. I can now write this review from my phone in room wifi was weak. TV now working picking up wifi signal. I am ok at tech, but found being offered a choice of set up instructions confusing and had to factory reset after trying the 1st instructions which left my wifi without password protection. The second set of instructions worked. I had to set up a new password for an account, but then could keep the wifi password for plug boost. Means my device can switch between the wifi and plug extension for best signal. Worth the effort of setting up to get a consistently strong signal",

Sure, the new (extended) network was up, but it was even slower than the original one with low signal. This extender also seems very unreliable with 5 GHz networks. Although it initially worked for an hour or so, it then refused to connect any more until a hard reboot. Online forums suggest that this is a known problem with the device's firmware, which was never addressed. This product didn't do it's job for me, so I can't recommend it.",

The only problem is that it effectively sets up a second Wi-Fi point to connect to, rather than being a pure clone of the original. This can lead to situations where your device can faintly see your router and so stays connected to it, even when it would be better off switching across to the Netgear Wi-Fi signal. For us, this hasn't been any issue as our router is at one end of the house, so we put the extender right in the middle and connect everything to that. But it could be an issue for others.",

The other thing I didn\u2019t consider is it needs to run on a separate SSID therefore you can\u2019t seamlessly walk around your property, you\u2019ll need to keep changing between the booster and the primary router SSID which personally I think defects the point of this.

Next morning i had a solid amber light, which according to the forums means its 'rebooting'. problem is that it never finishes rebooting.
