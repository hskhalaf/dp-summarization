      "text": "This is our families 4th pair of Urbanears, each one a different model. Love Urbanears on a whole. These are no exception. The sound is crisp and clear when played through a Samsung Galaxy S5 streaming on Spotify on extreme quality. They sit well on my ears and are easily adjusted and are comfortable, though I have only listened to them about 15 - 20 min at a time so can't speak to longer listening times. The only ding in my books, hence the 4 stars not 5, is I would like a little more bass than is provided with this model. Other than that, great product and great quality for the price!",

If you are looking for headphones and don't want to shell out the money for the Beats then these are a great alternative. I use them for all of my apple products and picked up different colors for each of my kids so they know which ones are theirs. Great product for the price. I would recommend Urbanears products.",

The fabric covering is so nice and I love that the fabric covers the cord - less likely to split or break or get tangled. They earpieces fold in so the whole thing can be tucked away in a bag or drawer easily.",

I've seen similar styles of headphones priced all over the map. Many are much higher in price than the UbanEars. For an 11 year old to use with her ipod Touch, I just wasn't willing to pay an outrageous price. These fit the budget and made her very happy. She can listen to music, games and programming on her ipod Touch when she's in the same room as us without our having to hear it too. The came promptly and were very nicely packaged.

The ear cups are also much smaller than the ones on the previous pair and generally feel a lot less cushy and comfortable. The materials seem high quality and well constructed, though, and if you're going for relatively small and portable these fit the bill.",

It's this sticky matte plastic that attracts all different kinds of fiber. I have no idea why they chose such s*** material on the outside of the headphone. It's like they tried to get a soft matte plastic material but instead got plastic lint roller material. That is seriously what this is like.",

I've had a little trouble with the mic picking up too much train noise and bothering the person on the other end of the line. This might not be due to a flaw with this headphones though. I'm not sure any mic/headset could do better on trains. Would definitely recommend these!",

I am very particular about sound quality and this set of cans delivers the perfect balance of treble and bass in my opinion. The response is great too and they are noise cancelling as well. I highly recommend them especially at this amazing price. Trust me they can compare with Beats Solo as well. I think these sound even better than Beats! Get them!!!",

I love the color options this company makes! They are unique and very vibrant. I used to own the jade green pair and loved it then too (lost it shortly after purchase). My only issue is that I can't wear these headphones for more than an hour or hour and a half at a time because it tends to pinch your ears.",

I find the extra port for sharing music convienient. They are comfortable and they fold up nicely. The cord doesn't tangle. The only minor problem is that I think the bass frequencies are a tad lacking. You may need to look elsewhere if your looking for killer bass, these just don't handle dubstep and rap as insanely as I'd perfer. Hope this helps, overall you won't be dissatisfied though. I wasn't and it's been about two months since I purchased them.",

The sound is great and it tunes me out of any noise around me",

The only reason I was comfortable buying this brand is because I own a pair (bought from apple store a few years back) and I love it.",

The built in mic is good enough quality for phone calls; and works for in-a-pinch podcast recording. Also, the way they fold up nice and tiny means they fit perfect in my carry-around bag. Woohoo! Sadly, the way these fit my ears is a little awkward, and wearing them for more than a couple hours in a coffee shop eventually makes me need to take them off.",
