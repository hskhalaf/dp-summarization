      "text": "Terrible product; will not buy Sony Blu Ray player again. My player gets moderate use; maybe 3-4 movies per week. I started getting a pink \"flash\" when the movies were playing after about six months. Tried cleaning to no avail. The worst problem was the WiFi connectivity. Things worked fine for a year or so with amazon prime, you tube, etc; and now all of a sudden it won't connect to the home network. Every other 7-8 peripherals including another Blu ray player works great; but not this piece of ****. I've spent countless hours reading posts, etc to fix it and now I'm done. Will go with Panasonic or Samsung in the future.",

Now it gives perpetual network errors (even though I've been using it with an ethernet cable directly connected to my router since the wireless card broke). The other one works mechanically, but because Sony does not support their products (why should they when they can force you to spend money on the newest model?) the YouTube and web browser apps no longer work, and the Netflix app has lost functionality since Netflix updated its api and Sony won't fix it's app. I'd recommend buying something else.",

The disk player work great, no problems. It's just the app. I won't speculate if it's a matter of someone feeling the customers are getting a good deal but that new replacement app that showed up with a \"software update\" sucks.

The thumbnails are there to see which video you are accessing, but when you go to play it only the audio works. I have unplugged the unit and this does not fix it.

I couldn't care less if it's as smart as Einstein, as elegant as Victoria Beckham, and as fast as Usain Bolt. Does it play my Blu-Rays? Yes it does!! Does it play my DVD's? Yes!! Plays all-region DVD's, at least the ones I've tried (1 & 2), and as far as I know only region 1 and region free Blu-Ray's.",

I wouldn't purchase another Sony blu-ray if having internet connectivity is important to you.",

Netflix plays really well from this player. Earlier I was playing Netflix from either the Wii console or the laptop. From the Wii console it was really difficult to get subtitles for the movies. Connecting the laptop was an additional setup. This made it convenient and comes with a great Netflix app that provides subtitles for everything. So overall, great product from Sony.",

Which I will get it fixed with the Xbox One console as soon as it hits the streets! For playing blu-rays only, really nothing special - I would've given 3 or 2 stars anyway.

The loading times are certainly shorter than the Blueray player this one replaced and the 3D worked as well. I don't care much for the 3D feature, but the kids like it. I appreciate the much faster loading. The player also has \"smart tv\" features that we will not use (our tv is already smart). But these features may be attractive as well to those who don't already have them. I can't say this is the fastest loading Blueray player, only that it loads much faster than the one we were using before. The price is okay too.",

      "text": "Like others in the one star category - after functioning well for less than 18 months - this thing's best purpose is now a door stop. Slow to load but nice quality while it worked. 18 months is not an acceptable product life IMHO. Now audio and video drop out nearly continuously and we have to go buy another. After reading others dead-ends in trying to get a fix I'll cut my losses and buy something else. Why can't companies make products that hold up? Guess we keep buying them. Very frustrating.",

I was very happy, and although I did not have any blu-rays prior to this, i have already started adding to my collection. set-up was easy, and have had no problems with it since it was purchased.",

The DVD/Blu-Ray works great and is a lot faster than our recently departed blu-ray player. The picture is perfect. Summary: We really love this player. It works like it is supposed to work.

The remote design is a weakness (most players' remotes are) and it would have been vastly improved with backlighting, but, for the price, I'm not going to ding the rating on that basis.",

      "title": "WiFi \"Network error\" occurs often, despite network status \"OK\"",
      "text": "I frequently watch Netflix and Amazon Streaming Video. I didn't have any trouble setting up the Sony and was able to watch Netflix/Amazon without any trouble...for a few weeks. After that, I started getting a Network Error when I tried to connect. It asks if I want to check the connection and the connection says \"OK\" for internet access and network connection, yet I cannot connect. I've tried resetting the network settings. It seems to happen about 1 out of 3 times I try to use it. So frustrating and I already passed my Roku player on.",
