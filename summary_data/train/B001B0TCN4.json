I brought it to an authorized service center who said the carburetor (in fact, all the parts that can possibly break) was not covered (I think they cover the strap unraveling and that's it.) It would cost me between $75 and $125 to clean and diagnose the problem (not necessarily fix it.) Half a container of this stuff ... and it started on the first try!!!",

Will remember to use throughout the season next time and will also run the blower out of gas at the end of the season and start with FRESH gas next year. Learned that gas breaks down quickly now and I don't start the blower very often. Highly recommend.",

I went to several area auto parts stores but all everyone had was a spray for the carburator, which requires taking a few pieces off which I did not want to do. So I tried some alternatives that you pour into the gas tank, but they did nothing. So I ordered this product and my snowblower is running again. In fact, I'm letting it run until all the old gas is used up. But this product really did the trick.",

      "text": "After being in storage for several months, my power washer would not start. I then checked to make sure that fuel was reaching the carburator and that the spark plug was working. I tried to start it several more times. No luck. After pouring Start Your Engines into the tank, I pulled the starter four more times and it started, ran a little rough for a while but then smoothed out and ran perfectly. This is a great product that does exactly what it is advertised to do.",

      "text": "I have used this in all my outdoor power equipment ranging from lawnmowers to generators to tillers and pressure washers. The product works great and does as advertised. Doing some research on the internet, the way this product works is that it adds back lighter components of gasoline that evaporate and lowers the flash point of the gasoline by 20-30 degrees so that it makes the gasoline extremely combustible.",

I can't say the same for the mower, though it has sat for years without use and likely I need clean that carb out too. Gas will gel up like oil over time, so don't expect miracles, else ensure one runs any machine dry at the end of each season!",
