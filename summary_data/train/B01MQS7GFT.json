The pictures that people have posted on here aren't totally realistic, I didn't see that crazy change over 2 weeks or whatever, but I did notice that my lashes grew. While there wasn't a \"wow!\" change, I had a small section on my lash line that was totally lash-less, and I completely saw new lashes starting to grow there. Last thing: just know that you have to apply it daily. Lashes fall out, you can't apply it once and expect the results to stick.",
