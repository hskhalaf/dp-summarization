Strong enough to stay straight when you're pounding them and they hit an underground rock. 3. The shape secures the stake is stable in a wide variety of terrains. 4. The paracord loops are strong and reliable. Cons: 1. The tip of the stakes do blunt a little when they hit underground rocks. 2. The notches on the top of the stake are straight, not hooked - so guylines are slightly less secure. Overall: These stakes live up to MSR's strong reputation. Extremely light for backpackers, and very effective in all terrains. However, MSR should have hooked (not straight) notches at the top.",

If you are on rock hard ground/very rocky terrain then you simply need to take the extra step of using your trowel to churn the dirt up where you want to put your stake in and remove any rocks. If you are on snow or sand you can use the eyelets on the stake to run some paracord through and anchor the stakes to a log/branch/decent sized rock which you then bury under the snow/sand. Follow those steps and your tent will be as secure as can be with a very low weight investment.",

When I tried these stakes a couple weekends ago, it was like hammering a stake into butter. Would recommend to anyone who lives in mountainous, rocky terrain.",

I've been a Scoutmaster for 23 years and have gone through dozens of different designs of tent stakes looking for the most perfect one out there: this is it. They can be bought for about $2 ea. If you look around you can find cheaper copies sold in different colors but unless you're buying them by the hundred as I am, it's not worth the search. The three sided design grabs the soil, placed sideways it hold in sand and snow. The anodized aluminum is very lightweight but drives into the hardest ground. ...and the lifetime warranty means you'll never have to pay for a tent stake ever again!",

I learned really quick that if you put some kind of handle through the rope, from like a hammer/axe handle, and give it a couple good tugs, they will come out.

I have used them successfully in both sandy ground and rocky soil. They hold better than typical tent stakes in sand, but can still come loose easier than a larger sand stake or anchor. I have had no problems pounding them in the ground with a rock (since I never bring any sort of mallet or hammer). The rope loop makes them easy to remove with my hands or a stick.",
