Others have commented that they require some break in as the highs can be a little harsh. I agree and expect them to mellow as they get a few hours on them. Likewise, they're not strong on thumping bass as you might expect from a 5 1/4\" woofer but the rear firing port boosts it some. The integrated titanium tweeter and midrange horn are quite good. Overall, these are excellent small speakers and for $180 they're an amazing value.",

These things move a lot of air. I run these with a 15 watt/channel stereo tube amp. They are so efficient I've never been able to turn volume up past 1/2 without shaking walls. Crystal clear sound. Probably the best speaker purchase/value I've ever made in 40 years.",

For the price id say these are just okay. I went with the JBL Arena 130 and it's a night and day difference compared to these without a huge price jump. These aren't bad if you aren't used to hearing premium sound. I didn't get the crash in the high end I was looking for nor the hard kick of the mids. They don't even have a low with the size they are so I won't rate them on that.",
