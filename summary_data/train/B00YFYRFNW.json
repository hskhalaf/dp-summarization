One of them had really bad diarrhea and would wake me up 3-5 times at night to go outside. I thought it wasn\u2019t food related so I fed them home cooked food and they stopped having diarrhea. I switched them back on Blue Buffalo and the diarrhea is back. We saw a lot of similar recent reviews on consumer affairs about dogs getting very sick after eating BB since General Mills has bought it. I\u2019m not buying BB anymore. For the price of it you\u2019d expect to get a good quality product.",

Finn needs to lose 5 pounds, so hopefully this addition will help. We alternate a bowl of BM Duck Dog Kibble with a bowl of adult Nutro Dog Food. Finn enjoys both foods!",
