Most of the other ones I found were the same size as snoopy and to a very detail oriented boy they were not \u201cright\u201d. This one is proportional to his snoopy dog, arrived earlier than expected, and made for a very happy boy. We also learned about Japan, where the toy was shipping from, and constantly talked for weeks about the trip his new friend was making across the world. It was definitely a great buy!",
