The variable width adjustments make it easy to line up with framing studs behind wall. After I installed it I was able to do slow pull-ups on each cross bar individually and then using both to assure it would stay put, I weigh 180lbs. The cross bars stayed put and straight. For the price, using car tires in my case, this was an excellent value and purchase for me.",

I used a stud finder to locate the studs to put the lag bolts into. I predrilled all the holes with a 7/32 drill bit. This is a must do. As some else has mentioned, if you want, you can cut a piece of ply wood (46.5 x 22) to make a folding workbench. This is a good unit for storing tires and a good base for a folding workbench. I recommend purchasing this unit if you are in the market.",

As for those that said it wasn't sturdy, they must be overloading it, or installing it wrong. Was very sturdy and perfect for my Tesla Model 3 winter tires/wheels. I wouldn't choose this model for my F350 36\" A/T tires, but that isn't what I expected. ;o)",

Because of this the mounting at the ends also needed a board to bring them 3/4\" away from the wall in order to match the spacing at the center. Not a big deal. Anyway, I'm very pleased with these.",

Make sure you measure twice and have it spaced enough for your tires cause once it's up, you don't want to drill all over again. It folds when not in use and the finish is nice. Steel is strong and not cheaply made.",

It easily accommodates my 17\" wheels with OD of about 26\".",

Since I was installing this on a cinder block wall, I didn't use the included lag bolts, but I didn't have to worry about finding studs. The way it folds is a little strange to me, but it folds up nearly completely flat against the wall. I've used the Hyloft tire rack in my enclosed trailer and it works just fine, but there were more components that came loose out of the box.
