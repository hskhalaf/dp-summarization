Looks like it can be a hit or miss with the faces . But from other reviews have said seems like it\u2019s sturdy which is a plus ! Good for the theme .

For awhile we were using a wooden stick--granted, we were also blindfolded and missing a few times--but even when we took out a metal bat (it was surviving TOO long) it took a hit with that as well The body is definitely the more durable part, as the head came off with one clean swing (the candy still stayed inside). Overall very happy with my purchase, the pin\u0303ata was very cute and a very funny addition to our picnic party",
