TBC UPDATE I finally had a opportunity to use this. I must say it's a nice little tool. I still don't think it's up to really heavy duty projects but am pleasantly surprised at what the tool is capable of for it's size. So unless you're trying to remove heavy stones or something that is buried on the deep side this tool will do. Would still like it better if it had a little more heft to it",

I like the Knights Of Armur Weeding Mattock because it is of modest size, but does penetrate the clay soil better than a shovel or hoe. Overall, I'm very please with it.",
