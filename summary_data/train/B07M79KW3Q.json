I didn't even have to read full user's manual. I read quick guide and followed it. RFID test strip connects with cholesterol meter very fast (about 1 second?) and it's ready to use. I actually compared the result with recent blood work that I just did this week in hospital lab. Surprisingly, measurement was very accurate. Now, I can check cholesterol whenever I want without visiting the hospital! It's great product and user friendly. Highly recommended.",

I have to give myself a pretty good jab and drop the blood on the strip directly from my finger. Not sure how good the readings are, wont know that until my actual blood work at the end of the month. Sorry i dont recommend this product, not user friendly and cant measure anything but your total cholesterol.",
