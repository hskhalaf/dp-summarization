This \"cheap\" phone out performs s7 on all fronts (battery x10, reception, screen size, etc etc). Now I'm still month to month with Verizon and can leave anytime if my circumstances change.

Pretty amazing. All we did was pull the SIM from the iPhone with the SIM tray key and pop it into the new phone. Call quality is good, and all the stock Android features are there. The screen is passable, not OLED glory like expensive phones but good enough really, made up for by its size. Haven't had any problems with it!",

Which I usually don't because I think current generation batteries prefer not to be too charged or too discharged, and with this phone its easy to do that and still have plenty of battery available.",

Only bad thing for me so far is the vibration is way too weak. Practically useless if in your pocket. There doesn't seem to be a way to increase vibration strength either.",

The camera is very good for a budget phone. the finger card worker is perfect. the speakers sound nice. The microphone is awful and the phone doesn't pick up on headphone microphones. The battery life is easily 3-4 days for moderate use I have never gotten below 15% battery. I only have to charge the phone maybe 20 minutes a day and if I forget to charge it overnight I can survive the whole day only losing maybe 5 - 10% battery.",

Unfortunately, it only has 3 gigs of RAM and single SIM card ability unlike it's international version which has 4 gigs of RAM and dual SIM card ability. Dual SIM card is kind of a big deal to me even though it is not that big of a deal to most people. I was unaware of this when I purchased it and didn't return it but, for the average individual I would recommend it. It really is a beautiful phone and performs well other than that.",
