So, you have to tuck the shirt (Velcro closure) into the pants & just put the belt around them (no belt loops). Material is thin, which is good because it is usually hot in MS on Halloween.",

The little patches are still completely attached. It does run a little big, but that is a huge bonus in my opinion! It was tricky to find a plastic gun to fit in the gun holder, but we found on at the Dollar Store! He loves his radio as well. He did break the whistle rather quickly, but yet again, I am way ok with it!",

It is extremely well made and we all loved that the outfit did not come with a toy gun. He's never missed or even asked about one! He uses the holster to hold his flashlight.

My son is a tall 4 year old and the 3-4 fit him perfectly, he can probably wear it for at least another 6 months. My 5yr old soon to be 6 who as well is tall for his age fit just perfectly in the x-small.",

It isn't a cheap piece of.. It has a lot of belt holes with reinforced brackets (...?) so it looks very put together. My little boy loved this too.

The shirt is velcro down the front (behind the buttons), so easy on and off. The pants are elastic waist, so it fit her just fine. Had to cuff up the bottoms. Agree that the belt is really thin and the buckle will not hold - so I will be using double-sided tape to hold the belt on for Halloween. Otherwise....great costume!",

The badge was worthless, wouldn't stay on at all and we ended up using an old badge I already had.",

It's easy to put on because the shirt has a strip of velcro under the buttons, so the kiddos can quickly put it on & take it off. The pants are cheaply made, and are way too long for the small shirt. My son wears a 5 shirt, and the Small shirt fits him perfectly. If your kiddo is about to outgrow a 6, go to a Medium.",

I would actually buy this again because it was by far the best option I found for the looks of it.",

The belt it comes with is hard for him to get on and off, but we just used one of his regular belts for him to use.
