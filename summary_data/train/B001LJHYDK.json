      "text": "I installed this on a Lowe Sea Nymp 1457. Using a 15lb mushroom anchor. I absolutely love it. Put it on the front and also installed the remote kit. I am well pleased. I've had it out about 4 times now and the convenience is just something. I can sit it the rear and drop the front anchor without moving my lazy rear end. Hopefully it will last. Works exactly as described. Bought another to install on rear to accommodate complete laziness. Don't expect it to reel in faster than what is claims to do. 8/16/18 update: Still working like a charm!",

      "text": "I added this to my 13-foot fishing boat and use a 15-pound river anchor. And I installed a second up-down switch at the helm. Nice to have an electric in place of the hand crank I had before. Works well overall, but would have liked it better if the anchor did a free fall on the way down. It winds down at the same speed that it winds up, so it is taking longer to set the anchor now. But glad to have it and I am using the anchor a lot more now when I fish.",

A thread on a website suggested that my battery was not charged enough or too small. I bought three 35 amp hr, glass matt batteries and a trickle charger. I wired them in series. It should have had enough power to pull a barge, but still no improvement in performance. I'm taking it out and installing a hand crank.",
