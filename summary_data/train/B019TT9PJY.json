It fits two full Nalgene bottles in the side pockets, and to combat the water bottle falling out problem folks talked about, I just clip the bottles into the side clips through the loops on the lids. This backback fits my 13 inch Macbook Pro, a book, and a light jacket with no problem. It's small, but packs more than I expected! Great front pocket with lots of compartments. My husband and I each have one, and we love them!",

Love that it buckles at waistline, giving it a nice balance when hiking on longer trails. Had this for a year and went on many hikes. So far so good, no wear, no tear.

I haven't had it long enough to really comment on its long-term durability, but initial quality is through-the-roof. The only thing I wish is that the side water bottle compartments secured bottles a bit better. I was climbing with this pack on recently and lost a water bottle down the side of a cliff.",

The extra straps keep it secure enough it feels sturdy and just big enough so that i dont have to worry about space management. only thing i will say is the stone grey seems more like a light turquoise then grey but that is just my opinion",

I had to open my pack to get water out my water because the water bottle holder on the outside of the pack was too small to hold a water bottle. I would definitely recommend this pack.",

It's behind the big zipper section of the pack...so you don't have to worry about taking all your other items out of the pack to refill the bladder! I also love that I can attach it to the larger Osprey packs if I decide to level up my hiking in the future.",
