I pulled the Zoom out of it's case today after not using it for about a year and the back of it has gone completely sticky. There's really no easy or safe way to remove this coating, since there are small rubber foot-pegs in the back, as well as the battery compartment. Just use regular plastic for crying out loud. This is so disappointing. I never ever took the factory screen protector off the front screen, and the back of this device is a total mess.",

The only issue I have is the start-up time: it takes literally a minute or two to start up with a 32GB memory card installed. My understanding is that the start-up time is related to memory card size, so it might be much faster with a smaller one. Also, it would be nice if this unit encoded to OGG format instead of / as well as MP3, but its absence is understandable. One caution: be gentle with the power/hold switch.",

I can easily hook it up to my computer, plug in a 10$ SM57 clone to the XLR inputs, and it becomes great for recording big, loud instruments (trumpet, tuba, etc.) The fact that the XLR connectors double as female 1/4 connectors is great too.",

I use it with my phone to record interviews, or use external microphones which are EXCELLENT to pick up ambient sound... THE audio recording QUALITY is EXCEPTIONAL.

There's a fairly steep learning curve, but that's to be expected in a unit with so many functions.

One time the studio was booked solid, I had a hot PSA to record, so the station manager put me into an eventual studio (now a catch all) with this little gem. I was amazed at the sound quality, immediately bought one on line, and now do most all of my volunteer work from the comfort of my own home.",

The compressor for voice level fluctuation helps avoid distortion in situations where levels change quickly. This is an excellent recorder to complement video recording or use for podcasting. Move the files to your computer via the SD card and a USB SD card reader. Be aware that using phantom power for mics when operating on the AA batteries will limit their runtime. If you can run on the AC adapter when using phantom power over xlr, that is best.",

Apparently there are issues with AMD processors on laptops with the newer H4n. Also, registering and unlocking CUbaseLE which comes with the recorder was as royal pain. I did get it unlocked though on it works great on my computer. If you're a musician you can't go wrong with this recorder and the included sound processing software that comes with it. I use this every week. I think the newer H4n on auto rec level records better then the older H4, although both of them are great.",

I've also purchased a Zoom H1 which is a much smaller, highly portable, inexpensive recorder. At ninety nine dollars, it is also a sweet unit when small size and being inconspicuous is important.",
