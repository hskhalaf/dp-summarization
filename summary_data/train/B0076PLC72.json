However I do like the look of them anyway! The color is a light green with aqua stripes in between the bumps. There is a sort of cracked glass look to the ceramic too FYI. Not exactly what I expected but I love them anyway! Packaging was good - no issues there!",

The lamp shades were to large for my vanity, but I put my other vanity lamp shades on them and they are perfect. I am very happy with these lamps and love looking at them every time I walk into my bedroom.",
