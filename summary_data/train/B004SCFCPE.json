We have the fan speed on medium, and you can feel the air blowing from any spot in the room. I read several reviews that the lights weren't bright enough, but we have no such complaint. It's plenty bright for their room-which is 10'5\" x 12'10\".",

The shaft sits in a mount sort of like a ball joint with no securing screws. Hold on to the other string while changing speed or light.

Super easy install and it only weight 11 lbs, I think. Hooked this baby up and it really does move some air. The light is nice and bright, but not too bright. I would recommend getting an LED bulb in this because the bulb sent does put out some heat. I love it and the color is unique.",
