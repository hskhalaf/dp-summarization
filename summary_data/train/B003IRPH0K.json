Of course it had significant damage in two places at the edge but it's too big and heavy to return. I just turned the damaged edge towards tophe wall. The dark color gets really \"oily\" and smudges easily like a cellphone glass. That is kind of weird. Functionally, just what I needed. About $70 less than any other vendor. But, do expect so,e damage.",

On further inspection the legs on one side were coming apart from the top and there was a crack in one of the modesty panels. On the positive, it seems very sturdy. I would note that if you are going to move this frequently it is quite heavy. I wish it had worked out.",
