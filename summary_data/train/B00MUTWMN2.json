The reason for the one star is that the speaker in the left ear stopped working after a month and a half, a couple of weeks outside the 30-day warranty. Part of this is on me as had I bothered to check the warranty I doubt I'd have purchased this headset. 30 days just doesn't cut it. And part of it, of course, is on Logitech for poor quality control.",

I store the headset in a safe place that would not expose it to anything unusual that would make it peel. I probably would buy a different product simply because the peeling has exposed the foam and the foam is now deteriorating.",

The volume keys will change your Windows sound volume when the headset is plugged in so those will work regardless of the platform.",

I believe it's a combination of very directional microphone and that this headset is audio-balanced for voice over music and sounds. If you are looking for and audio headset, you shouldn't even be reading this review. This is a headset designed for VOIP conversation and excels in that focused application.",

I need to go to the headset Earphone Properties' enhancements settings to turn on the loudness equalization for it to sound equally loud across different applications. For games and songs, it works pretty well but need to note that this is not a Hi-Fi set. So lower frequency beat may not be audible. As for Lync, the buttons works perfectly on adjusting the loudness, mute and answering/hanging up the call. Somehow the voice feedback doesn't sound right, it is a bit too loud. Other than that, I feel comfortable to put on this headset.",

I have already found that if I wear these at the very front of my ears then they are much more comfortable than when they are pressing my outer ear against my head if worn further back. Audio quality is quite good for virtually all purposes and mic is particularly crisp and clear. Not a purist's headset, but a very good home office type, especially for the price.",

I would only recommend short time frames in using this product as your ears will tend to feel sore after a while.

Headset was treated well, it either sat on my desk or head and was never yanked, thrown, stepped on, or mistreated in any way. Have had similar experiences with other Logitech headsets, but never so soon, I could usually get a bare minimum of 1 year out of them. I'm tired of having to replace sub-par, defective junk, and will never buy Logitech again.",
