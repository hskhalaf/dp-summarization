The graphical user interface no longer appears and now intermittently the screen goes blank. I have tried everything to fix the issue including resetting the receiver to factory. I have not seen this issue on the internet. I used to buy Sony all the time and gave this one a try. Think I will bypass them in the future, you may want to do the same if you want your purchase to last longer than 5 years.",

If there was a way to re-flash the firmware, that might help, but it isn't possible with Sony. Unfortunately, I am outside of the Square Trade and manufacturer's warranty period. My other gear from Yamaha lasted a whole lot longer (is still usable) compared with Sony's short shelf life in my case. Looks like my next purchase will not be a Sony.",

Now it's a glorified & overpriced audio only receiver, flash back to the 90's.. Thanks to sony, for inferior quality and facilitating the planned obsolescence of electronic devices.",

That said, we are satisfied with how it functions in our home theater. My great frustration with anything electronic is the lack of a good paper operating guide. Sure, it is on line, but FOR ME, that is in inconvient, and often illogically configured. However, in this case, it all went well. I cannot say if this reciever is better or worse than Sony's newer reciever. I suspect that unless the user demands the cutting edge, this will be more than satisfactory.",

This unit is great and the cost of it was pretty much equivalent to the cost of repairing the fried Yammer. I've had quite a few Sony products over the years and I must say, they have always been reliable. This appears to confirm that impression for me. The Networking function makes it very easy to play my music library from the home desktop. I can also play specific genres (eg. Christmas) from a tiny USB jump drive, if I want. Very intuitive on-screen menus.",

Set itself up in minutes with included microphone. I've not messed with the speaker levels since, sounds great. I shift through the modes quickly using the remote control depending on content type. Thought I may need to go Naim Audio to drive my Regas in-particular, they are precise speakers, but this unit drives all the above just fine. Recommended!",

Move that button by the Volume knob. I have experienced none of the problems others have reported both with the new firmware or the older.",

Haven't got a chance to test the surround on movies etc. yet as I'm waiting on a fiber cable and additional HDMI cables. This receiver provides plenty of power to my speakers. I'm usually hoping for more volume but I didn't even have to go above 50% to enjoy the sound.",

However my receiver is located in a cabinet and I need onscreen overlay display on my TV to view the volume level and listening mode (especially with the awkward placement of the sound field button!). If onscreen display is not important to you I highly recommend it, unfortunately it is to me so I will have to replace it with a probably more expensive alternative.",

Some of the features I like the most: 1) I like that I can watch cable with the stereo off (pass-through) 2) I like that I can use my iPhone as a remote 3) Love the bluetooth and AirPlay 4) Sounds great There are many other things, but these are the most notable for my use. My previous receiver was also a Sony (ES Line). It has migrated to my bedroom and I find myself getting frustrated that it doesn't have many of the same features.",

I was able to use the auto config to get the 5.1 setup in 10 min. My unit sits between DirecTV and the 65\u201d monitor (with bad audio), it now has a great audio with everything I watch. So far, I have to use the SONY remote to power up this unit, and use the DirecTV remote to do everything else. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s about selecting the correct code. I\u2019ll get to correcting this one day.",

However what is major is that you also have to change the audio output source. This is annoying and ridiculous. Output is speakers. When you switch inputs, the default audio output should still be the speakers. Set up was easy and seemed to produce good results. The cable for the calibration microphone was about 6 feet too short for my room (18 feet from the equipment to the seating area). It should be fine for most listening/viewing rooms where it is 12 feet or less from the equipment to the seating area.",

Unfortunately, you cannot operate both at the same time with different sources (e.g. cable TV inside and radio station outside). It's one or the other, or both utilizing the same source at the same time. Denon receiver's accommodate this capability but not this Sony. If you don't need that feature, you won't find a better quality, feature rich, easy to use receiver available from any manufacturer.",
