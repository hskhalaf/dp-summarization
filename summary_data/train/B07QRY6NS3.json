I saw some reviews that some were defective and had to be sent back but I decided to take a chance anyway since it's a good looking radio. Well the first one we got was indeed defective. You couldn't turn the volume knob so I followed the steps to return it and two days received another one. The second one works perfectly thank goodness. This is the only reason I didn't give it five stars. They need to QA these radios before they send them out to their customers.",

For some reason, during the first few hours I used it, every song it played was amazing. You know those movies where the old tube radio with the glowing dial only picks up songs from many years ago?",
