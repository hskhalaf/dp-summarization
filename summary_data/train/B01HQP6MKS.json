      "title": "comfortable, stylish walking shoe",
      "text": "Bought these for a recent trip to Europe to walk around in. Super comfy foot bed (it is cushy), and fit perfectly. The back strap over my heel is not super tight so it doesn't dig in or give you blisters. The stretchy X straps keep your foot snuggly in the shoe without being too tight. I was able to dress these up in the evening with a sun dress, and wear them with shorts and a T-shirt, so they're quite versatile. I also liked that they had a rubber bottom with tread so you don't slip/slide if the ground is wet. Great shoe, and seems like it will hold up well and is well made, too.",

      "text": "I'm crazy about all my Born shoes and sandals. The footbed is excellent. This pair lost one star because the cross over strap is of elastic which does tend to stretch and make the fit sloppier as time goes on. I doubt this can be remedied but I will ask my cobbler to try when it is impossible to wear these sandals thanks to fit.",

It sounds a bit like there\u2019s air in the soles. I was nervous about the elastic straps becoming too worn, but so far a summer of near daily wear, even while hiking and getting wet, they seem to be holding up nicely. I don\u2019t expect them to last me more than two summers, but for the price they\u2019re great.",
