I could hear fine although the caller was slightly low but not enough to complain. No complaints from callers about hearing me. I don't remember the range, I don't want to give inaccurate info by guessing. The fit was really good. It's small which is good for my small ears. Decent seal. It hung nicely. I liked except for the battery life... but that's major. It could have been defective but I honestly didn't feel like going through the motions, just returned it while it was in the 30 days",

There's static that comes through the music and then pauses, eventually cutting out. I've noticed that trying to shut down and restart doesn't work. I have to wait hours before they will work again, only to cut out after 30 minutes of use again.",

Hell, even in my pocket they have trouble staying connected. I fully charged them before I used them as well so it's not them running out of battery. Audio lag is just aweful on my Samsung Galaxy S8. I'm talking up to a second of lag. Just all around would not recommend.",

      "text": "I bought these specifically for the multi-point Bluetooth feature as I carry both a personal and work phone daily. This works pretty well as I'm often listening to a podcast on one phone when I get a call on the other. Battery life is usually enough to laate all day with moderate use. I can't really speak to sound quality as I'm a poor judge of it and rarely listen to music",
