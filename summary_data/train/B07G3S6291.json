A raw organic diet is best but since that is a very expensive endeavor, I'm starting with adding broth 2-3 meals per week. My two English Mastiffs are absolutely overjoyed when they smell this!

      "text": "This broth ran out of my local store and now I have to buy it online which is fine. I'm giving this 5 stars because I give to my dog regularly. The amount totally works for me because you don't want the broth to go bad. 1 pack should last you 4-6 feedings depending on how much you like to add to your dog's food. I like this one the best because it helps my dog stay regular on her high protein diet and she's allergic to chicken and beef so Turkey is all she can have. I love that it has ginger and tumeric in the recipe.",

It smells delicious, and has all natural ingredients. Resealable cap. I'm a fan and so is doggo.",
