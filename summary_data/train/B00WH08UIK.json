There also is a reset pin hole but as the device became stuck on something i had on the screen, pressing the small button in the pin-hole did absolutley nothing. i found if i restart my iphone, the device connected to the projector, that cleared the frozen screen. one other disapointing thing, alot of shows wont play on the device becase of licencing issues. example i tried to play the come back show \u201c Murphy Brown\u201d on comcast on demand streaming site, nope. no shows will play. not the projectors issue but disapointing none the less.",

It comes with most of the connectors one may need for various devices, including a tripod that does a great job stablizing the unit. As another customers reported, the battery does not keep a charge if the device goes unused for about a week, but other than that, this projector is a great value for the entertainment it provides. You cannot go wrong with this purchase & I would highly recommend it!",

This changes how I intended to use it, but since I got it at about a 50% discount from regular price I can live with it. Also, the internal speakers were louder and sounded better than I expected.
