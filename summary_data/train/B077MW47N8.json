Bluetooth hasn't disconnected yet, always automatically connects within 10 seconds of starting my truck. Touchscreen works as well as a modern phone display is bright and clear, lots of options, extremely fast software with no lag, choose any color you want for the buttons. Had a tough time choosing a stereo but really happy I went with this one.",

Easy to read touch-screen, steering wheel controls compatible, back up camera compatible & clean installation & sound. I have the factory interior speakers running with a mono block amplifier with a 12 inch Bazooka passive basstube. Nice clean sound! Highly recommend this stereo!",
