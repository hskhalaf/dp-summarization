Produces plenty of power and doesn\u2019t bog down with high surge loads. Gas shutoff is easy to access. Included instructions were clear on how to convert the generator to a floating neutral (most homes with a transfer switch). Cons: Heavy (but not bad to move with the wheels). Loud (but tolerable compared to other open frame generators in this range) Bottom line- Affordable and powerful this is the best of its class. Consumer reports rates it well and I agree with them.",

It has enough power for a 18,000 watt AC, freezer, fridge, lights, two fans and lasts 9-10 hours on a full gas tank. The remote control is extremely convenient and useful for us aging folks. The noise level is not bad - much better than our 5500 CAT unit. Highly recommended.",

Have contacted them numerous times and every time they are too busy with various excuses. This would require a $2 part and 2 minute installation and yet they do not have time for their customers. Worst Customer Service I have ever encountered and will never purchase anything from them again.",

To see if the problem was operator error I took the gen to a mechanic and paid for a diagnosis. The result was either a bad solenoid or the in the guts of the housing it was attached to. Positively a warranty issue. I would definitely not get a gen from Westinghouse in the future! If I were you I would not get one!",

For a portable generator, Westinghouse is great! You have to get a transfer switch installed by an electrician. Then plug in the portable generator to the outlet and amazing! It is very easy to start thanks to the electric start button. It holds a lot of gasoline and has to be filled up twice per day depending on how much load you put on it.",

Also very loud and only runs at one speed. Does not have auto idle like advertised.",

Also, the fuel tank is relatively small but it lasts ALOT longer than other generators that are the same or LOWER wattage which I thought was awesome. There are many things that I would say that makes this the best choice for my needs. The only downside is the noise level of it. If you get this and live in a residential area you will either need to share power your neighbors (lol) or put some type of cover over to reduce the noise level. Great product, thank you!",

I was able to turn almost everything at my house including a fridge, TV, internet, Lights, 4T AC with no issues, and running on propane gas. I think over all is a very good product so far.
