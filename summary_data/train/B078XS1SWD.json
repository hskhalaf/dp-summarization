Previously bought 90 degree brand leggings (which are also wonderful); however these seem a little thicker (less chance of seeing-through when bending over) and chance of wearing out with multiple washes seems less as well... the waist band is GREAT for tucking in the extra flab ;) -- I am 5'4\" and about 200lbs, the Large fits perfect... (my body build is more like 175lbs)... the length is a bit long, but by no means a deal breaker... love the ancles (as well as te calf part on the Capri style); they are not too tight, perfect!!! 5-stars, and I paid full price, no compensation for my review!",

I typically wear a size medium. The mesh size large fit pretty snug. I\u2019m glad I went with the large versus the medium on these. The large size in the plain black color fit drastically differently. They are comfortable in the legs, but they are a little bit loose in the waist. Overall, these are nice yoga pants so far. They are thick and soft, and seem to be of good quality.",

Pants are not see through, easy to move in, very comfortable. I went back to order another pair but they were sold out of my size (would still get medium again). Will definitely buy again.
