      "text": "I bought this meter to measure the load on several circuits as well as sub panels. Unfortunately, if you have a circuit over 20 amps, it goes into overload.... It will not measure a load above 20 amps or less than 200 amps.... That is a BIG void in my opinion. The description does not clearly state this. The specs state \"AC current: 2/20/200/400A \". Maybe a more accurate description would be \"2-20 amps OR 200-400 amps\".",

Works good on DC voltage measurements, does not require switching from 2 to 20 to 200 to 2000 volts like some meters. In other words if it is .246 volts or 24.6 you get the read out fast and accurate. The peak measurement is something not found on cheap meters. Its not too big or too heavy to use for my bench top or field measurements. I like the AA battery choice for long life, the 9V batteries don't last long in most meters. It is accurate on resistance measurements.",

The clamp fits within the splitter's loops and is strong enough to be held their on its own force. Watts = Voltage x Current, so if the ammeter is reading 0.8 amps on a standard US socket, multiply by 120 (can vary from 110v to 120) to get 96 Watts. You can then estimate how much it costs to run by multiplying by your power rate (probably around $0.15 per Kwh) by how long it is running and dividing by 1000. (120 x Meter reading x hours running x Electric Rate)/1000 = Cost to run (roughly).",

But when an actual reading is sought using probes, the LED readout settles and returns valid values. It would be handy if it included alligator clip attachments.
