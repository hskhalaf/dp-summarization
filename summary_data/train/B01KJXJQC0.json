Always missing channels and yes the receivers are set for all our channels. We replaced the coaxial cables (rg6) a few times thinking maybe we had bad cables. If the main receiver isn't turned on we get no power to the second receiver . We are not happy with this product at all.",

We have spent countless hours on the phone with dish network to figure out the problem only to learn, now that our return window has closed, that there is an issue with the satellite's second port. I would not recommend this product to a friend. Rather, i would recommend purchasing 2 single connect playmakers.",

You are better off getting a standard DISH Tailgater for each tv or settle for ONE tv/receiver. I plan to either sell this one, or just get a portable dish and tripod for the second tv.
