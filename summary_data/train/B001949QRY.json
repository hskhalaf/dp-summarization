It looked so bad I was ready to donate it. But I kept it because it was special to my deceased Mother. I expected a long tedious chore to clean it. Was I wrong!! I was shocked it was so quick and easy.....one bad thing...the lid came off in shipping. It was packed with electronic gifts I had ordered so I was not happy. I would order again but order by itself.",

I had about 8 pieces (from larger platters to bowls to butter holders, all with intricate nooks and crannies) which with normal polishing would have probably taken 5 hours or more and not have been perfect. With this product, it took less than 20 minutes and they are perfect sparkling silver and in all nooks and crannies. I will NEVER buy anything else again!!",

      "RESTORES SILVER PIECES - By fighting off tarnish and other forms of deterioration, the silver foam polisher washes off layers of oxidation. This means that the silver's natural gleam and shine is restored, making it look as good as new. It also preserves pieces' natural luster and maintains their classic beauty.",
      "PROTECTS AS IT CLEANS - The polish cleanser not only clears off tarnish, it also leaves a protective safeguard on silver items' surfaces. It defends articles in the long run through a tarnish-resistant barrier, which prevents degradation of your fixtures for long periods of time.",
      "FAST AND SIMPLE APPLICATION - A sponge applicator comes with the silver polish container. For optimal effect, dampen the applicator with warm water. Then, work the polish into a rich, creamy lather and apply it on silver. Rinse the piece or fixture under running water and dry it off with a soft towel.",
      "SAFE TO USE - Made in the USA and Kosher certified. With a formula that is tough on dirt and tarnish but gentle on silver, it can safely be used on fine silver antiques, silverware and more."
