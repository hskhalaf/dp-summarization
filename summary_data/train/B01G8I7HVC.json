Lots of power for a 22' x 22' garage that is open all the way up to the ceiling (lot's of cubic footage to clear). Well worth the price, and just the right size for the wall of my garage. Not too big, not too small. I installed an intake vent at the opposite end to bring in makeup air.",

You must be careful when tightening the mounting screws because if you get them to tight, the louvers won't operate. I use this almost every day and so far, so good. I'll update this review should I find a problen in the future.",

The integrated louvers were the main reason I chose this fan, and were my main disappointment with it. They moved freely with multiple test fits, but after I finally mounted the frame into the wall studs with lag bolts, they now require manual assistance to move. This tells me there is very little tolerance to allow for slight misalignment in the mounting surface. I've never met a wall that was perfectly square, so in my opinion, this is a major design flaw. Luckily, I had already planned to install an external vent cover with a built-in damper, so the louvers are secondary for me.",
