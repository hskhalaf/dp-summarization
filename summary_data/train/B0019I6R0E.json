You can even compost the wet ones if you're into composting. And you no longer have to live with the guilt of A)putting a toxic filled plastic disposable on your child and B)filling up our landfills with human waste filled disposables that take 100's of years to decompose!

I do double up on the inserts for over night. Also, I use the gDiaper inserts with both the gDiaper shells and the Grovia shells.",

If the g diaoers had worked for us then I would certainly keep using these for daycare and trips out the house. I think I can use these as inserts for our other cloth diapers when baby is bigger (they are very long and have to be folded to fit a medium baby).",

They are a little more expensive than pampers, but with Amazon's regular purchase feature, are a lot cheaper than retail. Our only beef with them is that the starter kit only has two cloth shells - three would be perfect. In their documentation, they recommend just switching them out, but if your baby gets a loose stool or is sick, you've got to wash one out in between - several times we found ourselves putting him in a damp, recently cleaned diaper cover. We rarely flush them, but the fact that you can is very comforting.",

We've seen firsthand how they disintegrate, and it makes us feel better knowing that what could be a huge impact per child on the environment is definitely mitigated by using gDiapers. We have occasional leaks (particularly at night, when I sometimes switch to conventional diapers), and it is extra work to wash and stuff the liners each time, but we feel good about what it does for the planet.
