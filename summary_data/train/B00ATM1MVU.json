I'm an artist first, and I like having the preset functions at my fingertips. But I'm also a photographer, and like the option to set up my shots manually. The camera is a little bigger than I thought it would be, but I've used it now for almost four years and I still love it. It's great for nature photography and also for portraits. And both the macro and zoom features are fantastic. I would absolutely buy it again.",

He had never used the camera before and was able to take great shots of the red moon. I use the camera mainly for videoing my son's wrestling matches. The camera takes excellent videos at 60 fps, which makes it easy to view in slow motion for review with his coach. I can video his matches from the stands because of the tremendous 50X optical zoom capability of the camera.",

This is one had met all of those requirements and prayerfully this one will be my go-to camera for many years. I been using a Fuji S700 for almost 7 years but the quality of the photos were not what I wanted. The price is reasonable and it is a great camera for those of us who like to take photos but are not professionals.",

It seems to handle motion pretty well and is easy enough to set up. I found some of the selection buttons on the camera body to be a bit fiddly, requiring multiple presses to select or accidentally pressing one because there are several, very close to each other but I blame that on fat fingers as much as the camera itself. Do go through the menu and check the default settings. We picked up a very large memory card as part of a package deal so I set the image quality / resolution to the maximum.",

This allows you to zoom in on the picture taken and then take a second picture. Your first picture will remain as is. A wonderful feature especially if you want to get closer views from your original picture. Needless to say the zoom on the camera is exceptional. The camera feels comfortable to hold and the weight of the camera is not an issue. Wonderful camera. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "It's a great camera, with nice pictures for an amateur photographer like me. I put it in SR Auto and let it do all the work for me. The zoom is incredible! I just have a little issue with it and I don't know if it's normal or mine has a problem, but when I take the first picture using flash, the second one takes very long to finish (the screen goes blank and after like 10 seconds it shoots). Battery life can last you about 200 pictures (depending on flash use). Bought and 64GB MicroSDXC from SanDisk and it works great using an adapter. That way, I can see the pics taken in my smartphone or tablet.",

It was written as if you completely understand photography and I am only a novice... The few pictures I have taken were excellent and I think this will be a slow learning process because of the instructions.... I love the camera and wish I could learn how to use it quickly.",

We love it and use it all the time, Just got back from vacation out west and took over 2000 pictures. I do recommend that you purchase a extra battery and the car charger like i did, that why you never run out of life on the batteries.",
