They have a surprising amount of detail, the package contains all the bones, and they are well made and heavy-duty so they won't break with the fumbling and manhandling of 300 inexperienced students per year. We use real bones for our advanced courses, but these are great for courses where students need to learn basic bones and bone features. Best of all they are affordable!! The administration was delighted to approve $500 for skeletons since they had just paid 40K to outfit another bioanth lab with casts from a more scientific source.",

She said the skull opens so you can put a brain in there or use it as a candy dish. There is also a diagram with labels. My daughter calls it a road map, which is full color and able to be framed. She just loves this diarticulated skeleton. Definitely a must have for those into A & P.",

Why? Because our professor will lay out random bones and we have to identify them/label them on a diagram and explain all details/areas of the bones. This skeleton is VERY USEFUL to test myself. I'm VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND PRICE! Some of the bones, like the big leg bones, are a bit difficult to figure out due to the lack of detail and they way they were cut. However, overall, for this cheap price, THIS IS A MUST for anyone going into nursing/PA/MD/etc.",

As some have mentioned there are mold lines in some bones, but they are obviously not a bone feature, and I suppose you could sand them off. The bones are stiffer than some, which we like due to less un-natural bending of the longer bones. We also like the magetic skull closures which are better than the hook/eyelet versions. Excellent price. Comes with plastic vertebral discs. We don't use them, but could be good if you want to string the vertebrae together showing a more natural view of the spine.",
