I try to eat it with bananas or other food if possible. It's not as bitter as Chinese medicine, that's for sure! For some reason I bought some other type of hemp seeds and they had most of their vitamins stripped from them, so this is the best deal I've been able to found so far. Beats all other competitors.",

Yes- the zipper seal bag was not of the highest quality but the product within is what really matters. We repackaged them in three pint mason jars for better shelf life. Will definitely buy again.",

I use to make raw, organic almond milk... pretty pricey. 1 cup of hemp to 4 cups of distilled water, a pinch of sea salt, perhaps a little liquid stevia, liquid vitamin d3. Add a little organic, non- alcohol almond or vanilla.... yummmm. Makes a full jug of nut milk. No need to strain. For smoothies... use a 1/4 cup. No need to add milks or nut butters. For raw, creamy soups... 1/4 hemp, tbl. spoon miso, olive oil, smoked paprika, nutritional yeast, some plant... fresh ground pepper. Hot water. Blend. Very convenient. Great for my morning coffee!",

This brand of hulled hemp is particularly fresh tasting with no odd aftertaste that I've had with other seeds. I sprinkle/scoop on smoothies, atop salads, yogurt, stirfrys, ect. adding a nutty and healthful kick to everything!",

Previously I have tried Esutras Organics Hemp seed but they keep changing their price all the time. So I wanted to try this Just Hemp Foods and their quality is superb. I am glad that I tried Just Hemp Foods.",
