We ordered a \"Tire Swing\" and expected it to be that, but it was a plastic tire that was much smaller and less sturdy than we expected. Because this company charged a Restocking Fee, we had to pay the return shipping plus Restocking Fee. We ended up losing about $45.00. I now realize that some suppliers have different rules than Amazon.",

I wanted this type because it is fully enclosed so water won't stand in it like a real tire. It does come with the chains seen in the photo, but we bought a clip to hold the chains together at the top and hooked it to another chain which we put around the tree branch.",

You do have to buy the proper nylon rope, one connection ring and find a good tree limb. Rain cannot get inside this tire swing. The color does not come off. It is smaller than advertised....but two children can swing comfortably.",
