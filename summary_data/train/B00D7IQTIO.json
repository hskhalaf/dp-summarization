There headphones sound great but the build quality is sub par to a pair of $10 headphones you'd find at big-lots. Seriously Sylvania Bluetooth heads are built more durable than these. Don't waste your money. Junk. These will end up broke without and doubt. Scosche did offer to cover them under warranty but I had already thrown them away. Sorry but warrantying junk is just a waste of time. I switched over to a pair of HESH 3 Skullcandy's but I can't recommend them yet.",

However, if you are not someone who listens to a lof of hip-hop or other genres which include a lot of bass, then these headphones are better then Beats. I use them when I am watching movies or listening to music with a lot of vocals and they are terrific. I also really like the fact that it has a mic so that I can take calls with them. At the price of $200, I would say they are the better choice.",

This is my second pair of headphones from this manufacturer to do this. SCOSCHE products are cheaply and poorly made. They suck. Avoid this product no matter who is selling it.",
