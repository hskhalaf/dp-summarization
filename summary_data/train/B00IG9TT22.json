      "text": "Great looking sweater. I receive many compliments on it. there are a few downsides (hence the 4 stars): #1 This sweater snags easily. You really do need to keep an eye out on surfaces. When this thing rubs against something rough, you will pull threads. This results in little tuffs across the surface. #2 Long sleeves suck with this. The fabric on the inside of the sleeves makes it difficult to get a long sleave shirt in it. You have to do quite a bit of adjustment afterward. #3 Not for windy days. While this is a pretty warm sweater, a chilly wind will cut right through it.",

You start lookin for bad guys... Kidding. pros: butt kickin good looking coat. Warm as heck. Just love this design and the green rocks. HEAVY for a jacket. cons: can get picked/pilled by things, but not bad. Wind can penetrate this pretty easy... so need another outer shell for high wind. Not sure about rain, think you'd be soaked, as this is not a tight weave.",

Spyder never goes on sale in retail stores (Dicks, Gandor, Sports Authority etc.) the retail tag shows $169.99 and that is what you would pay in store, but not here on Amazon. The fit is athletic, the quality is superb and Spyder supporting our Veterans. You can't ask for more from Amazon on this one. Oh and this jacket is indeed the very heavy weighted one.",
