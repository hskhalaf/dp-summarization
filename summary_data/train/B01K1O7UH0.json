Outside of velcroing my end table and the bottom of my Alexa, i came upon Wasserstein's Alexa Speaker Stand. I couldnt be happier with my purchase. Its affordable, stylish, and solves the problem of it getting knocked over. I highly recommend this product.",

I have had this on my wishlist since it was introduced to the market. The reason I did not purchase it, was due to the price. The normal price for just a stand to hold the Echo is not worth it. I do admit it is well made and better than all the others I have seen. All the Wasserstein products I have purchased have been great and they are well made. Since it's price has gone down I bought another to place my other speaker when it arrives.",

I won't review again, should there be another purchase. I love the stands. My cats can't knock over the Echos (really big plus) The newest one was for 2nd gen Echo. 2nd gen is shorter and fatter. The Echo is about an inch taller than the stand, all buttons are accessible. It fits like a glove due to Echo gaining a chubbier waist.",
