I'm impressed by how smoothly it scoops up the wet clumps stuck to the litter box without leaving any streaks on the bottom of the box, and how big, wet, nasty clumps easily glide off of the scoop and into my trash can. However, I've had issues with clumps getting stuck in the slits, which can be a pain to clean off.",

I have broken a few because with that kind of litter you sometimes have to use a little force to scrape the clumps from the bottom of the litter pan. With this one I have tried to use a little more care and not break it, but if I do I still have the cup and I'll just replace the scoop.
