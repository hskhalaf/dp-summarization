The Amazon bag functions at least as well, and perhaps a bit better. I like the Amazon bag for multiple reasons: 1. Sufficient capacity for my Dell Latitude with a 15.6\" display screen and a huge number of it's accessories (portfolio binder, pens, business cards, small AC adapter, mouse, external keyboard (mini), Wi-Fi range extender, Ethernet cable, presentation tool, cable lock, ...), a n inch or two stack of documents, umbrella , flashlight, etc. 2. Lightweight 3. Smaller outside than the Samsonite, but seems to have just as much capacity 4. Wheels are very quiet when rolling 5 Quality 6. Price",

Do not buy unless your wheeling around once a week on perfect indoor surfaces (which of course is NOT the point of a business wheeled case)",

You can avoid some of the wrinkle complaints that people have by packing your suits while they still have the dry clean plastic on them. Overall it's great for bringing a couple of average size suits in a carry on size bag. I can also fit some shirts ties and even a pair of shoes in the bag. Can't complain much about it.",

I think if you need a roller bag for long term use, such as back problem, spend more to get a better designed bag. If you want to use for short term (e.g. 3 months), like me, then get it, use it short term, and throw it out.",

The one thing I wish it had would be a key hook in the front pocket. I use the bag to hold my supplies for a class I teach and wish I had somewhere to put the key for our shared closet. We used it last weekend for a cross country airline flight and it held up well. Definitely worth the cost.",

It's definitely a conversation starter as almost everyone will comment on it. I guess it's because it looks like and sounds like I'm at an airport with a suitcase.
