Otherwise she hasn't had a problem with it; no cuts, rashes, leaking out, etc. Additionally, these are thinner than what the hospital used. These are low quality diapers. The hospital had the same brand but I don't remember it being this bad. I would not recommend them. I will finish the pack but will not purchase it again.",
