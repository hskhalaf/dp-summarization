Currently going through the tedious rma process of that drive which was used in a machine extremely infrequently until anything I tried to save on it kept giving me a disk read error. Switched back to wd black which Ive used for years in other desktops to replace that. Id rather stick to the 7200rpm black model and used a ssd for a boot drive than touch another seagate again. I didnt want to believe all the issues people said about seagate but wow they were not kidding.",
