Had to call customer service only once before installation and they were great. So far my doorbell has worked as advertised the tricky part is getting the motion settings correct. My ring2 is 20 ft from the street and it picked up a number of cars passing kthe house early this morning. Cold morning so heat signature from vehicles may have tripped the sensor. Had to customize the motion sensor. I have a strong signal Rssi of -36 so getting good signal .l am please so far.",

When someone is immediately at your door, the app on your phone will take forever to open and by then, the visitor at your door is gone. 2. There are no free plans to view your videos. The lack of a response time nullifies its use, then you can't go back and see who was there. Camera is almost useless.... Funny how Amazon isn't even reaching out to give the canned response \"this is not what you should expect\"....I'll be trying to recoup my investment soon or throw it in the garbage.",

Installation of the Ring doorbell 2 was easy and took about 20 minutes from out of the box to getting it adjusted. I recommend this product.",

As often it feels like the individual customer isn't important to these giant companies, I found that touching. Also, a word of advice.

      "text": "I like the concept. It looks good and was easy to install. That being said, the WiFi is terrible. It\u2019s mounted on the other side of a wood framed wall with bunk siding from my wireless router. Less than 4 feet away (not an exaggeration). It\u2019s plagued with constant buffering and connectivity issues. I purchased a Ring Chime with the WiFi extender... absolutely no improvement and that\u2019s mounted 5 feet from my router and three feet and one exterior wall away from the doorbell. I have wireless devices in my basement on the far opposite end of the house that connect perfectly. This has got to be a design/technology issue. The WiFi is all that holds it back.",

      "text": "This Ring Doorbell easily replaced our standard existing doorbell. You have the option to install wirelessly or wired, but my husband hardwired it to our existing doorbell wires and it works perfectly. We live in a cul-de-sac and the camera view shows the whole cul-de-sac. The motion sensor has about a two second delay, but not much to worry about since able to scroll back to review anything you may have missed seeing. I was torn between this one and the Nest, but I am so glad I chose the Ring. It cost less and has excellent quality. Great purchase!",
