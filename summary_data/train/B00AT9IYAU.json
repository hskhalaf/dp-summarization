Two of my students requested specific colors, I ordered these based on reviews, and let me say sonically they are far superior to any other ukulele in this price range. and they are pretty tough.

For $35 it can get damaged in an overhead bin and I won't be too upset. It hangs on the wall with my Kala and my Ohana and it gets played regularly. You can't go wrong with this ukulele",

I was contacted shortly after it arrived by the company, who passed along some advice about letting the nylon strings \"season\" a bit so that they hold their tune more consistently, and I really appreciate that gesture! It shows that they want their product to succeed. I'm quite happy with this uke and I look forward to strumming some songs soon!",

I\u2019ve played it almost every day for the past 3 weeks and it needs tuning every time I pick it up (even after playing for about 5 min it needs to be retuned). I know the strings need a warm up period to get stretched, but tuning every day for 3 weeks....they should be stretched by now. Maybe it\u2019s the one I got, but just be aware that it needs to be tuned a lot; even in the middle of playing a song.",

They both have children's sized guitars, but these ukuleles are a much better fit and I feel like I am in Hawaii all the time!

It doesn't feel cheap either, everything looks very well put together. Sounds good when tuned up. Seller is very attentive, 5 star definitely deserved. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The strings went out of tune in the begining not as much as I thought. My kid plays it every day. It was perfect.",

I see people giving 1 star reviews for a product just because they don't know it's typical nature. That's so unfair to the Business owners. I didn't give 5 star because of a MINOR imperfection on the finish that was touched up with clear (instead of color then topped with clear) so the wood shows through. In an inconspicuous spot I didn't notice right away.",

My 7 yo son saved for half and I paid for the other half which he worked hard for and he has not been disappointed at all! It will either spark his interest enough to progress with it or not. Its definitely a good halfway purchase if you have someone who may or may not use it!",
