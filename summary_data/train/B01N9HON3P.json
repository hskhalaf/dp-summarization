      "text": "When i originally ordered these socks back in March of 2017 i liked them, but after wearing them for several months i have changed my opinion. There is a problem especially if you wear socks over them. The bottom edge is not hemmed so when you put on socks over them the edge curls up and rolls back on you foot. This is uncomfortable and creates pressure on the lower foot when you walk or run. Otherwise these socks feel good on the arch and ankle and provide mild support.",

Got these compression sleeves for the ankle area and they did the trick. Ran the race, did not do more damage, and back on track. I mat have had some achilles tendonitis, but not sure. These work, and I would purchase them again without hesitation.",

      "text": "Bought these to wear everyday for my plantar fasciitis. They have big a huge help with the pain while walking. I use these everyday. I put them on in the morning and then take them off at night. They have held up very well. Washing them has had no effect on them. I throw them in the wash and they come out like new. The compression they provide makes my feet feel great. Combined with nightly icing and a stretching program my feet are feeling so much better. I am not limited in my activities.",

I am giving them a 4 since I am sure if I had \"small legs\" they would be wonderful but want people to know that sizing is based on having skinny/thin legs like the ones in the picture.",
