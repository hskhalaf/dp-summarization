The trick is to line the zipper pulls up as close as possible to each other then use this lock. It helps to have a bit of cable length since they don't all line up in the same area. The weight is negligible, and the item price is more reasonable than the other shopping site that starts with e and ends with Bay. Any deterrent is to your advantage when foiling criminals.",

They worked for locking things in lockers at hostels as well as locking some zippered pockets on our backpacking bags. The price was perfect, saw the same lock in the airport and one was the same price as this double pack. Easy to set your code. I think these locks will last quite a while! Great buy.",

For ex: if your code is 343 and the lock is set to 343, the combination can be changed whether the lock is open or closed. If the code is 343, and the lock is set to, say, 459, you can't change the code to a new one while the lock is closed.",

Setting them was easy with the directions, they are fairly secure (though obviously not going to withstand, say, bolt cutters. As I basically never let the thing out of sight, anyway, and it's an extra precaution - these were a great deal and serve their purpose well. Slide right through even the overly small holes in my zipper that were designed for I'd guess much older, youth-diary-style locks.",

I'm still going to use them with other cases I have that need good locks so they won't go to waste! Again, good sturdy lock(s), worth buying for the right application.",
