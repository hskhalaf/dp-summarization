I will have to find another plug.",

I was also pleased that the block table top works with the blocks that came with it, the set of Mega Bloks he already has and the legos he'll eventually be big enough to use. The blocks that came with it are probably fine for an older kid, but our 18-month old finds it harder to pull them apart than the Mega Bloks he's used to.",

Especially if they are eating at the table. Okay for play with 2 but not for eating. Lack of surface space.",

I have not tried to the water option. Also the flat top can be used for puzzles. I would purchase again.",

And it's super easy to just flip the table top over for the regular table side. I would highly recommend this product!",

Only thing is since it\u2019s light if my son leans too much it will slide, but I just put it in a corner or against other furniture.
