I struggled to fit my Manduka mat in the bag. You have to roll the mat tightly to fit it in and no way you can accommodate a block after you put the mat in. However, people who have normal mats like Gaiam will find it easy to accommodate a mat and 2 blocks (may be even a towel). I would have given it a 5 star had they made it 2 inches longer",

Have yet to carry the bag, but noticed at delivery that the zippers were stiff, seemed hesitant, as though they were sticking on something which leads me to believe that it is the construction/installation which may be in question. I need the bag, so I will carry it this week, but have reservations about the zipper life. Hopefully I will find this not to be a problem",
