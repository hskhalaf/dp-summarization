Very light weight so it's on great stairs or when you want to dust off curtains, etc. No, it's not the most powerful, large capacity vacuum ---> it's a great $30 dollar light clean up vacuum though.",

(3,200 sq ft) I was just needing it for this small amount of carpet. Now I use it throughout my entire home. I use it on my tile and hardwood flooring. This is a great vacuum for the money for sure. I love how you can detach the pieces to make it a hand held vacuum cleaner. I love how storage for this vacuum cleaner is so convenient. I put mine in a small closet area where I keep my brooms and mop. BUY THIS!!",

There's no brush underneath it. It's just a light suction vacuum. I may only use this for little dirt pick ups but not my carpet. Guess it's time to buy a better vacuum \ud83d\ude44",
