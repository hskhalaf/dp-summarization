      "text": "The fan is beautiful, and a great value for the price. My only issue is that two legs of the light didn't work with the first one I ordered. Amazon immediately shipped another, and I had the same issue. The electrician wired it correctly, but we both agreed that it was in the unit. He took the internal mechanisms of the fan apart, and realized that it came from the factory wired wrong. When he rewired the internal part of the unit, the fan worked fine. It was a lot of extra work, but I do love it.",
