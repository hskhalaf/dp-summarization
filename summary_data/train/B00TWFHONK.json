      "title": "NOT A Dell 3120",
      "text": "Upon reading another review dated Jan. 23rd, 2019, I discovered the fact that this is not a Dell 3120 but a Dell 3181. (See Photos Attached) I needed a 2.16 GHz processor and not a 1.6 GHz processor as this is. You can tell by the sloped section in front of the keyboard that this is in fact a slower 3181. Even the box and instructions state 3181. (see photos) I needed a faster speed for streaming movies, which this is not. Other people having difficulties connecting to their WIFI is due to the slower CPU speed. Totally False advertising trying to pass off a 3181 as a 3120. Sent back for a refund. Beware people !!!",

Too bad it tends to be marketed and sold as an educational - institutional market device rather than a general consumer product, because this is very good. It feels very well built, with rubber bumber rails around the edges, probably part of the mil spec it boasts about. This does not feel like a cheap notebook. Screen is bright and sharp, matt screen, respectable for a budget 1366x768 screen. Great battery life. Very nice keyboard feel to it. Performance is good, even for a Celeron processor.",

I reset the computer myself and that fixed the problem for about three uses and then it started glitching again. Very disappointed I could not get a replacement!",

However rating lower as the laptop itself is beat up. Deep scratches by the keyboard, and screen is scratched up. It works for our purpose, but if you're needing something a bit more professional, probably not your best option.",

The keyboard and trackpad also work great although I typically use an external keyboard.
