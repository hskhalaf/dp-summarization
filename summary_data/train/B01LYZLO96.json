Amazon replaced the set and the second box came without any problem. The first box seemed as if someone decided to mail every broken glass they had because it made no sense. Glad the second box was fine, but made me feel I should go back to a store where I can see the merch physically before I purchase.",

Albeit it's a bit early, a year later I should update this review. However, 12 nice looking glasses for about $50 was quite a deal. It's difficult to find drinking glasses under 14 ounces that are actually drinking glasses. Confusing statement but true. Most are huge, 16 ounces or more. Slender profile, great drinkability, clean and clear glasses with thicker glass to \"weight\" the bottom. IMO these are 5 star for sure!",

These are not paper thin at the top like so many I've tried in the past. It is one thickness, not fluted, all the way up. If I had to say one nit-picky thing, they're a bit smaller than what I had. My fault for not checking. But- again, I'm very pleased with this set of glasswear. (P/S- wash up nicely on top rack of dishwasher.)",
