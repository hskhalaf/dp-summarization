The reason why I gave it only 3 stars is within a few months, the bridge snapped off. It happened while it was in the padded case, so no one was hurt, but those things are difficult to glue back on. Because of the bridge coming unglued, this AMAZING ukulele only got 3 stars. I have not contacted the seller to return it, as it happened a few months after I bought it. I have since glued it, but I'm super scared to play it in case it snaps off again.",

I do touch up the tuning every time I pick it up, but it requires less each time. Being larger, it is easier for me to play.

I do love the strap - it was the first time I used one and it felt great, very comfy when I played. If you already have a uke that you have spent at least $100 on, do not buy this one unless you want to give it away to a beginner.",

It took a while to tune the first time because it came with strings on but barely tight. One string popped off during this; it seems like they just have a knot at the end and it slipped off under pressure. I tied a figure eight that won't slip and it's stayed on fine since. I've been learning a few songs but need to find some better sources! It's no fun to play 4 chords repeating since I'm not much of a singer... I would highly recommend this though!",

The ONLY caviat I have is how often I have to retune it. I can get through a five minute riff before the strings begin to go a wee bit flat. Not a big deal though.

At first, one string kept going out of tune, but I think maybe it just took some time with him playing it for it to finally work itself out...maybe it had to stretch or something? He said the chords are much easier to learn than a guitar and he already learned several songs the first day he got it. He's played it quite a bit and is really enjoying it!",

The tuning heads are of very nice quality and use all metal spacers instead of vibrating plastic parts on some of the others such as my Makala Kala tener ukelele has. I like the SNARK tuner better than the one that came with this kit but this one has more features to tune guitar, violin, etc that could be useful for someone.",

Definitely pays to pay a little more than $40. It\u2019s great for a beginner and not too much of an investment if they decide it\u2019s not for them. Also nice enough to provide a great experience for a beginner. Would definitely recommend.",

Great fun and my 17 year old daughter thinks it is cool and has an interest in learning as well. Good purchase.",
