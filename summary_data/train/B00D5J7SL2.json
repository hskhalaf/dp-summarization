It gave me a complete refund and said I could keep the cushion. Now that's five star customer service. As for the cushion, it is well made, firm and attractive. I believe it would be an excellent lumbar support cushion for someone smaller. That is, under 6 feet..",

Of course, you still have to make a conscience effort to sit back. Don't worry about fit. It's adjustable and also comes with straps to extend if necessary. I did not have to use the extended straps, but I was concerned because the chair is wide. It looks nice too. Will recommend to anyone that starts to get lower back pain.",
