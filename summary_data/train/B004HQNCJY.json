My 60 lb bull terrier has been drinking a lot of water lately with the heat increase in our area, and this helps make sure she never runs out and doesnt have to bend her neck to reach the water. My only complaint is that the bowl came with stickers placed on the inside of the bowl leaving a residue that was hard to remove when these stickers could have easily been placed elsewhere.",

It is very stable and does not tip over easily, even when Loki decides to shift it all over the kitchen tile. It is a very nice height but can be reached by low-to-the-ground determined pups. Loki\u2019s brother, Thor, a corgi/Rottweiler (40 lbs) mix can reach it just fine. He checks the bowl everyday after Loki is done eating for \u201cquality control\u201d purposes, of course. Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a taller pup.",
