Most of my pots, pans, and bakeware are Calphalon, so I decided to try their apple slicer. It's a nice unit. Very sturdy, blades are sharpened (not cut-your-finger-off-easily so, but, still, have a care with them), handles are wide and rubber-gripped, overall exactly what I wanted. Highly recommended.",
