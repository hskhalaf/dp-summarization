      "verdict": "Ariat designers seemingly found a way to make the Terrain Pro H2O remarkably comfortable and supportive at the same time. They appear to have also made the boot outstandingly watertight, helping many a wearer brave the inclement weather with great success. With all that said, those who would give the gear a shot should be willing enough to forgive its narrow toe box. All in all, the Terrain Pro H2O, while not ideal for those with bulky toes, has more than enough merits to be considered trail worthy.",

Being a 12 1/2 wide - 13 wide I had to purchase the 14 size boot which is loose in length around the foot. I have to purchase other memory foam inserts to fill the area which makes them heavier. My feet do not hurt at least and so far I am not tripping wearing the large defined heel I need.",

What can I say? Another great pair of Ariats\u2014husband uses these for hiking and horseback riding.",

I walked through some wet spots in the woods where there were puddles and such and while my feet did not get drenched or soaked or anything, my socks were pretty damp around the toes when I took the boots off. So no water got in through the mouth of the boot, but some seems to have gradually soaked down around the toes. It would be nice if they were fully waterproof, but the dampness is something I can put up with because I do like the boots overall.",
