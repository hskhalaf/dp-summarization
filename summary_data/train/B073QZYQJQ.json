I guess this was from walking and brushing the band up against my leg. I'm sure it can be washed off with some leather cleaner, but it's annoying! Plus, after seeing my boyfriend's black MVMT watch, it made me wish I got that color even more. The black against the gold is beautiful! The quality of the watch is great, was packaged very nice, along with papers and a cute box.",
