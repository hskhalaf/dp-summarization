It took about 20 minutes to put together but wasn\u2019t bad. Duplo blocks do fit on it although it\u2019s not duplo brand so you have to push a bit harder than you might usually. I suspect Legos would fit too. My daughter loves it!! She\u2019s 1.5 year old. It\u2019s something she\u2019ll use for many years though so if you\u2019re balking at the price consider how long you\u2019ll use it.",
