      "title": "Great kit",
      "text": "As an acoustic drummer, I was leary about going electronic, but apartment living required it if I was to play. I was pleasantly surprised with this kit. The heads feel like real drum heads, and the ability to tighten them to my liking only made them better. The bass drums is nice and responsive, as are the cymbals. My only gripe, and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars, is the ha-ha pedal. It is not very responsive at all, making you lift your entire foot off of it most times to get the open sound. Overall, this is a great kit and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for an electronic set.",

I bought this TD11 kv kit expecting a newer version would offer more, but the TD 8 has it all over it. The TD11 is nice but it has less instraments and sounds to pick from. I also can't seem to get the bell on my dual trigger ride to ring. I can't find it in any of the menu's, even with talking with a Roland tech. Bottom line is, it is a nice kit but don't expect the world.",

I like to plug the drums into my laptop and record them in Logic Pro X - very simple (once you know where to find the V-Drum mapping) and great for recording/editing. My only gripe is the hi-hat. I would suggest replacing it with the VH-11. Some other upgrade suggestions would be to get a PDX-100 snare and to use the aux input on the TD-11 module for another crash cymbal.",
