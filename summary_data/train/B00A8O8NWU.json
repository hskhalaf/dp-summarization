I love the simplicity and variety of The Honest Kitchen base mix. It makes it so easy to add whatever meat I want (I usually do ground turkey) and just add water. When I first got my dog he was on a kibble diet but since I switched him over to a more natural, less processed diet his coat has become a lot shinier and healthier, and he certainly enjoys the food a lot more than the kibble!",
