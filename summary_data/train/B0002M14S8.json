He runs every other day so they wear out quickly. Instead of paying the high price at the store, I checked Amazon and found the same pair. They must have been on sale because I paid around $55 which is a steal! Unfortunately that price isn't still there and I just re-ordered them for $93. Considering how much they are in a store and how much he uses them, it's still a good price. Next time I'm stocking up if they are on sale!",
