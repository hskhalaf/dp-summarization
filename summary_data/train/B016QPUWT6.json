My grandson was looking out into the ocean and could see another ship in the distance, he was thrilled. Then took them on a land excursion and was just as thrilled looking down into the grass at some insects! For the money it is a great buy, even his dad was impressed... oh, and it came with a neck strap, very helpful too!!",
