After almost a year of moderate use (use 2-4 times per week for soccer and track practices/games), three of the four chairs that we bought have had problems with the hardware that connect the cross bars to the main supports. We've tried different nuts/bolts to put in to make them work, but they just don't seem to work. So disappointing. Edited to add: I contacted Kijaro directly and they replaced the chairs very quickly. I didn't have to send them the old ones...they just asked where the fail points were located on the chairs.",

However the no sag might be of more value vs the seat height for smaller stature people. If not for the sheared bolt, I'd give 5 stars on comfort and quality for people tall enough to handle the higher seat height.

I usually sit with my feet up in my seat, so when I don't want my 25lb dog in my lap I love that the chair is still roomy enough for him to fit beside me.",

We have had some other brands in the past, but these blew them away. Truly fantastic chairs. Also, I got mine in purple... And it's a VERY nice color of purple.

It's big, solid, and titled at just the right angle so you're still sitting upright but not ramrod straight. I would have no problem using this as a desk chair to work at, and it's been great for reading and even meditating. The strap on the carrying bag isn't fantastic but I imagine you could always rig something up to make it more comfortable.",

These chairs are wonderful....sturdy.....19\" seat height (for those of us of a certain age)...and very well made and comfortable. Easy to unfold/fold and replace in a sturdy carrying case with comfort strap. You feel like you're sitting in a real chair! They are a bit heavier than most folding chairs, so if weight is a problem you should take that into consideration.",

But the smell is really strong and sickening. Maybe it was used.",

      "text": "This is probably the best folding outdoor chair in terms of comfort. You will see reviews and videos about other outdoor camping chairs that are not comfortable when you sit because you sink into the chair and then you end up slouching in the chair. You cant sit for a while in these type of chairs. Kijaro solved this problem. The chair back and seat material are two pieces and the rear legs are slightly shorter than the front, so you get a great angled chair design and you can sit in these forever! Great job and these simple changes made huge improvements!",
