When you see them in person at first it will look different than the pictures shown on amazon. The pictures on amazon don't show the flecks of white all over the shoe intertwined with the vibrant color you see. I wasn't crazy about that at first but I got past it and really appreciate the shoe in its entirety. I bought the shoe in the black current and midinight navy. Will most likely buy another color :)",

I wear no show socks and after about 30 minutes it started rubbing on my ankle. They also kind of lack cushion in my eyes compared to another that I have. I had to return.",

Be careful buying lighter colors because material does collect dirt. I wear 8.5 in Nike but Size 9 in this UA shoe. Wonderful shoes and buy!",
