The Ajax is also outfitted with zippered hand warmer pockets to keep his fingers toasty, a wind flap to protect the front zipper from drafts, and elastic-bound cuffs that provide a secure fit and help to keep out the cold. Your child's arms will retain full mobility through it all, thanks to the built-in angel-wing movement.",
