Easily sturdy enough to put your feet on or even put a tray on to decorate. Very well-made!",

They are easy to clean and so sturdy and beautiful. Inflating these was kind of intense because I had to use my mouth because I don\u2019t have a pump. So, yes I was a bit light headed BUT my excitement of the finished, inflated product trumped all of my dizziness. Just buy it! You won\u2019t regret it.",

For ease, keep the inflation knob closest to the end of the zipper. As you begin to inflate, start zipping up the cover leaving just a few inches before fully zipped. This way, it'll be easy to fully close when inflated. It can be hard to zip up if you inflate to a firm amount. I blew it up manually easily. Just remember to pinch the bottom of the knob a bit to allow air to flow in and out. Took me a bit to figure that out.",
