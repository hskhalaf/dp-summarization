Perhaps Hasbro could consider reissuing sets with \"retired\" ones. Another option would be issuing ones that are colorless and come with a paint set. The girls love painting over the characters. This set did give my granddaughter more to decorate and dress up with scraps of fabric, but the lack of older ones is the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars.",

The amount of imaginary play she does with these sets is enough to want more. Imagination and talk play has gone out the window these days and out kids just want screens. For my daughter she can sit in her room talking and playing with these friends for as many years as we can!",

It took quite some time to get everything out that is why I gave it 4 stars. The items are just as described and all of the stuff looks just like it does in the picture.
