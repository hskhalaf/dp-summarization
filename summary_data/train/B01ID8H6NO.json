Basically, if you have multiple people with long hair in your household, the rollers at the bottom of the Roomba (along with the rotating brush) will choke off by winding up wads of hair.

I just expect better design from such an expensive product - in the time that I spend working on the Roomba, I could easily vacuum all of those same areas. It also can't do thicker rugs period.

I contacted iRobot support and they confirmed they do not make any HEPA filter, nor do they have any affiliate companies that can provide a compatible HEPA filter.

When it is low in battery (about 1.5 hour of work), it goes back to its base to recharge and then resumes. Dislike: Not a lot but it is kinda noisy although not more noisier than an upright. However, no one will run an upright for 1.5 hours nonstop. My floor is 800 sq ft and the roomba takes 3+ hours to clean with one pit stop to recharge.",

You will still need to sweep the hardwoods once a week to get all the hard to get areas. This thing actually does pretty good on carpets as well, but our main use is hardwoods. The only thing I can complain about is having to clean the small bin out everyday, sometimes we forget and the vacuum will shut down until you clean it. Battery life is ok. It can not clean my entire floor plan (2700 sq ft) in one cleaning, it must return and recharge before completion. Overall very happy!",
