I use it for inspecting marijuana trichomes near the end of harvest to ensure my plants are in the most optimal window for harvest. I love the fact that this product has a rear push-button that instantly takes screen shots. It's how I took these photos. I highly recommend this product. It's also really fun looking at clothing fabric and other random small things with great detail.",

The setup was exceptionally easy on Windows 10, just plug-n-play (plug in microscope to computer, open camera app on computer, select microscope as camera input, profit). The quality of the pictures is good enough that I can make out details that I wouldn't be able to with a standard magnifying glass. The only downside is the suction cup sometimes comes off due to the weight of the microscope, but if you clean the surface before applying the suction cup it helps it stay in place.

I got an email right after buying it with the link to the software. It only took a minute or so to download, and it was easy to install. The only complaint I have is all the other applications that come with it that have nothing to do with it. I realized I suddenly had all these new apps that I had to track down and uninstall. I do not believe any of them were actually malware, but nothing should ever be installed without prior approval. So back to the microscope, I love it!",

Even the goose neck attachment is good looking and well made. Most importantly, the image quality is excellent. I tried it on my skin. Now I know what must have inspired many a sci-fi movie.",

It's amazing how everyday things look like when highly magnified (like your fingernail even right after a manicure, yuk). to be fair, this isn't a high-powered microscope, but almost anyone could put this to good use and it's very affordable.",
