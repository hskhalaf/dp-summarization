All the parts came in one long box, all the tools you need to build it are included, and the instructions were very clear on how to assemble it. My husband and I build it in an hour and a half (and then we got the best sleep of our lives) I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this canopy bed. WE LOVE IT!",

The beds were easy to put together with lettered parts for easy to follow instructions (about an hour or less per bed). One bed came in perfect condition with no manufacturer flaws. The other had one piece that was slightly bent (easily remedied) and a couple flaws, that were only noticeable if you were looking for them. Only complaint is that once the mattress was in place, it slides around a bit and I'm not quite sure how to fix that issue. Great buy. Definitely recommend.",

I\u2019m 275 lbs and my partner is maybe 180 lbs and the bed holds up well even during said activities. Pro tip: put pillows between the wall and the frame when you're getting it on. Edit: as I use this bed more, the squeaking is definitely... a lot... and I forgot to mention that putting it together was DIFFICULT because the holes for screws aren't totally aligned. I'm wondering if that's contributing to all the squeaking. I'm going to try using some WD40. I'll update if it works.",

We were easily able to construct the frame, just go slow and stay organized. It doesn't creak or move very much at all. The frame feels very strong. You could probably hang on the upper rails (although there are a plethora of stickers saying don't!!!!)",

      "text": "I love this bed because it was inexpensive and I really wanted a canopy bed. I needed help to set it up, but we got it together. The bed has these clips that go between the bars to prevent it from squeaking. One of the clips popped out, and it was VERY squeaky until I literally just stuck the clip back in and it's quiet again. It wasn't hard to do. I've been using this bed frame without a box spring for two months now- it's the perfect height, no squeaking and it's still very sturdy.",

We paid a good price for it in comparison to other similar bed frames. I did A LOT of comparison shopping. I also bought during Labor Day weekend so that probably helped with the cost.",

Took about 2 hours because I had to move stuff around but I'm only 5' and 110lbs. If my hubby was home or had 2 people to assemble this, it would have been easily done. I give this item 10plus stars. I got the white to match an all white room, I'm super pleased and can't wait to start adding lights or flowers around to make it my own style! Tres chic!",

The box clearly states two or more people are recommended to set it up, but I am stubborn and decided to tackle it myself after two weeks of the box just leaning up against my wall. I was able to successfully put this together by myself, but I would not recommend it, as it is very heavy, and when (it WILL happen) you realize something is upside down, it is very heartbreaking to undo your progress and start again. The product itself is very nice, the bed frame is sturdy, modern and a gorgeous piece to have in the bedroom.",

After I got to the last step, I came to the conclusion that the feet to the corner base bars, as well as the two center stabilizer bars, were not sent. This product received a one-star for exactly that reason. The product was incomplete and the pieces were bent.",

I don't see this holding up for your average (active) kid for a long time. It's lightweight, which probably explains the cheaply made slats. On the plus side, you can return it if it doesn't work for you. I gave it 3 stars because of how cheaply made the slats/bars are.
