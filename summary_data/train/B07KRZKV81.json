The textured portions of the insole hold your foot in place nicely. Laces are high on the shoe, basically only on the very top of the foot, which helps protect them from breakage. If you're into vulc shoes, this is the Emerica model I'd recommend most right now. It's a bit of a step up from the Wino G6. Just a simple, good-looking shoe. No big stupid logos. Checks all my boxes: comfy, grippy, durable, and skates well.",
