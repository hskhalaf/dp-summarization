I've literally beaten the f*** out of this bag for almost 5 years now. The only thing that's gone wrong is the little leather straps attached the zippers. They wound up coming loose and falling off. However, i have never had a bag last more than a year of school and this one is still completely in tact. No tears. No loose stitches. No broken zippers. I don't think I will ever get another bag ever again. If I do though, it will definitely be one of these.",

The strap on the right-hand side has torn along the seam, while the zipper to the small compartment has threads coming off of it and all but one of the little straps attached to the zippers have fallen off. For the $54 that I spent on it, this is far from the bag that I was expecting.",

After a month, the leathery pull strings to open/close the zippers all broke. Other people in my school had this same backpack and their's broke very easily as well. Another few months go by and the main zippers stitch begins to break. By the end of the school year, a good amount of the interior stitching was falling apart. I wouldn't recommend this backpack for school, but maybe if it's just holding a laptop.",

      "text": "I got this backpack in Navy Blue and I love it, however there are two negative things I can say about it-- There are no side pockets for a water bottle or a travel mug which I find to be slightly irritating. Additionally, the leather zipper pull on the fron pocket has broken like 3 times. I keep re-tying it but eventually it's gonna break, oh well I suppose. Anyhow, it really is a great backpack especially for college students. The bottom is durable and the backpack holds all of my textbooks/laptop nicely :)",
