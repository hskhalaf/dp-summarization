The second was accidentally dropped in water. Her girlfriend shook it off and turned it on and the lens extended. Then it shorted out fatally, of course. FYI, when any electronic equipment gets wet, you should immediately turn it off and remove any batteries so the device can't short-circuit. Then let it dry out for several days. There are several drying methods detailed online.",

As for pictures, the SD780 nails it almost every time. Low light, bright light, action shots no problem. The videos are just as good as I have not touched my very nice Canon camcorder in years. My iPhone takes ok spur of the moment photos but when I know a photo op is going to occur I grab my PowerShot. It has been exposed to all sorts of weather elements, beaches, dust, etc and is as good as the day as I bought it.",

The (rechargable) battery life is terrific. My son's roommate is constantly borrowing it for projects, etc.. My friend went on a trip to Spain with a $1200. camera, her traveling companion had this camera. When they returned she went through all their pictures to put a book together and was amazed that she couldn't see a difference in quality between the photos. Very highly recommended!!",

Best thing about this camera, aside from the usual specs discussed in the other reviews, is it has a viewfinder.

There are many scenes outdoors especially at the beach or in the snow where the screen view just doesn't make it. Very pleased with the purchase.

The zoom, located on the shutter button, is much easier to use than the position on my last camera. The only drawback is that the battery has to be removed to be recharged, so buy two batteries and keep the extra charged up. DD",

One problem I found (for me) is when zoomed out fully and then you later want to print a 8X10, the finer details will be pixelated but not noticeable with 4x6 prints. However, in fairness, this could be an IS issue at full zoom(?) or photographer (me) trying to do too much image correction. Will have to try more 8X10's with no zooming or image correction. Megapixel size should be enough for 8x10's so not sure what problem might be (and, yes, image quality is set to maximum in menu).",

I would reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a very portable, rough camera that takes pretty good pictures. Video isn't too bad and the battery life is pretty amazing. I love this tiny camera.",

The result is great, better photo quality compared to SD750, but video quality is much better. And it felt very small in hands, and fit very comfortably in jean's pocket. And one bonus I got is I can reuse almost everything from SD750.",

I always shoot with Canon with DSLR's and they do deliver quality. The camera is excellent, and very importantly is compatible with the CHDK. The lens leaves a lot to be desired for in low light conditions. Outdoors or in good lighting the camera shines. The HD video is a nice addition, and the quality is fair. Unfortunately there is almost no compression on the videos so you cannot record for very long unless you have a 8 gig SD card (or larger).",

In most cases, except for some very low light situations, my pictures were clear, bright, focused and all I did was point/focus/shoot. It has a lot of built in smarts, so that it adjusts as you focus to shoot the scene. It also has some advanced features that I am still learning to use. Great \"little\" camera. The zoom part takes some getting use to. The view finder doesn't work well, when you use the zoom feature.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD780IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nIt may be the slimmest Digital ELPH Canon has ever created, but the impact couldn\u2019t be bigger. The PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH captivates the senses with bold saturated colors and a daringly original design that matches the intensity of Canon\u2019s most innovative camera technology. Even when picture-taking conditions seem pretty unforgiving, you\u2019ve got Canon on your side. So the shots you used to miss are the images you\u2019ll now be sharing, and the movies you never took before will be HD unforgettable. \n\nPowerShot SD780 IS Highlights \n\n12.1-megapixel resolution, 3x optical zoom lens with Optical Image Stabilizer\nCanon\u2019s commitment to innovation defines the excitement of the PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH. 12.1-megapixel resolution is more than a number, it\u2019s your cutting-edge link to the outstanding clarity and quality you\u2019ve always wanted in your images. Think bold and big, because razor-sharp oversized prints are a breeze. Get the picture? It\u2019s absolutely brilliant. \n\n\n\nThe PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH has a 3x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a closer shot of a landscape, or a child\u2019s big smile. \n\nThe PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nHD movie shooting capability plus HDMI output\nThe PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH lets you record video in beautiful high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies (and still photos) on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high-definition monitor. You\u2019ll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 still images at once. \n\nSmart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH to Smart AUTO and you\u2019re ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It\u2019s a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you\u2019re photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you\u2019re getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nShooting Modes \nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 20 Shooting Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\n2.5-inch PureColor LCD II and wide viewing angle\nThe PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH gives you a large 2.5-inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. Canon\u2019s PureColor LCD II offers spectacular color, resolution and contrast even when viewed at an angle. The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light--a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. \n\nA World of Advantages with Canon\u2019s Technology \n\nThe DIGIC 4 image processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self-Timer. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor \nCanon\u2019s most advanced image processor, DIGIC 4, delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you\u2019re ready to shoot, then delivers perfect focus. In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA Face Detection Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include the photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, specify Face Detection Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range, and the Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway--allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot SD780 IS Digital ELPH body \n * Lithium-ion battery pack (NB-4L) \n * Battery charger (CB-2LV) \n * Wrist strap (WS-DC7) \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB interface cable (IFC-400PCU) \n * AV cable (AVC-DC400)",
