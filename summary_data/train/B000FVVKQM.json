This is a \"UHF HDTV Antenna,\" *not* a \"UHF and HDTV Antenna.\" The latter implies it will receive *all* HDTV broadcast stations. Some digital TV stations are in the VHF bands, and this antenna is a UHF antenna. It'll probably catch VHF signals \"well enough\" if the stations are close enough, but if they're at all distant: No go. As a UHF-only antenna it's probably quite nice. Construction seems solid. Assembly and attachment to a mast are easy enough. Coax attachment is a bit finicky if you're using the longer compression F-connectors on your coax, due to mechanical clearance, but that's a relatively minor issue.",

It receives a very large number of channels and the picture quality for the HD channels is superior to even the COX Cable quality! I installed it in my attic which is standard wood truss, but has very thick sprayed insulation above with concrete tile on the roof. I aimed the antenna towards the hill with the majority of the broadcast towers in our area. I actually receive far more channels than I had anticipated. I couldn't be more happy with this antenna.",

Possibly it would reach farther if you put it 30-40 feet up. Reception of the channels I could get was great and in high definition - 1080i - so it does work fine.",

The dbm reading from TV fool is a better indicator for the possibility of getting enough signal without drop out. Mileage is not a very good indicator to determine if the antenna will be able to pick up stations since other factors such as terrain and the station output power are varied. Stations with signal strength less than -60dbm may experience drop out or worse.",

The lower rating is simply because it did not work, but it will really depend on your situation. I did end up with a Channel Master, YAGI-style antenna, and am pleased with its performance.",
