I do not think I would actually prefer one that is thicker than this. I think that the price point might be a bit steep still, but that is perhaps because I am used to prices paid out 8+ years ago on goose down blankets.

My other issue is the feathers. It is losing feathers like crazy. Most of the baffle boxes are nearly empty.Though the feather loss is annoying I am kind of hoping it will make it a little cooler to sleep under. Buy with caution.

Which brings me to reason 2. It's rather thin. My old comforter was fluffy and made the bed look soft and inviting. With the new comforter, it looks rather flat. I'm not sure why other reviewers have been pleased with loft, but I'm not. Yes, it's warm enough, but for appearances I'm giving it a 3-star review.",

      "text": "This comforter is amazing. The first down comforter I have owned and it works great. A lot of loft and keeps you warm during the cold nights but does not cook you during the cold nights. Very soft fabric makes it more comfortable than most of the duvet covers I have bought for it. I have had no trouble with feathers coming out and I have had it for about 2 months. I cannot comment on durability past 2 months.",

      "text": "I was in search of a mid-level heavy down comforter that would work well for all seasons. This one has satisfied that need with its soft, pillowy feel and yet remains somewhat light and airy. Machine washable is key as many comforters are dry clean only. Highly recommended for use Spring-Fall. Being not in winter where I am, I cannot comment on that season's use yet.",

      "text": "I'm a down comforter fanatic. Most are over priced. This one seemed reasonable given the statistics. However, the description isn't complete. The comforter is 75% down, 25% feathers. This is an important characteristic that wasn't properly disclosed. Also, says made in US from imported materials in the description. But the outer cover says made in china. So I guess its sown together in the US????? That being said, it is plenty work, light weight, and reasonably priced. I'd recommend, but can't give it more than 3 stars due to the misleading description. But we're happy with it thus far. No leakage yet. True baffling and a nice big size (we got the king).",

Years ago I tried the major department stores, paid way more and yet ended up sending them all back. This one is a keeper. We have only had it about a month but have seen hardly any leakage at all, not feathers, not down, and not particles.",

I've never had a down comforter so I didn't realize how warm it would be. I will probably need another one for Spring/Summer because I've woken up a few times too warm and needed to take it off my legs. Very happy with the purchase though, it's warm, comfortable, and looks great. I got the duvet cover from pinzon for it.",

It didn't seem all that warm so i took it out of the cover, fluffed it, and let it sit for the day. When i put it back in the cover it was fluffier and much warmer. It has been keeping me toasty ever since. I love the larger size too. It looks really good on my bed and fills my duvet covers much better than the last one i had.",

After years of down comforter that the contents shifted to make one end puffy and the rest flat and not warm, this is just wonderful. I could have slept thru the rest of the day.

I live in a poorly insulated cement block house in Michigan, and even though it is the dead of winter I found myself waking up hot. So I turned down my heat. What a great money saver! I am very pleased with this comforter.",

We were not disappointed...it is light as a feather, so to speak, and as warm as we needed it to be.and very soft to the touch.
