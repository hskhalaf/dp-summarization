Food doesn't stick to the surface the way it stuck to the other baking dishes and when there is a bit of food residue, a few minute soak with hot water and baking soda does the trick! The directions do state one should not soak the dish for long. It is also as pretty as it is functional, which adds another element of delight.",

I will say the product sizing that Le Creuset uses is much to be desired. Most of the time they give the overall length instead of the actual capacity of the dish. It is difficult to determine if the size will work for its intended purpose. I am very satisfied with the product but the price is a bit ridiculous (so only 4 stars).

Each dish features grooved handles for a sure grip, plus Le Creuset's glazed interior that protects against utensil damage, staining and odor absorption \ufffd making each dependable piece of stoneware easy to use and easy to count on.\n\n * High-quality exterior enamel protects against metal marks and other damage\n * Hard-wearing, impermeable finish fired at temperatures as high as 2192 degrees F is safe for cutting on with knives\n * Unmatched thermal resistance from -65 degrees F to 500 degrees F \ufffd safe for the freezer, microwave, oven, broiler and dishwasher\n * Less than 1% porosity, blocking moisture absorption which can lead to cracking, crazing and rippling along the interior\n * Unique clay mixture that creates a very dense material when fired, maintaining even temperatures and preventing scorching\n * Resistant to staining and flavor/odor absorption\n * A perfectly color-matched palette of bold, consistent tones for easy mixing and matching with other Le Creuset products\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAll items in the Le Creuset stoneware range are original designs and have been hand-crafted, making each piece unique. Due to this uniqueness, there may be slight variations from piece to piece.\n\nLe Creuset Stoneware is safe for use in the microwave, freezer, refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and broiler. The maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C.\n\nThe enameled surface is easy to clean and scratch-resistant. The enamel is completely hygienic and will not absorb odors or flavors. Le Creuset Stoneware is extremely strong and durable, and resists staining, chipping and cracking. The handles, knobs and rims have been designed for a secure, easy-to-hold grip.\n\nCLEANING AND CARE\nDO NOT use any Stoneware piece on the stovetop or any other direct heat source.\n\nOVEN: Maximum oven-safe temperature is 500 degrees F / 260 degrees C. Use oven mitts for lifting at all times.\n\nBROILER: When using under a broiler allow a gap of no less than 2-1/2 inches between the rim of the dish and the heat source.\n\nMICROWAVE: Handles may become hot during prolonged microwave use, especially if the handles are enclosed with plastic wrap. Cover just the open top of the dish, leaving the handles exposed.\n\nFREEZER-TO-OVEN USE: Do not place a frozen dish of food in a preheated oven. Place the frozen dish in a cold oven and set the temperature, allowing the dish and oven to heat together. Before serving always check that the center of the food is completely and uniformly hot.\n\nCLEANING: Before the first use, wash the dish in hot, soapy water, and rinse and dry thoroughly. For most day-to-day cleaning, cool the dish for a few minutes before washing and drying, or wash in the dishwasher, allowing the full cycle to complete. Never leave a dish fully immersed in water. For removal of stubborn residues allow the dish to cool, fill with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak for 10 to 20 minutes. Wash in the usual way using a plastic brush or scouring pad if necessary.\n\nCream Catalana",
