I ordered this POS in the hopes that my kids would have the same experience only to find it is a poorly constructed peice of plywood which is glued, nailed and screwed (you have to screw together) bongo rip off. The bottom track is stapled on so poorly, the plywood wheels will not smoothly roll along the board. Save your money!",

The roller is just a bunch of thick discs that you screw together with a long bolt. The board itself has a guide rail down the middle that fits in between the discs so that you stay in the middle of the roller, but if you run up against it, the friction really throws you off. Still a good purchase though, definitely worth the money. I'm 230lbs and it supports me just fine.",

Other than that it was a breeze to put together (the roller comes in separate pieces and the hardware to assemble it, so no worries its simple), well made and strong. If you need something for snowboarding/skateboarding this will work. If you're looking for something that wobbles in a circular motion look elsewhere as this particular balance board only shifts left to right, but that's enough for most beginners to intermediates.

The only gripe I have is that the \"drum\" thing that you roll on slips if you change direction too fast. I fixed that by laying down some electrical tape where the wheels touch the board. No more slippage now. That's the only reason why I put 4 stars, I would definitely suggest getting one otherwise.",

Update after using it for about 2 years I switched to a skateboard deck and now wish I actually had a solid core all the way through.
