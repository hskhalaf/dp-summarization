In addition the Dell includes USB 3.0 ports on the side and 4 different connector options. I highly recommend this monitor and already want a second to replace my 1080 Acer secondary display.",

If the calibration report that comes with your monitor has massive spikes on certain colors that are > DeltaE of 6, check if you have backlight bleed. On both my monitors, that was the case. UPDATE: I received another replacement. There's still some light bleeds, but it's within an amount that is acceptable, so I'm increasing the rating to 3 stars. The point about poor QC still stands. Shouldn't take 3 tries to get an acceptable monitor.",

And it works perfectly at full resolution with the latest Mac OSX. Just purchase a mini displayport to display port cable. Plug the mini displayport side into one of the Mac's thunderbolt ports and you're good to go. Highly recommended.",

You should see a single solid block of pins extending all the way from the blade pin to the other side of the connector. Otherwise you will be limited to 1920 pixels. Theoretically HDMI should work as well. But you need a card that supports resolutions beyond HD over HDMI. None I saw state that and the couple I tried did not.",

Some issue with the hardware/ firmware reset. I am connecting it to my macbookpro through a mini DisplayPort cable to Diplay port cable. You might want to check out more recent monitors, as Dell may (or may not) have fixed this issue.",

      "text": "I was a little afraid to purchase after some of the negative review re: light bleed and poor color, but I have been completely satisfied. The color is beautiful, there is no light bleed, the menus are easy to use and adjust for mac. Just make sure if you're using a macbook that you buy the mini dp to dp cable that amazon recommends. I wanted a single monitor rather than a dual monitor set-up and the extra resolution makes a huge difference. I can use adobe graphic design and video products all while having my email and an internet browser open and accessible. Great purchase!",
