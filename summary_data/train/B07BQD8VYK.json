It is somewhat unclear in two places that are important for proper assembly. One place where it is unclear is the adjustable legs. They have a tab for pivot point on them and if you put them in wrong it will not work. The other point in the drawing where it is unclear on the drawing is the metal hight adjusters. If they are backwards it will not go into position. All in all it is a great desk that my daughter loved. Love the finish and the adjustability.",

Although Amazon CS tried their best, they could not obtain the part for me. Instead, I was given a credit for ordering a 'similar' part. Being only a furniture foot and 3.5 - 6.5 weeks delivery time frame, returned the desk to Amazon and ordered directly from the shipper.",

It took me about 45 minutes to assemble, and that was because the instructions were simple to follow. You will want to assemble the leg bracing pieces only hand tight until all the parts have been connected. Then tighten all the screws securely, but not too tight. Remember, too much torque will bend the metal.",

The assembly was not super easy, and I needed help getting the top on, but otherwise I did it all myself. Assembly wasn't horrible, but it was not the easiest thing I have ever put together. There are videos online you can watch, but they sometimes do not show detail. Anyway, I like this overall and would recommend it or buy it again. :-)",

The cosmetic plastic parts do not fit very well at all. The two shoes that protect the front legs are only retained by one pin, and are otherwise free to move around. After assembly, the desk works well, and the adjustment mechanism seems like it will last for a while.",
