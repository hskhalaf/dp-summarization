However, a few months after I got them, the coating over the headphone wires started to peel away/disintegrate. They still work, but the quality/durability of these headphones is awful especially for the hefty price tag. I own $6 Panasonic headphones that have outlasted these. I definitely would not recommend these to a friend.",

That said, the sound is still good and other than the \"moving parts\" they stand up to a lot of sweat. If they could remove the volume feature and lower the price, I would be a bigger fan. That said, they do work for the gym, but you have to use your device to change volume, which is a pain. I have been searching for workout headphones that stay in my ears, sound good, and do not fail due to sweat. These do well other than the volume adjustment, which should work longer. Overall, they are good but not for the price.",

For half that price the OCX 685i will give you great sounds with good situational awareness while you get your workout on.
