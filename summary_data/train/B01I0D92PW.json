      "verdict": "The Adidas AlphaBounce AMS is a running shoe that\u2019s versatile enough to be an everyday companion, whether one is going to the gym, going for a short run, hiking or going to work. This averagely priced shoe can also be a unique fashion statement with its futuristic design, monochromatic upper pattern and muted, yet stylish colorways.",
      "pros": [
        "Several testers were impressed at how comfortable the Adidas AlphaBounce AMS is",
        "The modern look of the shoes was admired by those who love wearing running shoes that can also be worn casually",
        "A number of users observed that the materials used for the shoe are of high quality",
        "The pull tab and the slight extension of the heel cup were helpful features for a lot of users because it helped them put their feet into the shoe",
        "Testers were impressed with the general durability of the shoe",
        "The Bounce technology was lauded by testers who wanted more of a firmer feel and a springier rebound when running",
        "The inner cushioning is not too plush",
        "According to testers, it provided the right amount of foot stabilization and support",
        "Despite the limited color choices, users still applauded the available colorways",
        "The shape of the AlphaBounce AMS looks narrow and pointy, but many users observed that there is actually more room in the forefoot than meets the eye"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The tongue of the Adidas AlphaBounce AMS being sewn on both sides made users feel a little tight at the top of the foot",
        "A couple of users remarked that the AlphaBounce AMS was not efficient for long-distance running",
        "Testers observed that it took some effort to insert their feet into the shoe because the opening was too narrow"
