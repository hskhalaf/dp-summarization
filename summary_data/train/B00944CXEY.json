What is not covered - material and workmanship of the battery, case, crystal, strap or bracelet. So my question would be what is covered?",

It has some bling but can still be worn casual. It really is a classy looking watch that can be worn for most occasions. I also like that I can tell what time it is (versus watches with tiny dots in place of numbers, or nothing at all).",

After some wear the rose gold on the band has tarnished a tad in certain places, but nothing a polishing won't take care of and is to be expected with constant wear. Always get compliments on it.",

As I was so excited, it was pretty devastating to see the one little missing part.",
