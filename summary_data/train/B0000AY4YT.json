We take pride in all our vehicles so I researched how to make our RV look descent again. Meguires products got high ratings, so I bought it and ,indeed, it made our RV look new again. I won't lie, there is a lot of elbow grease involved to get the oxidation off and we had to buy a new buffer, but it was well worth the results. Our whole RV travel club has now purchased it for their rigs as well!",

The wax took much longer to dry than expected and I ended up staying at the marina until well after dark, at which point condensation prevented the wax on part of the boat from ever drying, so I only got half of it off and then went home. On the parts where I was able to buff the wax off, it looks significantly better with a reflection off the boat that I haven't seen in a long time. If my marina had allowed me to get started earlier, the wax may have dried faster, but the product loses 1 star because of the slow-drying wax.",

The cleaner removes dull oxidation quickly, the polish brightens it to a mirror shine and the wax seems to hold up well after a few months. It's not cheap but when you put this kind of effort into a job there is no point using anything but the best materials. For me this is it.",

(One of the keys to keeping your boat young is to never go too long without restoring the original finish). It take a lot of work and I would recommend getting a few brand-new clean white towels to rub in the oxidization. If you have an orbital buffer, use that. For $26, this is the best value I've seen to get your craft looking sharp again.",
