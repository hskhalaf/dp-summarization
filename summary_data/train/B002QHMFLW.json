The bottom condo has absolutely no support it rocks back and forth and the only way to syabilize it was to put a block.of wood under it. The mouse came already broken so that was un use able. I have a kitten and adult cat and this is a horrible tree for either of them.",

I would not recommend this because I don't think that my cats will actually use it in its original configuration. If you're willing to think outside the instructions, and make some modifications, the product is totally fine. I ended up nixing the pouch-bed, and replacing it with the platform from the small condo pillar. I put the small condo on the base, since it was way too wobbly on its pillar.",

The design is also a little too compact and could be harder for older cats to navigate to the top. Should have known something was up with the price only being $40.

If I had to do it over again, I would not buy one that is so huge!",

Those platforms aren't even big enough to stand on let alone lay on an enjoy. Read the dimensions, and look at a ruler at the same time and think about your cat.
