Do not purchase this unless you want to be annoyed with short batter life and a defective charging port. Unfortunately it's too late for me to return it.",

Within 5 minutes of me unplugging it I got the battery low notice. It also smelled like someone who smoked cigarettes was obviously using it. I'm highly pissed off because nowhere in the description did it say this was used.",

It does what it says it does, and it's got a nice form factor and design, but my life is the same. Update! It died, granted it took a few years, but still. I reached out to the company just to ask about warranties, etc and they told me to pound sand. That's a little disappointing.",

But this is a huge batch of bad speakers and there being sold. I think sol republic know this but simply will not deal with it. I want a new one sent to my door with out having to box it up and then worry if it's going to get lifted from my porch. No I'll keep it and tell everyone this whole batch is defective until I get sent a replacement.",

I listen at pretty high volume, so I don't actually expect 8 hours, but I'm getting about 1 hour and a half. That's unacceptable. Additionally, the battery seems to deplete even if the speaker is powered off. I listened until the speaker was at half battery strength and then turned it off. The next day, when I went to listen some more, the speaker was completely dead. Back it goes I guess. Edit: It started working acceptably after burn in.",
