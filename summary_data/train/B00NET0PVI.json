      "text": "The Blackberry Passport is a device with a purpose and is deserving of the time it takes to fully appreciate its many benefits. For those considering the device, there is a slight learning curve, especially for those transitioning from a different OS, but it is time well spent. The OS is extremely fluid and intuitive and the addition of Blackberry Blend allows for seamless and constant connectivity. Physically, the device is 'easy on the eyes' - it is nicely and solidly built and the screen size is, quite literally, easy on the eyes. Blackberry Passport is top of the line and, in the crowded smartphone market, is one of the most innovative devices available. Working Wide; job well done, Blackberry.",

If BlackBerry had actually tried to sell this phone, it might well have been a powerhouse. Square display and shape took some getting used to, but not that much. Highly recommended.",

    "title": "BlackBerry Passport Factory Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, 32GB, Black",
    "description": "Style:Phone Only| Color:BlackThe BlackBerry\u00ae Passport\u2122 smartphone is designed to be different from other smartphones, with a large, wide touch screen and a touch-sensitive keyboard. The BlackBerry Passport design was based on the form of an actual passport, providing a sense of familiarity even in something so new. Its frame was inspired by the steel I-beams used in modernist architecture, and the gentle shape of the back cover feels great in your hand, while accommodating a large battery. The BlackBerry Passport takes our iconic keyboard to the next level. The physical keyboard gives you more typing accuracy1 and leaves you more screen space for viewing. It responds to touch gestures, so you can scroll web pages, flick to type or slide along the keys to move the cursor. The BlackBerry Passport is built for busy people like you, with optimization of power consumption in BlackBerry\u00ae 10 and an impressive 3450 mAh battery. That\u2019s almost 2 times bigger than the battery in the iPhone\u00ae 6.",
