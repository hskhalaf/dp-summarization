I will admit that the initial setup was quite hard, given the fact that I consider myself to be technologically literate. But I was impressed with Netgear's online tech support and they were able to help me with my issue. Beside this minor start-up issue, I noticed that the internet connection range was superb and I had no issues with internet drop-outs. Overall a very good product with a stellar customer support. Keep it up Netgear! You have convinced me to shift from Linksys camp over to yours!",
