The sole feels like walking with a plank of wood strapped to the bottom of your feet - absolutely no cushioning, no support, and no flexibility whatsoever. The size is slightly small, I'm between sizes and I got the larger size and it fits fine. I kept them hoping they would get better wearing them a few times, but they did not at all.

Now i have to finish Kamiks job and go in there with an exactly blade to remove it, Much of the stitching is really sloppy and has loos strands.

Seems like the perfect budget boot for snow shoveling and anything that doesn't require more mobility. Like any shoe with an all-rubber bottom, it isn't very flexible. Reviews question whether it is truly waterproof and I can say from inspecting it that it doesn't have any kind of interior membrane like Gore-tex. Just the warm synthetic liner which is water-resistant, rather than waterproof. So the boot is only as waterproof as its leather exterior. Take care of that, and it will no doubt serve if you don't need to walk through a stream.",

They can keep your feet warm but only for a little while. Maybe half hour to an hour tops in continued exposure to snow. Good to wear when shoveling snow and giving a helping hand when cars are stuck in snow on the road. Con I bought one size bigger to allow for thick wool socks. You do need to wear thick wool socks because the boots do not protect your feet from getting cold when subjected to prolonged exposure.",

They are NOT hiking boots, although I covered five miles of rough terrain yesterday in them. But, they are warm and comfortable, it was six degrees when I was out today. As with any winter boots, keeping your socks and the boot liners dry is key. If I am going to hike for an hour and then stand still for a hour, I change my socks after the hiking part..............they seem well made and durable, we'll see.",

My husband had been searching for a durable and comfortable pair of boots to wear while snow blowing and shoveling that would keep his feet warm and dry. He's pretty picky and had tried much more expensive Uggs and other brands. Then decided on these. These were 1/4 of the price...much nicer and more comfortable. He wears an 11 1/2 and ordered a 12. They fit perfectly.",
