Not sure if it's just this phone, but there are system updates at least once a week. I'm dumping it and replacing it after only six months. It won't run the simplest apps anymore because the 8G memory is completely full of undeletable junk. Seems like it's being pushed to its absolute limit, and will fail for no reason.",
