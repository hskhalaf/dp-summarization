And that's what they do here with the mark iii. This is just what you'd expect from a pro DSLR. Durable, great auto focus, and love all of the customization it provides. Yes the price point is high but typical for a pro DSLR. Would definitely recommend this camera body for serious pros",

Usually, the result is grainer/noisier. This 5D keeps very nice result up to ISO 1600.",
