It never stops shedding; there's no way for me to wear it without huge portions of the wig cap showing through. :/ Take your chances, be prepared for a possible one-time-only or careful photo shoot to hide the wig's poor quality.",

It felt like the wig cap doesn't really fit the shape of your head fully. If it fit better I would have given this a 5 star, otherwise the pastel wig is awesome and I always get tons of compliments <3",

From experience, I know that it will start to look dry, brittle, and cheap after fewer than 10 uses, but that's what you get at this price point. If you want a nicer/more comfortable cap, longer lasting fibers, lace front, built in combs, etc look at the $30-$60 range. I definitely recommend this wig for costumes (much nicer than any $20+ wig you'll get at a halloween or party store), filling in other wigs, or anyone looking to try out wigs before dropping a lot of cash.",

A tighter hairnet might be needed for people with longer hair, though, since the one that comes with it is pretty loose and big. It\u2019s usually not a problem if you pull your hair back anyway.

The back was also so thin, you could see my hair right through it. I have really dark hair and it just did nothing to hide it. Luckily, my cosplay involved a hood so the whole back-half of the wig was covered. It worked for what I needed, but I plan on hunting down a new wig ASAP.",

      "text": "I really like this wig. It's pretty, and when you throw a beanie over it, people can't even tell the hair isn't real. I knocked off a star because I received a wig that was thin at the top, so wearing it without a beanie or hat is not an option. However, I knew that was a high probability before I purchased the wig thanks to reading the other reviews, so I wasn't really upset about it.",

It's been 3 months as I've been continuing to wear this and the compliments keeps on coming, which makes me happy. Only thing that sucks is that I may need to wear a hat because the netting kind of shows on the back at the top of the wig. Idk if its just me or the wig itself. Pretty wig nonetheless, will purchase more colors in the future",

I open it and it look like green and gray. It's this ashy looking gray that doesn't look great with the green so i was so mad because it looked amazing in the picture. I'm not gonna buy anything else from this buyer.",
