If you have a Samsung phone the features are brilliant. Tap controls are spot on & there so small. The most comfortable earphones I've ever had. For the money I can't fault these in anyway. Absolutely no point in comparing to Bose and other top makes that cost far more.",

If you have a Samsung using Dolby Atmos really helps the quality and the Galaxy Wearables app offers more sound features. It stays firm in the ear and doesn't budge when active, it's also comfortable and you forget it's there after a while. The touchpads are responsive but I wish you didn't have to choose between a set configuration of what they do, and that they were fully customisable rather. Overall 3/5, I like the smart features but really let down on the sound quality",

The ambient sound isn't as great, with a higher volume you can't hear your surroundings which puts you at a very vulnerable place if you are cycling to work since it cancels any noise possible from outside - ambient sound works well on lower volume whatsoever well.",

For me it was the range between the buds and phone when playing football, not long enough range without carrying your phone with you. Very little point but this was why I got it. My fault for not checking the product range I guess. Still love it.",

      "text": "I purchased these a year ago and as bluetooth earphones go, I really like them! But I recently had one of the buds stop working and when I contacted Samsung they confirmed that these were a legit Samsung product but were not manufactured in the UK. Therefore, they were unable to help me with the issue. Luckily, Amazon's amazing customer service team allowed me to send these back for a refund and I will not be repurchasing them from the official Samsung site. I'm really disappointed that these details were not made clear to me, so just watch out!",

I was in Euston station recently and the interference was very bad. I previously had the Samsung Level U headphones and they were even worse for interference.",

The best thing about them was the passive noise cancellation, but the ambient sound made it hard to hear people when they were talking to you, I found taking them out was quicker and easier which made it pointless. Sound quality is amazing one of the best in this area. Recently my case has been decreasing in battery capacity so I have just sent mine back. I reccomend getting the buds+ for \u00a320 or so extra, alot of problems have been addressed and is better value. But if you can't get buds+, these original buds are still great!",

I am content with the battery and only charge it once every 3 days but that's because I use them for about 3-5 hours everyday - charges up relatively quickly. Noise cancellation is not exceptional, but then again they are IN-EAR tiny headphones.",
