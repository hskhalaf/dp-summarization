      "text": "I recently purchased the Park Tool cable cutters from Amazon, they became unserviceable after just a few cuts! I then purchased the Felco C7 cutters, they have performed extremely well making clean straight cuts in both stainless cable and cable housing. I highly recommend the Swiss built quality of Felco, they cost more but are well worth the extra dollars for a tool that will last many years. The Chinese manufactured Park Tool cutters are now in my garbage, I was so disgusted with their performance I didn't bother returning them to Amazon. I am avoiding Park Tools from now on... so should you.",

I'll probably never need to buy another cable cutter. However, it's not really the be-all and end-all others are saying. It cuts derailleur cable a bit more easily and cleanly than the less expensive units. However, when cutting brake cable with the spiral shield housing, you still have to tidy up the cut end with a file and a nail set most times--not much different from the others.",

The bad: At least for spiral brake housing, don't expect this to cut a flawless 90 degree edge in the housing. More often than not, part of the spiral will collapse inwards and will need to be dressed with a grinding wheel or hand file like all other cable cutters require. If you already have a decent cable cutter this isn't going to remove the step of having to dress your housing ends.",
