      "text": "My fifth pair of Salomon Speedcross. Absolutely swear by them. When I run trails I typically run around 20 miles, sometimes more. Wore these a few days ago for the first time on a 28 mile mountain run. Perfect, perfect, perfect. GREAT grip, very luggy, almost like cleats but manages to be exceptionally light. Cushioned well, but not so well that you lost the feel of the trail beneath your feet. I find it incredibly valuable, especially on rocky or technical trails, to be able to feel the ground. I generally put between 400-500 miles on them before retirement.",

Im amazed the brand hasnt put a stop to this because the narrow-ness of a WIDE was just too ridiculously narrow, so much so that even if this was a regular and not a wide, it was still too narrow for that. So if you know you have very narrow feet, buy a wide and you might be okay. No one should buy the regular. If the wide is that narrow, I imagine the regular couldn't hold a hot dog!",

Light and efficient. Grip is excellent and inspires confidence at all times. Durability is questionable. A few abrasions show in the toe box area already. The wide cleat pattern will probably not last on hard, abrasive surfaces. Overall, this is an excellent Trail Runner. Five well-deserved Stars.",

      "text": "I ran a trail marathon with these in Vermont, the grippiness of the soles is really fantastic, and the space between the 'spikes' (sorry not sure what to call these) is deep enough to allow for mud and debris to fall away and not get compacted. They felt as light as I could expect for the product--the stiff toe and sole keeps you from 'feeling' rocks under your feet which prevents soreness. The downside--these are VERY slippery on wet rocks. I kept sliding off. So if you have stream crossings in your running keep this in mind. Another downside is that when mud gets caked in the shoelaces, because of the quick tie feature, it's hard to slide them off.",

This leaves me to 1 or 2 conclusions, 1. They just don't care that their bar codes are on the wrong boxes, or 2. these are not the genuine shoe. Right now I'm leaning towards 2, these are a knock off copies. In ether case I'm done with this supplier.",

      "text": "These are excellent shoes for hiking in mixed terrain. The cut is low enough that they don\u2019t rub the bottom of my ankle bone. They are adequately cushioned, but are better with cushioned socks. The lacing system has held up well. I have worn them on several hikes in Grand Mesa, where they served me well. My only complaint is that the cleats tear off too easily. I am not overly hard on shoes and am well within my BMI, and expect shoes that cost close to $100 to last longer than 4 to five hikes. However, they fit so well and worked so well I do highly recommend them. My old pair will become my beater shoes.",

After hiking all day, mostly on rocks and huge boulders, my feet did get sore. But I would still recommend these if you need serious traction",

My previous pair (same ones) were my exact foot size and pinched just a little. The awkward part is that the laces are so long once you tighten the shoe that you need to feed through the lower cross-lace and it still can hit the ground. No harm just odd.",

I bought the Speedcross 3 and the 4 and the 3 is definitely more bulky & klunky. So i returned the 3. The 4 is everything i want in a snow and trail shoe. It\u2019s not water proof but rather water resistant. But i have not had any cold wet feet issues running in the snow and slush. As mentioned it\u2019s a great shoe!",

Most impressive is the fit, I have narrower feet and seem to fit really well.",

With that said, after 40-50 miles of moderate trail running, I can say that I can't imagine doing more than a 10k in these. They reminded me of a modern version of my old Puma metal spike track shoes from high school. Cushioning is practically non-existent and swapping out insoles made the fit too tight to be comfortable.
