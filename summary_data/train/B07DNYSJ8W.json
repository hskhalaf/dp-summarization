Doesn\u2019t allow me to do anything well and the materials to include bolts and fasteners are super flimsy. It is not likely that this bench will hold anywhere near the 500-600 pound load the manufacturer claims. It seems particularly flimsy at the ends of the bench - which precludes preacher curls over the seat back or dips from any area of the bench. The caps on the feet fall off constantly.",

At 6'1\" and an avid lifter, this bench is too high to have my knees bent at the proper angle to make a solid foundation.

The range of positioning is really key to working out some harder-to-hit muscle groups so that was the selling point for me since I can't go to the gym currently. The bench adjusts easily and I haven't felt like there was any chance of it slipping position, or being anything less than extremely stable. Pads aren't exactly plush but plenty comfortable and clean off easily. Probably paid more for it than I would have liked to, might knock off a star for that depending on how it holds up, but I'm overall very happy with my purchase.",

First, it is too high off the ground but is marginally stable even with its narrow footprint. Second, the base/seat is far too big, long and tapers the wrong direction (outward instead of inward at the end). It is frankly ridiculous. The torso portion is too short, so my head/neck has no support - I am 6\u2019 1\u201d. Third, the vinyl cover material is too thin so after only 3 uses is starting to wrinkle. Terrible purchase.

Seat width is 14 inches at the widest part which is also good. The back and seat rests are super easy to adjust using the spring-loaded quick-release pins, so there's virtually no wasted time unscrewing/rescrewing bolts. Just pull and adjust.

Second, the foot pads are barely wider than the bench (see photos) which maybe okay if you have a thin frame.

They will need glued on at some point. The other is the bench has a side to side slope in it looking from the top or bottom of the bench. Using a level to gauge this, the slope is quite apparent but pressing into the padding, it does go flat eventually so concern for different angled movements are not a concern.",

The Bench is padded nicely and displays the quality of workmanship thats gone into it. Overall Highly satisfied and will definitely recommend this product.",

Rear legs also need to be a bit wider for stability. I can work around both issues (4x4 on either side where feet are) but it\u2019s a pain. No problems doing military press or incline press.",

I do not feel comfortable doing anything that doesn\u2019t involve at least one foot firmly planted on the ground. If you are not planted and your motions are not completely symmetrical, you will risk tilting over. This will be even more pronounced if you exercise over carpet (which I do not).
