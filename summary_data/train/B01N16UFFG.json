It was about 5 inches too big to go with the sides of the bed. I wish I had bought a bed from American Signature. I don't like to write negative reviews, but this one was so disappointing. Now I'm stuck with a $480 bed that I don't even like to look at it. No one has used it yet. I would like to have my money back.",

This new way of making beds and not needing box springs is just awful. After 2 months I started to see the center piece leaning and loosening. I have tightened multiple times, all to no avail. The slats are not sturdy either. They tend to pop out of place. I suggest ordering a platform/frame support for platform beds in conjunction to this item.",

I've put sturdiness to the test good amount of weight in the bed at once. no issues. but the slacks on it does scare me they will give one day on me because It does not feel like sturdy wood.

I would\u2019ve given it 5 stars but the setup instructions were a little confusing at first. Took me hours to put together (with breaks of course) alone. Def should be a 2 person job! Overall, I am happy and it\u2019s looks great in my studio apartment! Thank you!",
