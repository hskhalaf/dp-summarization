Both were horrible, I will never forget the pad again. We are glad to have the two colors, there are spots where each are the best choice for visibility.",

But one hand at the bottom and one at the top, give it a twist and it folds nice and compact making it easy to fit in it's carrying bag, which can easily fit in a backpack or carrying bag for your drone etc. I have used it on very wet grass and it does shed water pretty well. It is a good size when expanded. All in all very pleased.",

Printing is fine, a few others mentioned printing problems. I might have a dot here or there, but it's not a problem for me. Would have given five stars if they would have included better stakes. They're cheap plastic, I recommend getting a few metal ones instead. I have no idea what the reflective tape is for, those went in the trash. They don't match any of the printing's circles and even if they did they seemed cheap and would likely peel off quickly.",
