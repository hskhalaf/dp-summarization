No way before it went off though. Some people said it is too sensitive. My bike is under a cover and I've never had it go off, even in storms/windy weather.

But it's not loud enough to get my attention when I'm inside, which is okay. I dont think any theif wants to deal with that. What I dont like is that even a light rain sets it off repeatedly. Very frustrating because when it's raining my bike doesn't have an alarm and there aren't any pedestrians to scare off a would be theif!",

Cons: Did not fit my scooter. The lock is extremely sensitive, it goes off if you barely touch it. I was afraid the wind would set it off and annoy my neighbors all the time. The only way to turn the alarm off is to unlock it with the key, if there was a remote I may have kept it.Too sensitive for everyday use.",

I'm fairly confident that if someone touches your bike with enough force to move the suspension visibly, then the alarm is going to register the contact.

Came neatly packed in a little box that was put in a larger box with no padding to keep it from bouncing around in the Box. At this point it's just a fancy lock for my disc brakes. I am quite disappointed at how lousy the motion sensor is. Was going to buy another one for my other bike but I will be looking elsewhere",
