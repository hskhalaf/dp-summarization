They are so fragile and we try to be so careful with them and it doesn't matter. Just frustrated.",

I purchased this $1100 vacuum to be the last one I ever buy and it lasted all of 12 days. So much for high end vacuums!",

The steel wand is heavy too. Lighter materials exist. Why not use carbon fiber tubes? Not sure it is worth the cost. I think a better combo would be the powerbrush that comes with the \u201cpets\u201d model. I also wish the hose rotated at the plugin instead of forcing you to rotate the whole machine to uncoil it. In summary, I think it is overpriced for what you get. I hope longevity will make the high price a good value in the long run.",

Vacuum exhausts upward to avoid blowing dirt around. Filters and bags are easy to access and replace. Attachments work well. Bare floor attachment is best that I've ever used.

      "text": "The vacuum is a bit heavier than I'd hoped, especially the carpet tool, but everything else about it screams high quality and thoughtful engineering. The suction is easily adjustable as is nearly every other function, even the length of the wand. The most impressive aspect of it to me is the way the floor tool fits easily under cabinets and furniture and goes so precisely into corners, angles and edges. It makes vacuuming a pleasure.",
