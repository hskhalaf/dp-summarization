It's important to inflate, let it rest overnight, then re-inflate to get it to the correct size. I am 5'4\" and I purchased the leg extenders because otherwise it was too short for my standard desk with keyboard drawer. I don't know why they say the leg extenders are for tall people, I couldn't get into a comfortable, ergonomic position without them. Also, it's a little \"stuffy\" sitting on the rubber all day in shorts, so I put a cloth cover over the ball. Voila! works great.",

The base was nice because it was more stable, but after about 7 months of use, the screw that's holding the metal piece in place broke in half. The actual SCREW BROKE. The metal piece was helping to keep the ball stable, so the chair feels like it's slowly falling apart. This product is the same price as a nice regular office chair, so I would expect the same quality.",

Backrest, of course, allows you to lean back if you need to. It was super easy to assemble, the ball was easy to inflate with no issues with it being too small like some reviews have commented. If you are 5'7\" or taller, I recommend purchasing the Giam Yoga Ball Chair leg extensions at the same time you purchase the chair or you might be frustrated with the low ride-- I'm 5'8\" and super happy I did!

      "text": "Easy to put together with the ball inflation being the hardest part. It took me two days to finally have my ball expand fully. The material is significantly sturdier and thicker material than my other two yoga balls I have. After a week of active sitting, I have noticed that my hip pain is getting lesser day by day. I also found it helpful to release a bit of air from the ball for my own comfort. If you are already looking into what it takes to reduce your pain and have better posture, giving a couple extra days to \"customize\" your chair is well worth it in my opinion.",

It\u2019s not at all something you can lean on and is really only a handle for moving the unit around.

It ends up fitting perfectly. The height of the chair with the fully inflated ball is perfect for my desk. I've been using it off and on for a couple of days now and it's comfy, makes my back and shoulders feel better, my legs don't cramp up from sitting all day for work. Highly recommend!",

I perform these exercises several times a day and my back feels so much better. I would definitely recommend this chair to not only people with back issues, but anyone who sits a lot through out the day.",
