While it doesn't actually plump lips very much...neither do any of the other brands I've tried...and I've tried a lot of different brands! I also like how saturated the color is for a gloss. And last I'm discovering that the Two Faced brand offers high quality product lines that cost significantly less than many other high end competing brands. Overall I'd buy this again!",

Burning is to a pleasant feeling, and when you go to wipe it off it takes forever to rub off even with soap and water. even though it does pump up your lips it turns them incredibly pink and burns very bad. Definitely not worth the price. I suggest you to not buy this.",
