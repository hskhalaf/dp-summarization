No where on the box does it mention core unlock and after installation nowhere in the bios does it allow it. After researching it seems that its predecessor the Non-Plus board had these features. Other than that it is a decent priced board for a last gen CPU. So I'm not knocking stars for the product as it works as advertised. I'd knock stars off Amazon for false description of the board. Added picture of the proper pin placement.",

However, linux radeon drivers (Important for doing anything with gnome or other linux X desktops, or virtual box) have not be supported for a long time. So you need an inexpensive nvidia card. Ok, well that takes up your only PCIe slot, so you have to choose if you want video or RAID support. Sata3.... should have been sata6. Keep those things in mind when you're shopping.",
