I insisted to use, but to do that I had to get a waffle maker that could get hot enough to make a \"classic\" waffle, which is what Aunt Jamima mix--a proven brand of 128 years (!)--needs. The cheaper waffle makers really mean Belgian waffles, which are thinner and don't require as much heat. The result is perfection.",

Cons: The settings (buttermilk, chocolate, etc) are not explained anywhere, so there is no way to know if they change time, heat or both. THAT would be very useful to know. Also \"custom\" setting is not explained, and doesn't make sense- you would expect to be able to set it, right?. There are recipes in the manual that relate to the settings, but if you use different recipes you'l have to guess. It's not rocket science: just keep checking until they're done.",

It has all of the bells and whistles, but I think some of the controls are a bit redundant and some of them like \u201ccustom\u201d are not fully explained. Build quality is very good and there is adequate spill control. These are deep waffles so if you are using a mini waffle maker like the Dash, you will need to add about twice as much batter to each waffle section.",

So, its very fast.and you can adjust and fine tune the darkness or crispness to come out just as you like. And its non-stick though I use a minimal amt of oil.
