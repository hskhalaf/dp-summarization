      "text": "This Mosasaurus is huge. It is 28 inches long, and its jaw can open really wide. Unlike the Super Colossal Tyrannosaurus rex from this toy line, it can't swallow figures or mini dinosaurs. But you can hold 1 figure in the jaws, and close them, since there is room. It is hollow in the stomach region, and is quite soft and rubbery. It doesn't need batteries, and it is waterproof. You can play with this figure in the swimming pool, and reenact scenes from Jurassic World. Overall, this Mosasaurus toy is incredibly detailed, and I would recommend this to any fan of prehistoric marine reptiles or Jurassic World fans, or even dinosaur fans.",

The tail is also extremely heavy, which puts a lot of stress on the connection. We could never get the tail on our first Mosasaurus to stay attached. It kept falling off. Upon inspection, the female part of the ball and socket appeared to be deformed and does not properly latch. We returned it to Amazon for a replacement. The second Mosasaurus suffered from the same issues. I opted to just epoxy the tail to the main body.",
