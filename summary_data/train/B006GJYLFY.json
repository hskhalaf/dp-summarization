It's obvious now that these seats were so dingy that they just looked a different color and I didn't realize what the original color was until I applied some Vinyl Sauce. Highly recommended!",

In my case, the Hot Sauce does such a great job, I rarely have to use this wax. Although, I'm putting a coat on today before I go out. My recommendation is to do a good detail wax and sealant on your boat. Wipe it down after every use, preferably with Hot Sauce. Every few times or maybe weekly/every other week (depending on how often you use your boat), do a quickie wax. Will look like a fresh detail...",
