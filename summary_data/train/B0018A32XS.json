There is a spring to this newer one, so its easier to maneuver. and its got extra attachments the older one did not. Definitely try out this newer model, if you are a fan of the old one. I can no longer use regular razors on my skin, and need as close as a shave possible, and this newer model is a keeper. Great improvement panasonic!",

Two: The weight of the unit can cause it to pull free from the wall socket during charging process. Again it would be better with a wall wort with led charge state light and cord to shaver.

It shaves the hair close enough that you can\u2019t see it from a distance, but if someone is going to be touching your legs, this is not for you",
