      "text": "This would have been an even better product if the seller had packaged it for it's journey. The box arrived mashed, and partially torn open. The kit box was partially flattened. I have not, as yet been able to determine if any of the actual model pieces have been damaged. On the positive side, the instructions are something to write about. Detailed, and very clear. I anticipate not problems following them. I am glad I did not order glue with this order. It would have been all over both boxes and the model itself.",

I haven't finished building mine, but so far the kit's detail is good, as well as the fit of the parts. Many details were added that are not available in the older kit, mainly the 37mm anti-tank gun Kennedy put on his boat.",

Once again, I was lucky none of the plastic pieces in the box were damaged. Other than that, it was fun to assemble. If you like putting models together. I have ever since I was young lad. Me father was in the Royal Navy you see. I grew up putting WW II plastic models of numerous types together. It's a creative way to pass the time. Ye lads and lassies tell me what ye thinkest.",
