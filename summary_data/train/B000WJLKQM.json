However, it was an easy fix by having some folded up blankets around her. I wish there was an insert we could buy that would be easier, but not a big deal. She loves bouncing in this. She would stay in this for hours if I let ler. It's nice and secure on the door frame.",

My only complaint is the height adjustment. I have it on the highest setting & it's not enough. We just got it so as he gets taller, I'll have to figure something out.",

Only downfall (and it is for us specifically) is we only have a few doorways with molding that this works on and at 7 ft it needs to get shorter than what it does. An 8 foot doorway would be perfect, but all of our 8 footers are bull-nosed so that is a no go. Again, that is a specific issue with my home and NOT the product!",

I saw her jumping with and the laughter as she jumped around like a little bunny in circles filled my heart. I've never been so satisfied buying something for someone before. I recommend this for all babies. We got lots of compliments on the jumper too! People always ask where I got it from. It's very well made so you can have a peace of mind too.",

It is inexpensive when it comes to baby products and entertains our baby for 20-30 minutes which is about 15-25 minutes longer than anything else including the expensive baby swing. Some jumpers are just the cloth held up, but I like that this has the bumper around it. He has pushed himself into the door frame but the the bumper he doesn't hit his head on the door frame. It is also really easy to put up. It has a spring loaded clamp, so there is no need to twist or do anything to tighten. I honestly thought there was going to be more work.",

I'd say it probably has a golden age range - not sure how well it would work for kids under 5 months, or who are able to pull themselves up to standing on furniture. It works best for us if we pull the cord up so our little guy is further from the ground. If it hangs too low, he doesn't get as excited or jump as much. I'm a huge fan.

You need to run the end loop of the strap through the plastic brace again and then it raises the jumper by a lot! The only problem is that after you do it and the baby jumps the strap gets loose and then the jumper is low again. I was able to fix this with a cable tie that prevented the strap from slipping.",
