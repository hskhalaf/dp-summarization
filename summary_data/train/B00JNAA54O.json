The ME181C is very responsive, has a decent screen resolution and the manufacturer skin of Android is not overwhelming at all. As for battery life my friends tell me that with some lite use (1-2 hours a day) the tablet can last a few days with 1 charge which is good. The camera is not stellar or anything but that's not a big deal for a tablet. This is an amazing tablet for the price and I'm very glad that Asus is making very good improvements to their tablet lineup.",

Once you upgrade to WW-3.1.23.172+ your battery will hold a charge like it's supposed to. I went a little further than this by limiting the maximum CPU frequency. Unfortunately, the minimum frequency of this Intel CPU is 532 MHz. It's also easy to root and some of the built-in Asus apps are not bad. I currently use the Asus Browser and Asus Camera as my defaults.",

This is very similar to my old Nexus, since they are both made my ASUS, but this one is faster and somewhat bigger, but thin and light. I've received at least 3 \"system updates\" from ASUS since my purchase, each one an improvement to the prior system. The resolution of the screen is wonderful for my purposes. I have a 32GB microSD in the slot and I can't imagine needing more storage at this point.",

Good: -Comparatively inexpensive -Has much of the functionality sought in a tablet -Holds a reasonable charge Bad: -Noticeably lower performance, especially with browsing speed and media -Stability issues are very noticeable. Considering Android is running on a much wider range of tablets than iOS, this is not surprising. Final thoughts: This is a good 'disposable' tablet for experimenting with different ideas, but if you tend to push the limits of your tablet and need something to serve as a workhorse, this isn't it.",

No problems since. Will definitely be sticking with this manufacturer when it's time to upgrade. The picture quality is amazing, better than my husband's tablet. I could go on and on about everything I like. For the price I paid, I think it was an amazing deal. Thanks ASUS!",

I contacted ASUS and sent the tablet in to them, and I had purchased an accident protection and warranty plan, but they just sent a letter saying that a loose port was not covered and that they would repair it for $209. What a disappointment! I am disgusted with ASUS and with their poor customer care! I will certainly NOT buy their products again! I would encourage you to be cautious! If you happen to get a lemon, as I did, they will not stand by their products!",
