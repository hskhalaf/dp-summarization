      "text": "I had originally bought this same model Rosle torch from a kitchen store several years ago and it was the absolute best hand torch I had ever used. The build quality of all the parts of the torch were impeccable and it never had problems igniting even after years of frequent usage. More recently, I bought 2 of these torches from Amazon as gifts to friends only to discover that Rosle had either changed the design or switched manufacturers to a noticeably cheaper quality. The safety switch is poorly built and will fail easily, and the spark is not reliable after seasoned use. Do not buy this torch unless you can find the older version (not made in China)",

Got it replaced and the new one had a broken igniter so I needed a second fire-starter to ignite the torch. I returned them both. I won't be buying this again.",

I mean embellish with a tool that easily crisps up any sugars, cheeses, meat or fish. :) It is very safe, stable and easy to fill.",

I used to have this much cheaper torch and I didn't make creme brule\u0301e often enough to justify buying an expensive one. However, after my other torch died after only a year of limited use I just decided to splurge a bit. Totally worth the money. I can't even believe how much better it is. It lights on the first light, locks into place, you can hold it with one hand and it carmelizes the sugar quickly and evenly. I made 12 servings of creme brulee for our family holiday party and it was awesome :)",

I also used it for meringues and for creme bru\u0302le\u0301e. I couldn't find fine sugar (my bad sent my hubby to the store so wadda ya expect) so I had to use granulated sugar, which is harder to crystallize and it was perfect. The shell was crackin' good and a perfect contrast to the custard. Highly recommend this versatile kitchen torch.",
