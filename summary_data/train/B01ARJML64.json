However on our second use the pole for the rain fly broke in half and when it rained it had one or two small leaks, which might have not happened if the rain fly didn't break. Also the tolerances are very tight on the rain fly which probably led to the failure.",

We prefer to only use it for 3 people and a dog and we fit just fine. The door is a little annoying because it doesn't open all the way. You have that remaining strip down the middle. The window covers could be better as well since theres really nothing to tie them with. You tuck the window covers. We've have this tent for about 3 years now and we only go camping once or twice a year. It can get pretty hot inside with just 3 bodies.",

A tall person can easily stand in the tent. Set up is about 5-7 minutes. A queen size air mattress fit easily with room for duffle bags. Floor is sturdy material. Easily fit back into the carrying bag. Not too heavy for carrying and transporting.",

The product arrived in great condition, set up in seconds, and was ample room for our family of four. We had our three-year old son in a sleeping bag, our seven-month old daughter in a pack and play, tons of bags, and finally the husband and wife. The tent provides nice finishes (moderate-duty TARP floor, storage areas, light basket, and more), appears to be well manufactured, and is excellent for the price. Personally, I applied additional water-proofing and purchased some better stakes but you could probably do without. Overall, remarkably satisfied.",

It has held up so far without any leaks/ the floor is made of pretty sturdy material and should hold up for years since we use a tarp under the tent. The screens allow for quite a bit of ventilation when needed. It takes us about ten minutes to set the tent up and about five minutes to take down.",

It's 6 feet in height too, so we pretty much could stand in there comfortably. It rained really hard one of the nights in Yellowstone, not a single drop go inside nor did the tent damage from the winds and rain. Very excellent tent, and the price was a steal.",

I waterproofed it and consider it just as good as my TNF or Mountain hardwear tents now.",
