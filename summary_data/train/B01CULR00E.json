However, if they seat well, or when I swapped to comply, the sound was fairly well balanced and well worth the price. However. I purchased two sets. - One set pulled apart when i was removing/replacing the worn out earbud. RHA did replace under warranty - One set left hand side started playing at about 1/3 to 1/4 the volume of the right side, making them fairly useless. I will be looking for headphones once again.",

But for me, value also depends heavily on DURABILITY and LONGEVITY. And these simply didn't hold up to normal, daily wear and tear. After 4 months of regular use, my right ear-piece came unglued, and before I could look to repair it, the wire became detached, and it was no longer functional. Sorry guys, gotta chalk this up to a design flaw. For $54, I expect better value, and would rather get a cheaper, but more durable product.",

Nice range, with jazz sounding pretty crisp, and hip hop sounding like hip hop should sound (i.e., that boom bap). Third, they are $40.
