IF you need a very wide lens, one of the best choices. Four stars for missing a better manual focus for night photography.

As soon as you start using it, it is near impossible to go back to your old lenses for landscapes and such. The chromatic aberration at the edges of the photos is a small concern, BUT, the feature designed to remove that in editing programs works very well, along with handling the other distortions that come from using a wide angle. So in conclusion, absolutely buy the lens, but have your correction software ready for a quick easy fix.",

The build quality is just fine for a Polycarbonate body. Very high quality and VERY light. I like that. The lens is exceedingly sharp. Is it the fastest lens out there? NO. But who cares for this price. If you look around on the net, you will see this lens gets nothing but rave reviews and it consistently rated higher than it's competitors costing over twice as much. If you're looking for a wide angle lens BUY THIS!",

I tried higher ISO and lower F-stops but the pictures were too noisy, I didn't even try taking pictures on low light. Maybe with a tripod I could had lowered the shooter speed enought to get good pictures.",
