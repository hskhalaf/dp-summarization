      "verdict": "The CVO version of the vintage Keds Champion Leather has remained genuine to its ancestor by delivering comfort and conservative yet stylish kick that could be mixed and matched with any attire. It features all the classic elements with enhanced durability and versatility yet Keds fell short in updating this shoe's mediocre arch support. Nonetheless, most buyers and bystanders still admire the classic look of the Keds Champion Leather CVO that displays only the essentials.",

        "A large percentage of the reviewers highly recommended this kick to their peers",
        "Quite a few reviewers suggested the Keds Champion Leather CVO for the all-day use",
        "The lightness of this model has been praised several times in the review section",
        "A couple of ladies admired the slim profile of this footwear that gives a slender illusion of their feet",

However I think I wore them a bit too much, as all day on my feet wore literally right through the bottom of them (you could see my footprint through the bottom for a long while before it went) and the base came apart and let water in after about 4 months of use. As an occasional shoe I don't have an issue but not sturdy enough for lots of walking!",

The cvo leather makes them look quite ugly - maybe in a material version they would look better because I do generally like Keds. Quite disappointed with these as they turned out not to be my style at all so gave them away after all.",
