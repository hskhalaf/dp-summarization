The fingers already have holes in them making them pretty much useless. (I covered the holes with duct tape in the pic so I could try and use them, but it didn't work) They are marketed as tough gloves, but they just don't last. I would not purchase them again and I would return them if I could. But of course I'm already past the return period. Also, I think I have average size hands and the extra large seemed very tight.",

Plus as some other reviewers pointed out they fit a bit snug but that's actually prefect because I sure as hell don't want 100 lb and heavier dumbbells slipping out my hands. Also those gloves are very sturdy so I don't see them wearing out anytime soon. I wish I brought those gloves first instead of those fingerless workout gloves that I now trashed.

The stitching is coming out though from being snagged by the runners as I grind them. The top of the glove is a nice breathable material.

It's a shame, because these would be great gloves otherwise, but I don't expect them to last very long. Update: these gloves lasted me 6 months of daily use, which is honestly longer than I expected.

    "title": "Ironclad Heavy Utility Work Gloves HUG, High Abrasion Resistance, Performance Fit, Durable, Machine Washable, Large",
    "description": "Size:LargeHigh-tech synthetic materials offer increased protection without losing dexterity. Ironclad gloves mold to your hands and won't ever lose their shape, even after washing. Breathable and durable, Ironclad gloves come in task-specific models to meet any challenge. All feature hook and loop cuff closures except for Cold Condition\u00a9, which has a high-performance neoprene cuff. Cuff Material: Neoprene, Material: Synthetic material, Pairs (qty.): 1, Size: L, Color: Black/Gray\n\nAMAZON.COM\nIronclad has given hands a new lease with their high-tech approach to glove design. Ironclad gloves are made to protect workers' hands better than other work gloves, without feeling clumsy the way so many work gloves can. The first thing we noticed about these gloves is that they're tailored to fit the natural curve hands have in a resting position, rather than being cut straight, so when the hand isn't working, it can actually relax without the glove pulling the fingers in an uncomfortable direction. The palm of this general-utility glove is made of Amara, a synthetic material that mimics the resilience, grip, and comfort of suede while remaining machine-washable and resistant to water damage. High-wear areas are reinforced with tough DuraClad fabric, making these the toughest-grip gloves we've ever worn. The fingertips are also reinforced, yet we had no problem with dexterous tasks like picking up coins. We also like the cut of the cuff on these gloves. It comes in tight to the wrist to prevent dirt or other materials from pouring in. Why so many other gloves have gaping cuff designs is a mystery. While the gloves themselves won't be damaged by water, they won't keep your hands dry for long if you're working in really wet conditions. But that can be said of most work gloves, and everything considered, Ironclad gloves are some of the toughest, most comfortable, and easiest-to-work-in gloves we've tried. --Brian Trinen\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nIronclad's Heavy Utility HUG-04-L is extra durable and is rugged. Our most popular glove has been updated and made even better. A long wearing, tough utility glove with amazing tactile feel and dexterity. Now with additional knuckle protection and reinforced palm areas that are stronger and more flexible than ever, this is one tough glove. Not to mention, they are completely washable, just like every other Ironclad glove. For best results machine wash and hang dry. Ideal for construction, material hadling, demolition, landscaping, forestry, handling lumber, and cable & wire work.\n\nSee more",
