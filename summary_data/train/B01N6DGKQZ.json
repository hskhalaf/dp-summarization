I work with a bunch of men at a greenhouse, so my pumping room was a meager accommodation to say the very least. This bag kept things tidy, organized and uncomplicated in my tiny pumping microcosm. The time that I saved by not having to unpack and dig around for things allowed me to spend the maximum time actually pumping, without ruining my relationship with my mostly misogynist coworkers.",

I can easily fit my Spectra pump in one bottom section and my medela cooler in the other bottom section. I can also fit my Erin Condren planner as well as a letter size accordion file full of paperwork in the side pockets. It's the only bag I take to work now since the top section is big enough to hold all of my purse-related needs.",

The large top area has my nursing bra, phalanges, wipes etc. The other side compartment is large enough for an iPad/ thin laptop and some files.

What stands out about this bag besides its sturdy quality is the pockets. With most pump bags, you can't put much in it because of the pocket for the cooler/pump leaving the middle shallow. Although this bag has the same issue, it has a side pocket for a laptop/notebook, giving me the full depth of the bag. Awesome quality! Stands on its own. Elegant and professional looking. Easy zippers!",

The zippers were also tough to close and seemed cheaply made. Luckily I found the Dr Brown Bag and although I\u2019d like it in black, it\u2019s a much more functional option.",

It was a bit of a splurge but my wife seems to absolutely love it. I was most concerned about the size of it after it arrived as she is a small woman, but she doesn't seem to mind as it fits everything she needs and more. She has an Ameda pump that sits easily in the lower compartment along with her cooler bag. Money well spent....major husband brownie points earned!",

It is very well constructed, sturdy, and stylish in an understated way. I love all of the gold accents. The bottom compartments are perfect for my pump on one side and my 4-bottle cooler bag in the other. For size reference I have the Medela Sonata Pump. Highly recommend this bag- cheaper than many of its competitors and worth every penny.",

    "description": "Size:MiniABOUT CHARLIE G BAGS\n\nInspired by her daughter Charlotte, the company was founded in 2016 by Kristi Geronimo, a working mother who was looking for a better solution to her daily pumping schedule. Tired of carrying multiple bags that didn\u2019t serve her purpose, she created the New Yorker specifically to serve as an all-in-one professional style tote that would blend in seamlessly in her professional and social circles. \n\n \nWHY THE NEW YORKER?\n\nDESIGN - The intuitive layout allows for four separate compartments so you never lose your items in a bottomless bag again. Two insulated lower zipper accessed compartments for housing a portable breast pump and cooler. A large central upper compartment for storing additional personal and baby items. Oversized slide pocket to accommodate small lap, ipad or documents. \n\n PREMIUM QUALITY - The New Yorker is made of 100% premium Cordura nylon, providing for an ultra durable and easy to clean bag. Additionally, the all-metal gold colored hardware and premium YKK zippers add style and sophistication while the oversized handles and 2\u201d cross-body strap make this a dream to carry. \n\n UNIVERSAL PUMP COMPATIBILITY - Designed to fit all portable mass market pumps, including Medela Pump in Style (with or without a case) and Freestyle, Hygeia, Freemie, Spectra, Ardo and Ameda. Can be carried over the shoulder by the large drop handles or cross-body utilizing the 2\u201d oversized strap. \n\n\n100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE\n\nOur promise that you will be completely satisfied with the quality and functionality of the New Yorker. Buy with confidence and give a new mother the confidence to pump in style!",
