My favorite (before these) were the ONE Maple Donut, but the have artificial sweeteners like sucralose so I searched for an alternative and found these. HOLY COW these are amazing! They are reaaally sticky, but totally worth it! The bar is softer than other thought quest bars I\u2019ve had in the past and there are little pockets of syrup and little wafflelike pieces throughout. Seriously didn\u2019t expect much but I am blown away with these. My boyfriend loves them too! Now keep in mind they are very sweet, but this definitely tastes like a cheat meal and it is NOT!",

It definitely tastes better than any other brand's birthday cake flavor, which I've always hated. These were the cheapest bars available at the time so I decided to take a chance on them and was pleasantly surprised, especially based on my prior experiences with other brands. I've ordered three total boxes and all three have been fresh and very soft. If these go on sale again, I'll definitely buy more.",

Think - a child smothered their waffles in margarine and syrup, ate their waffles, then the leftover liquid dried up...that's atune to eating this.",

The additional sweetener makes them too sweet and leaves a bad aftertaste. (Some people won't mind the stevia so obviously, your mileage may vary. I will admit, it's mild and I'm extra sensitive to it.) The texture takes some getting used to: it's a bit like dried out chewing gum. I could get used to this for the whopping 20g protein in each bar. But because of the stevia, I'm going hunting for an alternative.",
