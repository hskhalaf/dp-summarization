An RTX 2060, 16gb RAM and a sleek white case to go with my white corsair gear seemed pretty cool! Well, I got the box today, looking forward to enjoy my day off playing on my new PC, and found that it's some crummy, ugly black case with a gtx1660. I'm extremely disappointed and my Sunday plan is ruined. Don't buy from Skytech as they apparently don't know how to ship out product.",

Case is pure white in color, not eggshell or some other off white. There's also a screen filter on the bottom fans that's a nice addition. You can prob build this for $150 less, but the compromise is worth it if you don't have the time (like me). Recommended.",

The InWin case has a place for them behind the back cover, but the wire for the power button and HDD LED was stretched across one of them. I re-routed the wire and I'll get those drives in before long. Easy fix. I definitely recommend this PC for any gamer or content creator!",

Other than that, I cannot complain with this beautiful and very high functioning build. Definitely worth the money!",

I noticed many people mentioned that the GFX Card can vary in brand and EVGA in my opinion is one of the better brands. I have not had experience with Tech Support, however, the desktop came with support page and support app on the desktop. There was also no bloatware - this is a major plus, as I always usually have to remove all of this.",

Handles any games (1st party RPGS, MMO's, FIFA, COD, etc.) at high FPS well. The PC case itself and clean interior build provides easy access for upgradability. Specs are the best you're going to get for this price point in a pre-built that I've seen. Perfect fit for someone just getting into PC gaming that doesn't want to build their own! Would recommend purchasing an external hard drive though (can find them for around $50 on Amazon) since you'll fill up the 500G SSD quickly.",
