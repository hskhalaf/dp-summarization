Once I took it out I thought there is no way this big blanket will fit back in that tiny bag but in second it was all safely tucked back in the bag. The bag is attached to the blanket which is a great idea. There is also an attached zipper pouch which was a nice addition. We are very pleased with this blanket!",

Instead, it's expected that the wind carries the sand off of the blanket since it's made out of a silky material versus a cotton towel. By the end of our day, there were pockets of sand all over it. I'm not sure we'd go to the beach on a windy day though. Either way, it's much nicer having this rather than big towels that collect more sand.",

Better off reusing old bedsheet believe me",

Cons: It's a bit difficult to get rid of sand from the pockets, also it's super thin- it will be only be comfortable on top of fine sand or other smooth surfaces.

      "text": "This is a very BRIGHT and thin blanket, and it made beach strollers stop for a longer glance. I purposely put water and sand on it to see if it was worth it\u2019s price. The water trickled around and the wet sand sifted about. I did not try to sit and wait to watch the wet sand (see if it seeped through the blanket) because it was HOT, so I ran back into the ocean. Be careful with clearing the area as this beach blanket resembles a silk sheet - May be pierced by sharp objects.",

I bought it to take to the beach and when the winds kicked in the stakes did not hold down the blanket. They are simply not long enough; the hook barely stays attached to the corners. So, after my second use a stake was gone into the sand and couldn't be found. I bought more heavy duty stakes to use and now it works for me. Yes, I would buy it again, but I'd also buy replacement stakes at the same time.",

      "text": "Blanket is great and serves it's purpose. Nice and big, light but durable, easy to fold, and easy to travel with. Gave only a 4 star because the \"aluminum\" anchors to hold the ends in place are not strong enough and bend easily. If you are in just sand, they pull up or move and in grass/dirt, top of stake is not long enough to step on and push in, and when you can with your hand or foot, they bend very easily. Seems like the manufacturer would have made them a harder metal and the top longer for ease of usage.",

I had different expectations when understanding how the blanket doesnt collect sand. I had to lift one side of the blanket and the sand that collected slid off. Pretty easy, but I was thinking it would \"sift\" the sand.",
