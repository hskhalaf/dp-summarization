      "text": "I've done woodworking for 50 years and am pretty good with hand tools, but this is an amazing timesaver, and can be used with a lot of finesse. I got this to clean up some large beams (6\" X 12\") that were too heavy and unwieldy to put through my stationary planer, and the results were exceptional. This planer also slices through end grain like butter and leaves a smooth result with no tear-out. Once you get used to it, you can use it on other than straight or flat surfaces: I used it to cleanup some shallow curves that I had bandsawed on the beams.",
