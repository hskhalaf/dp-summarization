The WiFi also works great, where we were able to look at the images on our high resolution tablet while having coffee with no need for cables or any other devices. The battery charging mechanism also is great, since you can use a computer if you don't have your charger with you. The image quality, dynamic range, bracketing options, included filters and film simulation modes make it a great fun camera to learn the basics of photography in a very small package. I highly recommend it if it is within your budget range.",

If you do not have an IPhone 5S then you might like this small, easy to use camera. The advantage to this camera is that it has an optical zoom which the IPhone does not. The IPhone has only a digital zoom. It is because of this limitation that I keep looking for a replacement camera. So far I have found nothing in a reasonable price range.",

Pros: - Color rendition - Well built; doesn't feel cheap - 2/3\" Sensor size - Wi-Fi Connectivity - The manual focusing ring (my favorite) - Price: bought it for $120 bucks on a lightning deal here in amazon.",

It\u2019s easy to use, very responsive, and really powerfull as far as image quality is concerned for a \u00ab point & shoot \u00bb cam. Thanks to the clear lens, you can get great shoots in low light conditions, especially at wide angle. Body is well built and commands are easy to customise. In my opinion, it beats Nikon\u2019s P330/340 as well as Canon\u2019s S120 and other P&S in the range of highly pocketable cameras. Sony\u2019s RX100 has even better image quality in general, but has no wide angle lens, and is less responsive...",

A touch screen would have been nice, but I find the controls easy to use. I've tried MANY pocketable cameras, and this is the best one I've found so far.",

    "title": "Fujifilm XQ1 12MP Digital Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackXQ1 Digital Camera with 12.0 MP 2/3\" X-Trans II CMOS Sensor with Phase Detection and EXR Processor II.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n * High image quality of the FUJIFILM X-Series in a pocket size\n * Maximum resolution and description power with the bright F1.8 lens and \"Lens Modulation Optimizer\" function.\n * A comfortable high speed response at the world's fastest 0.06 seconds*\n * Elaborate and high-quality trimmed body design and control ring\n * Wireless transmission capable through the touch of a separate button, without ID and Password\n\nSensor: 2/3-inch \"X-Trans CMOS II\"ser\nEffective Pixels: 12M\nLCD Monitor: 3.0-inch (920K-dot)\nSensitivity: ISO 12800\n\nDESIGN\nSUPERB BUILD QUALITY\nAvailable in solid black and solid silver, the FUJIFILM XQ1's all-metal body is of the highest quality. With a stylish upper control deck, the black body has a crepe touch, while the silver body is fully anodized with a single tone finish matching the upper control deck. This high quality texture lets users feel the joy of holding the camera in their hands.\n\nBEAUTY\nX-SERIES IMAGE QUALITY\nTo maximize the power of the lens, Fujifilm has removed the optical low-pass filter from its X-Trans\u2122** CMOS II sensor. In addition, the camera features a \"Lens Modulation Optimizer,\" which minimizes diffraction and chromatic aberrations by digitally processing images to improve sharpness and clarity. Extraordinary resolution can be experienced with simple shooting in JPEG format.\n\nLARGE 2/3-INCH X-TRANS CMOS II SENSOR\nFeaturing Fujifilm's bespoke pixel array, the FUJIFILM XQ1 captures high quality images with its large 2/3-inch X-Trans CMOS II sensor. And you'll be able to enjoy high-speed continuous photography and Full HD movie shooting thanks to the high OLPF-less architecture and 2/3-inch 12M X-Trans CMOS II sensor processing capture your world with crystal clarity.\n\nOriginally developed by Fujifilm for the FUJIFILM XQ1, the 2/3-inch X-Trans CMOS II sensor inherits the same architecture and features of the high performance sensor found in the acclaimed FUJIFILM X-Pro1 flagship model. Adoption of BSI (backside illumination) technology enables the successful incorporation of phase detection pixels into the array without affecting sensitivity performance- the key to FUJIFILM XQ1's high-speed AF.\n\nADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND PROCESSING HELP TRANSFER THE POWER OF THE LENS INTO TRUE TO LIFE PHOTOS.\nX-Trans CMOS II adopts an original color filter array with a highly random pattern, eliminating the need for an optical low-pass filter (OLPF), which is used in conventional systems to inhibit moir\u00e9 at the expense of resolution. This lets the sensor directly capture the high resolution performance of the FUJIFILM XQ1 lens. Also exploiting the enhanced performance of the EXR Processor II, Lens Modulation Optimizer (LMO) factors are calculated to compensate for aberrations and diffraction blur that occur when light passes through the lens and then are applied to produce images with amazing sharpness.\n\nBRIGHT F1.8 LENS\nThe FUJIFILM XQ1 features a Fujinon 4x optical zoom that covers 25-100mm***. The adoption of highly-refractive aspherical lenses facilitates the F1.8 brightness at the widest point. Clear images are captured even in low-light thanks to 3.0-stop* 4 image stabilization and multi-layer coating technology unique to Fujinon.\n\nSETTING\nEASY SETTING SELECTION VIA THE CONTROL RING\nThe control ring offers operability similar to analog cameras. You can set your preferred functionality in advance and then use the control ring to finely adjust settings, without going to the menu screen. The user can set functions such as the aperture, exposure compensation and ISO of their choice.\n\nCONTROL RING THAT LETS YOU OPERATE WITH YOUR INSTINCTS IN BOTH AUTO AND MANUAL MODES.\nThe control ring around the lens mount can be customized to 1 of 13 settings in advance. This makes it feel more like analog camera. Functions can be set with the E-Fn button on the back. If it is set to \"Default\", it will automatically choose the setting recommended for whichever mode you are in.\n\nParameters displayed on the LCD screen directly reflect ring operation for intuitive operation. With original operating tones, users enjoy sophisticated and comfortable use of the camera every time.\n\nCAPTURE\nTHE WORLD'S FASTEST PHASE DETECTION AF SPEED OF 0.06 SECONDS* THAT CAPTURES ANY PHOTO OPPORTUNITY.\nIntegration of phase detection pixels into the advanced sensor. The world's fastest AF speed of 0.06 seconds* has been achieved with the on-sensor phase detection AF which brings subjects into focus in an instant with the phase detection sensor. Thanks to the synergy of phase detection AF and contrast AF bringing you precision even in low light, your subject can be captured quickly and accurately in many settings. In AF-C mode, once the focus point has been set, the movements of the subject will be accurately tracked, offering you multiple photo chances.**\n\nDOUBLE THE PROCESSING SPEED OF A CONVENTIONAL IMAGE PROCESSOR - EXR PROCESSOR II\nThe high-performance image processing engine \"EXR Processor II\" has sped up the shooting response time. With a start-up time of 0.99 seconds, shooting interval of 0.3 seconds*** and shutter time lag of 0.015 seconds, response performance competitive to that of DSLR cameras supports smooth photography.\n\nMAXIMUM HIGH-SPEED CONTINUOUS SHOOTING SPEED OF 12.0 FPS (MAX. APPROX. 9 FRAMES)\nHigh-speed continuous shooting that lets you capture both movement and your best shot possible.\n\nSHARE\nEFFORTLESS AND WIRELESS CAMERA-TO-SMARTPHONE PHOTO TRANSFER.\nYou can easily transfer images wirelessly from the FUJIFILM XQ1 to your smartphone or tablet after installing the free FUJIFILM Camera Application app. There are no troublesome ID and password settings; just press the Wi-Fi button of the top of the camera and then add the images instantly to your blog or share them with friends on your social networking site.
