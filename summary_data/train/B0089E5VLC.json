It's setup where smaller fish like tetras and guppies can get sucked into it. They are too big to go all the way into the system, but they get stuck and if you aren't right there when it happens then they can't get free and die. I love how sleek the aquarium is, but it's time for a better system.",

Probably spend more time watching this tank that any other I have. Update 2/2/2017: Bumped this up to 5 stars. I really like this aquarium. Now that it is fully cycled maintenance is once every 7 to 9 days. Plants are doing very well and fish/shrimp are excellent.",

I greatly regret getting this aquarium. I must now decide if I'll start from scratch or if I'll cut out the internal filter and add in a new filter.

I need to move the top aside to do this because the light bar covers the opening in the top of the aquarium.

It may not be bright, but it is stunning in a dark room. Don't hesitate to buy this winner.",

I read alot of reviews before purchasing the Hydor 50 watt submersiible glass heater and had no problem fitting them snugly along the water pump. I cycled both tanks in one day using Tetra Safe Start Plus after following instructions from Tetra customer service. Zeus and Sammy love their new homes. The reason for 4 stars is the semi open top cover, water evaporates faster and dust particles accummulate requiring maintenance every couple of days.",

I recommend to place a Fluval Pre-Filter on the intake pump for the Betta fish. Even though the flow is low, it is still too strong for sensitive Betta fish. The filter sponge is very easy to maintain (just clean in old tank water-keeping the good bacteria). Easily decorate to desire (favorite part), add small heater inside by intake pump, and add aquarium fish. Highly recommended and will purchase Fluval Aquarium tanks in the future!!",

    "description": "Color:Black| Product Packaging:Standard Packaging\n\nFluval SPEC is a contemporary looking aquarium designed for small areas such as desktops and countertops. This 5-gallon etched glass aquarium with aluminum trim combines style and functionality in one small package. Though small in stature, Fluval SPEC is big on features. It comes with a sleekly designed overhanging LED lighting system, consisting of 37 powerful LED lamps, that arches above the aquarium to provide brilliant illumination for plants and d\u00e9cor. The aquarium includes a powerful circulation pump with adjustable output nozzle and a large 3-stage filtration system that provides more than enough filtration for ultra clean and clear water. It also comes with all the necessary filter media for effective and thorough mechanical, chemical and biological filtration: a porous foam block with convenient handle traps large particles and debris, activated carbon adsorbs unwanted odors, discolorations and impurities and BioMax insert provides optimal colonization of beneficial bacteria and enhances the nitrification of fish wastes. The pump and filtration system are conveniently located in a separate chamber at one end of the aquarium to simplify maintenance. To ensure the well-being of aquarium inhabitants, it is essential to maintain your aquarium. At the very minimum, remove 20% of the water once a week and replace with tap water that is of similar temperature to your tank and treated with the correct dose of Nutrafin Aqua Plus. Regular replacement of Fluval filter media is essential to ensure optimum performance. The filter media should be changed alternately in order to maintain continuous biological activity. To enhance bacterial action, pour a dose of Nutrafin Cycle onto your filter inserts each time you change the media.",
