      "text": "Easy, flawless installation on first attempt. Picture on TV is beautiful 1080p HD. The Wally works just like our Hopper does at home, so there is no \"learning\" curve at all. Antenna is light weight, yet sturdy. We set it up on the tripod we purchased along with the antenna, made sure the handle was pointing north, and it found all three western arc satellites as promised. It took approximately 30 minutes from set up to TV watching what with all the software downloading. IN short, very pleased.",

On Further Edit: As we got to doing more traveling with this dish we have found that the Wally receiver that came with it in this package deal will only support this dish on a 25 foot RG6 cable hooked direct to the receiver. Any more than that and it will not hold the dish on the sat. We changed back to the V211 and it is working fine on over 50 foot of cable. X2 is great Wally is very poor to work the dish.",
