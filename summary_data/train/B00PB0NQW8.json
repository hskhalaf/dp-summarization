I have adapted these and the bottom elastic links to clip on and off with 24 small aluminium carabiners. Maybe velcro would have been better at the top edges. If you get the separate sidewall set too, there is no side with an opening or zip or flap. It does construct well with a bit of common sense, although we forgot the weatherproof clear flap at the apex, do had to top it on its side to attach the three hooks.",

Providing you have a bit of common sense then you can have the thing up in about 20 minutes or so. It is quite sturdy but has not yet been subjected to wind or a big downfall of rain so I can't speak to how it would stand up to this.",

On putting up the canopy which was easy to do I discovered a stain on the inside of the canopy (first picture). This could not been seen from the outside (second picture), which I found strange. I can only assume that this product has either been an ex-display model or used before. I would urge anyone buying this product to assemble before use. I have missed the deadline to send back, but would like the supplier to acknowledge this review. As for the product itself is was good and easy to put up.",
