They didn't charge my card a second time for the replacement, I had only to return the damaged one within 30 days or they would have. That was more than fair and I love that this closes by weighted door verses some sort of magnet or catch. Nothing to go wrong with this one! It's very sleek and is exactly as pictured. I would absolutely buy this item again.",
