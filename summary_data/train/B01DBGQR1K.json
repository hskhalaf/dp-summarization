The end product is so much better than you can buy in a store. I would honestly say that the spaghetti cutter has left my pasta looking a little more like ramen, but hey fresh ramen works too. I think if you really want to do spagetti right you will likely need a drying rack. I love the sheet roller and the fettuccine cutter they work perfect. I would recommend these attachments to anyone that owns a KitchenAid. This has to be one of my favorite tools in the kitchen.",

No pieces fold out or detach to more easily reach for cleaning.

There is no Al Dente bite but still it was excellent even with the soft texture from the eggs and freshness. Was a very good carbonara. Made so many noodles that I froze some. Making a half batch next time. Next gyoza skins for pot stickers and mayve ravioli. I'll get the hang of the drying rack",

The box appeared to be re-taped, the inside of box was not crisp as in new, And the rollers can't be turned without a lot of force and make a scraping sound. It appears to me that this was a returned unit because it did not work and had numerous finger prints on it. Bait and Switch, or simply a mistake?",
