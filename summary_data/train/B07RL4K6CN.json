Only complaint is I purchased 2 Skytech computers recently and the RAM was wrong on both orders. One was missing an 8g stick and one was 2400 instead of 3000.

The tower isn't super-huge which is nice and the internals are easy to access with a tempered-glass thumb screw door. It operates extremely quietly and stays very cool. Two thumbs up.",

Currently I'm unable to use dual monitors as a section of ports connected to the motherboard don't work at all. I had to buy a VGA to USB adapter just to get my second monitor to work, but the graphics card does not support it, resulting in constant flickering, app crashing or apps moving between monitors. I tried redownloading drivers, reducing resolution, troubleshooting my system and BIOS, nothing worked. After spending this kind of money, I would expect the PC to have complete fully working ports at least. Wish I hadn't purchased this, useless for dual monitors/streaming purposes.",

I'm happy to say at competivtive settings I average over 110 FPS (4k) in both games and I am quite impressed by this. The fans are not too loud on silent mode, the power usage isn't insane, the performance is just as expected, easy to setup, etc. In terms of value for money, of course any pre-built will cost more than it costs to build yourself. Accounting for all the parts there is around a $30 differential. However a keyboard and mouse are included with the pc which closes the margin and makes it a 'bang for your buck'",

THERE IS ONLY 1 ACTIVE HDMI PORT, make sure you have display-port cables/adapters if using multiple monitors. The only downside, and this is really picky, is that the side glass is on the left and it is not possible to switch it to the right(without a ridiculous amount of work) if you get a new desk setup.",
