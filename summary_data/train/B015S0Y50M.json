      "text": "Installed my two 3GB WD RED drives with little difficulty and switched on to a loud noise. After a while the noise reduced but was still totally unacceptable. The unit was a factory refurbished one which should have been checked before being sold. Seems fairly clear that the fan was on the way out, the WD drives were silent in my previous NAS. I let the syncing process run in the hope that the noise would cease but no luck. When the OS was up I selected each of the three different fan modes but none of them made any difference. Returned for a refund.",

Only running a single drive so far (which might be speeding up write speeds) but managing 100MB/s write, which is the max of the single connection. Shares are much easier to set up the whole GUI is much improved (as you'd expect after 10years!) Very pleased with the redundancy and volume offered from a 4bay system.",

The Netgear ReadyNAS devices may not have as many \"bells and whistles\" as some competitors but this really isn't a problem. Just be aware that building a 24TB RAID 5 volume (using X-Raid configuration) takes the best part of 24 hours, I don't see there's any way out of this (my ReadyNAS 104 with 4x4TB drives takes over 3 days).",

It seems to be settling down now, but keep a separate backup of your data in case off loss.",

All browser attempts to communicate with the device go into a loop- no matter what option I take. Total fail - terribly disappointed.",

I opened a ticket with Netgear and they replied not our fault contact Plex. In any case the product should be removed from Amazon as it falsely advertised it's capabilities. And Netgear should offer a refund or a replacement. It's a lot of money to pay for something that is totally useless apart from a glorified external HDD. DO NOT BUY",
