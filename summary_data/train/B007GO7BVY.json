      "text": "I've been buying Fossil watches for over a decade now and own about a dozen of them so I know the quality of the brand. This particular watch is stunning. I've never bought a gold toned watch but this one caught my eye and it is stunning in person. It doesn't look like faux gold and actually it is more of a color changer that looks silver-ish in certain light and then looks gold-ish in lower light. Definitely my new favorite watch !",

This style watch was also available at Macy's but at a more expensive price so I was extremely happy to find this watch on Amazon at a lesser cost. I did have to take the watch in to Fossil to remove some of the links to fit my wrist. (I'm a woman. I like the big face, men's watches.) Everything on the watch is functional and I've not had any complaints.",

Not bothering to send for repair again as I will have to pay for it. We\u2019ve always loved Fossil brand but really disappointed in this watch.",

Looked exactly like pictures and seemed 100% authentic from the box it came in and the fact it was still in the plastic wrap inside the box. However when we went to go get it fitted to his arm the jeweler said it was already missing one of its links, thus the watch would be uneven on one side causing it to drift to one side. The jeweler was questioning where i bought it from which made me a bit embarrassed that i may have bought an unauthentic or repackaged watch. My boyfriend however didn't mind at all and still loves it.",

While turning the crown to forward set the time, no issues. However, I over set the time and needed to roll back the minute hand to set it correctly. However when I turned the crown the opposite direction, the crown itself became dislodged from the watch. Next time I will buy from the store at the mall. Luckily, I had free return. I shipped the broken watch back today.",

Yes I still have the others, so I bought this and the moment I felt it my hands I knew something changed. This one feels cheaper and lighter than all of the others. Buyer beware, if you have owned one of these dean watches you will know they either cut corners on the band or are using a different viscosity of metal but it is 10000% not the same.",

It arrived quickly and was very nicely packaged! The watch itself looked beautiful. As it was a gift, I cannot say anything else about the quality of it. My son seemed very pleased with it.",
