      "text": "This thing is awesome! I bought it because I was tired of sweeping up cat litter surrounding my cats litter box. The strength of this vacuum is incredible. It sucks the litter up with no problem what so ever. The quality of the vacuum is superb. The only thing I can see some people complain about (doesn't bother me) is how loud this unit is. When turned on, it is fairly loud, but I bought it strictly to pick up cat litter so i typically don't use it for more than 40 seconds at a time. Oh and I also love that it is corded so I don't need to worry about charging/bad batteries in the future.",

We have not used the brush, but the extender we use to get corners of the cage. I supposed this would be very useful for cleaning hard to reach areas like cushions as well. All in all very useful for us and I'd buy it again. [...]",

Nice long power cord - Between just 2 outlets I can reach pretty much anywhere in my apartment. Chose this over a rechargeable because most rechargeables have weak suction, poor battery life & short usable time before needing recharged.

      "text": "I bought this based off the rave reviews here; what a disappointment! This lasted a few years before it completely stopped working, but even while it did work I was very annoyed with it's very weak suction. If you wanted a handheld vacuum with good suction, don't get this. This has what I'd call a basic lite suction. Another con is that the pieces that attach keep feeling off and seem to weaken the suction even more. Pros: it's versatile and has a long plug.",

Be sure to order an extra filter, as it gets pretty dirty with rabbits. It is pretty loud, so if your rabbits are skittish, be cautious, or make sure they are out of the room.",

I haven't bothered to stock up on filters for this one, just in case.
