      "text": "I don't even know why I hadn't bought this sooner. We are a family of 5 and lugging around 5 chairs is not fun. This chair makes my life so much easier. It's simple yet efficient design allows you to fold it up like an accordion and put it in the bag it comes with and send you on your way in less than 2 minutes. Every time I fold or unfold this chair people ask me where I got it and how awesome it is. I have to agree. This is a great product. Definitely worth every penny.",

It is perfect for the kiddos but is not really comfortable for larger adults. I had to sit in the end to be more comfortable. Has held up well through half a soccer season and I expect will last much longer. Would buy again when this is no longer usable.",

No quality concerns so far and the bag is easy to load and carry onto the field. Adding a bench to the sideline was a great way to help keep 7 year olds contained. Before the bench they would bounce around and spill onto the field cheering, but now they stay a little more contained. The 4-seater was good. We have 8 players and 4 on the field at once so it has been plenty.",
