I'm posting here to add that (once you upgrade to the 1.5 firmware) this router works great with BOTH X-Box Live and Nintendo Wi-Fi with no additional setup. I even enabled WEP and there were no problems connecting to either service, all I had to do was enter the WEP key on the Nintindo DS and it was ready to go. Be you a router configuring expert or a novice, you'll find this router meets and exceeds all your needs.",

Thanks Dlink! Sincerely, Ira Carmel. Edit; I had this router stacked under a Dlink Switch of the same footprint and it overheated and eventually started rebooting every 30 seconds.

I have had tons of issues with Linksys, especially their client software which is just hideous, which is why I researched and switched to this combination. You can't go wrong with these two!",

This has been the easiest router I have set up yet. I have had zero down time, with the exception of when configuring some settings that require a reboot. I would recommend this router for anyone who wants gigabit lan speeds and a stable wireless connection. The only thing this device lacks is the new 802.11n specs, and that's no big deal because of the built in MIMO system that gives you the higher speeds with other D-Link devices.",

      "text": "My experience is not as good as the majority of other reviewers. The product was difficult to install and the first rep was unhelpful. Once it became clear that he was not able to help with the problem, he hanged up... The second call was more successful albeit the critical help was provided from the DSL provider. The problem turned out to be that the DSL model already had router functions that had to be disabled. Now the router works well.",
