      "text": "Love this product. Packaging was very will done. Unit replaced a manual three way HDMI switch which required getting up and going to the tv to change. Has six small led status lights that remain on; power light, plus five HDMI status, one out and four in. With all cables hooked up the power on is red, HDMI out is green, the HDMI ports lights will show either red or if selected blue. The one critique I would make of their design is matching up the remote control buttons which are labeled IN1,IN2, IN3, IN4 to the box stratus lights is HDMI port 1 is to the far right.",

I called amazon tech support and was informed a replacement will be sent. I received the replacement 24 hrs later and tested it out with devices on this time. The replacement was really not necessary because an error was made on my part. In summary the product is positive. When Interconnected devices are powered on the input Led for each device is red. When u select the input, the led turns blue.",

The picture-in-picture feature is cool, at first, but it's really nothing more than a gimmick. So, don't buy it based on this single feature alone. I currently have an Xbox One S, a laptop (via thunderbolt dock) and a nintendo switch. As for the display, it's a Lenovo 23-inch computer monitor with an auxiliary output for sound. As a single person living in a small apartment this is truly a wonderful configuration that spares me from purchasing a dedicated TV to do nothing more than what I already do on a computer (i.e. Netflix, Hulu, etc).",

      "text": "There appears to be a design flaw. If the switch loses signal to a device connected to it, even for a second, the device has to be rebooted or reset. I had 2 of them do the same thing, when a device switched screens for more than a second the signal would drop and the switch would automatically change to another input. When I would try to go back to the original input it would not show up on the screen. I would have to reset the input device and power cycle the switch in order to restore the picture.",

I know nothing is made to last anymore but 5 months is just not acceptable. I can no longer recommend this product. ----------------------------------- I have nothing but good things to say about this switch box. Setup was flawless - plug and play. We'll see how long it lasts but at this point I'm very happy with it. It allows 4 devices to be connected to a single HDMI port on my TV at a very reasonable price. The Picture-In-Picture is a cool feature that I didn't to find at this price point.",

I plugged in all 3 of my video game systems, and so long as my TV is on the correct source, whatever gaming device I turn on, this device automatically changes to the correct input. I don't really even need the remote unless i have multiple systems playing at once. But that's hard to do using the same TV...my only concern is that having this plugged in seems to decrease the quality of my other inputs, and I don't think that's an issue with my TV.",

Input isn't recognized, it won't receive power, it won't turn on or change channels, nothing. It was short-lived, and if that's the intended life expectancy, then it is too expensive. I don't recommend if you want something that is long-lasting.",

The automatic signal detector frees you from having to manually switch the input. My only complaint (which really isn't that big) regarding the detector is that it takes about 5 seconds before it switches inputs. So far, there have been no instances where the HDMI Switch automatically switches inputs unless the console was turned on.",
