The new tire... the SAME Goodyear Wrangler is now a light duty tire capable of 35 PSI max pressure.. I am now afraid to tow my boat with this setup. Beware.... the new Goodyear Wranglers are cheap light duty tires compared to the old 44 PSI max pressure tires. I wanted the new tire to \"match\" the existing tires.

I have used these Goodyear Wrangler tires on my 1999 Jeep Wrangler Sahara since new with 3 exceptions that I regretted soon after. These tires are great for typical city and highway use. If you want an offroad tire they don't have deep lugs for wet soil or sand grip. These tires are for all-around conditions and not for extreme conditions. They ride smooth and get decent mileage. After 20 years I have learned they are superior tires for both wet and dry conditions.",

Call ahead and make sure they will mount tires bought elsewhere. Some will, some won't.

    "description": "An economic design for trucks in all weather conditions, the Wrangler Radial pickup tire from Goodyear offers an aggressive tread design that tackles wet, dry and icy conditions. The large tread blocks on Wrangler tires help ensure handling and control in a variety of conditions while the innovative anti-hydroplane technology sheds water from the tread area. Durable, reinforced rubber compounds ensure Wrangler tires resist damages from common sources. As one of the most trusted names in the tire business, Goodyear Tires has an ongoing legacy of success and a reputation for quality tires and satisfied drivers.",
