Flame control is a little odd: you have good control for a half-turn or so and then it's maxed out but you can still turn it quite a bit but it won't go higher. Max flame is good enough it just reaches it quickly on the dial. Still love it though",

I rarely need the double burner, but always hated the propane top version which could tilt and did not provide much support for the pan or pot. This is the exact opposite. Wide pan support area, solid metal construction, and super flame control. No windscreen, but I never had one anyway nor do I find them effective. Finding the right place to setup a kitchen is more important. In all, a bomber of a stove.",

Because of its size, it looks really stable. Stability is important, too, as the propane tank is attached to the side of the burner. You don't want the burner flipping up when you take the pan off, and this looks like it will definitely stay put. Coleman's burners are quite reliable, especially if you are using the throwaway coleman propane canisters. Highly recommended. I sent this back though because I was looking for something smaller.",

It should work well for car camping, or other uses needing a large portable burner.",
