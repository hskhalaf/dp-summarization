I also love that there are several ways to use this ( changing colors/no colors/one color of choice/ intermittent mode and regular mode) and it\u2019s portable ! Great product ! Inexpensive too . I got a 1.5 yr warranty also. I drive for Uber /lyft and do medical transports and sometimes have different smells such as smoke in my car ; this should help immensely :)",
