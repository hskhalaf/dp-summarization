I would send back for a second time but I have guest coming up this weekend and have no other bedding for our spare room. The first time they sent me a twin size when i ordered a queen set.",

The stripes also go the wrong way, horizontal across bed instead of vertical. Would not buy again. Updated with one less star because we returned and they took out 20% for a \u201creprocessing\u201d fee. Terrible return policy",

There were many more patches that are not photographed (I couldn't take the smell of it any longer). It was very disgusting and I do not recommend purchasing this item.",
