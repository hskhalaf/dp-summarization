Anti-frizz products are too greasy, detanglers are not enough. I have tried dozens of products over the years, various price points, none really do what I need until now. This spray makes my hair soft for the first time ever, and minimizes tangles too. After washing/conditioning, I put a few sprays in before brushing with a wet brush, then a few more once I'm done brushing. It's just fantastic!!",

The Leave-in Conditioner helps weigh down the hair if you are looking for more initial control over frizzies. I\u2019m not sure why this bottle is half the size of the Keratin Mist for around the same price, though.",

I read the reviews before ordering .and was hopeful...but the only thing good is it sprays evenly for a conditioner.... The smell is ok. It's a light citrus-type fragrance. Doesn't make you smell like pledge furniture polish at all...more like a real lemon scent.",
