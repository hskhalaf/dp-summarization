We bought it to replace the Britax seat our 3-yr-old has been in since he was an infant (we unfortunately had to replace it because the car was involved in an accident). Because we're using this for a toddler, the first thing we tried to do was move the crotch strap to the proper placement for his size. This is IMPOSSIBLE. I can't state enough--neither my husband nor I were able to get that strap through so we could move it. I feel badly for parents who bought this seat for a smaller child and had to move the crotch strap after using it for awhile. At least I can return the seat.",

On another other note- removable and waterproof car seat pads are well worth the investment for ANY car seat. Love the colors of this car seat and by comparison to the newer model? There are not enough new features to justify the more expensive purchaser of the bigger badder model. Love this one just fine! Easy assembly and install.
