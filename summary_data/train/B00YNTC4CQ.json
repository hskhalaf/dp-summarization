I was using it about 30 feet from the laser and it was picking up the signal perfectly even though I couldn't see the laser in the daylight. My only complaint would be that it is too loud and the volume dosen't go low enough. After a while it becomes very annoying so I wound up just turning the sound off. If it had a better volume control I would have given it 5 stars.",

It doesn't make sense because the laser should be what determines the range but I did seem to have a little trouble getting it to hit the farther I got from the laser. but like I said, I've only used it a couple times.",
