My seven year old daughter loved the graphic on this board and had $50 from from Christmas. Figuring that a $54 complete board was probably better than something at walmart, but cheaper than just buying a deck and essentials from a skate shop, we went ahead with it... Mistake! I have added a video of the bad side of the board. The other side spun a little better, but not much. My girl is now bummed.",

But from my point of view it seems to have very good components and seems like it's a pretty quality skateboard for the price. It arrived undamaged, but did take awhile to get here. I ordered it Aug 30th and didn't receive it until Sept 10th, which was after her birthday. That was kind of disappointing.",

      "text": "Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old girl. Her very first skateboard, and she is thrilled. I was very happy with the purchase. The board is quite large and sturdy. The top is a textured surface for good foot grip, the wheels roll very smoothly, and the graphics on the bottom side of the board are vibrant and gorgeous. If you are in the market for a girly skateboard, I think you will be very pleased with this purchase.",
