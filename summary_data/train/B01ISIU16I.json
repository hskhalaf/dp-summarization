The negative was in the shipment. The cap on the dispenser was loose and some product leaked. Not enough to return, but packaging could be a lot better. The manufacturer tried to seal the cap and plunger with some type of plastic heat wrap. Doesn\u2019t work. You may receive an intact bottle, or one like I had with some minor spillage or open the box to find the entire contents swimming with the bottle. Who knows.",
