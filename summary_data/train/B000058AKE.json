In fact, it's perfect. I used it to reheat some food and the food fit nicely. Reviews mentioned the handles were getting hot, so I was careful. Nothing happened. In the end, I believe this was the perfect purchase, perfect size and good weight for it's size. I know it will be used a lot in my household.",

I have already used it and it is exactly what I wanted to steam my carrots, broccoli, and red potatoes. I am also pleasantly surprised by the thickness of the pan. Also, I'm happy the lid is not glass. I just think everything about it is awesome. Please see my uploaded customer images.",

The inserts for s similar price didn't' hold the food above the water as much, which would allow for the boiling water to evaporate quicker.",

The steamer part works great as a colander for draining pasta, and I also use it to rinse berries or salad ingredients. I love kitchen items that are multi-purpose. My original pot had a glass lid that was great to see what was cooking, but it shattered one day. I'm happy they changed to the metal lids for safety reasons. My latest pot does show the discoloration in the bottom of the pan, but it's not a big deal to me.",

I have a healthy low- carb dinner! So easy, and some items steam within literally minutes! Great price, great product, easy clean-up! My fave!",

    "description": "Sauce it, boil it, steam it, and simmer it with the versatile Farberware Classic Stack 'N' Steam Stainless Steel Saucepot and Steamer. From lobster pot to soup pot, this multipurpose cookware combo can be used with or without the steamer insert, and boasts a full cap base featuring a thick aluminum core surrounded by stainless steel for rapid, even heating on any stovetop, including induction. Heavy-duty stainless steel is polished to a mirror finish for a classic touch and the stacking steamer pot is dishwasher safe and oven safe to 350\u00b0F.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nFunctional as well as beautiful, this 3-quart saucepot and 2-quart steamer insert are made of heavy 18/10 stainless steel polished to a mirror finish. The pot has an aluminum core in its base to spread heat quickly and evenly. The core is completely clad in stainless steel so, like the rest of the pot and the steamer, the pot bottom resists corrosion and discoloring and cleans up easily. Thick rolled rims add durability and make it possible to pour from the pot without dripping. Because the pot is 4-1/2 inches deep and comes with a tight-fitting, domed lid, it is roomy enough to simmer stocks and soups and can also be used for braising veal shanks or for cooking chili on the stovetop or in the oven. (The handles are oven-safe to 350 degrees F and stay cool on the stovetop.) The pot and steamer are dishwasher-safe and come with a lifetime warranty against defects. --Fred Brack\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy\n\nSee more",
