It smoked for 30+ minutes after dousing it with water repeatedly. I had it for 10-11 months, and there was no indication of a problem beforehand -- the brush head was working/spinning properly, and I'd cleaned the filters recently. When I reported it via \"Get Product Support\", the only (automated) response was for me to buy replacement parts. Which is funny, because I guess that means I'd need to order every part except the handle.",

They stated that the 5-year warranty only covered the motor, but on the website, it states that \"non-wearable components deemed defective\" should be replaced under this warranty. The brush roller is not a replaceable component (this seems like filters). Horrible horrible customer service!!! I will never be purchasing a Shark product again!",

We rarely cleaned the base (hair would bind up in the roller so bad), that sometimes you could smell something burning or notice a loss of suction. Then we would clean the rollers... I think after so long the motor burns out working so hard to create suction &, turn the rollers that it will burn out if not properly cleaned, monthly. The base (where the rollers are most importantly), takes the longest and I feel like is the most neglected.",

I hung the mounting bracket in a closet & store it with the power cord wrapped separate from the floor vac.
