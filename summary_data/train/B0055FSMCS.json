      "text": "For those of you who are serious about your Popovers, you need this pan. Having made them in the past using a traditional muffin/cupcake pan with mixed results, I can tell you that this product is the one you need if you like popovers. They come out perfectly with a nice tight stem and huge puffy top. Perfect. Clean up is a breeze. Just wipe out with a soapy sponge. I attribute the improved performance to both the shape of the cup and the open structure which allows for airflow all around the cup... this allows for rapid, uniform heating during the high temp, initial baking period. Highly recommended.",

They were good but they did not look like the ones in the restaurant. I found these and they are wonderful. Easy cleanup -- I can be messy -- and very well constructed. The Good Housekeeping recipe makes exactly 6 popovers and combined with a little maple flavored butter and you have a great addition to your meal. I even considered cutting off the tops and filling them with tuna salad.",
