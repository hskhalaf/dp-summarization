      "text": "I linked my HP Media Center Computer to my large screen TV which is about 40 feet away in another room. The system is linked using a Linksys WRT160N router. The picture and sound are good but there is some break-up of the picture at times. I am now recording television at a higher quality setting and this seems to help. The only problem I had with installation was getting the extender to stay linked. I am using NORTON Internet Security and this seemed to be the problem. Once I added the extender to the \"trusted\" list the linking problem disapeared. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and would buy the extender again.",

I was glad this still has composite out so I could connect it to an old CRT TV and still be able to use it when I upgrade the TV to a flat screen. The wireless works great, I tested but don't use it because I have a physical cable run to this box. UPDATE: This is still going strong. No complaints. Even connected to an old LCD and new Windows 7 computer since I wrote this review.",

Downside is I wished there was more information out there on how to setup movies and storage. It would also be nice to figure out how to incorporate the Samsung remote to work with the extender or the extender remote to work with the Samsung TV. I am sure it is all possible I just havent found the \"how to\" information yet... It is also great for displaying pictures from the laptop wirelessly through the media center to the Samsung TV.",

Now I can watch whatever I have on my PC on my TV in HD. You have to make sure you have the right type of router to use with it. Just do some research like I did and you will not have any problems. But don't think it is just plug and play unless you have the router to support it. For me it does what I wanted it to do - provided you have the the other pieces that it needs to work with.",

So I spend $20 more to get CAT6 cable and then spent 3 more hours after which he told me \"you need to contact Microsoft if you are having more problems\". I can get it to work sporatically and it is cool when it does, but unless you are very technical and have several hours to kill, I would recommend against this as a purchase!",
