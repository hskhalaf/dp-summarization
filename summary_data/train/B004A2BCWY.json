For Example, factory brake pads make the brake pedal feel more responsive, and behave like when the vehicle was new. Also learned that something as a small as a PCV valve should be a factory one because the pressure in the valve is different that an aftermarket one and makes the vehicle run properly. For the price, it just makes good sense. Highly recommended.",

If you can use these, even on non-Ford vehicles, you're better off than most non-OEM filter designs you can find at the local parts store. They're even better than select OEM brands as well. Part of the allure is that they bypass high-pressure flow from the top of the filter, rather than the bottom where the particulates lay. Very few other brands do this.",

    "description": "Oil Filter\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nMotorcraft filters are engineered to the high quality standards of the Ford Motor Company and are recommended by Ford as the original equipment replacement filter for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles. They are designed to help protect against engine wear by screening out abrasives, such as carbon, sand, dust and bits of metal before they can get into your oil. Pressure-relief valves help minimize the chance of contaminated oil circulating back into the engine and also help maintain the supply of oil to the engine under extreme cold conditions or if the filter gets clogged. The outer casings are constructed of steel, \u201cironed\u201d for a precise fit, painted to resist rust and include flutings to ease removal. The efficient filter media offers increased dirt-collecting capability and ability to capture more engine-harming particles. Silicone anti-drain back valves help prevent oil from draining out of the filter and engine when the engine is not running and resist the aging effects that an engine\u2019s high heat can cause.",
