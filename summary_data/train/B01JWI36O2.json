The cooler consists of four separate components that you assemble around your bottle/can, The fully assembled cooler is rather bulky, uncomfortable to hold and awkward drink from. The Asobu cooler does keep my drink cool-cold but definitely not frosty like I had hoped. The foam sleeve I bought at the market works just as well at a fraction of the cost. Disappointing ...",
