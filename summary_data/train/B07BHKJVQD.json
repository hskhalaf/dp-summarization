He usually wears Nike, but he wanted some to match his uniform, so he went with these. The fit seemed fine, but he was getting massive blood blisters on his toes and heels to the point that we literally gave them away after about 4 tournaments (thinking maybe they just needed to be broken in) and bought some Nikes. They look sharp, but they really hurt his feet. Disappointing.",
