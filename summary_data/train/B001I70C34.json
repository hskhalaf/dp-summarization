You set the adjustment on the nut or bolt and it stays tight. In fact you can adjust this so tight on the work you have to loosen it just so you can remove it. I really like the comfort gripe handle also. Lastly I haven't encountered a service cap or bolt size yet that this tool can't handle. Great Tool, Channellock got this baby right.",

I mainly use it for adjusting leveling bolts because we have a wide range of sizes and they dont need a lot of force to be turned so using a really big adjustable wrench is overkill. I have had many coworkers ask me where I found this wrench after using it. The only down fall of this wrench is the comfortable handle. While the handle is comfortable the grip will become loose and try and slip off the metal handle. It can simply be pushed back on but it is a little annoying.",

The jaws on this wrench were a little thicker than the wrench that was stolen, but they seem to work well enough for my purpose.",

      "text": "If you have only one adjustable wrench, this should be it. The jaws are long, narrow, pointy, and STRONG. There is very minimal play in the worm gear. The finish is excellent, no flaking or chipping. The handle is grippy, and well padded. The whole works cleans up easily, restoring to a like-new condition every time. I love this wrench, and get loads of comments at work.",

Longer jaws grip better, avoiding slippage or nut round off. Measurement scales (in. on front mm. on reverse) are handy for sizing nuts, pipe and tube diameters. Greater jaw capacity supports larger nuts and bolts. Thinner jaws for greater access in tight spaces. Precise jaw design grips tight the first time, every time. Four thread knurl and non-protruding jaws provide greater capacity; minimal head width improves performance in confined spaces. Code Blue grips are designed for durability and comfort.
