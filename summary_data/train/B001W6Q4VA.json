If your furniture has legs, with a \"footprint,\" say the diameter of a quarter, its weight will eventually compress and deform, say \"push out,\" both the the rubber , as well as the plastic, portions of the slider. Thereafter, the \"pushed out\" portion of the slider will start to \"sink into\" the carpet, making it difficult to slide. The solution is to insert something, say a \"washer,\" to broaden the diameter of the leg, to distribute its weight over a larger area of the slider.",

At 63 years old I needed to move a large love seat and couch after an operation and was not supposed to lift anything but all I need is to lift it enough to slide these under the legs and it was literally clear sailing. My wife was skeptical at first but when I moved a couch with ONE finger all could say was that I have been taking my vitamins.",

We will be able to wait until the window installers arrive and the bunk beds can be easily moved to facilitate the installation of the replacement windows.",

These work just as advertised -- slide them under, and away you go without hurting your back or straining overly much. Durable, easy to clean, and certainly affordable. I use an old pillow case to keep them together, as the cardboard-and-plastic packaging is not for re-use.",

I needed help lifting the bed to get them under but once they were in place I could move the bed w/ ease to paint behind. I ended up leaving then in place so I could move it in the future to clean behind.",

We ordered these and received them in one day. That evening I was able to move the same units all by myself. Simply lifted the corner of each item and nudged the pad in with my foot - and then zoom!! across the carpet I went. Fantastic product. Not sure how long they'll last but it's not something most of us use every day",
