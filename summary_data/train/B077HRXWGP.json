The temperature reading takes about 30-90 minutes to stablize and read correctly when changing between enivornments. AQI is hard to believe as it never changes outside of the 0 to 5 range, whether out in a field or in the middle of a city.",

The device has a fold out stand on the back, but the power socket is on the bottom, so it won't stand up when plugged in. The stand even has a cutout for the cord to pass through, but can't be used when plugged in.",

As far as accuracy, I have nothing to compare the \"readings\" against. My main concern is that the monitor reads TVOC or total voc's . However I was unable to determine what VOC's were being read to determine TVOC. My assumption is and I may be wrong is that TVOC is the sum or the adding of multiple VOC's together . If this is the case, then what individual VOC's(names) are being calculated to determine the TVOC???",
