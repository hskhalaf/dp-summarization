      "text": "Bought this to replace my Nest Gen 2 in order to get the apply HomeKit and Siri compatibility. My Favorite feature is Siri voice commands and the Geofencing. It\u2019s not as attractive as the Nest was, but the learning feature Nest had was running up my utility bills. We never had a predictable lifestyle so the Lyric geofencing is a much better solution. Scheduling is also WAY easier on this. If you have Apple products you want this over the Nest. The Ecobee looked good too,but this is less and I couldn\u2019t be happier. I was planning on giving the Nest to my in-laws, but now I think I\u2019ll sell that in ebay and get them this for less money.",

Turns out the one I was sent had a faulty wire according to our AC professional and it blew out a piece on our air condition which cost over $200 to fix. I sent this back to Amazon and it took a month to get my money back after promising a new one for weeks. Decided to let my dream of having a smart thermostat go for now. Unsure if I\u2019ll try again after this fiasco!",

I run probably 20 honeywell thermostats between homes and work. I've been very happy with their products up until this point. The t-5's are simply junk.",
