To celebrate this, I bought her a cowbell. It sounds great, comes complete and I know every time she looks at it or plays it, she'll feel my undying (albeit goofy...) support. It's as pictured, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this purchase to others.",

Except for the broken stick, I would have provided a 5 star rating.",

      "text": "This IS an instrument with that beautiful, LOUD, full cowbell tone. It's attractive and sturdy but, most importantly, it's what you expect to hear in, say, a Blue Oyster Cult song. I was happy with the mallet but I must say the dowel rod is quite thin in diameter. I wish they'd gone with a thicker dowel. Otherwise, it's fine. The mounting bracket appears to be strong enough to attach to a drum set. I tried playing it \"hand held.\" At first, I wished for a handle but, after playing, I realized that you can actually manipulate the tone and volume by changing your grip. No, there is no clapper. Not needed. Very pleased with this. I highly recommend it!",
