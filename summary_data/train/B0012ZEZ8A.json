Wax has a deep shine and a slick feel, beads water easily. Tire shine is vivid, not sure how long it will last. Interior mister is good. Non-greasy and removes dust and dirt well. Very satisfied.",

Most of the other cleaning supplies inside it are shrink wrapped and the rags can be washed. Just not a very good gift to give when someone opens a box with everything covered in white crusty goo.

      "text": "Great overall care kit. The only item I needed to add was some leather spray. Well and a bunch of microfiber towels. All the products come with very simple instructions. The exterior detail spray works really nice between washes and waxes. I purchased some mini travel spray bottles to keep in my car. I have one with Glass Cleaner, one with Internal Detailer and one with the external detailer, that way I can provide quick touchups even when I am not at home. Works great for when the birds decided to use your car for target practice.",

The products are high quality, and work beautifully. A clay kit alone can cost $20, and waxes cost anywhere from $10-$20 per bottle/tin, so the value on this is insanely good. My car looks great and i enjoy having all the tools i need to get the job done right.",
