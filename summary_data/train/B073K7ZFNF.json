The sound is very good and the picture is spectacular. I was amazed when I saw the actual screen was half the thickness of my iPhone. If you've recently been broken up with, do it. Buy this TV.

Ultimately I did not get my check until 5/22. I am never buying an LG product again...they couldn't care less about their customers.",
