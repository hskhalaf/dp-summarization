Stable and doesn't \"slosh\" much even with being jostled around. The only way this would be \"spill proof\" would be when EMPTY. The one thing it should come with is a softish/friction fit/snap on lid similar to plastic food containers/tupperware type, that fit tight over \"bowl ring/opening\" so the jug could be packed upright (as pictured) and not slosh water on the stuff packed with it. If I could find some covers like that, I would get multiple jugs so I could pack up more water for extended trips.",

The water in the bowl isn't very deep but my dog hasn't had any trouble using it, and it holds plenty of water for a day's driving. The only caveat is that the O-ring around the threads for the bowl is delicate and it's very easy to over tighten and distort it.",

It works as advertised; doesn't spill and he drinks from it. Unfortunately this is, as the title says, a \"travel\" bowl that you whip out if need be and not as a bowl to leave at all times. Result? Barely a day and he already punctured the corner after treating it as a chew toy. Still works but it lost the spill-proof feature since flipping it will only make the water fall out of the hole. Supervised use only, guys!",

Not a bad thing, just a learning curve. My pup took to it right away.",

With this, it lays low to the ground so even if Banjo messes with it, it's very very hard to flip over and spill. Also, we've only needed to refill the water once a day or so.
