      "text": "2nd one ive owned. Great little point and shoot. Clear images. FAST and 6x zoom very handy! Just learn ur settings for rapid photos of moving children or etc. No it doesn't compare to my larger better cameras, but is the gem of it's class. The megapixel it has is perfect for home and vacation shots just like TZ series. This is my second one and i love it. Great family or trip or daily take w you camera!",

This camera is by no means big, and bulky, but, I don't feel like I will loose it easily, or due to it being so small, forget I put it somewhere and sit on it! It was recommened to me buy serveral photo students, and it produces well. It is the sort of camera I could see becoming a very cool, keeper that in the near future will become one that is sot after. With the upgraded one gig card, holds over 300, 6 meg shots! Great buy!",

      "text": "This camera is nice. Looks good, and has the feel of a \"normal\" camera. If you want those very thin cameras, this is not the one for you. Exposure and color balance are very consistent, both indoors and outdoors. Anti-jitter works well, but tends to produce somewhat grainy pictures. Better keep your hand steady, specially if you use the 8.3x (max) zoom. It's a shame, though, that it doesn't include preferential aperture and exposure time modes. Sometimes, automatic just won't do what you want. Batteries compartment tends to open if you carry the camera in your pocket, so be sure to buy a case with it.",

I am especially impressed by the movie mode. It can take really good quality movie at 30 fps. Overall at this price I think it is a good camera.",

Only negative of this camera is, as stated in another review and magazine reviews, if using the high sensativity mode, blowing up the pics to poster size is not a good idea......won't come out well at all...... But besides that, the pitures taken with this camera are excellent quality, and it is very easy to use.... I would defiently suggest this camera, the chances of finding a better camera at this price is almost impossible.......",

Picture quality is very good, zoom works pretty fine though couldn't make out till now how to make the optimal use of both digital & optical zoom combinedly. Dim light is not atall a problem with this camera. Even the night pictures are as bright as day light pictures. Yet to explore the other features of this, but in the last 2 days it seems to be a good buy.",
