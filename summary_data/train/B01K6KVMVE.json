Still, I find it disappointing. The light output is a nice warm color, matching incandescent closely. I don't notice any flickering. Good bulbs while they last. In another room, I have used another brand, non-chandelier bulb with the same LED design as this one, and they also did not last long, so I don't think it's just Hudson that has this issue. We switched to Halogen bulbs in that room. I'll keep trying LED bulbs, but so far, it's been a rough ride.",

      "text": "These are phenomenal bulbs. I've bought a lot of LED light bulbs and these are among the best. They're very bright with a nice warm color, and beautiful to look at. Most LED candelabra bulbs have a bulky, ugly white section at the bottom, but these look as good as incandescents. I'm currently using them in outdoor fixtures, but I tried a couple in a dimmable fixture inside and they work great there, too.",
