I've used it in my dog's stroller for a little cushion while trying to keep him cool. It's soft and he has no issues with lying on it.",

My cat and I have not been disappointed! Since the hot summer days have arrived, my cat spends most of her resting time curled up on this cute little blanket. Nice quality item, easy to clean. Very pleased.",
