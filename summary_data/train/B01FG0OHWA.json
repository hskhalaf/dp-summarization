Has nice pigmentation and great SPF coverage.",

It doesn't clog my pores, which is nice because I am prone to breakouts. This reduced the number of breakouts I have. It's fairly expensive for a small bottle, but it does work. During the summer, I actually just used the primer a lot of days. It evened out my skin tone enough that I didn't even need the foundation over it. I like it better than the non-tinted primer. It's worth a try if you're considering Bare Minerals products.",

It\u2019s magic. Sometimes I buy it at the mall, but it\u2019s cheaper through Amazon. I give it as gifts. It\u2019s one of my favorite things.",

There's enough yellow tones in this to counteract any blue/purple undereye coloration so I don't have to use a separate concealer.
