It has a motion detector so if you need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and need to find the toilet, the light comes on and you will have an easy time. They are mild lights too so it won\u2019t hurt your eyes when they come on and ruin your night vision. You also don\u2019t have to worry about turning any lights off when you\u2019re done because the light turns off by itself after 2 min of no motion being detected. The sterilizing uv light is a big plus as well. Who knew I\u2019d be so excited about accessorizing my toilet of all things.",

The sensor seems to be sensitive enough for a normal person and the light will change colors if you choose to set it that way. It claims to have an ultraviolet cleaning cycle, and I have seen it when it was on, but if it actually works that would be a plus. The downside to me is that when a person raises the seat to urinate the light is extremely bright. It works best if the toilet seat is down so it isn't blindingly bright.",
