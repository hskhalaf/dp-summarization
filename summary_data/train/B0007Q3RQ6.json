It's a bit loud, but we're rarely in the same room (my office) when it's on high. We expect that this will last more than twenty years (I'll be more careful), but we're not sure that we will.",

What I didn't expect was that speed setting 1 produces loud electrical noise continuously. This can be heard throughout the whole house. Speed setting 2 is actually drastically less annoying and generally sounds like air, but occasionally there will be a loud hum oscillating in and out. This will do what it promises. It cooled my house in a matter of minutes in the evening when I turned it on! However the drawbacks in terms of annoying noise produced I believe in my case outweigh the positives.",

Any where you stand you can feel a breeze from the air moving through the house and thats on low! lol.",

It didn't fit in the window as I would have liked but with some work I think I can get it to sit steady and not vibrate so much. In NC, it gets pretty hot and humid and this fan certainly works better than our old Sears fan that's only 60 years old.",

    "title": "Air King 9166F 20\" Whole House Window Fan",

The fan fits window openings that are between 27-inches and 38-inches wide and are 26.25\"\" tall. Traditional window fans are held in place by closing the window down onto the fan. While this is effective, if you ever need to close the window, you have to physically remove the fan from the window. Air King's Storm Guard feature enables the window to be closed behind the fan during inclement weather, or when securing the home. This Air King Window Fan is made of an impact resistant plastic housing, powder coated steel front grill and blade. With a powerful motor, this fan is the perfect cooling solution for instant air circulation and cooling. This fan is compliant with OSHA and ETL. It comes with a 1-year limited warranty to protect against defects in materials and workmanship.\n\n\nAdjustable Settings and Powerful Motor  Air King knows that the power house of any fan is a high-quality motor. With this in mind, Air King equipped this model with a 3-speed, 1-phase motor and sleeve bearing, permanent split capacitor.

The motor is rated at 1.4, 1.2 and 1.0 amps and170, 145 and 115 watts on highm medium and low. This fan is tested in accordance with AMCA standard 230-99. The industrial grade fan motor means high velocity air circulation with little to no maintenance.\n\n\nAdditional Features  This fan is perfect for all rooms, large or small. It has a front-mounted rotary control to select desired speed. The power cord is black, 7-foot long, has a 3-conductor, and is a SJT type. Included in the packaging is the assembled fan with Storm Guard sliding panels, instructions, and mounting hardware.\n\n\nAbout Air King  Air King offers a full line of industrial grade and commercial grade air circulating solutions. Whether it's for an industrial setting such as a manufacturing plant, warehouse or factory or a commercial setting such as an office, school or hospital, Air King has the perfect solution for you.
