Those were kind of a pain because the tap holes weren't drilled deep enough, but it wasn't impossible. Once assembled, this is an extremely solid piece of furniture! Much better quality than IKEA. The only other thing is the white is not bright white, but slightly more on the ivory side. Very much worth $450.",

The main negative is that there were 4 pieces of wood that were cracked, and you will not know this until you unpack it all... Lots of packing. I had to repair these broken pieces rather than pack it all up and send back.... The functionality outweighed the inconvenience of broken pieces (note: I have my own work shop,,to make repairs while others who purchase this may find this problem too big.) Very difficult to pack back up once you unwrap and unpack.",

One of the pieces in the directions is stated incorrectly. But the directions are easy to follow. Make sure to lay out all of the pieces first and you won't get confused.",

The granite top finishes off the cart nicely, greatly enhancing its character from a cabinet that could look rather plain and perhaps cheap to something that looks really elegant. I was surprised at how much and how quickly the price could fluctuate. I saw the same cabinet selling for about $35 less on Amazon about a week after I purchased mine.",
