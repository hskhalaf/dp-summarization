I used to wear Onitsuka Tiger Colorados, but these are the same exact style and half the price. Also, they last longer and are more comfortable to wear.

These feel precisely the same as the Pumas and Nikes I used to wear in the early 80's- the lightweight construction, thinly padded nylon fabric, shallow foam sole ( I can feel the treads on the sole through the bottom of the shoe)...But for my tastes, these shoes can stay in 1981. I am a big guy with really wide feet and these look ridiculous on me- like a pair of slippers. I do like the way they look out of the box and they were surprisingly accommodating for a wide foot, so giving them 4 stars.",

Some reviewers use them for running...to each their own...and maybe I ordered a different version, but I can\u2019t see these holding up to distance running. They are just fashion sneakers. If you are into running I recommend spend the extra money on a dedicated running shoe built for your running style.

Be mindful though that the suede leather can easily tear and the nylon can fray, however if taken care of these shoes will last you a good while tread-wise and they are so affordable that you can buy 2 pairs for the price of one New Balance or Asics!",
