Handles lighting much better. See at least 100' with the built in LEDs. Works well with aux. lighting as well. Only downside is no way to flip the image. (Old cameras had a menu that the image could be flipped or mirrored, this camera does not have any of that.)",

My other cameras that came with my A-zone system probably don't have quite as good a picture but at least they feel like they're built to last these other things feel like a big beer can very flimsy extremely bad quality.",

Also, the rotating knobs in the back are terrible as the camera ages so does the plastic. I purchased 4 of them and they are all missing their focus/zoom knobs. They stick out of the body of the camera and start degrading. If you try to rotate them they snap right off because the plastic is too brittle. You can no longer correct the focus or the zoom. Allen heads style adjustment knobs are the best.",
