Does well with heavier branches you just have to go slow and let it get them in the teeth. I was stuck between the longer clippers and getting a pair of the shorter ones. Go long! Makes cutting deeper and taller hedges easy. And the weight is minimal. As quickly and easily these things trim you don\u2019t have to work your arms to much.",

This Black and Deck is a gem, it\u2019s light in weight and powerful. It cut through our mature hedges and flower tree branches with ease.",
