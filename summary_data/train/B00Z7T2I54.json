So for my new iPad mini (thanks, Grandpa!), I wanted something that would be more protective. There are things you have to deal with...like those stubborn little doors over the charger and headphone ports...but it's worth it to me not to have to worry about breaking my device. Also, you can't have the cover on the back and take pictures. That's ok with me but I thought I'd mention it.",

I have yet to drop my tablet so I cant give it a true review based on reliability but it feels solid and looks like it would stand up to just about any typical drop from waist height. The built in screen protector is a nice feature as well. I also thought the thumb code button wouldnt be responsive since the case covers it but I haven't had any issues with it what so ever.",

This case provides ample protection to keep it safe from those drops. The back also serves as a stand which she uses often. Very good product!",
