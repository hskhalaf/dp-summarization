It fits our graco 4-in-1 perfectly with a ton of room for a small pack of diapers and wipes and even some of her fave toys as extra luggage space. Even the guy that did the gate check appreciates this. He said it was easy to maneuver and the handle helps. It stores almost flat and will definitely be bringing this with us on all trips!",

I do however wish they would but a double wall of canvas on the bottom near the wheels.

We previously travelled with a borrowed backpack style, thin bag and it was horrible. My husband had to frequently stop to readjust the bag/seat and the seat is closer to 30lbs so it was not easy to carry. Having this bag on wheels is a game changer. We could easily push this through the airport and check it with our luggage. I\u2019ve only been on two flights but it doesn\u2019t have any damage and it kept our seat protected. When not in use it easy folds for storage. Would highly recommend this product!!",

The padding was a nice addition. I would recommend it to any parent who wants to keep their car seat clean and a little more protected for flights and easy travel.
