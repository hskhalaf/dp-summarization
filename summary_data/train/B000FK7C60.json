The 650 is perfect, not only for my 4'10\" kid, but even for grown-ups. It is so much fun, I'm resisting the urge to sneak ride it ... more. I was also worried about whether my kid could handle it because he's not particularly strong, but he tipped it over in the grass twice while learning, and since then has had no problems whatsoever. Love this thing! We're using a 12-hour timer switch ( to prevent overcharging, so we don't have to worry about killing the battery. Freakin' SWEET!",

The front wheel is a little lopsided, but I will eventually fix it.

I would say the age range for this is 8-12 maybe 13 or 14 depending on the size of your child. Lots of fun and fast. It's very fast and powerful. But definitely not too powerful. Especially in open spaces. I wish they would make a bigger/more powerful version like a mx800 or something. But overall this was a great purchase and very fun. When we got ours there was a crack in the frame but we called razor a they will be replacing it.",

We didn\u2019t want to spend a ton of money on a gas bike until we knew he was going to stay interested so this is a great starter. I imagine if he sticks with it we will be going to a gas one pretty quickly but still worth every penny",

The fork packing already came apart so Razor did a good job replacing the fork assembly without any trouble. They had excellent customer service but it was a real pain to change the forks out and get the brakes dialed back it so they wouldn't squeak all the time. For these troubles, this bike has lost favor with the kids really quick. Time will tell on the reliability of the battery system.",
