Stylish watch, but has two downfalls. 1) The face is quite dark and does not light up, so it can be hard to read at night and 2) the adjustable loop for the strap tends to slide around leaving the slack of the band to hang. Side note, I think the two buttons north and south of the crown are just for show. They push, but do not do anything to my knowledge.",
