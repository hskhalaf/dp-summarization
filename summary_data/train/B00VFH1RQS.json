But after an afternoon of constant light rain it leaked in two spots, both where the wall storage pockets were. The seams were taped but somehow it still leaked and I'm glad it wasn't a heavy rain. I was sure if anything, the tent would leak where the 3 zippers meet in an odd way on the end door but that stayed dry. I am returning the tent because I cannot have one that leaks, I camp in all kinds of weather and heavy rain doesn't deter me so that's a deal breaker.",

The nylon is sturdy, and held up to a couple pretty windy days, but it is thin. We had to put a tarp up on one side to block the campground streetlight.

Second, this tent has vents galore, but the bottom vent that\u2019s designed to draw air in and up (cooling the tent) can be cinched but not zippered. Because of this, a stiff breeze of more than 10 mph goes right through. That\u2019s tough on cold nights when just blocking wind makes a big difference. I\u2019d still buy it again.",

Room divider is flimsy but gives you a modicum of privacy. Materials and stitching appear to be sturdy. Zippers snag a little but about what should be expected. Folds back down pretty easily. Tight fit to get it back into the storage bag, but very do-able. Overall, a great tent.",

      "text": "Thank to the guy that tried multiple tents and wrote a lengthy review on here. You led to me purchasing this. The 1st weekend and this past weekend of Ren Fest there were high winds. Our tent barely budged while others were literally rolling across the fields. Condensation does find it's way in, but not too badly. Oh and the zipper gets stuck a little, but just hold it taut and go slow. Goes up in less than 60 seconds without the weather cover. Overall 10/10 would recommend.",
