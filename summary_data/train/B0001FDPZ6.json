Also, while printing a document on paper is very fast indeed, printing on a CD or DVD is very slow. Finally, Epson's \"Print CD\" software (Macintosh version) is clumsy and hard to use.

Now the cartridges stop printing even though the ink utility shows about 20% of the ink remaining and a message at the top of the screen reading I have about 100 pages left.

It served its purpose well; as a writer, I need a fast and easy to maintain printer. However, it was time for one that suited my writing needs, as well as my wife's photographic ones. The Epson Stylus R200 Photo Printer completed the picture (pun intended, sorry) for my technology needs. It is easy to set up and use. Best of all, it is consistent and reliable. The price that Amazon is offering is more than competitive. It's unbeatable. Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points and The Five Points Concluded",

Most have some color but not much. The ink just disappears. I'm hooking the HP back up and will use the Epson only when print quality is a serious concern of mine,",

One tip... when printing, always open up the printer properties window and select the proper print quality (text, photo, 'best' photo, etc) AND paper type. It makes a huge difference.
