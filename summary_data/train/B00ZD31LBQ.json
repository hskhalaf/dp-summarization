Anyway, it fots like a glove- I run with it in in 90+ degree weather in the deserts of TX and I haven\u2019t felt like it\u2019s made the heat worse, it\u2019s very comfortable, the weight distribution and materials are the key here. Very very minor inner arm chaffing when wearing a tank top rather than a sleeved shirt, but an easy fix. Definitely recommend this!",

Shoulder straps are padded well and do not leave your shoulders sore as the weight of the vest is distributed quite evenly on it. The straps give plenty of leeway for proper movement and doesn't feel like it constricts my chest or breathing at all. Would definitely recommend.",
