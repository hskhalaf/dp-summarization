The filter on the control box also had a significant amount of plastic shavings in it. Had they offered to just send a replacement faucet with an advance RMA, I probably would have kept it, but not much faith in a unit that fails from the start pretty much.",

I was surprised to find this model from a well-known brand at reasonable priced. The product itself is really well-made. The metal parts seem solid and hefty in the hands and the connectors are high quality brass. Will update if anything changes.",

      "text": "We have had this faucet for almost five months and we absolutely LOVE it! It gives our kitchen a high-end feel without the high-end price. We have yet to change the batteries, so even if we have to change them within the next month or so, that's still only twice a year so we're okay with that! The oil rubbed bronze is a beautiful finish and easy to clean. This was also very easy to install and took my husband and I no more than 30 minutes. Highly, highly recommend!",

The rubber components that stream the water were falling out. The company replaced the faucet head for me, no problems. Next in 2019 the handle starts falling off. When it falls off it makes a loud metallic sound that can make you jump. It appears the metal splits over time. Keep in mind, this is due to everyday pulling the lever to the front and the back. Im about to contact company, will update.",

It's a bit tricky showing my guests how to work the faucet. The sensor is almost a \"touch sensor\" as you have to be extremely close to it to active it. It's a good conversation starter, however, and for the price it's a good buy.",
