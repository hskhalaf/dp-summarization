I had used bareminerals ultra thin brow pencil (universal light) for 6 years... but the product changed and I started looking for a new one. Took many tries... but this one is IT. For a fraction of the price I used to pay. Most natural-looking, and the pencil is not too hard, not to soft. I tried the soft brown and I\u2019m in love. I recommend giving it a try!

It's also the perfect color. A lot of drugstore brow pencils in dark brown run red. I'm black, my hair is a cool brown, not a red brown. This is the perfect dark brown.
