I found a few recipes I wanted to try (spaghetti sauce, black beans, and caramelized onions) and every single one of them worked perfectly. I've canned 20 pints in my first week of owning this Presto! I follow recipes exactly and it has helped knowing that there is no guessing. I also much prefer that pressure canning is mostly inactive work while water bath canning takes much more work. I love this canner and the ease of use!",

      "text": "We've canned lots of food with this and it worked great. We've canned beef brisket, turkey and chicken broth, and vegetables in it, and it has been great. I recommend getting the adjustable pressure regulator, so you can use it at 5, 10, or 15 psi. Every time the gauge pressure matches the pressure when the regulator starts rocking. The canner feels very solid, and I like the fact that the lid locks securely whenever there is pressure inside, so you can't open it when there is still steam. I also like the fact that it includes a recipe book with times and pressures for lots of common foods.",

Really like the slight notches on the interior to indicate how much water to add. My one issue that I have is the pressure seal valve which often needs a little extra coaxing to pop up so that it\u2019ll start building pressure. Water also pools around that valve and needs to soaked up. Would highly suggest getting the pressure regulator weight that allows you to adjust the pounds of pressure in increments of 5.",

But I kept reading that the water bath method, which I have always done, was not as safe as we thought. Have canned green beans with it so far and they are delicious. We just take them out of the jar and microwave them. Also, looking forward to canning tomatoes with it. These are my main 2 items to can. Love this pressure cooker and would highly recommend it. Just follow instructions.",

One of the notches was catching just a little bit that wouldn't allow the lid to open or close smoothly. I hit it lightly with a file to knock down a small burr and viola! AS ADVERTISED! I'm extremely happy with it, and it looks like I should get a lot of use out of this in the future. Very good product!!!!!",

Also, let this thing cool down enough after using it, i was impatient and hot steam came out when i opened the lid, not hot enough to burn me, but still hot enough to give me a shock.",

One thing I was disappointed about is that I cannot use it on my propane burner (aka turkey or fish fryer). So I pulled out the old Coleman camping stove! The gauge was not reading accurately, and Presto promptly replaced it with a new one at no charge and prepaid the shipping to return the other one. NICE!",

    "title": "Presto 01781 23-Quart Pressure Canner and Cooker",
    "description": "Pressure canning is the only method recommended safe by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for low-acid foods. Doubles as a boiling water canner for preserving fruits, jams, jellies, pickles and salsa in pint and half pint jars. Also handy as a large capacity pressure cooker. Constructed of warp-resistant, heavy-gauge aluminum for fast, even heating. Works on regular and smooth-top ranges. Deluxe pressure dial gauge registers the complete range of processing pressures. This precise measurement is especially important at higher altitudes. Air vent/cover lock allows pressure to build up only when the cover is closed properly and prevents the cover from opening until pressure is safely reduced. 23-Quart liquid capacity (21.8 liters).\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe USDA recommends pressure canning as the only safe method for low-acid foods such as vegetables, meats, and poultry. The Presto 23-quart pressure canner is more than adequate for any home canning needs. It's a professional-quality tool, made of heavy-duty aluminum, with stay-cool handles and a strong-lock steel lid. An accompanying rack fits down into the pot to keep jars up off the bottom, so that liquid can circulate underneath. And it can do double duty as a large pressure cooker. It's easy to cook healthfully with pressure cookers, since the food retains so much more of its nutrients and flavor. \n\n The sturdy lid locks down during canning or cooking; an inner sealing ring keeps the steam in. In addition to a pop-up pressure indicator and a simple steam release mechanism, there is an overpressure plug that will let off steam if it builds up excessively. The pressure dial gauge gives an accurate reading so that pressure can be kept constant during canning. This pressure canner is also a cooker that's useful for weeknight dinners or for any meal that needs to come together quickly. An accompanying booklet contains more than 50 recipes, ranging from basic soup stocks to stews and pot roasts--even sweets like English Plum Pudding or Brown Bread! Tenderize lean cuts of beef or pork, or cook chicken, fish, or vegetables faster than you can in a microwave, and without losing moisture. \n\n Nonabrasive cleansers are best for cleaning this aluminum pressure cooker, though occasional use of a fine metal polish will help the exterior keep its shine. The lid of the Presto 23-quart pressure canner is not immersible. In addition, the sealing ring should be removed after each use to allow cleaning of the inside rim of the lid. The dial gauge is delicate; detailed care instructions are found in the accompanying booklet. The vent pipe is simple to keep clean with a small brush or pipe cleaner, and both the air vent/cover lock and the overpressure plug are removable. The pressure cooker measures 14 inches in diameter (17 inches including handles) and 15-1/2 inches tall (including lid). Presto guarantees this pressure cooker with an extended 12-year warranty. A detailed instruction and recipe booklet is included; special safety issues that pertain to pressure cookers are clearly explained. --Garland Withers",
