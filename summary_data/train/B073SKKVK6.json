It is water resistant, hypoallergenic, and great for sensitive skin. \ud83d\ude4c Bonus is that it acts as a bug repellant, AND it will not sting eyes, if your kids get it in them from rubbing their eyes or something. \ud83d\udc4d When you apply it to your skin, you don't even feel it! I love that you don't get that yucky layer of suncreen slime. Definitely recommend it! It's worth it. \ud83d\ude0a",

My son was outside in the sun and didn\u2019t even so much as get pink when I used this sunscreen. I did make sure and apply every 2 hours. This sunscreen has a very nice light scent that quickly goes away after it is applied. It is a bit thick but goes on nicely. Like most natural sunscreen it does leave a light white tint on the skin. But does eventually goes away and isn\u2019t too noticeable.",

It smells like lavender which is my favorite. My toddler seems to like it too and didn't complain when I put it on. He actually wanted to do it himself.

Sunblocz Baby+Kids goes on easily and protects without all of the scary harsh chemicals that some other sunblocks contain.

Well this stuff was awesome!! It protected them so well and helped ease my nervousness about my youngest getting burnt! I was able to relax and enjoy! It is a little thick and sticks to your hands more, but it's totally worth it for peace of mind! Plus, I prefer natural stuff anyway! I even used it for myself!!",

The product's smell is citrus-y and pleasant - so much better than the sunscreen-y smell we're all accustomed to. It covers nicely and rubs in well with not too much effort.
