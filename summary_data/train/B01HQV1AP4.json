There is also a video on lowes website that showed how to assemble a very similar gazebo, really the only difference is this one requires a wrench or socket set (comes with a cheap little pressed metal wrench, but if you have a socket set, it will go much quicker), the one in the video used different fasteners (hand tightened knobs basically), but the rest of the video was helpful, so if you are having trouble, just sear sunjoy gazebo on lowes website and check out the video.",

I had tossed around different ideas on how to mount this in my yard so the wind does not carry it away or destroy it. I mounted it to (4) full size Chevy brake rotors that I got from a local repair shop that were scrap then covered the rotors with mulch. The very next day we received a storm with 50 mph winds and it stood like a trooper.",

The top quickly filled with water and caused the top to stretch. We removed the collection of water but the damage was done -- the entire top sags and every rain results in the same large pockets of water. VERY DISAPPOINTED. The design should have addressed the support issues for the top. UPDATE - due to the amazing customer service from Amazon, I was able get this resolved. THANK YOU AMAZON!!",

I put up by myself (I am 6 ft, 150 lbs), unless you count my dog laying around supervising. I ended up getting Sunjoy L-GZ933PST 12\u2032 x 10\u2032 Cabin-Style gazebo, and am so thrilled. Thankful it came with mosquito netting too. No matter how hard it storms I can find a dry spot underneath.",
