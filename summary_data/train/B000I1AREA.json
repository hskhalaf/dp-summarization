But, I hesitated to try the commercial version (again) based on a crappy photo. To me, this looked like thick neoprene - which wouldn't suit my application with a textured flooring surface. Tried to capture the difference in my photo: left is \"heavy duty\", right is \"commercial\". Minus one star for crappy images, M&D. Hope this helps someone else.",

As others have stated, the rubber sweep holes do NOT align with the predrilled holes in the aluminum bar - regardless of manipulation: The measurements between holes in both are not consistent (read that: uniformly spaced), and the rubber and metal hole spacings do not match each other. That said, the rubber is a vast improvement over the previous vinyl composition sweep: Only time will tell if it stands up to the harsh northern Minnesota sub-zero temps, moving across a concrete slab. Will revisit and revised this review as necessary, down the road...",

I like how they include excess rubber on both sides of the metal piece, allowing to leave the rubber cut a little wider than the door and helping to seal any gaps around the door even better. The rubber piece is nice and thick and I dont see it wearing out anytime soon. Addressing the reviews complaining about the holes rubber not lining up with the predrilled holes in the metal: mine came the same way but its just rubber. Just drill a new hole through it or just push the screws through it like i did.",

I mounted this on a screen door and the rubber was so thick that pneumatic door closer would not close the door. When I raised the strip up a bit (after having to drill new holes in the metal), so that the door would self-close, the rubber strip was so high that there was a 1/4 inch gap under the door. This gap was almost the same as I had before I installed the strip. So after two hours of messing with this door sweep, I realized I should not have bought it in the first place.",
