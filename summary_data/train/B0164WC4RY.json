The pieces are quite large making it easy for little hands to build.I took a star off for the e-book. It says the e-book is enclosed but you really have to hunt for it on the manufacturer website. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a booklet of instructions enclosed just like in the lego sets? I printed close to 90 pages and put them in the binder with dividers and labels for each creature but it took quite a bit of work.",

A few suggestions... 1.make the container a little bigger so that it's easier for the kids to put away all the parts. 2. Lower then price! Although it's a great toy the cost to make it can't be much. These are pretty expensive for a bunch of plastic parts. I might you'd sell more if they were more affordable. 3. Add a place on the lid where the \"tool\" can fit. It often gets misplaced.",

They loosen quickly and the robot or animal he has built won't stand up for more than a minute without collapsing. Also the little \"wrench\" included in the set does not do anything except make a rachet sound; it does not tighten or loosen the nuts. Very disappointed, especially for the high price.",

The case is a plus, since it can be used as a table where he can assemble the pieces if he is sitting on the floor. Update: My nephew loved it. Just one suggestion, the case needs to be a little bigger. The pieces doesn't fit in when a kid gathers them up after playing, they need to be carefully arranged in order to fit in. That's a little frustrating for a young kid who wants to \"clean\" after playing.",

The blocks are generic shapes that will work well for building. It's a nice option for people looking to buy classic building sets with typical pieces rather than the special themed kits with odd, one-off pieces. It reminds me of being a kid with a big box of assorted pieces that you can do what you want with. We've had a lot of fun building different things. The box looks like it's stackable with other similar style boxes. Overall it's a great value.",

He loves to make things, put them together and take apart. The instruction booklet that I received was also very helpful. I do have one recommendation; the pieces all came with a great storage container but all of the pieces wouldn't fit back in the container after playtime and creations were taken apart. Just a suggestion to make it a little bigger, otherwise I highly recommend this product.",
