However the box arrived pretty beat up and the from rim was damaged. Amazon of course took care of the problem for me, but my options were either return the whole bike or take a %25 refund.

Can't beat this bike for the price, I tore the brakes off and flipped the wheel first thing and the bike rides great. It is unbelievably light coming off of my old chromoly bike. I also picked up some of the 6ku foot straps to top it off, I would recommend these to others as well. The only thing that I did not like was the grips that game on it, they look and feel weird. So a trashed them before the first ride and tore some grips off my old bmx bike.",

I replaced the crank, chain wheel and pedals, and put some gatorskin tires on it, but I have friends who've paid over a thousand dollars for bikes that are just as fast.",

The matte on the bike can easily be scratched off. However, there are a lot of upgrades in the future with this bike such as handlebars, pedals, tires and so forth. Overall an above average bike for the price it is. Definitely worth it!",

For some reason the metal frame that holds the brake pads were coming into contact right on top of the wheel, causing it not to turn. That's the only issue I had, other than that the bike is fine.",
