      "text": "The board came packaged so well I thought I had ordered a size larger than intended! It is lightweight and thin, but not so thin that it bends or warps. Solid writing surface. Came with two hangers, tray, eraser, pen, and two magnets. Not heavy on our wall. Markers glide with ease and the eraser leaves nothing behind. We use for homework. Having this size board for spelling words, etc...has helped cut homework time. We have a 1st grader. Sometimes they need the visual aid to help transition to homework papers. If I need future magnetic white boards I will come back to this brand and seller. Cannot say enough good things abt this board.",

The included magnetic eraser and pen are good quality for being included for free. I've been using this item to help keep track of many different responsibilities, tasks, and school work. It has helped me organize myself better than before.",

I slid the 18 inch marker tray to the right-hand side of the board so that it would not interfere with me opening my file cabinet drawer on the left-hand side of the board. This board allows me to tidy up and organize my workspace so I can be more productive. No complaints. It's a great product!",

Tools needed are: drill/drill bit, level and philips screwdriver. The mounting tabs are adjustable, which makes it super easy to mount!

Along with the three included magnets, they are all on the weaker side magnetically-speaking, but the magnets will hold several sheets of paper up just fine. The tray and the two hooks on which to hang the whiteboard feel very light plastic, and give the impression of not being sturdy or solid, but attached properly they do their jobs nicely, and securely.

      "text": "This magnetic dry-erase board was exactly what my son wanted for his dorm to post his mathematical formulas and assignments on and it is very well made and came with everything that he needed to use it effectively. He mounted the board on his wall with 3M hooks using screw hooks to anchor it due to the policy of \"no holes\" in the dorm walls (completely understandable). He tends to be very selective about the quality of everything and really thought this board was \"all of that.\" I highly recommend this item to anyone who is looking to purchase one and the price was great.",

I know these things can get scratched due to pointing devices or jewelry. The only things that touched this were Expo markers, eraser, and fingers. I'm assuming it arrived with scratches but weren't visible until the black marker got inside them. There may be even more scratches yet to be found. I'm still debating on if it's worth returning.",

With a level and a straight edge, I managed to get it. I also opted to swap out the provided screws and anchors for some longer screws that could penetrate the drywall and bite into the studs.

I took away some starts for how absolutely frustrating it was to try and mount this thing, but once it's up it's perfect and exactly what I wanted.",

My dry-erase markers write cleanly on it and erase well without scrubbing. I like being able to attach documents with magnets. While the magnets that come with it are cheap, they do the trick (it came with three small black plastic magnets). I also like the flexibility of being about to attach the marker tray on any side of the board, which gives you the freedom to hang the board however you want.",

It was packaged well enough to protect the front of the board, which is most important. However, for those of you that might be interested, the board is slightly smaller than the advertised size, and is almost one inch shy in both height and width. This doesn't bother me, but I felt it was worth letting others know in the event they are bothered by this sort of thing. All of that being said, I'd buy this board again if I needed another one.",
