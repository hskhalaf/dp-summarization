The dealer was charging me close to $300 for them plus $90 for installation Some other stores like 4 wheelers had prices up to $500 for them (aren't they crazy?). So stop looking out there this is the best deal so far! The installation of the steps is pretty straightforward; so easy to install with the required tools.",

These are WAY thicker than the fenders, at first I was convinced they had metal inside them because they are so stiff, but no. My rather large passenger is short and weighs a \"classified\" amount, and uses the built in step every time. NO flex or give at all. These are light and strong. Again, get the MOPAR stuff, it is just made better and they fit like a glove. 25 minute install time!",

I had to grind out about an quarter inch of metal in total before it lined up enough to get the bolt through. After that, it held quite well.
