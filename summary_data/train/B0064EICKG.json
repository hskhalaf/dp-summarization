Most studs will span 3 of the dots, so you can really trust that middle one to be +/- 0.2 inches of actual center of the stud. 2 AA batteries very easy to put in.

That being said on interior walls it is completely accurate. On doing work on the inside or simply hanging pictures it has never been wrong. I have found myself using it more than I thought I would because it is so accurate.",

This patent-pending detector senses the wall in thirteen locations simultaneously, then immediately illuminates the display elements that are in front of a stud. The Pros Ensor 710 is faster, less error prone and more accurate than other products on the market. It is the easy way to find studs. - advanced Multi-Sense technology senses the wall in multiple locations simultaneously and uses data from many readings to accurately determine the position of studs, operates effectively even through difficult architectural construction features (such as wall and ceiling textures, uneven plaster thickness, uneven paint, and difficult wallpaper, thick walls, etc. ) that can cause other detectors to fail. - bright LEDs lights illuminate to indicate the position of hidden objects \u2013 making it very easy to visualize the position of studs. - The only stud Finder available that does not require swipes across a wall to determine the location of studs, so that the readings are immediately accurate. - identifies the width of hidden objects so that you not only know the position of hidden objects, but so you also know the size of them. - can identify the position of multiple studs simultaneously. This is particularly useful for when there might be two or more studs in close proximity, which can often confuse conventional stud finders. - The Pros Ensor 710 has more sensor pad area than conventional stud finders and can sense more accurately through many real-world architectural features such as texturing, uneven plaster thickness, uneven paint, difficult wallpaper patterns, etc. - deep scanning is always active (up to 1. 5\"). - The Pros Ensor 710 can be initialized at any position along a surface. - ergonomic soft grip.",
