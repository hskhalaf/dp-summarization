These are aluminum with a thin coat of black paint. When the black paint is scratched, you are down to the silver aluminum. In addition, the chairs need assembly. They are not a single peice structure. Each chair requires 8 bolts, which create opportunity for movement/flex. As a result, these chairs wobble somewhat.",
