This was faster than painting our kids bathroom with our appraiser coming the following day. Only needed 1 ft from the 2nd package and walls are 9ft + high there is also an alcove area behind door that was wallpapered.excellent product If my reviews help, please Like it below",

It held up to lots of kitchen splatters and wiped clean easily with water or some cleanser. My only compliant is that I couldn't get a seamless installation, but I'm not sure that anyone noticed where the pieces meet except me. I'm now planning on getting some for a bathroom facelift!",
