      "text": "I ordered this to store gardening supplies on my patio. I was initially concerned that the cooler would arrive dented but, it was well packed and looks better than I thought it would. My husband assembled it for me and pointed out the high quality wheels with ball bearings. He describes the finish as similar to that of auto paint and actually waxed it before I took it outside. I can't testify as to how watertight it is. It does, however, appear to be well-made, and I don't see any obvious flaws in the construction. The cooler I received is a slightly darker orange than the one shown in the product photos but, I'm happy with it.",

It went together ok and rolls ok. The really bad part is that the hinge sticks and pops every time you open it to get a cold beverage. It is really annoying and kids have a hard time with it. So color is great but not embossed like picture",
