Glass candle holders are rejects/seconds. The cups are badly formed, not quite round, and would not even qualify as a dollar store product. Also, this thing is made for the outside, yet, there is nothing to hold the glass candle holders onto the iron frame. A bit of wind is all it would take to break every one. Also, the gems are made of plastic.",

The glass does have some imperfections, but having it hang from a gazebo they are not visible. It is pretty solid, not flimsy. All in all I'm happy with it, especially the price. Because of that I can't complain about the minor things. In order to hang it you will need to get your own chain, which I also found on Amazon for about $10.",

      "text": "Very nice, just like picture but the glass holders had some imperfections around the rims, nothing that will cause issues but definitely a cosmetic problem. Also, one of the beaded chains was not connected and the piece that they connect to wasnt in the box which leads me to think it was broken before it was even boxed to be sent to me. Again, not going to affect the way it works but I had to hang it up differently than the others. It's pretty and I like it, but at the price with those issues, I think it should be cheaper, even without those issues, I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get.",

      "text": "Lovely item, amazing deal, honestly. It arrived six days early and in great shape despite being fragile. I intend to use this chandelier for the next ten years. The cups are separate from the body of it and may need to be glued on but that's no problem for me. Thrilled with this purchase!",
