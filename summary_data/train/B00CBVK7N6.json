I had no idea that the primers I had been using were not non comedogenic. I get congested pores, especially on my T zone. The primer lays down nicely and looks great under my foundation. I will be repurchasing this again. It really it a great product!",

The scent isn't so great when you first pump it out, but that quickly goes away once you rub the product into the skin. I cleaned my face, applied moisturizer first as suggested on the primer bottle, and then waited till it dried before I applied the primer itself. Then I waited again (as suggested on bottle) for that to dry before applying make-up. It brightened up my face, moisturized and visibly primed my skin for make-up instantly. I'm really impressed with this product and the price is great!",

Not good that the return policy is so strict. I normally would have returned it within the time frame, but oh well!!!!",
