Unless you are buying this set to collect, there is a way for kids to have great fun with the littleness of everything and not lose most of it almost right away. With a tiny dot of super-glue, I secured the smallest items where they belonged. Now a careless brush of little fingers don't sent the pieces flying across the room where we don't find all of them until I vacuum. And dig them out of the bag. There is still lots for the baby rabbit to do. The sets are great favorites and no one but me is any the wiser about the glue.",
