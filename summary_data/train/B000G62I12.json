This product is terrific, and did as good a job as the best pedicure I've had which I paid $55. for. Doesn't come with any instructions and I had a hard time figuring out how to use the product. I had to read back over some reviews to find out that I should pop out the tiny white plastic piece first! Now i need advice on how to change the blade.......",
