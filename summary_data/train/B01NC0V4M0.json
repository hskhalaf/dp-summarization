I\u2019ve dropped the bike several times on very rough off-road terrain and the bags have held up with and without very heavy amounts of gear in them. I\u2019ve ran lots of weight in camping gear and hauled it at a fast pace through rough rutted out off-roading with several lowside slides on the bike on slippery gravel. Not even a scuff after sliding the bulky bags on gravel. They are great bags and hold TONs of stuff but are HUGE and bulky. I\u2019ve pressure washed them off at end of 3 day dirt rides. No water or dust got inside.",

      "text": "I've suffered from the clunky BMW hardbags that have deteriorated w/ time, limited in size, not waterproof, heavy, and costly to replace/repair. When my lever broke and I couldn't open one of the bags and learned it'd be nearly $200 to fix or replace, I searched for a reasonable replacement. Wow! These bags are cheaper, lighter, easy to install, waterproof, and enable much more storage! Can't lock them but have a lockable Givi topcase. And doubt anyone wants to figure out how to get into these bags or to steal them. If they do, I'll simple replace b/c the price/value is brilliant. I highle recommend these bags as a solution to carrying cargo whether around town or on trips.",

The straps are really well designed, and I was able to attach these bags \"securely\" to my existing bag mounts/frames. In addition, I find them easy to open and close, and I'm impressed with the way they stay put at higher speeds. I'm going to keep these bags on my bike and just use my aluminum panniers for long highway rides. P.s. The yellow looks better than I thought it would.",

A refreshing design when so many other manufacturers have one bazillion straps. I could've gotten soft luggage system, but I chose these for their simplicity. While these may shred in the event of a serious crash, you can always patch them with other waterproof PVC material of some sort, however, realize that gear could fall out since these don't rely on a tough inner waterproof bag like many systems. The material seems tough though so I'm not too worried. Very nice product.",

      "text": "Mounted to a 2018 Suzuki DR-Z400 (Precision Motorcycle Racks were also installed). I do multi-day, dual-sport rides, sometimes on fairly technical terrain. The soft saddlebags are great because you can brush your leg on them and they deflect (unlike hard-case bags). They tuck in nicely and can be mounted low to keep the center of gravity lower. I've scraped the bags on brush without any signs of wear or damage. They come with luggage bag inserts so you don't have to take them on and off every day. I haven't been in a downpour (or deep water crossing) but my stuff never got wet after riding in rainy conditions. The bags can be removed and attached without using tools.",
