I did not like that the straps were only partially padded on the side facing my foot so the the raw strap material was exposed and less comfy. Where the straps attached to the shoe bed they seemed to be coming apart upon arrival. The quality of these was less than I expect from teva.",

So I would recommend wearing some sort of protection (eg. band-aids) on sensitive areas until the sandals really adapt well to your feet.

My second pair just wore out on a rough, muddy hike. I was sad that I couldn't buy the exact same color, but tried the ones with the ugly name - bungee cord.

If the cord material were a little softer it would be better. I do like the way it snugs up nicely around the heal. I seem to be in-between sizes so am struggling to find a sandal that fits perfectly. I ordered this one because it has some many ways to adjust it. The color also goes with anything.",

I walked all day in them and didn't have any of the rubbing that you would expect with completely unbroken in shoes. I got these to walk at work, and I know now I made the right choice. I will definitely buy from this brand again when these eventually wear out.",

Everyone is right about the length of the velcro straps. The most important one is too short. I thought about keeping them and maybe adding some velcro to make sure they would stay together.

They are still firmly attached under/through the sole so it probably won't be an issue.",

If you're thinking about hiking up an incline, forget it. I didn't last more than 20 minutes before I changed over to my $3 flip flops which ended up being 100x better. Not only that, the glue holding the straps on both sides is already falling apart. After one day of wear! I can't believe I spent $70 on such poorly made shoes.",

I wanted something in between Teva's classic sandals (too bulky for my tiny feet) and their really strappy ones (think Kayenta), and these fit the bill perfectly. I love the thicker ankle strap combined with the strappy front. I know I'll get a lot of use out of these come summer--farmer's market days, walking/biking to work, camp shoes, they're even nice enough looking to wear with sundresses for cookouts.",
