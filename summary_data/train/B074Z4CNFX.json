      "text": "My previous 21-inch screens always felt sufficient-to-large but instantly looked tiny with this between them (1st illustration). The amount of screen-space and pixel-count at first felt huge but, unfortunately, I got used to it very quickly. The side-screens now feel cramped whenever they're displaying anything more detailed than thumbnails or YouTube. My greatest fear is that I really, really, want to buy another two of these now but can't afford it! It performs perfectly. Although purists might want a higher refresh-rate if they are mainly playing twitch shooters this has not affected my work, watching videos, the slower/builder games I usually play or ARMA/Tomb Raider/Hitman when I have tried those.

The picture quality is superb, the resolution amazing - can put a number of windows all on one screen and work just on the one monitor - really useful for work. Lightroom works well using just this monitor; no real need for a second one - its so big and such high res. Love it basically.",

Basically, it's a great monitor for the price. Details wise, basically go read the various online review articles if you want a proper assessment. But briefly: Contrast is fantastic. HDR is so-so, but I really don't mind because the high contrast looks great anyway. Speakers are fine for loud games/films but annoying in that they're just little too quiet for the quiet moments of films. Viewing angles great, response times seem reasonable to me.",

Physical height is similar although the picture area is much larger, especially at 4k resolution. The iMac detected the screen immediately on either HDMI or Displayport inputs and the Mac is almost seamless moving between the 2 screens. Colours are great although I'm not a fan of HDR, far too rich and saturated for me but in standard mode it matches closely the iMac Retina screen which I have set to 3200x1800. Terrific value at under \u00a3400",

Movies are a treat on this thing, but bear in mind you will need good quality movies (blu rays) to make it shine.
