I knew where the product was at all times and it was at my front step on the day it was expected. I wish the box holding the flutes came in was not scuffed up though. Looks like I had the box in my basement and I just regifted. This box was inside the actual shipping box. So it shouldn't have been so scuffed up. I had no choice but to present the gift this way.",
