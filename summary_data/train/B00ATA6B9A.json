I\u2019m going to get more. Update: 11/14/17. 1 problem, as I spray, it drips down the front, it has happened on each can I use, not sure why this is happening, maybe to 1 can but not to 5 cans so far.

So something has changed because it has a tan cap now. I understand they do redesign packaging, but the formula has definitely changed. Will be sending a message to the company on this one.",
