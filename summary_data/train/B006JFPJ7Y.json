The cost of this cutter is less then the broken glass I waisted on the first old cutter I am convinced so should yiou",

I needed to use the cutter to score an old piece of glass and get it into a few different smaller pieces for a fixed window in a tree stand and this cutter scored the glass with ease. Sure, it's pricey, but if you want something you can depend on, then go with the TOYO Supercutter.",

Cutter worked well, even for a novice. I put a few drops of oil in the handle, as other reviewers suggested (rather than fill it), but it turned out to be easier for me to just dip the tip in oil between cuts. Likely just my lack of experience. There were less expensive cutters out there, but I thought the price was reasonable, since one bad cut would have equaled the price of the tool.",
