The material is a little thicker than i expected and it was odd feeling at first, but I got used to it quickly. I\u2019m sure the point of the thickness is to prevent leakage.",

I'm 5'5\", 135 lbs, and wear a 34C and the large size is snug, there's strange gaping along the armpit seam, and the material is scratchy and had no stretch. So disappointed by Lamaze. Really surprised they will put out a product with such poor quality. UPDATE: I tried to sleep in this for 2 hours last night and it was so uncomfortable I couldn't sleep AND it gave me a RASH.

It indents/imprints on your back and ends up making for a rash in the morning. I have worn these many times to see if perhaps it was a one time thing, but alas it has happened every time. Additionally, they tend to make one boob fold under and one fold over the midline piece in an uncomfortable way when you wake up in the morning.",

So I ordered a large dark grey. When the large came and I opened it, it smelled so horrible. I washed it twice and it still stinks. I cant describe the smell but the whole second floor of my house smells like it. I might just throw it in the trash. Two stars. I don't recommend this product.",

Once I bought the Lamaze Maternity Cotton Spandex Sleep Bra and my nights got much better! It was comfortable enough to sleep in or wear around the house when I didn't have errands to run. It also reduced the pain/soreness felt at night and I no longer had to hold my boobs to go to the restroom. I plan to purchase more of these very soon.",

My other bras/tanks, come out clean with just a little pre-treating with dish soap, but this one doesn't, and I don't have time for lots of scrubbing and bleaching (not that anyone sees the stains, but still, it's nice to look and feel clean).",
