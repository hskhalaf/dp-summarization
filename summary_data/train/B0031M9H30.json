I bought mine off Amazon & I'm kicking myself because I would have saved tonnes of money had I bought this one sooner. I wasted money on several different motion sensor bins before buying this. Besides, it looks cute in my kitchen get compliments all the time. Love love love it.",

My suggestion to the company is to make a more durable product for the price,or lower the price; correct the battery housing issue. This is a good product just not worth the price.",
