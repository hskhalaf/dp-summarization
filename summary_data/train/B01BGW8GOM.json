I took my kit to Custom Audio Concepts (very respected) and the installer (who wasn't just a kid) refused to install the wiring kit in my car. He even said he used to install car audio \"in the hood\" and would never have installed these. Mentioned that there are tweeter speaker wires that are thicker than these. But overall very pleased with the subwoofer and amp. It shakes my lanyard on my rear view mirror on only half volume!",

I also opted for the Planet Audio amp instead of the MTX brand amp because I heard the MTX amp has issues with overheating. I also didn't want a generic brand amp like BOSS or Crunch, no offense. One thing to note is that the wiring for this kit is GARBAGE. Do not under any circumstances use the amp wiring kit provided in this package. I ordered a separate kit online. The 8 gauge wiring provided is way too thin, I'd go so far as to call it speaker wire.",

So I took my car to Best Buy to have them install it and just for new wires it was $100 along with a $200 instillation fee. So in the long run these speakers are gonna be around $400-$500 WITHOUT instillation. Save yourself some trouble go to a local store such as Best Buy and just pick them out and have them install them saves money and hassle.",

    "description": "This is a complete package! Package includes, MTX loaded car subwoofer system with Mono amplifier and complete amplifier installation kit! The MTX TNE212D combines great subwoofer design with perfect enclosure design to deliver bass that far exceeds expectations. The unit is a dual 12\" sealed enclosure that has a single terminal cup showing a final 2O load to any connected amplifier. The Terminator subwoofers used in the enclosure include polypropylene dustcaps that are durable allowing them to survive the rigors of most trunks and are lightweight allowing them to efficiently move using less power. Each subwoofer can handle 200 watts RMS power, resulting in a power level of 400 watts RMS/800 watts Peak for the entire enclosure. The subwoofers also incorporate Spider Plateau Venting, which is a mechanical cooling process that allows the subwoofer to continually refresh the air around the voice coil helping to dissipate the heat generated during extended play. The enclosure itself is made using extra strength 5/8\" MDF (medium density fiberboard) which is the preferred material for subwoofer enclosures. Where other manufacturers only use a 1/2\" board, the MTX 5/8\" board is stronger ensuring that the enclosure can contain the massive low frequency sound waves generated by the subwoofers without problems. Thunder Bass, Hard hitting Dual 12 inch MTX subwoofers Designed For SPL, Rock your car and the neighborhood! Easy Installation, Mounts quickly in most trunks and SUVs We are an authorized MTX dealer!",
