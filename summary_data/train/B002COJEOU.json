I called the company and they gave me a phone number for support. Turns out it's a 3rd party that charges a fortune for support. I called D-Link back and they finally tell me that they've ended support for this router and won't help me configure it. After much trying, I admitted defeat and returned it.",

      "text": "Solid little box that delivers tremendous performance in a very tiny and cheap package. I have this unit connected to a 60Mb metro-ethernet circuit (gigabit hand-off from the carrier). During testing when the carrier had rate limits disabled I was able to push this box to download at a rate of 500Mb and upload at 400Mb (using the default 1500 byte MTU). On LAN-to-LAN transfers it also performs extremely well. Hang a few gigabit switches off of this unit and you have yourself a nice little router for a SOHO. I highly recommend this product.",

Even after I assign the ip for static router it will only stay up for day if I am lucky. I mostly use this with ethernet cables and 1wireless device. It fails as a router which why I bought it. I have now taken it back and ordered the asus Rt-56 from amazon. The asus works great without having to reset every day and some times every couple of hours like the dlink.",
