I have it on a 15amp circuit with my whole entertainment center and it hasn't tripped the breaker even when I plug the vacuum into the same circuit.

I don\u2019t know if it was enroute while being shipped or if it was the movement on the shipment van to my house, but there are several dents on the bottom sides of this fridge. It seems to work fine so far but I am quite upset that the item is athletically damaged (again this is only the first day of use). If it appears that the item is not going to function properly, I will update my review. I did buy the warranty associated with this product as well.",

      "text": "Let me start by being honest, at first I was so skeptical about the size and if this freezer would have enough space for the meats i needed to keep frozen. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try and to my surprise OMG this freezer is definitely spacious!! It is quiet, convenient and larger than I had expected. I am glad I brought this freezer and it arrived on time with NO DELAY!! If you\u2019re looking for a good freezer this is a great product!",

It is also very quiet. I use it to store homemade bone broth and overflow from the freezer attached to the fridge. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's not self-defrosting.",

Took about 24 hours and a little fiddling with the temperature dial, but has now been keeping a nice cold temperature. It does make some minor noises, but overall actually very quiet. Overall, happy with my purchase.",
