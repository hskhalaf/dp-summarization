      "text": "As others have noted, the spring for the buckle mechanism interferes with the threading of the strap and rubs into the strap. On other brand lashing straps, the spring is anchored on a separate brace and never comes in contact with the strap itself. The Keeper straps will slip, whether due to the poor buckle design or the teeth on the buckle. These were cheap, but I would have spent more to get better designed straps like those I previously owned. That's the big problem buying online - you can't fully see the product. I recently purchased some NRS straps, which have a far superior design and are easily threaded, unlike the Keepers.",
