My sis n law has had same issues with hers falling aprart in 6 or 7 months and she gets hers from the store not online so I don't think its an Amazon/Online problem. Asics has gone to cheap materials and workmanship so its time for a new brand! They were a great brand for many years-We will miss them:( UNHAPPY!",

I will say I did prefer the Kayano 23 over the 22, now that the price has come down a bit I will be switching back. The 23 has firmer foam in the mid foot.

Even if you don't do any kind of sport they are much more comfortable than the other shoes I had (I had Mizunos, Nikes, Adidas, New Balances and they aren't even close to this). Also, all Asics Kayanos I had lasted 2 years and I got rid of them because I was tired to see them there. One thing, for other brands I use 9.5 but for these guys I had to go with 10. Can't go wrong with this.",

The Gel Kayano 22's were to replace the Gel Kayano 20's which were absolutely perfect. I was surprised in how poor the Kayano 22's fit. They were tight at the toe and walking in them for 30 minutes let alone running was agonizing. something definitely wasn't right. Fortunately, Amazon has made the whole return process very easy.",
