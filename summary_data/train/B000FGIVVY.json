It comes with just the right amount of stuff and fits back into the basket nicely, no need to jam things in. It is also very durable as she has dropped a few items a few times and nothing has broken yet. The only reason I gave it four stars is because while the basket is so cute it becomes lopsided due to the fact that it only has one handle and not two. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend though and fellow tea lover.",

There was also a metal wire (used to create the basket lid hinge) sticking up past the basket lining which could possibly pose an injury.

It would be nice if the basket had some sort of protective storage as the pieces are fragile - Mom's going to have to get creative for that. I'd also suggest an additional pattern choice or two.
