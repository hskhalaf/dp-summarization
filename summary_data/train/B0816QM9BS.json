Previous Sidi and Specialized trail or CC shoes didn't get fit right for both extremes without pressure points from ratchet. Boa straps were better but not as good as laces. Tying these take me about 20 seconds longer than the ratchet or boa on other shoes. After they are tied, it takes an additional three to four seconds to tuck the laces under an elastic strap - very easy. I'm considering buying another pair to has a reserve - they bring me joy.",
