      "text": "1 star is too many, should be ZERO. I've had it with cartridges not being recognized errors! Seriously, I have never once been able to change a cartridge in this thing without fighting with it for hours. Today was the last straw, I changed the black ink and all of the sudden it can't recognize the Yellow cartridge, which is full. After 30 minutes of trying different things I'm done. Just ordered a different printer (NOT Epson) and I'm now going to take this hunk of garbage out to the garage and take a sledge hammer to it. I will NEVER buy Epson again and I strongly advise all reading this to save themselves and don't buy Epson.",

      "text": "I trust cnet ratings and this printer is rated very high. It prints fast and accurate. I have it hooked up to my wifi and really enjoy the luxury of wireless printing. The scanning and copying is also high quality. The cost of ink is also very economical, it comes with two cartridges of black and 3 individual cartridges of the cyan, magenta, and yellow. I hardly have to replace the latter 3, however the black seems to go first. Overall, I highly recommend this printer. I have owned this printer since 2013, and it is still working great!",

We used the included disk to load the drivers to our laptop computers and were able to download the drivers from the web for our daughter's netbook. Print quality is excellent (love the auto duplex). If you're interested in a quality, low cost printer for everyday home print jobs you cannot go wrong with this purchase.",

The on-device screen can angle up in case the printer is lower than eye level. The drivers can update themselves for you. It actually ASKS if you want to install the Epson monitor icon in your system tray, it doesn't do it without your consent, requiring you to remove the thing later. The software overall is great, both on the device and the drivers. I don't think the on-device UI could be much better given how small it is. And of course, it makes some very nice prints for the money, too.",

Assuming that you don't care about scanning documents to Word which it can't do. The Epson people were very nice to deal with but I didn't want to do so and the overall experience was poor.",

I went for the Expression Premium XP800, which turned out to be very good. No feeder lines on the printout!",

After a paper jam, I often have to turn the printer off and back on to get the screen to clear. And now, a little over a year after purchase, the front screen broke completely and the printer will not turn on at all. Finally, the customer service is non-existent. After calling three numbers, the only number they keep sending me to is one that simply hangs up. I will definitely steer clear of Epson in the future.",

Both of these needs are met very well. Wireless printing is a breeze. Fax, scan and copy work very well. Everyday printing tasks are done without a problem. My only disappointment is that the printer, which has two paper trays, will not print photographs on photo paper from one tray and print on paper from the other. Several communications with Epson support have not provided a solution. This is not a major problem but a minor inconvenience that should be an easy fix.",

Had been using an old B&W laser for higher quality for about 8 years, and was very pleased with the printing first time out on this Epson.
