I don\u2019t like folding it over one edge of my mat because then the one side has a bump. It is more non-slip than the mangofit, but still I like my Yogitoes better.

Got this in time for my 2nd class and the difference was night and day. No more slipping! If that wasn't good enough on it's own, they throw in a carrying bag and spray bottle! (You're supposed to spray the towel before starting your routine to \"activate\" the non-slip properties? Sounded weird to me but worked perfectly!) Much better solution then wearing crazy looking toeless socks and gloves! Also love that i can just wash the towel now instead of having to constantly wipe down the mat.",

This was the case even in the more vigorous classes. The mats in my studio are just slightly larger than this towel, therefore I cant use the corner pockets, but that hasn't caused any issues with the function of this towel. Very happy with the product. I wash it in the washing machine (warm cycle) and air dry it.",

Slipper for feet and hands in downward dog and warrior poses, etc. Yes, they say you can spray it with water to improve traction, but not ideal in yoga studio and with how much you find you have to keep spraying.

This yoga towel is on the thinner side and has a waffle texture which is not as soft as some other towels. It air dries pretty quickly. I have a Manduka Pro mat and it covers most of the mat except about an inch on each side.",

      "text": "I purchased this towel to use with the Heathyoga ProGrip Non Slip Yoga Mat with Alignment Lines, Revolutionary Wet-Grip Surface & Eco Friendly Material. Previously I was using a beach towel during hot yoga, and it would slide and bunch up. This towel slips over the ends of the mat, anchoring it in place. It grips to the mat, so my feet do not slide in certain poses. There is very minimal bunching of the towel on occasion. The towel covers the mat 99.8%. The width is just a bit short. Will most likely purchase another one.",
