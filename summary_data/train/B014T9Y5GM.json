      "text": "I am happy with this loom and stand. I waxed them before I put them together and will rewax after 1 month because it is very dry in my house in the winter. What I don't like is the way the reeds slip out in the upper position. I am trying different things to prevent this and still make it easy to change reed position. I have made several pillow covers, table runners, and shawls so far. The hardest part is warping the loom. The rest is easy.",

The angle on the rear legs is off, which means the little side shelves slope downward toward the back and the back of the loom will not fit into its grooves. Kind of a pain.",
