We had tried everything imaginable to get him to stop this. This took care of both problems. I am going to add some of this to my carpet shampoo when I clean the carpet. I'm so happy I have found this easy solution to both problems.",

    "description": "Size:24-OunceNature\u2019s Miracle pet stain and odor removers have been a trusted brand for pet mess cleanup for more than 35 years. Whatever pets do, you can trust Nature\u2019s Miracle stain and odor removers, training aids, disinfectants and litter products to undo.\n\nThis pet stain and odor remover with the naturally repellent scent helps prevent pets from revisiting and marking the same spot twice. When sprayed on previously marked areas, Nature\u2019s Miracle No More Marking\u2122 works to eliminate stains and odors leaving behind lemongrass and cinnamon scents. These scents repel and help prevent dogs from returning to the area. Ideal to use when trying to break dogs\u2019 marking habits, this product will repel dogs while working to eliminate tough, deep-set urine stains and odors. This product comes in both a 24 fl oz spray and a 128 fl oz pour. This product is safe to use around pets and home, when used as directed.\n\nWe recommend using Nature\u2019s Miracle No More Marking in conjunction with training, such as praising your pet when positive behavior is exhibited. Make sure to thoroughly soak previously stained areas with this product. Wait five minutes then pat down the area with a cloth. If you are struggling with a pet that repetitively marks the same area, a second application may be needed. \n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nTHE NATURE'S MIRACLE STORY\nBehind the Nature\u2019s Miracle formula is a family that loves their pets. In 1981, the Original Nature\u2019s Miracle product (intended for use in preschools), was used by founder Joe Weiss to clean-up a pet accident. To his surprise, the formula worked quickly to remove the stain and the odor. Pleased with the success, Joe produced 24 bottles of Nature\u2019s Miracle \u201cPet Mess Easy Clean-up.\u201d The new cleaner sold out in 48 hours! Pet owners discovered that the formula was incredibly effective at removing their pet\u2019s stubborn stains and odors, and Nature\u2019s Miracle Stain and Odor Remover was born. Today, Nature\u2019s Miracle remains one of the top pet-mess cleanup solutions for pet owners everywhere.\n\nNature's Miracle Stain & Odor Remover is effective in fighting ALL organic stains, including the ones made by your pet. HOW IT WORKS\nNature\u2019s Miracle No More Marking Stain and Odor Remover is the best choice for pet owners looking to remove stains and odors as well as prevent future instances of marking or re-soiling. Pets often mark or have accidents in areas that they have visited in the past due to lingering odors, residues, and habit. The No More Marking formula helps to prevent this type of behavior in your pet by combining stain and odor-removing technology with pet-safe repellents. While these repellents keep your pet safely away, Nature\u2019s Miracle No More Marking Stain and Odor Remover works to remove stains and odors such as grass, urine, vomit, blood, and other organic materials.
