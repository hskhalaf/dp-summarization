Thanksgiving rolled around and I tried it on my turkey. I was surprised how effortless it was to have beautiful deli slices. i later started using the knife to slice salamis, and pepperonis. In a drunken stroke of brilliance, I discovered how useful it was for slicing a beautiful cooked steak (after letting the meat rest, of course). Restaurant quality slices of a medium-cooked steak is an effortless crowd pleaser. Why doesn\u2019t everyone have one of these in their kitchen?",

First off - the plastic guides are so weak that it is impossible to rely on them to cut a straight slice of any uniform thickness. When I tried to hold the guide down while cutting, the handle part twisted and provided little-to-no support. Next, the design does not allow for the use of an electric knife though the guides are so flimsy you could probably force one in between anyway. The bottom line is save your money and look for something built with quality materials.",

The on button which you have to pull has a small bump to pull on and with greasy hands is impossible to hold. The knife also smells. I imagine the smell is because it was working so hard at not cutting. Trash. Zero stars.",

I had an old Black & Decker- wish I'd kept it. Several weeks later, I finally threw this in the trash and am looking at different brands. So dull I couldn't even cut a fresh loaf of bread with it-- a regular knife is sharper and faster.... I hate this thing.

My only complaint with it would be that the handle does heat up fast with continous use but I guess it isnt really made for what I'm using it for.

I chose this Proctor Silex knife for it's good reviews, it's longer blade, and the company's general reputation. I'm not disappointed. The knife is sturdy, the blades sit firmly in the handle, it's easy and comfortable to reach the ON button, easy to release the blades. The blades are serrated, which works well for me, as I use the knife mostly for slicing homemade bread. After using it 5-6 times, I'm very pleased with this knife and highly recommend.",

The Hamilton Beach model looks identical but the blades are 7.5 inches and the \"trigger\" has rubber on it making it easier to keep it on while cutting. I bought both...but kept the Hamilton Beach model and gave this one as a gift. I would say these knives are not the best but they do the job for $20. I've only used it to cut turkey and ham. Cuts meat fine but don't expect to be cutting through joints.",
