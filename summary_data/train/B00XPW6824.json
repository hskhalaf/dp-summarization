The Smart Bridge is easy to set up, and wiring is as simple as it gets. Pairing all the components was easy, so I was up and running in only a few minutes. I probably spent more time messing around with the packaging than anything else. My only complaint is that the remotes come only with pedestals, and no wall-mounting plates that allow them to be put alongside other switches. These plates aren't expensive, but they are hard to find in stores, so just be prepared to mount using removable adhesive strips (which work very well).",

It works with Apple Homekit as well as Amazon Echo. If you are even halfway handy, you can easily install this yourself. If you have a three-way light switch, you will need to utilize the remote. Make sure you follow their directions and mark the wires as indicated. If it's a standard light switch, it's a piece of cake.",

This one you can do with the app, plus it's Apple HomeKit compatible, also has some neat features like geofencing, and scene programming. I've bought more of these to include the non-dimmer switch, which I used to control a three way garage light. I've installed others in places where it makes sense to have remote control of lighting.",
