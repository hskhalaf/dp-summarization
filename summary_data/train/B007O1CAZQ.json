      "text": "This cooler was my favorite purchase of the summer! After using this cooler several times over the past several months, I'm still as much in love with it as the first time. Everyone who sees it wants one. Not only is the cooler a statement piece but it holds plenty of bottles of wine and other beverage along with a few bags of ice. The cooler doesn't leak and the top tray stays in place at all times. I'm glad I read another reviewer suggestion to tie a string to the stopper to make it easy to get out. I did that from the start and have never a problem. I highly recommend this cooler.",

The item came as described and after taking two minutes to to attach the bottom half to the upper half, the table moved out to our patio. No issues with the top staying up as long as you follow the instructions. The little silver thing in the middle is not a huge concern. Build quality seems good and overall it fills out needs.",
