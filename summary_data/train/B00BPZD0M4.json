I have the Samyang 12mm and while it takes great photos, I don\u2019t enjoy manual focus. I didn\u2019t have huge expectations for this lens but I was blown away by the photos it took. Great color and super sharp. 90% of my 1,500 photos were taken with this lens. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an inexpensive lens which takes fantastic photos!!!!",

      "text": "There's not a lot left to be said about this lens that hasn't already. I got this lens for my A7R. Yes, it is a full-frame camera, and this is a crop-sensor lens. Thankfully, Sony's full-frame Alpha series can easily adapt to using crop-sensor lenses. You'll lose resolution, but it won't be an issue, if you're shooting for digital purposes! Image quality is nice and sharp! There is very little lens distortion or blur around the edges, making this an ideal choice for landscape photography. I'll attach some sample shots I've taken.",

BUT - I really wish there was a 24mm in the Sigma f/2.8 DN series (equiv 35mm on full frame). It would be my walk around lens in a heartbeat. A 24mm and the Sigma 60mm would be the perfect pair for the Sony APS-C bodies, and they'd sell a ton of them. I think Sigma missed the boat on this one.",

Be aware of the filter size though - different than my SEL35F18, which means i need to buy more filters. Overall, fantastic image quality and worth even more than the price paid!",

      "text": "I paired this Sigma 19mm and the 30mm with the Panasonic 45-150 for a well-rounded set of focal lengths with similar quality (metal/brass mounts, polished metal finishes on top, and modest apertures). This is my second time trying micro-four thirds format and since the first time, Sigma has produced some intriguing lenses which made me give the format another try. And of course, my subject choice has changed away from wildlife to urban shooting which I believe these new lenses are worth a try.",
