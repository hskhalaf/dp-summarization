Maybe the US department of education should limit the length of contracts they make with industry partners to less than a generation!!",

It has a large enough display to hold multiple calculations and overall can handle a beating. (If you consider a TI-34 calculator falling down a 1-story flight of stairs in a middle school as a beating.) Overall would recommend this for Middle School students!",

It's great because you can enter lists of numbers and do simple statistical functions (standard deviation, mean, etc.) and will work in nearly any class that a graphing calculator is not allowed. Much easier display and use than other models such as the TI-30.",
