It took me a couple tries to get it down right, but once you get the hang of it, it is a great tool. Highly recommended.",

I use it to strap boxes together to make one box, and heavily packed ones where you need miles of tape just to keep the flaps down and the sides from ripping. Didn't come with instructions on how to use it but I found a YouTube video which clearly shows how. Once you know how its so easy a 5th grader can do it!",
