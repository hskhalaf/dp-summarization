I took a chance and bought my tools, including this kit. 6 days later and not a single chip! And this is my first time ever applying gel to my nails myself. I goofed and got a little on my cuticles, which is a big no-no, but the polish still hasn't chipped. I also apply the oil to my cuticles everyday and they don't look messy and ragged. This lit is awesome!",

Be careful about flooding the cuticles with this top coat, because the viscosity is on the thinner-moderate side. The \"Foundation\" gel, has the shorter tipped brush applicator, and the viscosity of this product is on the thicker side. The pH Bond is pretty basic. The \"Nourish\" cuticle oil has a pleasant smell, and, is comparable to other cuticle oils.",

Note for those new at doing their own gel nails: Especially with the top coat, be sure to wipe off any excess when you take the brush out of the bottle. Because it is clear, it is easy to put too much on and not really see that it's pooling at your cuticles. Then once you cure it, theres not much you can do. That was my newbie mistake - but now that I know, it works perfectly and looks great every time!",

Fixable by wiping with acetone. Really love the wide and rounded brush on the Top It Off top coat! It makes application super easy and top coat is lovely shiny.

I have been doing at home gel manicures for about a year now but previously using the brand \u201cGellen\u201d for my top/bottom coat. My manicures usually would only last 5 days top and always chip easily. I was hesitant to buy Gelish because of the price but I knew it was a good quality since salons use it. And i was right. So far I am on day 7 and going strong. Highly recommend to splurge a little and buy!",

It does not come with any color so I did purchase that seperatly. I love this brand and the way the nails came out was beautiful. I have had the same color on for almost 2 weeks now and not one scratch or lifting of the polish! I will be buying more colors in the very near future and staying with this great brand!",

Based on the chemical formulation of the gel polishes and the type of lamp used to cure them, you can under or overcure the gel polish.

However, it's not so bad with my lamp when I apply a thin layer and the burning sensation goes away after a few seconds.",
