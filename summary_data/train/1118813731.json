I like how easily the chapters are to read and how I can jump between chapters. Also, I do like that the answer key has a small explanation as to why that is the correct answer. Overall I do like it a lot. Again, this will not be my only form of study, this is more of a warm up to get me use to focusing and studying again.",

The book does provide perspective and has plenty of tips for taking the exam. As with all editions of the Dummies series, this book is nicely organized and written in a user friendly manner. If you are looking for an introduction to the field, this is more than adequate. But for actual test prep, look elsewhere.",
