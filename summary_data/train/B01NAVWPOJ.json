It registered rapidly. I only wish it had a larger fingerprint surface to be able to detect a larger portion of your print. I have been using it now for a couple of months and have never missed a stroke. I have occasionally tried other UNregistered fingers and it refuses them. Much better than the Samsung phone fingerprint detection.",

To reduce the chance of accidentally of installing unwanted software, I changed the Windows 10 security settings to always show the UAC prior to installing software. It's not a setting I would choose unless I had the fingerprint reader. This is one case where having the fingerprint makes me much more secure.",
