I just purchased a recent 65\" 8-series Samsung TV and was looking for a Samsung soundbar for better integration. I wasn't necessarily looking to have the loudest speaker, but wanted a higher fidelity sound for listening to music and watching movies. The installation was quick and seamless, but the sound was marginally better than the TV. I adjusted various settings, used different connections, wireless and wired, which made no difference. Very disappointed.",
