The automatic shut-off is very helpful; no need to watch the clock to treat each area the same amount of time. There is a drastic difference in my face on the days I use it. I would definitely recommend it without reservation.",

My doctor suggested 20 minutes a day per area for 2 weeks, then maintenance treatments, despite directions included w device, and I have been very happy. It's only been a few days, so I haven't noticed a huge change in any major wrinkles, but my acne cleared up and my skin is not red for the first time since high school! Used it on some small spider veins from having my daughter and they also show a change after only a few days. Great product!",

      "QUICK AND EASY TO USE \u2013 The Pulsaderm Red LED should ideally be used in 3 minute treatments 3 times a week. Before use, make sure that your skin is clean, free from any makeup, oil, or dirt. Use the included safety goggles as a precaution to shield your eyes from the light. The non-coherent light is not harmful to the eyes. Gently place the device over the desired skin area and hold it in place! No other tools or products are needed.",
