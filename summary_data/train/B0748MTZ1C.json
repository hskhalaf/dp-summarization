Mic quality is really good, I'm told, I speak very quietly but have no problem being heard. The range gets a bit limited when too many obstructions are involved. The battery life is insane on this thing and I love it. I charge it once every 1-2 weeks when using for varying times, 1-4 hours a day, sometimes daily but at least 4-5 days a week.",

I don't think my head is small (7.5 baseball hat size), and I couldn't even look down at my shoes without the headset falling off.

Too much bass so the in-game sounds are drowned out which makes it impossible to hear footsteps and sound queues at all. Battery when from 100% to 30% in about 2 hours. I'm not sure if I just got a bad pair but I ended up returning these. There are much better products out there in this price range.",

The microphone is very accessible with a flip feature for muting and unmuting and also side panel buttons as well.

I still would recommend this headset for its sound quality and price point for a wireless headset.",

I even reached out to CORSAIR's support team to see what I could do (thinking maybe there was a driver missing or something) but they just said no, that's how its supposed to sound. This headset would be fine if it cost $20, but it in no way is worth what they are charging.",

The only issues are the battery life if you forget to turn it off, and that the adjustable length for head sizes does sometimes expand when you use it for long periods just due to use, but once you readjust it there's no problems. In terms of staying on your head, the only way it'll fall off is If you move your head down and look at the floor for a long period or lean your head back for a long period. Otherwise it'll stay on nicely, with only minor adjustments in long play sessions.",

CUE software is pretty sweet. The only change I\u2019d personally like is a wheel for the volume instead of the switch they have. Again, this is just personal preference most likely due to using the G930\u2019s for so long. I would recommend them to anyone unless you have a need to be far from the receiver.",
