But the fun does not stop there, I have also made excellent frozen eggrolls, cheese toast, and today for the first time, bacon! The bacon came out absolutely perfect and I did not have to turn it over, stayed flat ,perfectly crisp, and ready to serve . And the only cleanup was rinsing off the pan in warm soapy water .",

This little oven is phenomenal at cooking pizzas, grilled sandwiches, chicken nuggets, garlic bread, quesadillas, etc. I love this machine! Even thought it has an open design, it doesn't seem to emit too much heat. Obviously the top of the unit gets very hot, so use caution. The tray washes up in a second, too. Best investment for the kitchen in years.",

The Ronco just doesnt cook properly, food is always undercooked and doesnt cook as evenly. It takes twice as long to cook a pizza than the directions suggest. However, I love the on/off feature which is why I purchased this pizza oven, because for some reason the Pizzazz doesnt offer an on/off switch. I also like the style, and the warming tray on top.",

It cooked quickly and evenly, much more better than an oven. Next I tried dinner fries and they turned out great. Next came corn dogs, chicken wing, chicken nuggets and they are came out cooked perfectly due to the rotating dish. Love it. But I especially like the warming tray until you are ready to serve. So very convenient! The Ronco is not very big and stores easily in my cabinet for when ever I need to use it. Just love it!",
