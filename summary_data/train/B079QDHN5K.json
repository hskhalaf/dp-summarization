Of course, it\u2019s printed clearly that this is not that in the product info, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m giving it a three-star review. It gets a three star review because it costs twice as much as other brands of 3/16 bubble wrap and it\u2019s the same stuff. So, it\u2019s perfectly fine bubble wrap, it\u2019s just overpriced for what it is. If it were 12\u201d x 60\u201d of 5/16 bubble wrap, it would be a steal.",
