We use the dispenser for storing drinking water, can't imagine other beverages with acidity will have it's impact on . We are not sure how long it has been disintegrated, and how long we have been taken down this materials with our water. From looking at the inside of the spigot, most of the silver coating have been gone. Buyer should check on your!",

No problems with leakage around the spout and the directions provide instructions for how to deal with issues if it does happen. I did follow another reviewer's advice and use a skinny vase filled with ice put in the middle because the ice on the bottom ends up melting and doesn't provide enough chill. The only other issue is one I have with all of these type of dispensers and that is the location of the spout - it should be lower. As it is, you have to have a couple of quarts in before it will start dispensing. Overall I would recommend these.",

But somehow during that time the punch left an etch mark all around the container about half way down. I only hand washed it with a soft sponge and you can feel the etching is permanent. I was hoping for the convenience of plastic but it seems I'll have to choose glass which I know will hold up to juice.",

USEFUL HINT: Fill the Jar completely with ice (some sliced lemons) add a little bit of water- and you'll have COLD water all day long as the water melts. Clean look with great lines that can handle a posh buffet or just a water dispenser on the counter. Hope this review was helpful!!!",

The base holds a regular size whipped topping container that can be filled with water and frozen to keep the beverages cold without the fear of diluting them too much with adding too much ice in the beverages themselves. Definitely a \"must have\" in my book! A great price too!",
