But the refurbished one lasted six months. Anyway, save your money and buy a different style and brand.",

Not a perfect purchase, but we have enjoyed it.",

She's tried putting dryer sheets inside her robe (wouldn't want it touching the heating part), and has run it through numerous cycles, but nothing has worked. Still, she'd rather have a warm robe that smells somewhat like plastic than a cold robe that doesn't.",

I am keeping an eye on it, but given that we use it multiple times a day, I hope it is just an anomaly.

      "text": "I bought this style of towel warmer because I thought my wife would like it. I was not expecting alot the other style from brookstone got really mixed reviews. But this one works great, took about 5 cycles to burn off the factory smell but warms the towels nicely. My wife even commented that it's almost too hot. I don't write many reviews but this one deserves the high rating!!!",

I guess the definition of \"large\" comes into question. My two large towels wouldn't fit in it. I gave this to my wife for Mothers Day, and she loved it! I think this will make for some great presents this year. I intend to buy more as gifts.",

Other than that, not a good product - when the power is on, it emits a smell, like a wire insulation is being overheated. If you do not intend to use this product, I recommend it, as it looks nice just sitting in your bathroom. When you use it, it does manage to heat the towels nicely (much better than a heated towel rack) and evenly.",

For those that say only the towel smells- when you dry your kids hair quickly and then wrap it around them, they will complain about that smell! It shows no sign of getting better. However, it was a good value, as towel warmers go- and we do like using it. No wonder they don't have this at the store currently- the smell would cause no-one to by it if they smelled it in person!",
