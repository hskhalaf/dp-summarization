      "text": "The headphones sounds great. For the price it's as good as it gets. Wire is not the strongest I have seen but with careful use it won't break for a long time. Battery is also quite good. 2 minor issues , 1)I expect these type of headphones to have magnets so they can stick together around your neck when you're not using them. This doesn't have that. 2) It charges via micro USB. It's not acceptable in 2020 ; we're in USB C era now. Other than that I think it's a good pair of headphones for the money.",
