      "title": "Not Recommended For An Invalid",
      "text": "While I love many of this tray's features, there are aspects that I hadn't expected to not be so great. I don't recommend this for an invalid with arm strength issues as the tray itself is really heavy and one needs some strength to move it off their lap. The locking metal slide for the legs does not hold well at all so the legs can collapse unexpectedly. The little side/under drawer is quite loose and has no locking mechanism. It slides in and out with the trays movement, which makes it an awkward feature, more than a helpful one. The tray's wood has not been sanded smoothly in areas and rough spots can be a factor with delicate skin.",

I love that there's a drawer and the legs are adjustable. It's not super easy to change the leg height but to complain about it feels so silly considering how functional this thing is. UPDATE: I started using this everyday to teach from home. The 5 stars still stands! I can raise my computer so the angle is more flattering and it turns any desk into a standing desk. I would recommend laying down some drawer liners or fabric because the hinges will scratch the surface when not in \"standing\" position.",

I got it as a meditation 'altar' to hold incense and to lay my mala beads on, set a candle on, etc. I had priced several pieces of furniture especially made for htat purpose and they were ridiculously overpriced and then saw this. And it is perfect. I even used it as it was intended (lol) and it works fantastic for both purposes. Very, very pleased with my purchase.",

I like that it was removable but it would have been better in the center of the table. It is a little heavy to move around if you are in bed and want to put it on the floor. I have used it after a surgery that kept me off my feet and it worked okay.",

The reason why I gave this product 3 stars is because it arrived slightly damaged in 1 of the inner edges where the desktop flips up. The damaged edge keeps getting caught in everything! including clothing, papers, etc. Better packaging would have prevented this issue",
