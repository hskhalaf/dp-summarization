I find I am more active than I was prior to getting the LL and that is a very positive thing! While I monitor my steps more than my posture ', I will be setting a goal and tracking that, also, next year! I like that it fits securely on my bra strap instead of having something on my wrist. The charge seems to last well but I charge it every night, just in case!",

Part of the benefit is knowing that it is there, because the technology itself is not quite sensitive enough correct small, but significant, deviation from optimal posture. In other words, you have to slouch quite a bit before it provides feedback. This sensitivity is not just a function of the devices intrinsic sensitivity, but also where you wear it and how tight-fitting the clothing is, which requires some experimentation.",

    "description": "Posture is an important but often forgotten part of our daily lives. With plenty going on in our hectic and busy schedules, it can be a real challenge to practice the mindfulness needed to identify and correct poor posture. \n\nWith Lumo Lift, get gentle vibrational reminders for your posture whenever you slouch. Track your posture hours, steps taken, distance travelled and calories burned through the companion iOS, Android or Windows Desktop Lumo Lift app. Lumo Lift requires the free Lumo Lift iOS/Android* app to activate and requires downloading the Lumo Lift manual from www.lumolift.com/manual prior to operating the device. \n\nCurrently compatible with - (view full list here www.lumobodytech.com/compatibility) \nApple devices running iOS 11.3 or above. Kindly check your iOS App Store to see if you can download the Lumo Lift app to your device prior to purchase. \n\nAndroid devices running Android 5.0 or above. Kindly check your phone's Google Play Store for \"Lumo Lift\" to see if you can download the Lumo Lift app to your phone prior to purchase) \n\nFor any questions, concerns and initial guidance on how to use Lumo Lift most effectively, please first visit our comprehensive Support Center at www.lumobodytech.com/support; call our dedicated call center at 1-877-702-7866; or write us at amazon@lumobodytech.com prior to contacting Amazon's customer service. \n\nATTENTION: Lumo Lift is a product which requires a user's commitment to changing age-old habits and a basic level of tech savvy and familiarity with the product for effective results. Please begin using Lumo Lift only after downloading the Lumo Lift manual at www.lumolift.com/manual. \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Posture Your posture affects everything from your health, appearance, communication, mood and even productivity. Poor posture is the leading cause of back pain, which is the most common reason for missed work days, lost productivity and costly doctors bills. Outside of health, your posture plays a large role in the way others view you, as well as impacting your mood and energy levels. The simple act of straightening up your posture and pulling your shoulders back can make a positive change in your life and help you put your best foot forward, all the time.\n\nHow the Tech Works The Lumo Lift is a small, lightweight device that is worn just below your collarbone for posture coaching and activity tracking. Using angle displacement as a measure, our patented biomechanics monitoring sensors in the device allow for the Lumo Lift to know when your body slouches away from what you\u2019ve calibrated as your standard of good posture. The Lumo Lift will alert you of slouching with a gentle vibration as a reminder to straighten back up. As the technology relies on body motion tracking, the Lumo Lift is best worn on snug fitting shirts that allow the sensor to stay close to your body.\n\n\n\n\nGet Better Posture Teach your Lumo Lift what good posture looks like to you, and it will make sure that you maintain beautiful, confident posture all day long through subtle vibrations whenever you slouch.\n\nHaptic Feedback Get real-time feedback on your posture and activity levels to motivate you to sit up straighter and to get up and move more.\n\nTrack Your Progress Keep track of your posture and activity progress over time through the companion Lumo Lift app. Get insights into your posture hours, step count, distance travelled and calories burned.\n\n\n\n\nThe Lumo Lift App Get the compatible Lumo Lift app on iOS 11.3, or Android 11.3 or above, to customize your posture coaching experience, as well as track your progress over time. \n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nPosture, Habit-Change, Wearable\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nThe core mission of Lumo BodyTech is to help unlock the human potential and empower our users to lead healthier, more active lifestyles through the integration of tech. When we realized the significant impact posture had on back pain and how far reaching the benefits are, from reducing stress to building confidence, we knew that we were onto something that could change lives.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nThe Lumo Lift is unique because it addresses a specific problem like posture in a way that hasn\u2019t been done before. Rather than constraining body movement to force good posture, or passively tracking current activities, the Lumo Lift takes it one step further and encourages a change in behavior to coach you into becoming more mindful of your posture.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nThe form factor for the Lumo Lift was definitely a big challenge in the creation process. The Lumo Lift had to be small enough to be optimal for discreet wear, but also capable of tracking posture from one location on the upper body. There was lots of experimenting and trying out new ideas, but we struck a balance between design, utility and technology and are really excited by the end result.",
