The tare function works well, but because of the nature of the soft-touchy buttons, I usually just power it on with my measuring cup on it, which immediately sets to zero before ingredients are added. I love how small and flat it is, easily stored in a spice cabinet. And of course it looks great, easy to clean high gloss surface.
