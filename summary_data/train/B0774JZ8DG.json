It takes some moving around to make it fit over tree and make face appear circular. It also looks a little funny when lights are turned on. The material is thick enough u can't see right through it but it's too thin for lights. I have colored lights on my tree so the snowman face has all kids of dots on his face when tree is on. Overall it is still a very cute topper and I am happy with my purchase.",
