This pan holds up nicely to the high heat of the grill and so far the nonstick surface has worked perfectly!! I\u2019ve grilled veggies with and without oil on them in this pan and have had no issues getting the pan clean or wearing off of the nonstick surface. I love that I can cut veggies in any shape I want and still grill them because they won\u2019t fall through the grill. Thanks for a great product!!",

The handles are too long for my grill, preventing me from closing the lid. I may bend them backwards before the next use or maybe just cut them off. They are just as hot as the rest of the basket, so they aren't absolutely necessary. There is also some rust already, but that's probably unavoidable without resorting to stainless steel.",
