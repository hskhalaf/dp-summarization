      "text": "My kid has autism and it causes him to have low tone and motor planning issues. He has taken private lessons to learn how to swim for the past couple of summer. He's 9 now and still can't kick fast enough to stay afloat or move forward. Regular kickboards are a little hard for him to grip for long periods of time. Anyway, look at him go, this is such a great board! He's able to grip it in 3 different ways and he has been practicing daily with it. His kicks are getting so much faster and stronger in just one week! For reference, he is almost 56\" and weighs about 68lbs, the small is perfect for him.",

      "text": "I got to try this same board at our local swim pool. I liked it so much, I bought my own. I swim laps & just need a kickboard to put my hands on to keep my balance. I like this one because it's shorter (16.25\") (& is noted somewhere it's for kids) & it's easy to keep clean. There is a choice for a longer board (21.xx\") for adults. Both are reasonably priced. Yes, if you think this should go under your stomach & hold you afloat, it won't. It's not made for that. It's made to help lap swimmers for kicking. Very happy with it vs the longer hard foam kickboards.",

      "text": "I got this for my 5 year old when we got a small pool. At first she found it challenging and I thought it didn't have enough buoyancy because it wouldn't float when she put her weight on it. Turns out that it's designed to be used as an aid, forcing the user to fully extend their bodies and hang off of it while kicking. She got the hang of it and it really helped her get into the correct position for swimming. A day later she learned to swim underwater without the board. The multiple handles allows the board to be used in different body positions. Great product.",

I was looking for a board that had the two different handle areas, just like their professional teacher. It works well. The only thing that I don't like, is that it is made of a hard plastic. This is a good buy, and I recommend it, if your child needs to practice their kicks.",

I guess I assumed this would be made of the same neoprene or foam as every other kickboard I've ever seen. The idea of this hard plastic knocking my toddler in the head (particularly after it pops out of the water) during lessons is too concerning. Perhaps this would be good for an adult working their legs in the pool?",
