The bar of soap would fit inside the bowl but overflow when using my brush to lather up. It does great for a cream since you're not using a bar. You'll also want to leave this open for a day or two to air it out on receiving. It has a strong wood odor when you open the package. Not something I want mixing with my shaving cream/soap. It does look nice and handles the cream well. I just don't like using it for the soap.",

This is actually his second Kingsley shave soap bowl, he loved the first one so much and after extending his shave soap collection he needed another reservoir for his rotation. He buys beef tallow shave soap pucks that fit very nicely in the bowl and give him the ability to create a great lather for his shaves. Price is fantastic for a quality piece, would definitely recommend to any shave enthusiast on behalf of my husband.",

I'd give it 5 stars except for the extra work required. BTW, I've read a couple of reviews recommending melting shaving soap in the microwave. I have done that and, for reasons unknown to me, it actually degrades the scent. I had a rather expensive AOS sandalwood-scented soap that was ruined after only 60 seconds.",

While the bowl looks great, it is more or less useless for actually lathering. It is possible to get a decent lather, but it spills everywhere as there is no depth to the bowl. Additionally, the bowl retains no heat. I'd suggest a simple coffee mug or ceramic bowl.",

This bowl looks much better, but it is a bit smaller so you may have trouble fitting larger soaps. I like to melt a small glycerin based soap into it using the microwave JUST until it starts to melt into it to fit right (+/- 30 seconds).

It doesn't give you a lot of extra room to maneuver the brush - it was smaller than I expected - but it works fantastically for large, short disc soaps (won't work well with Colonel Conk soaps). The small space means that you'll probably spill a lot of lather over the sides if you try to lather up in the bowl itself rather than using a second mug/bowl, but it cleans up easily and is a lot more water-resistant than I expected. Looks great, smells good - complements woody scents like sandalwood. Just remember to leave the top off for a bit after you shave, so the soap can dry.",
