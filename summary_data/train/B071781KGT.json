Picked up at a flash sale price so even better. Previous opener of this type was Wolfgang Puck Item and worked well for a little over a year before calling it quits.Battery replacement did not work after awhile. This is sleek and sits well in foil cutter holder on counter and has small footprint so not hogging space. Appears nicely made and if serviceable for at least a year is worth it.",

Here\u2019s the issue; once the recharge batteries can\u2019t be recharged, you may as well throw the entire opener away because there is no practical way to replace the rechargeable batteries even though the rest of the opener is functional.",

It\u2019s well made, fast and super easy to master. It helps to put your wine bottle on a kitchen towel to help keep it from rotating. Grab the bottle,with one hand, place the corkscrew over the top and press the lower part of the power button. The corkscrew drives fully into the cork with surprisingly little effort then continues rotating and completely removes it. Then press the top half of the power button and it reverses to eject the cork. How simple is that?",

It is always ready for service provided you replace the batteries before it slows down. No tether so store it anywhere with or without the base. In fact the base, which doubles as a seal clipper, can be stored separately. The design is simple and elegant, and it works very well provided the wine bottle cork is whole and undamaged.
