After three months, though, one side started activating automatically, going through toast cycles even though you hit cancel. Only way to stop it was to unplug it. We tried everything we could think of, nothing helped. May still be under warranty, but really who is going to take the time to ship a toaster for repairs, especially when you didn't save the box (and really, who has the space to save every box from every gadget)? Very disappointed, have always used Cuisinart toasters but now I will have to look elsewhere.",

After less than 6 months of use the digital display has made a considerable collection of sesame seeds and other debris that doesn't seem to be removable. Cuisinart doesn't see anything wrong with this but for a mere $50 or so (about 50% of the original cost) in shipping cost (I get to pay both ways) I could get a new one. For an obvious design or manufacturing flaw in the product, Cuisinart is taking a pretty arrogant attitude to standing behind their products. I guess it kind of makes caveat emptor pretty clear.

The wires hardly glow and some don't glow at all. After 17 months of frustration I have thrown it away. I have ordered a Krups at less than half of the Cuisinart price. I'll bet it toasts better. We'll see. Isn't the most important feature of a toaster the quality of the toasting? Otherwise it's just a piece of art deco.",

Nothing special. I regret our purchase and do not recommend it.",

After another month, both \u201ctoast\u201d buttons were stuck and after a few more attempts of prying them, the buttons broke, making this very extra expensive toaster, completely useless. I have since stopped buying all Cuisinart products because I have noticed their quality has diminished substantially in the last few years.",

It looks very sleek on the kitchen counter. I have only had the toaster for a week and will update this review later down the road.",

The LCD screens turn on when you touch buttons, illuminates in bright blue, and they turn off automatically (within about 60 seconds). I have used the defrost button once (on eggos) and it worked well. Instead of \"toasting\" the eggo it actually warmed/defrosted and then I was able to toast perfectly. I do recommend this toaster. Easy to clean and the brushed steel look does not absorb greasy fingerprints and stays clean.",

Yes, it looks good and has nice features but it is terrible at what is important: toasting! The highest setting is too light, bagels, have to be done 2x and is done poorly on both sides, and lastly toasting is very slow. I would be better off with a quality 2 slot toaster and using it 2x. That would still be faster and better. I plan on purchasing a Breville (you get what you pay for) and selling this one, used (you buy cheap, you buy two times). IMHO!",
