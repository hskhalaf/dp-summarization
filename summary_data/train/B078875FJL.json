Pictures showed a red/blue/white shoe, and the shoes I received have far less red in them and might be a totally different model all together, based on the tongue. I still like these shoes though so I\u2019m going to keep them, just be aware when buying for yourself.",

That being said ASICS traditionally runs a size smaller so order a size up!",
