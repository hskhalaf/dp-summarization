      "text": "This is a pretty good headset. They only downside is that the bearing cage only holds 16 bearings, which is pretty low compared to what I see looking around, most are 18 - 22 bearings. The bearings are 5/32nd size bearings. Easy to fix this by going loose ball. I had a heck of a time with installation because I didn't know that the cups that insert into the tube are different, I thought they were the same. I accidentally swapped them and it won't work this way. I finally figured it out and got the bottom on the bottom and the top on the top. Works great now.",

I'm adding a pic bit i dont have the forks cut yet so the top cap is not mounted yet. The seat rails were black so this headset brought it together , I purchased the bottom bracket in black as well from Amazon from the same maker.",

The problem with it is that it uses very non-standard lock nut, so it's very hard to install properly unless you have the elusive tool for that obsolete lock nut. This lock nut is not the kind you can tighten with a regular headset wrench. I ended up using a bottom bracket tool on this which did not fit right, so I could never tighten the locknut properly. Thus the headset could never be adjusted properly. I suggest that you buy the Ritchey 1 inch headset instead - that's what I'll have to do unfortunately...",
