I heartily recommend this all natural product.",

It is great for everyday or casual day. It makes my skin look better without looking like a ton of make up. I also love that it is natural and inexpensive.",

I love it in the summer because it doesn't crease or get greasy-looking. It's a bit dry on my skin type in the winter but I switch up my moisturizer and primer to make it work! I can use a light layer with a fluffy brush for light coverage, or build it up like a true foundation.",

Sadly, I will have to throw it away due to the condition of the powder. It is also hard to gauge the color of the foundation. The color I chose was too light for my skin type. If I had the right color, and the foundation hadn't fallen apart the way it did, I would have been very happy with this product.",
