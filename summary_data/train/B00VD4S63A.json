We quickly learned to apply adhesive generously. The paper did not rip once. I ordered 4 rolls to be safe, ended up needing 3. Highly recommend this wallpaper.",

I bought two more roles to finish the wall, which arrived from Lot 120. The older lot and the newer lot don't align perfectly (which is a standard problem with all wall paper). Blooming Wall replaced my older roll of paper without extra cost. It was extremely generous of them.",

Make sure to account for waste because you'll have to line up the pattern. I used almost one roll for my project (we pic). You have to buy glue for this paper, and I found it best to apply the glue to the back of the wallpaper, rather than the wall. Make sure to get all the edges coated in glue, those spots will be the first you notice pulling off the wall if you don't glue them well. Overall, great product.",

The lines are so small inside the ovals and when you go 2 ft back there is no pattern or design, all you see is just small and big ovals. I wish I had the time to put it sooner so I can replace it with something else. Is not ugly but is not as I expected. Very disappointed. I will follow up with a picture.",
