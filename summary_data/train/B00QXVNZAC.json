After rubbing it on her temples she put some in her hands and just sits and inhales them for about a minute. Thank you for the alternative rather than more medicine..",

I cannot say enough how wonderful this blend is. I am generally not a fan of lavender (I know, I know, everyone loves it...) but I know it's a good one for headache relief, so I thought with the mix of other scents it might not be the worst. It does not stand out to me - whew. Again, I LOVE this blend! I primarily smell the mints, but they don't overwhelm the rest.
