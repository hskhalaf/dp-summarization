I've already ordered a 2nd one for the other end-table. Watch the video for a quick demostration, and good luck!",

Our cheap china bulb looks better. It's nice to be able to control it with my phone, but that's basically the same as controlling it with my remote. It also cannot be turned into a colorful strobe light. I see how this can be great for others, but I will stick to my cheap made in China bulb for like 8 dollars.",

That went well after the customer service rep recommended that I set up a light near the hub and connect all four bulbs in one spot. Then I moved the bulbs to their correct locations, and they worked fantastically. I love the ability to set up different scenes and to program the on/off times. I only wish the bulbs could be programmed to change colors or blink for special occasions. Otherwise, I highly recommend the Sengled products.",

It does kind of suck, however, that they aren't available in the same deals or bundles as the regular color bulbs, and thus will end up costing you more. Hoping Sengled makes a greater variety of form factors in the future, because I'd be happy to replace every bulb in the house with their products. The color reproduction and Alexa integration are as good as Philips Hue (I'm familiar, I have a buddy down the street who's whole house is on that platform), with a much more reasonable price (which matters as you scale).",

I like it because I can change the ambient light to match the movie I'm watching or game I'm playing. Guests are always impressed by the wide range of colors the bulb can project. This smart bulb requires a hub though so be sure to purchase that as well.",
