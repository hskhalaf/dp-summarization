      "text": "I have two, one for each project I'm working on. Plenty of room. Although, if u purchase super saver skeins, u can only have two to three in pouches, because the tighter it is the more tension on the yarn coming out as your working. The large pouch inside is big enough for extra skeins, and partial projects. The zipper pocket is large enough for 14\" hooks (diagonal) and hook kits. Back zipper pocket fits books or patterns and the two end pockets are easily accessible for scissors, ruler, or tools used while working.",

But the size is also awesome because it can hold so much. Some reviewers raised quality concerns due to the velcro closures being sewn on incorrectly, but actually that is part of the design. There are velcro strips along the top to hold yarn ends, not to hold the bag closed. This is a neat feature! It is perfect for avoiding the tangled mess I usually end up with when using multiple colors on the same project or when working with double strands.",

I\u2019m new to crochet (I focus on amigurumi so I can\u2019t attest to how this works for bigger projects like blankets) and this keeps everything together beautifully. From my various yarns to my hooks to my hopeful project patterns, there\u2019s a place for it all. The bag itself is well made. The outside is jean material and inside is lined. It did come with a shoulder strap which helps hauling it from room to room. Highly recommend!",
