Despite that, my daughter loves these and can spend hours playing with them. I think as she gets older and more creative, we'll add to our collection, but for now, 100 pieces are enough for our 3.5-year-old. Other reviewers have mentioned having a hard time connecting and unconnecting pieces. We've never had that problem (unless my daughter is trying to accomplish the impossible). Gramma has the original wooden TinkerToys, and I find these to be a big improvement. I'm not worried about these breaking and the bendability feature makes for more building options.",

Its just the number of pieces 100, sounds like it should be plenty but its just not. Most of the time we build guns to play with and im always losing the soot out because there isnt enough pieces for me to build a good gun. of course i have to give my son the good pieces its his toy and if my husband joins in its really bad. We will be buying another set!",

It sucks because the red sticks are meant SPECIFICALLY FOR BENDING in the designs, and they can't bend at all. My five-year-old tried and we could see the middle of the sticks turning pink from the stress and getting closer to breaking than bending. They're useless so we threw them away.",
