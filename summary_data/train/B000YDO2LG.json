Number one, there is a feature that not only allows you to choose your slice size, but to also close the blade to prevent slicing. When I've finished using the slicer, wash/dry it, it hooks on to the top of the slicer. What a wonderful design improvement. The two stay together in my drawer, number one, and, number two, it protects injuries from occuring when rummaging to find the item. Well worth the price. I'm really pleased with this inexpensive device...",
