I currently have 2 Abu Garcia BlackMax 6.4:1 reels and some spinning setups, but was looking at trying something different. Between the high rating and the price, I thought I'd give this a try. The KastKing was not only $20+ cheaper, but also outperforms the Abu Garcias on every level - Less backlashes, smoother reeling, further casting distances. I'm just so happy with this reel, and can't wait to try out some of the other ones and ratios from KastKing.",

A friend recommended I get a better reel and try again. This reel was suggested. It has made me a believer. The controls on this reel are fantastic. Spool resistance adjustment requires little tuning to get results, the drag and retrieve controls are metal, the handle is cushioned and grips well. I can get it setup with free fall drops and 9/10 times that's perfect for casting. Once you're dialed in, you can throw your bait a long ways.",

I took it to the lake a couple of time and caught a couple of fish on it. So I thought I just had to work it in. Not the case this past weekend I couldn\u2019t even fish with it.

Most reels in this price range have horrible brake systems. This one breaks that rule. It cast smooth and long. It's quiet and light. It's small enough to easily fit in your palm. I was reading online that this reel and it's black colored counterpart are rated as the 3rd best reel under $100. I agree with that. Personally, I've been using Shimano Curado reels for over 20 yrs. This compares favorably to them. I'd have no qualms at all about using this reel exclusively. Highly recommended !",

Amazon got it to me in 2 days since it was in stock and not on back order. I still have to spool the reel and get it to the river, but I don't think that will be a problem at all.

This original version has more bearings 11+1 vs 5+1 and it also has centrifugal breaking with 4 different settings which is better for beginners. I am very pleased with all 4 reels.

This reel was easy to set up, (watched like a hundred YouTube videos), and started casting into buckets the back yard. Had it down in about 3 hours. I'd start out with 8 pound monofilament, and use electricians tape to wrap your line after you've pulled about 30 yards out, this way you don't have much of a bird's nest to sort through. I've pretty much abused this reel over the past two months. Nice beginner reel!",

Talking without research or knowledge. I've spent the high money. It just doesn't make sense anymore. Kastking is moving forward with innovation and quality. The Royal legend is a great baitcaster in both function and performance. Please, please fight the stupids and treat yourself to this reel. A winning combo: Amazon and Kastking",

My only draw back was it asked to remove the spool prior to filling with line. Directions were a little spotty, and I never got the side panel to completely clear the spool. I just did it old school way and threaded line onto spool with a small pick and tied it to the spool. Will buy more in the future, now just finding more fishing time is the problem.",
