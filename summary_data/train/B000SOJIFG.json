I fell twice while wearing these \"stability\" shoes. after the second fall (sustained an injury both times) I realized I was falling because these shoes were not stable. the straps were fine,at first,but then loosened. You cannot make the straps tighter. Then I realized how much looser they had become. I would not recommend this type of shoe to anyone because of the strap. It loosens with time and you could break your neck wearing them.",
