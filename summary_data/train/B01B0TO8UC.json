Three cameras later, two showed less than four small spots each and the third was squeaky clean. I was totally amazed. Very easy to use. Comes with cleaning solution and swabs and directions. These are for APS-C sensors. Should not be used on full frame sensors. I will definitely buy again.",

I did compared this to in store and the difference is in price. Store tend to sell this for 50-60 dollars while here I can order in bulk for same price. I do understand the importance of supporting box stores however you can't argue with quality and price.",

I have used several other types of swabs before and these are by far the worst, I am not sure why the reviews are so good. They caused more harm than good, and I ended up needing to get different ones just fix what these did to my sensor.",
