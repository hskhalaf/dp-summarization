It is a tad more easier to color in than his others and the lines/sketch are more on point in this one. His books have def improved if you compare to his others, hopefully the artist continues creating similar sketches. I have included the first page I colored and even took several shots, one at an angle so you can see the glitter, gel pens, and Metallics that I've added to the mix. Will post more pics over time.",

The pages are thick but can't handle chameleon markers. I love the page sizes and think they are just right especially for the amount of detail are on each page. They are matte and not glossy pages which is why markers bleed through markers also make a halo effect on the pages which I personally love since after all I'm coloring work from the painter of light. Great book for all ages.",

I love Kinkade paintings and how calming they are to look at. I took off one star because I do think that some of the shapes are really hard to color since they're small on the page.

If you are good at shading and using different colors for a bigger picture then this is for you! If you are looking for a \u201ccolor within the lines\u201d -straight to the point type of book this might not be your first choice. Definitely worth the price, since its Disney and a very dense book! Here are some pictures of the coloring options inside, enjoy your book if you decide to buy it! I sure did !!",

So you have the choice to either follow their design, alter it, or go your own completely. With so many small, detailed, shaded areas I think the color photo references make it much more welcoming and less intimating.",
