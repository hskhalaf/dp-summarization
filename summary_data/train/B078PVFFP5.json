If you don't put a knot on the closure, it starts to loosen up but once you knot it, it bothers my dog as it's uncomfortable on his neck. It needs to be made with a softer material. Had to return it! The inside is nice and soft though but has no harness so the dog can jump out of it easily. So disappointed!",
