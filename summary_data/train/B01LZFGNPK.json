Good quality, I like the size (great for a little note, which is exactly what these cards are for), and she and my four year old were going bananas over them for days with each other. Again, these are grape, not too cheesy, I felt that the price wasn't too forking high, and owl'd order them again, should the need arise. Please help, I can't stop the wordplay!",

This prevents any bending or folding and the cards arrived safe and sound, in pristine condition. The cards were made of thickish cardstock paper. The outsides of the cards (the front with the decal and the back) have a smooth, glossy finish. The inside of the cards have the same feel and texture as regular cardstock, making it easy to write a personal message. Note that the inside of the cards are also completely blank. Overall, a great, simple. classy, quality item. Funny, simplistic design, good packaging, and quality material. Will buy again!",
