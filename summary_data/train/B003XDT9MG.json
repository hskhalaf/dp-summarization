Its easy to dump the dirt and clean the filter. But after a few days it stopped cleaning properly which is the main work of a vacuum cleaner.For cleaning a carpet floor you have to use it more than 1 time.Later the bottom roller stopped working also.So we ended up buying an expensive but good one and we are happy with our decision now.",

It does not have strong sucking power so you have to go over an area multiple times to pick up loose particles. It is terrible on tile partly due to the lack of floor height adjustment and the cord is relatively short as well. If you need to vacuum a multi-surface space and like your carpets free of debris, this is not the vacuum for you. Better to pay the extra money and get a higher quality vacuum.",

I especially love it because you can use it on any type of floor -- carpet as well as hardwood or tiled floors.

It is very loud and the exhaust air blows out the front of the vacuum which causes dirt, etc., to blow away from you.

Not sure I would buy specifically for hardwood floors.",
