Thereafter discovered the downside of all the wear-parts being plastic: After a few uses the blade started coming loose from its plastic holder. The vibrations from the loose blade causes the battery clip which is also plastic to wear out. Now even duct-tape isn't enough to hold the battery in place and keep it running.",

This is just ridiclous, how did it make it out of the factory in this condition. Unusable! Take it back, i'll shop locally.",

I set the mower on the lowest cut setting and it cuts beautifully. I can maneuver close to steps and trees. It's very quiet and I can mow in the morning and not wake my neighbors. I recommend this mower to everyone",

Speaking of battery, it lasted for at least 60 minutes cutting short grass.

But by the time the battery runs out I'm ready to take a break anyway. The BEST part though, is that I can now easily tell my kids to go cut the grass since they don't have to figure out how to get it started. And they're grateful when the battery runs out too... :-)",

I called and after reading some of the reviews here felt like it would be futile but they very quickly diagnose the problem and are sending me a new unit as well as the means to send my defective one back.
