They're hard to adjust because they're 3 straps and when i got them they were too small so i returned them and i'm about to get new ones, but they're worth the money. You can wear them everywhere with any outfit since it matches with everything. They're good for trips and camps, etc. If you're a half size i recommend going up because if you go down its too perfect on your feet and if its swollen or anything, it wont fit. I'm a 6 1/2 and i tried a 7 on and it fits better than the 6, which i just returned. Hope this helped (:",

Also will not be getting Chacos with 3 straps again. It is really hard to get them adjusted right and to keep the toe loop from cutting off your circulation. So I have now paid a lot of money for shoes that I cannot wear. Definitely should have just bought them form the store instead of on here.",

      "text": "Chacos are not the best for wide feet, I myself have skinny feet so it worked out! The shoes are great, as for sizing I would definitely recommend trying the shoe on in person first. The size does vary based on how you personally would like the sandal to fit! (Loose or tight - More room the in the toe area) stuff like that. The shoe itself is VERY comfortable if you are someone who finds comfort in firmer shoes. For example\u2014 Birkenstock\u2019s. I wear these when I know I\u2019m going to be on my feet all day in the summer.",
