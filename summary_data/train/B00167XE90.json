Unfortunately, the drawers do not stay closed. When you use the drawers to put in actual tools, the weight of the tools opens the drawers and the chest starts to tip over. If you need this box to move tools from one location to the next you will develop bloody forehead syndrome. Do not buy this box, you will be disappointed.",

But if the tool box is closed and if you tug on a drawer, it will bend the metal and force this to happen. Wish it was a little stronger but you get what you pay for.",

The toolbox is of sturdy construction and the doors slide easily, even when loaded. The drawers can be removed for easy cleaning or placement of lining material. The locking bar can also be defeated so that you can slide drawers out without opening the lid. Very happy with purchase, delivery and quality of this toolbox.",
