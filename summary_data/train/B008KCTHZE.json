I wasn't sure what my boot size was, as these are my first pair of cowboy boots. Some people have told me to go up a size. I decided to go on my gut feeling and just get my regular shoe size. When they came they fit perfectly!! These boots are gorgeous! I love them!!! They don't have much grip on the sole as it is leather! However over all I'd give these a 5 star!!! I would definitely purchase another pair of Justin Boots!!",

The manufacturer has a 'find your size\" option and when I put in my details it suggested a boot size. Fortunately that size WAS in stock. I am very happy with these boots.

I could have gone down another half size and been fine. As they are slightly large it is a breeze pulling them off. The construction is height quality and the design the quintessential,cowboy boot. Go with one of the less traditional colors to make more of a fashion statement.",

It seems that if you have narrow feet, you need a half size smaller because if not, your foot will slide too far into boot. If you have more wide than narrow feet, I'd go with your regular size. A friend of mine had to go a half size smaller but she has long narrow feet. The leather seems very durable and the design is subtle, which is what I wanted. I will definitely be wearing these all winter with shorts, dresses, jeans, leggings and anything else possible!!",

(yes they are leather, but that won't keep your toes warm in the cold).",

They are a little stiff around the ankle and a little tight across the top of the foot but that will change and it didnt impact how they felt...they will only get more comfortable. I want to wear them every day!",

We had been to several huge Country Western stores and she could not find a pair that fit her right and looked the way she wanted. She has from her no me \"large calves\" which makes it hard to find boots that fit right. After reading reviews on here I thought these might work perfect and looked the way she wanted. I also knew Justins were a quality brand. I was shocked when she opened them how good of quality they are for the money. She loves them because they are the first boots to actually fit her right.",
