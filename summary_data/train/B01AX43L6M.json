Now that I have the soap, I find the coffee is in the middle of the ingredients list and the actual smell of the soap is vanilla, spices, and soap. Maybe when it's wet or makes contact with skin it smells less like soap and more like the other ingredients? Top ingredients are oils that are good moisturizers. Seems like a decent soap, just not as coffee-tastic as I hoped.",
