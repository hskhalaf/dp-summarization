I only paid $150 for the while thing. I told him this was unacceptable. He finally agree to send me a new power head for the shipping. I guess better than nothing. Buyer beware!",

I did appreciate the attachments and going from hard wood to carpet-but again, the suction is no longer working.

I shouldn't have to buy a new shark vacuum every couple of years that's just ridiculous! I normally wouldn't write a review but I'm extremely disappointed in the quality only lasting 2years. Should last at least 5. I take care of the vacuum and constantly clean it but it didn't help make it last longer. I've had cheaper vacuums last longer than this.",

I'm not sure I'd buy another Shark. It is convenient, portable, and light weight. I just didn't get very good mileage from this model. Thank twice before you buy.",

If you need to set it aside for anything while assembled as an upright it will take effort to find a good place to rest it or it could easily fall since you likely won't want to take it apart each time you pause your work.

Unfortunately one of our animals got sick with something contagious so to be safe we discarded that vacuum to avoid spreading the illness after we disinfected everything. When we were looking for a replacement vacuum we decided to buy this one again. It works well and it is lightweight. I only wish it were cordless and had a self cleaning brush. We almost bought the cordless shark vacuum but I couldn\u2019t justify the extra $100 for it. I like the accessories that came with it as well. We use the tiny brush to clean our bookshelves and windowsills and it works great.",

Its head is small, so it can get into and under small spaces, but the cup part doesn't hold much and has to be emptied often. I learned I had to be careful when opening it because, if not done correctly, all that I collected will dump out onto the floor. For me, it's not ultra-light; it's heavy, and it's very loud. I doubt that it will do a good job on the inside of my car. I don't recommend buying this vacuum.",

Great for dusting places that aren't easy (book shelves, baseboards, even blinds!) I read a few reviews giving it a lower rating because the vaccuum doesn't stand up by itself.

I purchased a used model, but all of the accessories arrived brand new and the unit was in pristine condition. Not a scratch on it and it came in an original box. I saved $40. Afterall it is for cleaning up dust, why do I need it brand new? I use this (my baby shark) in my basement and on my downstairs hard wood floors and kitchen tile floor in place of a broom when i deep clean. I highly recommend it.",

Ive had a shark for years and I understand I'm getting suction not sturdy materials for the price so I'm just aware of how I treat it.
