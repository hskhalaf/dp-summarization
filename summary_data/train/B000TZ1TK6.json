I went to the current stand I have, which has been inside in the same location the entire time, and there were NO protective rubber feet. I see from other reviews this seems to be a recurring problem. My floor is a hardy tile so really not a problem; it just makes you wonder about overall quality if they refuse to mitigate a recurring issue. Otherwise, I'm happy with the stand!",

However, there are two serious problems with them - 1) if they get wet, they immediately start to rust at all of the points where two pieces of metal meet (the soldering points) and 2) the feet have rubber caps on them that catch water and encourage rusting. As you can imagine, this is quite a problem for and outdoor plant stand. We had a big rainstorm this weekend and, when I checked on the plant stands afterwards, I noticed rust all over them.",

The metal is square cut and very thick and sturdy. It could easily hold a heavy plant in a 10 inch pot.
