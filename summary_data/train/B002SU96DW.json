The swing is easy to assembly, but you must have the tools to do it, such as the proper wrench or socket size. Don't over tighten the nuts or the slats will crack. The included chain is very sturdy. As the directions recommend, the wooden slats should be stained for added protection, especially if the swing will be exposed to rain. It's best to do this prior to assembly. I used an oil based, semitransparent stain of similar color as the slats and the results look great.",

That is high praise, when you have bent heavy wall steel tubing with three bolts that must all line up. Assembly was straightforward, but you gotta read carefully all the steps to take. Nowhere does the sheet say the size of the wrench - just one; 7/16 inch. Both a socket and a combination wrench are needed. The bench is comfortable. I decided to smooth-sand the wood pieces and coat them with transparent stain before assembly, which made it even nicer.",

It is easy to put together and all the hardware is marked. I liked the gold/yellow chain that came with it. I am extremely happy with the look and quality of the swing.
