      "verdict": "The Skechers GOwalk 5 - Qualify is popular with shoppers for several reasons. First, the Ultra Go cushioning makes users feel like they\u2019re walking on air. Second, the Comfort Pillar Technology enhances the responsiveness and shock absorption of the outsole. On top of that, it also looks good.Though the Air Cooled Goga Mat insole feels slippery to some, it did help prevent warm and sweaty feet. Overall, it comes highly recommended by owners.",

        "Numerous owners of the GOwalk 5 - Qualify bought extra pairs because it is that comfortable",
        "The breathability in this product pleases a good number of wearers",

      "cons": [
        "The upper of this walking shoe feels too soft for some folks that it fails to properly contain their feet",
        "A few individuals are unhappy with the insole as it makes their foot slide forwards, which, in turn, hurts their toes"

      "text": "Love these shoes this is my second pair, had various Skechers styles in the past but this style is by far my favourite, wanted a shoe for walking the dog regularly that would not wear down on the soles as quick as previous shoes and these ones last on the sole far longer, still have my first pair in this style after 18 months and there is still a few miles wear left on the soles. Purchased this second pair ready to replace when the first pair finally wear out. Price is competitive as I knew the size I needed fit is perfect. All in all a great shoe.",
