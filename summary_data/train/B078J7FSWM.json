I'd raise the lid on the computer only to see multiple notifications that the external hard drive became disconnected without being unmounted. Every time it'd wake up to check mail, a new notification would get generated. I sent it back. Very discouraged by the current stater of USB-C docks. It's not just Plugable, it's other docks I've tried as well. I've resorted to the HDMI adapter, a USB hub, and a spare charger. It's an unsightly combination and it was more expensive than this, but it's doing the job with a single plug.",

It doesn't connect to anything, you can layer it with concrete, and it can send you down a whirlpool of USB C remorse when you consider the false promises. It's also the first brick I've purchased that has the ability to make your attempt at doing work *more* complicated. Strange for a brick. My only complaint is this brick isn't red? I'm not sure why they chose black metal for the color of this brick. But, fortunately this brick is much lighter than those other ones. It has these ports thingies; that's cute. They don't do anything, which makes this a really funny brick. Silly brick.",

Anyone considering one of these new (and expensive!) USB-C/Thunderbolt docks should be aware of how buggy and difficult this new interface is to apply. Plugable is the best option. Note - I also learned to make sure so choose sufficient power-supply wattage, some laptops, wow - power hungry.",

This one does 85w and for the past several months it has been rock solid for me with no issues. I'm docking it 1 star because the power button in the front of the box is way too easy to push by accident and pretty unnecessary. I'd only knock it 1/2 a star if I could though",

I have been looking for a dock like this that is reasonably priced since I bought my macbook pro. Did not want to spend $300 for a juiced up dock. This is perfect. I wish it had one more monitor port for a dual screen set up, but this is more than adequate if you only have one screen.",

With 4 USB 3.0 ports and HDMI 4K makes my work flow easily . The audio port is work very nice and can be used with audio-controlled keyboard on MacBook Pro or external keyboard. Note is that if you need to use Siri, make sure you set the microphone choices correctly in System Preferences -> Siri. So far I like this product and save my cost to buy the dock and an additional power adapter.",
