So it would have gotten 5 stars had it came with the right size wire and prevented me from buying a 10 pound roll of 0.030 wire. Other than that little hiccup, with 0.025 it works good, and is a great addition to any small shop or anyone who wants to get into welding",

Ready to try your hand at wire welding? Have we got the welder for you - the Handy MIG from Lincoln Electric! This compact, portable and lightweight wire feed welder plugs into a 115V, 20 amp outlet and is user friendly. Four voltage settings and continuous wire feed speed adjustment allow you to weld mild steel from 24 gauge to 1/8\" thick. And, it's easy to get started since practically everything you'll need to MIG weld is in the box - gun and cable assembly, work cable and clamp, gas nozzle, gas regulator and hose, spool of solid wire, contact tips and hand shield with filter plate and lens. Just add a cylinder of shielding gas. But that's not all - there's also a spool of self-shielded, flux-cored wire, contact tips and chipping hammer/brush so you can use your Handy MIG to weld with gasless, flux-cored wire too.",
