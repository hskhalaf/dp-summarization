I've been a professional jazz cowbell player since I was 3 years old growing up in the backwoods of Omaha (the true origin of jazz cowbell playing). I have a collection of over 2,322.4 cowbells and have never been satisfied. That was until I stumbled across this beauty. This cowbell is the Magnum of cowbells. Let's start with the silky black handle. It almost seems like it was meant for my hand...smooth, yet familiar during my first jam session. When I performed behind Phil's Foodway last Saturday night....there was a not a dry eye in the parking lot. Beauty was found that day in the form of melodious clanking.",
