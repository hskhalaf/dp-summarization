Great Shoe, but Very Hard to Find in Retail and sometimes online. Also. Reebok uses Way Too Many descriptors to describe their shoes. You have to watch like a Hawk that You get the one You intended to get. All DMX's are not equal. I only use the ones with Air Chambers in the Soles.",

I happy to report they are very comfortable and I love the memory foam/gel soles. They would be perfect if they also had a mid-top option as I like the support for my ankles. I purchased some Skechers shoes that are good 3 days before I found these shoes but I like the Reeboks better.",

The outsole comes with targeted rubber construction for traction and flexibility. The low-cut construction lets ankles move freely.\n\nReebok was founded for one of the best reasons possible: athletes wanted to run faster. So in the 1890s, Joseph William Foster made some of the first known running shoes with spikes in them. By 1895, he was in business making shoes by hand for top runners; and before long his fledgling company, J.W. Foster and Sons, developed an international clientele of distinguished athletes.",
