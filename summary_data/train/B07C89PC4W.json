For my first road trip, I inflated the tires to 80 psi cold. I have a 7800 travel trailer with double axles. About 300 miles into the trip 1 of the 4 blew. I did not hit anything, it was at night, I was doing 65 and I didn't run off the road. In fact, it was a smooth road. I can't explain what happened. I was able to continue another 1100 miles without any of the 3 remaining failing, but I am concerned that they might.",

No deformation of the tread or sidewall like cheaper tires. Mounted there was no abnormal bulges in the sidewall. Spinning them they looked pretty true. Overall they seem like a decent tire. Only complaint is i had to let them sit a week stretched out so i could mount them on my wheels. But, so far, i would buy again.",
