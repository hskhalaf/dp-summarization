Before our trip I decided we needed to add to our collection of sand toys and figured we'd try this out. Glad we did! The plastic bag it came in was a thicker plastic than I had thought, so we were able to store all the little beach toys in there during the trip. The mesh bag it came with is a bonus! Lots of great sand accessories to keep the kids entertained. My kids ended up making lots of friends the day we had everything out - all the kids wanted to come play with everything!",

The mesh bag it comes with is quite nice. Honestly, next time I will shop in person for items like this so I can see what I am actually purchasing. There were multiple other companies that were competitively priced, most a bit cheaper. These had the highest reviews. That's what prompted me to purchase. I am satisfied but would likely not re-purchase.",

If you have a sewing machine I highly recommend reinforcing the stitching on the mesh bag.

My kids love the sand molds and they are some of the better sand molds they've used. Most of the toys fit in the large castle bucket which makes packing things up and storing them much easier.",

      "text": "Came as pictured. Lots of variety of sand toys. We bought this for a sand table and is the perfect amount of toys for it. Also perfect if you were to take them to a beach or water park. Only gave 4 stars because the mesh bag that comes with the toys is cheap material and probably won\u2019t hold up. But that can easily be replaced.",

It only comes with what is pictured and the castle molding that comes with it is around 2 inch high which is Very Small good for kids ages 3 and under. The plastic shovels and other toys are sturdy but i can see the buckle not lasting more than a season. Better off going to BJ's if you have membership and buying a 24 piece they have for 13.00...",
