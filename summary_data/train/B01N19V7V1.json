Four chairs came to a box and in total, the assembly took us about 30 minutes with most of that time spent just cutting the packing tape/foam off of the pieces. We were looking for chairs similar to this but didn't want to pay $300/chair and these are a fantastic alternative. Not only are the seats padded, but the backs are padded as well. Coming from wooden dining chairs with more of a country look to them, these are a huge upgrade as far as look and comfort go. I'm 5'5\" and my husband is 6'2\" and the height of the back is great for both of us. We highly recommend them!",

The chairs are very comfortable and it was the first thing my husband said when he sat in one. Win! We are only using two chairs for now as we use bench seating to reduce space, but we will make use of the other two chairs when we have company! Absolutely love this set...great value!!!",
