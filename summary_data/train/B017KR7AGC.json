I bake most days and even at the 425-450 degrees I roast veggies at, these allowed me to safely take them out and use them as hot mats to protect my beautiful rustic solid wood table my husband built.

We can use these for simple things like holding a pot or for getting hot pots out of the oven. They are very flexible and adjust to whatever you are holding. I just love these. I think I will be ordering more in a different color. I currently have he blue ones.",
