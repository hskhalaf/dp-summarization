As a handheld without the power roller attached it sucks things us ok but tends to get a clog at the little rubber flap on the inside of the canister but what good is a vacuum that pushes the dirt and hair around instead of sucking it up.

      "text": "This would get a 5 star rating while it worked, but the flex tubing broke and now it\u2019s garbage. I had it exactly one year and used it every day to pick up cat litter dust and pieces plus cat hair. It picked up cat litter and hair on hard floors great. Had so-so time-of-use for each battery charge. It was doing the job I needed. But the flex tube broke from normal use, nothing out of the ordinary. It is a wear issue, inferior quality material for the flex tubing. Not worth the price for just one year of use.",
