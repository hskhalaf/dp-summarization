I know it's the cable and not the HMD, because HMD works when I plug in directly to USB 3.0 in my computer. It should work regardless of the device plugged in. If it's not that means the standards are not met!!!! now I have to buy another cable that works with Odyssey! FU!",

I have a 10 port USB hub and won't show any of my external hard drives when they are hooked up to each other. When used alone however it did show all 6 of my external hard drives, but when combined together shows only 2 of them, which defeats the purpose. So i'm returning them.",

I have used other extension cables and always had problems from other company's products. So since all my video cables and ethernet cables are from Monorpice I assumed that their extension cables would be of the same quality as the rest of their line, it seems that I was right.",
