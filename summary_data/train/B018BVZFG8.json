It is worth every penny! It doesn\u2019t have much of an odor detectable to a human nose, but it does burn my nostrils a little if I inhale it so I would recommend spraying and then walking away.",

It caused her to groom incessantly until she had fully removed the product, thus ingesting it. We tried spraying directly on her coat (which she didn't appreciate at all) and by first applying to our hands and then petting it on to her (as instructed by our vet). Neither with success. Finally, we also tried to spray it on one of her 'bedding' places, but now she avoids that spot. The bow on top is that the product is non-returnable to Amazon because it's flammable. I should have bought it locally to give it a try instead.",

    "description": "Size:60 mlIs your cat peeing outside the litter box, scratching your furniture and carpet, or hiding on a regular basis? These behaviors may be caused by fear or anxiety. FELIWAY products are a vet recommended, drug free, and clinically proven to help alleviate many of the unwanted behaviors cat owners deal with. FELIWAY Spray provides \u201chappy messages\u201d by mimicking the natural feline reassuring messages (pheromones) to make cats feel calm and comfortable at home. This product has been found to reduce scratching, spraying, and hiding for 90% of cats, and many owners see results within 7 days. Cats are also very sensitive to change, so if you anticipate changes in the home (moving, renovation, recorating, new pets, new family members, etcs.), FELIWAY is very effective in helping your cats remain calm, and adapt to the changes without unwanted behaviors. If you are having issues with spraying (peeing), after cleaning urine-affected areas, spray FELIWAY directly onto the urine marks, as well as onto other prominent objects including furniture, drapes, window frames and doorways. This helps your cat to feel calm, and reduces unwanted behaviors caused by anxiety (like peeing outside the litterbox). This will also help them to stop scratching and hiding as well. Feliway Spray is completley safe for both humans, and your cat - it is odorless and colorless. Spray away the fear, and feel calmer today!",
