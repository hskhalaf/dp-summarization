Was very quiet for the first few weeks (which was truly encouraging), but slowly developed an internal wobble (like every other fan I've ever owned) and now it makes noise. I also discovered that the fan is creating an external electrical current that is being carried by the ducting. If you touch the ducting, you will get a mild shock. It's not enough to start a fire, but it is enough to make you jump. Now, here's the cool part... I described these problems to Vivosun and they had a brand new fan at my door in two days! What? Who does that? Great service. I'll let you know how the fan holds up. :)",

My compressor is louder than this fan but it does generate some noise but it's not an major issue for me.
