It does not work as advertised. The systems cant be more than 2 rooms away from each other or the signal is weak. The Basement remained a deadzone requiring its own router. In addition, installing google wifi knocked the sonos sound system off my router and I was unable to reconnect these. May work well in more recently constructed homes but a giant fail here.",

They weren't cheap and they were supposedly top of the line but my last two from them continually dropped WiFi no matter how man times I rebooted or reset the system. Finally I decided I'd had enough and tried this setup, and as soon as I replaced the Netgear with Google, using the exact same modem and ISP, all my dropped connections instantly went away and the internet is working flawlessly ever since. I will never go back to Netgear after discovering a far superior product. Just wish I would have done more research and found this sooner!",

My system almost always chooses 5 ghz which is great until you want to connect devices that can only use 2.4 ghz to connect e.g. most smart plugs.
