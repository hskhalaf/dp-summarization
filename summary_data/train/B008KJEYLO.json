I always wondered why the need for all the extra chemicals and garbage in baby wipes, and finally companies are thinking with their heads. I\u2019m only giving it 4 stars however because these really need a flip top instead of the sticker lid. The wipes stay very wet for a long time, another huge plus that they don\u2019t dry out. But sometimes the sticker lid doesn\u2019t seal very well and water can leak out. Flip tops are also just easier to deal with. Please make these with flip top without raising the price!

My toddler has had severe allergies since birth and water wipes has been a faithful companion through it all. As well, I suffer from chemical allergies myself and I have found water wipes gentle and helpful for me to use too. I have bought tons of water wipes packages and have only found one damaged single pack. I have found the products consistent in satisfaction.",

      "text": "Ever since we switched to Water Wipes. our baby has rarely gotten any diaper rashes. When we used Huggies sensitive wipes, it would irritate the skin and it only got worse as time went on. We avoided rashes by using these wipes and drying the skin completely before putting the diaper on. We never even need diaper cream/paste. So glad we realized all the extra chemical ingredients in different baby wipes cause irritation - none of that is in Water Wipes! It only has water and a tiny amount of fruit extract. Works perfectly.",

The texture and feel is soft, moistness is perfect, seal on the pack stays put until i'm finished with the pack, and it's easy to open one handed when you have a squirmy poopy baby. My only concern is that they may not be as biodegradable as other wipes (the wipes remind me a dryer sheets when dry). I buy these by the case. Love that they have no chemicals or smell.",

HOWEVER, my oldest son has extremely sensitive skin, and WaterWipes work extremely well for him without aggrivating his skin or burning with any chemicals like other brands did, and for that reason alone I'll never go to a different wipe.",

I'd advise any parents to stay away from anything scented and invest in these incredible wipes for the sake of your children's tender skin.",

Additionally they are gentle on the skin and have an extremely limited number of ingredients. I always include a pack of these in baby shower and welcome home gifts as I want as many people to learn about this product as possible. Price point wise, these are more expensive than big box brands, however the cost is relatively equivalent considering it takes 1/2 the amount of wipes to clean up most messes.",

WaterWipes are the only wipes made with just water, specially purified and softened, and a tiny drop of grapefruit seed extract. WaterWipes have been carefully designed to be gentle on babies\u2019 sensitive skin. They are the only wipes that contain 99.9% water and a drop of grapefruit seed extract \u2013 a natural skin conditioner. Because they are hypoallergenic, WaterWipes don\u2019t irritate the skin and are safe for use on sensitive skin. The National Eczema Association has awarded the Seal of Acceptance to WaterWipes. The story behind WaterWipes When our first daughter was born, she suffered with sensitive skin and developed bad diaper rash. I wanted to find out why, so I took a look at the ingredients in the baby wipes we were using. I was shocked to learn just how many chemicals were in them \u2013 and questioned should we be putting them on her delicate skin I thought there had to be a better way so I set about creating a purer and safe alternative. Many years later and after a lot of hard work, testing, and scientific research, the perfect baby wipes, WaterWipes were born. Pure, gentle and safe for the most delicate skin yet as convenient as a regular baby wipe. Every day, in every corner of the world, new moms and dads are discovering the benefits of our gentle and safe wipes for their baby\u2019s skin, I hope you like them too. Ingredients are Water (Aqua) 99.9%, Citrus Grandis (grapefruit) seed extract and contains traces of Benzalkonium Chloride",
