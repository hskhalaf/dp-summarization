      "text": "I finally broke down and bought the Special Edition Charge 3 white/graphite which also came with the solid black band. I absolutely love love love it!! But after 2 months, the band started tearing and peeling on the inside. When I tried to get a replacement (they do come under warranty), customer service informed me that they do not have a replacement for the white sport band. The only colors they have are berry, scarlet, or navy. Being someone who doesn't wear alot of colors, this was very disappointing. I love wearing my Fitbit and am completely let down they can't replace a band that \"they\" sell. Be ready for disappointment if your band rips.",

I ended up spending more money for a new charger in case that was the problem. It isn't. I have tried charging it from more than a dozen USB ports. That isn't the problem. My Charge 3 has now been DEAD a week and I am still waiting for Fitbit customer service to respond to me. I am extremely disappointed.",

NOT ONCE has Fitbit worked for Crossfit so it is fair to assume that it does not track any strenuous activity accurately. Buy a cheaper pedometer + heart rate because that is all this is",

Fitbit support are \"investigating\" - but from the look of the Fitbit support forums there are many, many people in the same situation. I'll update with any resolution - but for now it's too early and there are many software issues that mean this is a 1 star review. The band is effectively a brick.",
