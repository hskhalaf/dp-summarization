Been looking for a while and many are reviewed as too flimsy or having zippers that fall off after being used 2x. This one is good sturdy material and the zipper seems to be solid. There are handles for when you need to pull them back out to get something. I only gave these 4 stars because I don\u2019t know how they will hold up after more time. So far so good.",

I have used storage containers that have cloth sides to slide under my bed in the past, but they normally have something to stiffen the sides to keep it upright as you retrieve your items. I had not realized how important this feature is until I tried this product. It is definitly not worth the purchase. I will need to find another product to do the job.",
