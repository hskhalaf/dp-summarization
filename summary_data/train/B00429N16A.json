However, it has never worked this way. Windows 7 periodically lost connection, and now windows 10 can not even see it. I have opened sever tickets with Western Digital over the years but their customer service is terrible. They have never supported this product and now I'm just out of luck. My only recourse is to buy a new device or build my own NAS. I will NEVER buy another western digital device.",

I really love the personal control over any haphazard commercial system that may or may not go out of business or get compromised some day.",

I use Norton Security Suite for automatic continuous backup, which gives me some peace of mind. Would qualify for 5 stars if the network set up was more intuitive. Maybe that's not all WD's fault, since I'm a Microsoft home user. I would put in a good word for the WD help folks, who were responsive and pleasant.",

But I have not been successful in getting answers from WD. For example, when I add files to MBL, why does it take hours (overnight) to have the files appear on my DLNA devices. Clicking on RESCAN or REBUILD under SETTINGS does not seem to help. What is happening that takes so long? I have tried to connect with WD Support via email/phone but since they will not use a proper CALLER ID, I never can answer when they call. Now I can't even log in?",
