The bag is definitely larger and designed for a working photographer. There are so many little pockets and zippers for my accessories as well. This for a fraction of the price of some of the designer camera bags I'd been looking at. I think I can finally stop searching for the ultimate storage bag!! :)",

I am using the large for a Canon G50 video camera with rig, and not only can it easily fit the camera with cage & zoom H5, but it also fits a Blackmagic Video Assist, AC adapters, cables, etc. etc., and I still have plenty of unused pockets. My one criticism is that while they are very customizable with many dividers, they could do with more velcro on the inside case sides for the dividers to attach to. Otherwise they are really nicely made cases and I am quite happy with them. Would definitely purchase again.",

I didn't think that I would be able to do it, but this case fits three full size flashes, a wide angle camcorder lens, and a 70-300 zoom on the bottom level. I have an SLR and a camcorder on the top level. The pockets are great because they allow some easy organizing of battery chargers and flash controllers. Cables can fit in the mesh pocket on the case top. (See my images for photos of how I organized the layout.) I have owned many cases over my career, but this one offers the best value for its size and price.",

Because of the size of the velcroed dividers, and the way the velcro is positioned around the sides of the case, it's not practical to turn those 4 tiny slots into 2 decent-sized slots (or at least, I couldn't figure it out).

      "text": "Make no mistake, this is a rather bulky bag. It's heavily padded all over and protects the equipment from the elements. The only odd thing I have is just that I didn't expect the bag to be \"fat\". Since I'm used to the dinky Nikon starter bag, this bag definitely blows that one out of the water. It comfortably holds my Nikon D90 + Grip with 18-105 lens, Charger, Cleaning supplies, battery stuff, lens filters, Canon P&S, and still has space for 2 lens and another camera body.",

It is so good to have one bag with everything in it for a quick grab, and for taking in the car. I wouldn't want to carry it for long, but that is what a sling bag was made for. This bag even has straps for a tripod. Amazing value",

I didn't want to cart around a bag that weighed 50# but I needed a bag that held all the lenses and was lightweight. This is it. Don't go anywhere else. This bag is intelligently designed with spaces for everything, easy access to extra lenses, pockets for accessories, a comfortable strap. The bright color interior is an added bonus. This is the one.",
