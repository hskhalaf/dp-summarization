Same results. Whenever it's outside, no dots. Take it inside, the dots are visible. It doesn't surprise me because I saw this scope on Amazon for under $20. Buy the crossbow, then throwaway the scope that came with it and buy something different. I picked up a Raging River Crossbow 4X32 Muti-reticle Scope from Amazon for $40 and couldn't be happier.

The three dots are out of alignment(top dot is further left than bottom dot)but even so I was able to sight it in with just the center dot for anything under 30-yards from ground or stand. It is loud - about as loud as a 22 rifle, but bolt delivery is quick. Definately happy with this purchase!",

And, as others have noted, the provided sight is way too dim - barely visible in anything but low light. Other than these things, it might be a decent little bow for the price.
