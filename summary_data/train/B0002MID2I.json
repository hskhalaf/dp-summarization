The unit operates very smooth and it is not too bad on air consumption if you dial back the pressure and control the flow for the task at hand. Granted, if you need the full power, it will consume air. I'm mostly sanding primer or filler, so throttling the air helps reduce compressor cycling and gets the job done.",

I have two other DA sanders (Hutchins & Snap-On), that are finishing DA\u2019s that I sue majority of the time. When is comes to cutting and stripping of bumpers and hoods, this beast gets the job done a lot quicker. When we stripping a bumper job with the finishing sanders, it would take 1.5-2 hours, where as with this one it takes 30 tops. Well worth the price!. Plan on using this to strip down my 72 Nova",

I actually had to slow it down, and use a higher grit sandpaper to slow down how much material it would take off. I gave it 3 stars because it failed so quickly. This was replacing a DA sander that i had used for years in a wood shop.",

We'll see how long it lasts, but if it lasts a year then it's far cheaper to buy this unit than the comparable \"industrial brand\" that is so much higher-priced. Uses the same sanding disks. The guys using it are picky -- and they are impressed. I haven't told them the price! :-) UPDATE 12/8/2018... Not only has this lasted, but the guys in the shop like them so much, we've bought three more. Bargain price for the value.",
