I foresee the latch will soon break off, in particular when hot water is put into the Growler.. Unfortunately, this is a design defective. Please fix this,Thermos. Once the latch goes, the whole growler becomes useless.",

This is a very stout thermos, bottom almost feels like a solid piece. Stopper/cap has a stainless steel bottom, which means your beer will not be touching any plastic. Clasping mechanism is very tight and part of the handle which is attached at the bottom with a Phillips screw. So after many years of use, if the clasp gets too loose or breaks, I'm sure a quick inquiry to Stanley will get you in the right direction for a new part.",

I'm using it for hot liquids mostly and I would take their 18 hours \"HOT\" estimate with a big grain of salt. My guess is that if you filled it and didn't ever open it during those 18 hours, it would stay very close to the hot it was when filled. But if you open it and take some out, that time is likely only 6-7 hours. Really helps if you pre-fill it with boiling water and let it sit for 5 minutes and then dump and fill with coffee.",

If I don't finish the growler within a day and a half or so, I just put it in the fridge. It seals so well that it preserves the beer for several days beyond what a traditional glass growler will do.

I also have used this for large-batch cocktails during picnics and beach trips and it's great for that, too. I suppose you could also fill it with non-alcoholic beverages like iced tea.

Not worth my time to return so I guess I'll keep it until the hinge breaks which will probably be soon. Other than that, the quality of the handle, rubber seal, and the inside seems good. Too bad they didn't implement the quality throughout the whole product.",
