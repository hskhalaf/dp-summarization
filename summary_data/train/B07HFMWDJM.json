Several are also impressed with the shoe\u2019s overall aesthetic. However, some think that the pair is quite pricey. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a reliable and responsive cushioning system, this model might be for you.",

        "It\u2019s been the consensus that the Adidas T-MAC Millennium presents a great look for its users",

        "A player pointed out how comfortable these Adidas shoes for basketball are",
        "The shoe has herringbone traction",
        "Several patrons of the Adidas T-Mac collection are ecstatic to know that this basketball shoe model contains Boost, just like the 3rd volume of James Harden's signature basketball shoes"

      "text": "I loved the Nike Hyperdunks. They are the best mass-produced basketball shoes ever made. Naturally, Nike stopped making them. Getting it right isn't entirely what capitalism is about. My first attempt at replacing them went poorly. The shoes (another model of Adida's) were quickly demoted to casual shoes. This model proved much better. I wore them around the house for a couple of months to promote the relationship between my foot and the shoe interior. The interior is spongy and seems to acclimate to the idiosyncrasies of the foot. They are not quite Hyperdunks, but they are worthy of the serious hoopster.",

      "text": "very comfortable shoes. good basketball shoes. decent impact resistance, excellent traction on court, and excellent lockdown on your feet. if you are looking for good basketball shoes on decent price range, i strongly recommend these. my only complaint would be this is low ankle. I am used to high ankle basketball shoes so still trying to get used to my ankle being open, but other than that, (since it is my personal preferance to wear high ankle b-shoes) there really is no flaws or negative about the shoes. Hope this information helps",

Wont be sending the shoes back, look to be in good condition but if this is what I can expect from this company as far as quality and care goes I likely wont order more shoes from them. Not advertised as used shoes but I'm 95% sure these shoes were used then cleaned up before sending out.",
