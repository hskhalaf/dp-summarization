The only thing was that the ankle straps were not tight enough so my husband pulled back the rhinestone strip, trimmed it and then the strap could be adjusted tighter. A very nice heel that was a comfortable height to be worn all night. Now I did have sore feet but that was from neglecting to remember that I would have to park in downtown New Orleans for the event and traverse cobblestone streets. Not advisable. These added major bling to the outfit I wore for an upscale company Christmas party.",

But other than that, I think I can rock these for a couple of hours at my wedding....hopefully :) They're only 3.5\" tall so not too bad.",
