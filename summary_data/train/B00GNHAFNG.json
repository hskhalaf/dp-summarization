Unfortunately, it still doesn't touch my vicious migraines, but that was very nice of them to follow up with me!",

When it doesn't go away completely, I just roll it on again. It really works for me. I also love the scent, not super sweet, but peppermint! Try it.",

      "text": "It took me a couple weeks to order this after reading about it. Then, I looked forward to trying it. I am not disappointed. It does not CURE my headaches. What it does is HELP! Without drugs. And, that i LOVE. I have had migraines and sinus headaches longer than I care to remember. I highly recommend and encourage this product. It is a \"tool\" in a headache sufferer's toolbag. There are NO side effects and nothing harmful. I am now getting ready to order and try the stress relief formula. Thank you for a great product.",

      "text": "I have been plagued with headaches for most of my life and this does a great job on my less than severe ones. Even on my worst headaches this will take the edge off and assist if I need to take something stronger. Also the scent does help me relax. I have purchased this for my daughters and they also use it. Also I dealt with the company a couple years ago when I received one that was clearly opened. I contacted them and not only did they replace it, they also sent a bottle of their Stress Relief which sits by my computer for heavy stress days.",

It was no big deal (we could still use it) but we responded to an email sent by Nutravana just to give them a feedback on the leak. A few days later, we received a replacement with a hand written note! Not only is the quality of this product exceptional, but the quick personalized response has made us loyal Nutravana customers !",

It has a soothing fragrance and this helps to calm my stomach which tends to be upset when I have a headache. I keep it near me at all times, taking it in my purse when I go out. It is so easy and discreet to use. It doesn't eliminate my headache, but it really does make it more bearable and of shorter duration. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed.",

      "text": "I've bought a variety of these headache oils trying to find something that works as well as one I borrowed years ago. This works about as well as any I've tried... It completely knocks the headache out about half the time. I really love this one for the size and shape of the roller applicator. It's perfect for massaging with firmer pressure than I can do on the back of my own neck, especially at the base of the skull. I also rub it into my tmj and put a dot under my nose so I can keep smelling it. You may want to test if it irritates your skin before putting on your face.",
