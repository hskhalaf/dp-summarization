It really smooths out the sound in our main space which is a rather large room. The extra bass this provides over the speakers gives the overall sound a nice boost. It still seems like a lot of money to spend on it, but just like everything else we've bought from Sonos this works out-of-the-box with little configuration, and that is something we can really appreciate.",

If setup had worked first try without me spending an entire evening trying different approaches, I would have given it 5 stars.",
