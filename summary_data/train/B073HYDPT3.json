Video is a bit grainy, but is expected at this price point. Wifi FPV seemed to work well in the range I was in. There are trim functions to help with stabilization. Flight time is as advertised....Approx. 8-9 min. The app is basic but it does what it is supposed to (record video, take pics, live FPV).",

Can do amazing, multiple flips and, with a little practice, you can do amazing aerobatics. Try cutting power during a high flip, then going full power as it falls. Looks cool. Very durable. Batteries are cheap. Highly recommended! Excellent customer service. I had a problem with the wifi from the drone dropping out, so they're sending me a replacement. Vina was a knowledgeable and helpful customer representative.",

I ended up buying 2 more batteries which seem a little bit longer life maybe but not by much. Maybe it's just impossible and dropping a star for it is unfair, I couldn't drop a half star. But overall I feel this was the right choice for what I wanted and I have zero regrets. The YouTube reviews led me to a good drone.",

It almost teaches you how to handle it after trying it a couple of times. The controls are sensitive and respond very well. Once one learns how to handle and control it, it is a lot of fun and feels much better than cheaper more fragile models our there.",
