      "text": "After a little over two years of medium-heavy use, this drive is failing. I was simply transferring something onto it, as one often does with external hard drives, when the transfer completely crashed. From then on the drive would freeze and function unreliably any time I tried to copy anything of substance onto it. CHKDSK is reporting numerous bad data clusters and not enough spares to swap them out with, so now I have 1.5TB of precious data that I'm in danger of losing. For what it's worth, the drive worked very well until it did fail. Transfer speeds were as expected with USB3, and it was very responsive overall.",

Otherwise a smooth, quiet, stylish external HDD. --Update 1-- This drive is still a solid drive a few months in. I am very pleased, in fact, I just purchased a second drive.",

I've only had it for two months now, so if I have any future problems, I'll edit this post.",

They don't listen to your explains and turn you down very rude. Worst customer services I ever had with this company.",
