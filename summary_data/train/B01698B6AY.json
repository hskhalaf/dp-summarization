We were able to paint it with some white paint and it hides it pretty well. We toyed with the idea of sending it back, but we had already unboxed it, cleared my son's room and carved out a day to put it together. Overall happy with the bed.",

Thankfully we do not need the bed, it is just a back up. Thought I would share what I learned in an effort to help others who may also be thinking thicker os better.",

I don't know how much time we'll get out of it but for the time being it is a solid deal. If you're looking for something to last 10 years, look elsewhere. If you need something quick for a young child or a guest room, this is a pretty good deal.",

They don't want the bed back either. I don't blame them. Don't buy this item.",
