(Then again, aren\u2019t most noisy toys?) this toy withstood so much without showing a hint of damage. Also, not once did I change the batteries since I bought this. It finally started to run out when I got rid of it. Also, take advantage of the \u201ctry me\u201d part if your kid likes to turn things on and walk away, leaving them running forever until you go turn them off. The \u201ctry me\u201d let\u2019s it run for a few seconds then automatically turns off!",

I Will be returning the item in hopes of reordering one that isn't a faulty product.",
