      "text": "It's been a while I don't buy a Sony camera, as I tend to prefer canon. But because I am used to the quality of the Canon professional rebel series, I realized that their compact digital camera picture quality is not very clear specially in low settings. Therefore I decided to give Sony another change. And I loved it. The light weight of this camera is great, I bought to take it Carnaval in Brazil, and this camera would fit on my jeans pockets. It makes amazing crystal clear videos with zoom and the pictures are great. The panoramic feature is also a plus. If you decide to buy this camera you regret it.",

      "text": "Overall the camera is great. My biggest grip is the menu and the anti-shaking feature. I got this to replace a dsc-9 which I loved ever so dearly. This model now has a touch screen. It is nice but not as responsive as I would like (I'm used to my iphone). Also, the anti-shake feature which was awesome on my dsc-9 is now as solid now on the newer models. It is still really good though and definitely better than the other cameras I looked at out there. Overall I would highly recommend the camera, especially for the price. You get much better quality in a nice sized package compared to other options out there.",

Still pictures are clear and crisp...no color disorientation. Video is the best i have seen across in a point and shoot camera till now. Has a very good menu navigation. the operations system is pretty cool too - can switch to an easy view for people who do not like all the complications and can switch back to regular mode for more settings. very light weighted, small - smaller than my Nokia N900 :) Touchscreen is ok..does its job.low light pictures are cool too. Im happy I bought this !!!",

The camera is ready to take a photo just a few seconds after it is powered on. Like I said, no complaints.",

This camera would be a good camera for the price range of $100. I ended up taking it back and getting the H55 and Sony regained it's brownie points with me with that camera! I recommend the H55 over this, no questions asked.",

    "description": "Take your pictures further with this sleek, stylish Sony Cyber-shot camera. Capture vast landscapes in Sweep Panorama and view them on a beautiful 3.0\" touch screen. Get better group shots with a 25mm wide angle lens and get the best shot with iAuto Mode, Smile Shutter and Soft Skin.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Take your pictures further with the hot new Cyber-shot T99 digital camera. Capture vast landscapes in Sweep Panorama and view them on a beautiful 3.0-inch (diag.) touch screen. Get better group shots with a 25mm wide angle lens and get the best shot with iAuto Mode, Smile Shutter and Soft Skin. \n\nCyber-shot T99 Overview & Highlights \n\nUltra-wide, 265-degree Panoramic Shots\nSweep Panorama Mode reaches beyond the traditional wide angle lenses to let you capture expansive, breathtaking shots of landscapes or skyscrapers. Just press the shutter and shoot the scene with a sweeping motion. The camera does the rest. \n\nTouch 'n' View\nNo more fussing with tiny buttons. Just tap the large, 3.0-inch (diag.) touch-screen display to review your shots in vivid color and ultra-sharp contrast. \n\nIt's All About the Lens\nThe high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for video recording as well as for outdoor, sports, and travel photos, and Close Focus shoots close-ups up to just under 1/2-inch from the subject. A wide angle of 25mm equivalent wide-angle lens allows you to take wider shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces. \n\nGoodbye Blurry Photos\nDon't let a not-so-steady hand prevent you from capturing the moment. Optical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically compensates to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. \n\nShoot Movies in HD\nNothing recreates the moment like razor-sharp, high definition video. Your movies will look stunning on YouTube and similar sites thanks to the 720p high-definition MPEG4 recording format. Record up to 29 minutes (or up to 2GB) per movie in 720p format. \n\nA Smarter Auto Mode\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you--recognizing scenes, lighting conditions and faces--and automatically adjusts the settings for you. The results are clear images, faces with natural skin tone and less blur.",
