Tried all troubleshooting tips from Lenovo and did not solved the issue. Seller did not provide support at all and refered me to Lenovo. I was forced to go back to my old Lenovo which is still working like a charm. BEWARE! In summary, I lost all my work, wasted time and money. Now I need to return this and get a decent one.",

Now here I am having to send it back for repairs and using insurance I had to pay for. I am without a computer to do my work. This is NOT fair.",

Support Claims Hard Drive Failed, when a new one is replaced into it (mind you all the data on the system is lost) they now claim to not know what is wrong and I am out a computer for an unknown period of time. Considered buying other Lenovo Products for my business until this experience happened.",
