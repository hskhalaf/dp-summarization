Cuts in plywood have been great, especially when using the scoring feature to reduce tear-out. The only thing about this saw that had me on the fence was that it didn't have a riving knife, but that has been a non-issue. I also haven't had an issue with any of the two tracks I purchased. Kickback, it can happen with any circular saw, just take your time.",

Cuts do not splinter on rips and very little on crosscuts when using the scoring feature. The saw could use more power, however, but works good for cuts in 3/4\" plywood.

The Freud Diablo blade I mentioned above is 1/16 (less waste), and cuts more smoothly and without burns. My only other criticism of this is that the instructions do not have very good pictures in it that reference what they are talking about. Overall I am very happy with this purchase so far.",

The rail is bowed from one end to the other, meaning it does not lay flat on the cutting surface. So as you move the saw down the track, the track lifts up at the ends and rotates on the center point, prohibiting it from keeping a pre-set line. I did some research and others have had quality issues with the rails, depending on where they were made. Only realized the issue after the 1 month return window on Amazon, so am trying to get an exchange from the manufacturer.",

In addition, the saw has close-to-wall cutting capability (11/16 inch) for expanded cutting applications. The built-in depth stop allows a preliminary cut of 1/16 inch to be performed before the entire material is cut, creating clean and splinter-free cutting.  12 AMP Direct-Drive Power for Smooth Cutting \nThe SP6000J has a powerful 12 amp motor with soft start for smooth start-ups and Electronic Speed Control to maintain a constant speed under load for smooth cutting. The variable-speed dial control (2,000-5,200 rpm) allows the user to set the speed for optimum performance in a variety of materials. The built-in torque limiter helps prevent motor burnout. \n\n Precision Cuts and Ease of Use \nThe SP6000J saw includes a range of convenient features, including a large top handle and an electric brake for increased productivity. The saw also features a lock lever that attaches the saw to the rail system, so the saw stays on the rail when positioned for a bevel cut.
