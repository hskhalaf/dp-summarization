It keeps white wine from un-chilling itself as you sit at the table engaging in long-winded conversation, and even more importantly, greatly reduces the amount of time you need to pre-chill your wine in the freezer/refrigerator. Slap it on a bottle of pinot noir and bring it down to 60F in a few minutes. I have gotten my money's worth out of this product, that is certain.",

This way, in a few minutes you can chill down a bottle from room temperature. But if you just want to keep your already-chilled bottle cold, this works like a charm. Good price, too!",

    "title": "Vacu Vin Inc. Rapid Ice Active Cooler Wine Bottle Chilling Sleeve, Standard, Chrome",
    "description": "Vacu Vin Rapid Ice Wine Coolers were developed to chill wine quickly and keep it chilled for an extended period of time, all without the need of a refrigerator or ice bucket. The cooling sleeve contains 6 pockets of specifically formulated, non-toxic gel that expands when placed in a freezer for a period of 6 hours or more. Upon removal from the freezer, the Rapid Ice Wine Cooler easily slides over the outside of the wine bottle to chill the whole bottle within 5 minutes. Once cooled, the wine will remain chilled for hours due to the multiple layers of insulated foil and foam within the sleeve. The Rapid Ice Wine Cooler is designed to fit any standard-sized wine bottle. The award-winning wine cooler is both flexible and virtually unbreakable. It is also lightweight which allows you to use it at parties, picnics, barbecues and much more! Once used, simply return the Rapid Ice Wine Cooler to the freezer to reuse over and over again! Vacu Vin was established in 1986 in Delft, the Netherlands. For over 30 years this family-owned company has evolved into the leading brand within the housewares industry, offering an array of barware accessories and kitchen gadgets that are characterized by their quality and innovative functionality.
