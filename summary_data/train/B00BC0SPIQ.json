If you've had problems sleeping I highly recommend this pillow.",

The tighter the pillowcase the more firm it is and the longer it retains the lift. I sleep on my side and it's the only pillow I've ever had that holds my head up enough that my shoulders don't feel like they are being driven up into my neck. I have bought multiple for myself and as gifts to family members with neck issues.",
