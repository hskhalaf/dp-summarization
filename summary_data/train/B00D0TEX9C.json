      "text": "My cat loved the snacks when he was able to find them, but for whatever reason wasn't able to locate them as easily as most food. He had difficulty locating them both visually and by small even with the snacks presented right in front of him. He did, however, recognize the packaging. When presented with the bag and a pile of snacks, he'll try to tear the packaging open rather than eat the exposed snacks. Strange phenomenon I've never encountered with other cat food/snacks.",
