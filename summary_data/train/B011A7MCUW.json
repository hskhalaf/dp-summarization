Ours required just a little tweak to the tuning to be right on and the instructor was very happy with the warm but clear tones expressed by this acoustic guitar. The fit and finish of the guitar was also fantastic for the price and ours came nicely tooled, tight and well constructed.",

I own and have played many different acoustic guitars, in all different price ranges. It's amazing that an instrument of this quality can be had for less than $100. The guitar plays well and sounds decent. It is small, so don't expect a big sound. Would be excellent for young beginners.",

The strings sound crisp n bright. I have only played for a short time so far, will play longer on my day off. But at this point, I am highly impressed w/ this guitar. It's pretty darn GREAT, and the price was so low too. I got the 36 inch size, and I'm 5'5. The size is good n comfortable, not too bulky, and it's certainly loud enuff too. This guitar is really something special. so beautiful. Very happy and thankful to have it.",
