He can easily carry them around in his mouth. The only caveat is that as any cat owner knows, what one cat loves, another cat may refuse to even look at. I like them because they're well made. They hold up to a lot of abuse. Every once in a while, I see a little pink felt ear on the floor, but otherwise, none have torn, nor have the tails and eyes come off nor has my cat been able to bite them off.",

He will also eventually chew through them until the stuffing comes out. They are affordable so at that point I just replace them.",

I don't know about all cats, but mine doesn't seem to be able to notice her mousy if it's the same color as the rug. Wish they came in bright colors! Great for the price.

      "text": "I've purchased 3 packs of these because of the add on price. they are small about 1 1\\2 inches big. Basically no bigger than your thump. But,... My 4 year old cat just loves play time with these mice. I bought a pack a few weeks ago & she couldn't get enough of these. She tore them open & I sewed them back closed. It's not that these are cheaply made but she loves pulling things apart & her favorite toys is no exception. So I have bought more to keep on hand. They really entertain her & she becomes so silly when playing with these.",

So I pick them up and stick them in a bag in drawer for a while. Then when I get them back out they are like a new thing all over again. Keeping them in a zip loc baggie must make the catnip scent strong again. They last as long as they possible can being exposed to sharp claws and teeth. I'd but them again and again. They are cheap entertainment.",

I highly recommend them, they are real mouse size and certainly go through a lot with my Siamese fur-babies(she's got one right now so I'll see how long it takes before she drowns it)",
