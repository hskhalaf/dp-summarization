It works best on my face. I can't say it does a lot for dry skin elsewhere, however. UPDATE ON BROWN SPOTS: I can't explain it, but same brown spots which disappeared at first have come back. So didn't want people having too much confidence in my review about their disappearance.",

Unlike lotions that seem to only work for a few hours. I would like to see less lavender scent... maybe go with more of a Bulgarian lavender with the Rose undertones. Otherwise, great product!",

I reached out via email and the Co-Founder Maria followed up by sending the Unscented version free of charge, letting me still keep the Original bottle. The Unscented still has lavender, but maybe less in amount in the total formula, as there's no slight lavender scent. The oil is great for the scalp, face and skin without a heavy greasy feel. Highly recommended the product for it's quality and excellent customer service.",

As such it does what you expect olive oil to do when you dump it on your head. This is nothing fancy, they tell you the ingredients right from the outset. The combination of those ingredients don't achieve anything too fancy but if you want some olive oil to dump on your head, there are worse ways to go about it.",

      "text": "I think this oil would be perfect without the Lavender, or with less of it. It's overpowering. I squirted some out when I got it and it was too much to use on my face so I put it on my hair. It feels softer and like a high quality oil, but the scent is kind of making my throat sore, so I can't imagine using it on my face. Maybe I'm allergic to lavender but I've never had an issue before. I would buy it again, if they replaced it with something else.",

A little goes a long way so keep that in mind, and it absorbs into your skin (not oily) leaving it so soft and your skin feels amazing. I look forward to trying their other products. My hubby loves it too. You won't be disappointed.",

At first it\u2019s a lavender scent THEN just kinda turns into a smell of (how do I describe it) like you walked into some kids dorm room and they are burning incense. Kinda musky smell. The lavender fades. Probably will not order again and just stick with argan oil.",
