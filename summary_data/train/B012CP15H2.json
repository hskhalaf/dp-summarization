It has a see-through lid and although the instructions say not to clip the clamps while cooking, by clamping them, it totally eliminates the clattering of the lid. My daughter has a similar one only bigger and the clamped lid really helps. My old crock pot would literally bubble up with steam and rattle the lid, often leaving little puddles on the counter. Not so with this one - very pleased.",

      "text": "Being empty nesters, it seemed like all of my crockpots were too big and bulky for smaller sized recipes. Cooking for 2 is a big enough hassle, let alone having big slow cookers take up space in the cupboards. This works great and is a better size for a two-person household. I LOVE IT. Currently it is on the counter top cooking Swedish meatballs for dinner! It also is attractive and looks nice when taking it to potlucks and parties.",
