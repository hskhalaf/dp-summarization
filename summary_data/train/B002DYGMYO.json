While most people will have their young athletic player wear one AFTER a concussion I felt it was important not to injure their young brains at all .",

I saw another ice skater using this soft helmet, so I decided to give it a try. I know this headgear is designed for soccer, but it works fine for ice skating as well. It protects the area that is likely to hit the ice when she falls. It stays on my girls head okay. The ponytail port helps to keep the headgear in place. The only complain I have is the quality of those hook & loop fastening tapes. Look like they won't last for too long.",

As an eigth grader playing with bigger kids especially i needed to know i was doing everything i could do as a mom to help protect him. He doesnt complain at all. A couple kids on th team wear it as well so ots not a big deal. Maybe every team or school should consider making this headgear mandatory. Its comfortable and well made. Great choice for my son",
