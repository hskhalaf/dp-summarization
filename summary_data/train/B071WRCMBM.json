Thats handy for better stability and helps balance the weight in your shoulders better, less strain on the lower back. The bags material is nice and thick, you can tell its well made. A great bag for a great price. My only suggestion would be to make it in more colors. Black is my least fav color. \ud83d\ude42.",
