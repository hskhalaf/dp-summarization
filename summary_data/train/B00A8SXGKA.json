I found out that it doesn't weigh accurately a few months later when I used it for the first time. It weighted my bag at 46 pounds, but at the airport it was 52 pounds. I had the same issues coming home with the airport weighting my bag at 49.5 and the scale reading 44. This luggage scale almost cost me $100 in overweight fines, but luckily I was with others who took some of my clothes into their bags.",

It is very accurate as well. My luggage weighed exactly what the scale said when we got to the airport. I had never thought of purchasing a hand held weight scale before, but Southwest airlines only allows 40lbs, which is really tight. I highly recommend this product and would purchase again in a heartbeat.",

My other scale beeps and freezes the reading once it's stabilized, and I much prefer that method. Overall, a great travel scale that's small and light enough to travel with. For a 50-pound suit case, it read within 1 pound of the airport scale (which read 1 pound higher than this one).",

      "text": "This is really helpful esp for international travel where you have to be accurate about luggage weight. It really helps since it is digital scale. The only draw back i experienced is that it is difficult to weight 50lbs since you have to lift it with both hands (it hurts) and the battery slot right below is loose so whenever you lift, it tends to disconnect and reset the measurement and you have to start the whole thing over and over again. I had to tape it so, it wouldn't move. The battery lasted only lasts 3 mths, and i used it to weight 50-60 times.",

We were able to pack up and weigh our luggage going and coming home (thank goodness as I had 15 extra pounds free and were able to move stuff to family's luggage to mine as they were over by 10 pounds). We were also able to use the temperature guage to see if the back room of the condo we rented was too hot compared to the rest of the rooms.",
