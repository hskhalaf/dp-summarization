Basically, my girls suck at skating and fall all the time. I don't even want to think about what would have happened without these. One time one of the knee pads got out of place and just ONE FALL one of them scraped her knee and it was apparently the end of the world. So these are lifesavers. They stay on just fine on a four year old.",

I chose these, instead of the many others available, because of the size and width of the velcro and the padding, which the padding looks as adequate as any of the others offered. My grand daughter hasn't tried them on yet so I can't comment on the fit. I do however like the feel of the plastic. It isn't super hard and has a little give which I think will be better vervus hard plastic. I bought them to eliminate skin abrasions not from breaks. I don't think any of the other ones would help with breaks either, if that's what you're going for.",
