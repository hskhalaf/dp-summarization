But it's easy to loosen if you want to give your shoulder a break for a little while without taking it off. Been wearing it at night, as well. It keeps me from getting into weird positions for my injured shoulder while sleeping. Intelligently designed. Very versatile. Super happy with it! No complaints.",

He says the shoulder stabilizer helps his shoulder and fits. He did think that the chest size ran small but it does fit. It would have been better if there were instructions instead of just the pictures on the box. It only took two days to get it.",

Maybe wearing an elastic neoprene shoulder sleeve would help with comfort.",
