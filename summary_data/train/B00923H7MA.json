There may be an obvious way to turn off this feature, but I have not yet found it.",

When I strike the high string, the display jumps back and forth between D and B flat, usually ending up where it seems to settle on B flat. Tuning to center the needle winds up giving me a slightly flat D. So I have to tune that string by ear. This is specifically happening while using the tuner's built in microphone. I don't know whether or not the same behavior is exhibited if you plug in an electric guitar.",

It has other features which I don't use. My only slightly negative comment is that the tones it generates don't sound like a nice sine wave like a tuning fork provides. This isn't a big deal to me since it will then show what you are getting after you have set your instrument to the tone.",

I also purchased the CM\u2013L100 clip on mic because I know she will need the isolation to tune such a quiet instrument in a large and unruly first-year band room. She had no problem immediately grasping how it functions thanks to Korg's experience in design. It's all very intuitive. I am a professional musician and really can't find any fault with it.",

My husband has asked me to order him one to replace is old Korg tuner. So I'll be ordering another. Excellent quality and a great price.",

The metronome settings, while not always the most precise in terms of what I want to achieve, get the job done for daly use. However, the best thing about this tuner is that the sound is not limited to a single octave, but can reach the natural ranges of most instruments, which is a feature lacking on a many metronome/tuners. A necessity on a music stand, this tuner really is the best of the cheap.",
