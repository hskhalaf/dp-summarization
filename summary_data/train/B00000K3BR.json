Running & stomping is more fun + I rather have him send rockets into the air vs shoot foam launchers at people. With the smaller foam rockets we have they eventually lose the fins so I fully expect the same with the large ones. This won\u2019t impact them launching but may impact the direction.

Would recommend going with as large a size rocket as you can accommodate in terms of launch zone. I\u2019d say to figure the height of flight to be about the radius of your landing area.",

I wouldn\u2019t bother getting the extra rockets, because it\u2019s good for kids to run around and catch them (and for adults to figure out how to get them out of the gutters!). I highly recommend this for any gift of littles... even the adults will love stomping on it. Shoot, it might be the perfect gift for that someone who has everything: it\u2019s compact and ridiculously amusing.",

      "text": "This is a great outdoor toy for kids that does not take up too much space in your backyard or garage. Our kids love to launch the rockets and chase them in the yard, although they can easily get stuck in trees. I think the kids learn about using different strategies to launch the rockets to make them go higher or lower based upon how hard they step on the launcher. The rockets are made of soft foam so they are unlikely to cause any injury. Our kids and their friends absolutely love these rockets and it is easily one of their favorite outdoor toys -- plus, it is a simple and easy to store/clean toy as well",

After a few practice trials, he had no trouble at all stomping on the base and getting of great launches. I like that the rockets are soft foam and completely safe. Great toy.",

Only complaint is that the tripod (2 pieces you wedge together) come apart after every rocket launch. I finally just duct taped the legs together and it works fine - but it could use a better design on that portion. Still would recommend.",

Only drawback is that we have to help her keep the launcher steady because when they jump off onto the air pad, it tends to force the hose to wiggle enough to where it'll shake the launcher if it's not held.",

    "description": "Edition:Jr GlowStomp Rocket Jr. Glow is 100% KID powered! Run, jump and STOMP to launch these rockets up to 100 feet in the air! All-foam Jr. Glow Stomp Rockets are great for younger kids. They glow in the dark and are perfect for fun during the day, after dusk and in gloomy weather too. Stomp Rocket Jr. Glow is strong and durable, and great for active, outdoor play. Stomp Rockets have won lots of awards from industry experts, including iParenting Media, Dr. Toy and Creative Child Magazine. Includes 4 all-foam glow-in-the-dark Stomp Rockets and a Stomp Launcher. Refill rockets also available (item #20015). For kids ages 3 and up.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nKids can get rid of some excess energy with this air-powered outdoor rocket toy. No battery or fuel is needed to get the rockets airborne--just some old-fashioned stomping power. Set up the simple launch stand in a clear outdoor area, connect the 38-inch-long vinyl air hose and blast pad, load one of the 9-inch yellow foam rockets--and watch out. Our 5-year-old assistant reviewer really got a kick out of jumping on the purple blast-off pad and watching her rockets soar 50 feet or more, though she had to fight the adults for a turn. If the three rockets included with the kit aren't enough fun, you can order stomp parachutes and spin copters from the manufacturer. --Marianne Painter\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nStomp on the all foam rocket to send it up to 100ft in the air\n\nSee more",
