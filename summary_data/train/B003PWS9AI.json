      "text": "My 5yo has started going to bed in his undies and has accidents every now and then. This protector blocks liquid completely and it's topped with terry material so whatever the sheets don't soak up, it catches so there are no issues with urine going over the sides of the mattress as it's repelled by the waterproof layer. I like it so much I plan on getting another set for my 5yo and 2 sets each for my 4 and 2yo to have on their beds (so there's an extra to put on while I'm washing the soiled one in case of accidents).",

Our old one had a funky plastic layer to it that would make us warm at night, and then for some mysterious reason, it started flaking off onto the mattress.

We haven't noticed a temperature difference and it stays on way better than the first. We have a tempurpedic king size mattress, this fits the corners perfectly, never comes off on its own, and doesn't lump up anywhere.",

The protector is not noisy like I saw in other brand reviews but it did take some of the comfort out because the mattress doesn't quite form to our bodies as it used to. I was happy with the seller communication after I ordered the product.",

It fit over our mattress nicely and doesn't cause any problems with a fitted sheet fitting on top of it. It feels like a very thin towel, but I can't feel it at all through the sheet. If it saves my mattress, it's well worth the money.",

As we sleep we shed thousands of dead skin cells, which can quickly accumulate providing an ideal environment for dust mites.

This helps provide a cleaner more allergen free sleep environment for you and your family.\n\nSoft Cotton Terry Surface - Breathable, Cool and Noiseless\nTo keep our protectors cool and noiseless, the surface material is made with soft cotton terry back coated with a breathable, hypoallergenic and 100% waterproof membrane layer. Cotton terry naturally absorbs moisture and is completely noiseless.\n\nFitted Sheet Style\nTo ensure a great fit, an elastic band is used on the side skirt to automatically pull excess material under the mattress.\n\nMachine Washable\nMachine-wash with your sheets using normal household detergents that do not contain bleach.
