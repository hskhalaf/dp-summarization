I bought him a half size larger (size 3/12) because they were for track and Under Armor sometimes runs small and they were still extremely small. We just got back from an Under Armor store and a 3 1/2 in another style fit perfectly with a size 4 being way too big. Therefore, I would say this sneaker runs much smaller than others and you may need to go up a full size or a size and a half.",
