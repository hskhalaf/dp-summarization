I drink a lot of tea, and I bought this for the purpose of organizing it. I wanted a tea organizer that took away the hassle of sorting through all of my different boxes. The only way to close this box is if you have the bags laying down, which defeats the purpose of buying this box unless you have exactly 8 different types of tea. If this box was just a tiny bit taller it would be perfect. I'm probably going to send it back. :(",

The pictures don\u2019t show the dirt and dust that came on it. I tried to clean it up and tighten screws, but it seemed like it was stripped. When you put the tea bags in the box, the cubes around the side won\u2019t allow you to close the top fully, as the top frame is a little wider than the base frame. When opening the lid, it just feels like it\u2019s going to break, it\u2019s flimsy. Hopefully this was just a fluke item, but I am going to return it.",

I'm guessing they would absorb the odor, and I'm worried about ingesting that same chemical! (A small label on the bottom of the tea box mentions Formaldehyde.)",

The way the lid fits, if you the edges of the tea packages are right up against the outter edges (they are slightly taller than the box) the lid doesn't shut firmly.

I probably cant use this box since the measurements were listed wrong. I got it for a gift and I was going to cover it in floral paper to match a friend\u2019s lost heirloom however since it\u2019s a little longer than 12 inches the paper isn\u2019t long enough. I purposefully was looking for something to fit the paper. If it weren\u2019t for that I\u2019d probably get this damaged one replaced \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "text": "It is a really nice box and i do reccomend it. However, be careful if you live in a house with no air conditioning as when i moved to my new home with no air conditioning. When it got hot & humid it caused my box to mold over. Particularly where i had the type of tea bags without paper or foil wrappers. So just be careful as to how you use it and you will be fine. Unfortunately i had to get rid of mine as it molded through too much. But most likely i will ordering a replacement now that we have a.c. and my home is more temperature regulated. So great product but just a heads up.",

Not the highest quality, but perfectly acceptable for storage given the price point.",
