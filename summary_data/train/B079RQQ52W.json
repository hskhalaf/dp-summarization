      "verdict": "Ariat designed the Terrain Waterproof to stand up to most types of outdoor conditions. Its comfort, lightness and sufficient ankle support were testaments to its well-deserved applause. Add to that is its efficient waterproofing and commendable fit and sizing. However, concerns were raised when owners experienced durability issues. Taking everything into account, the Ariat Terrain Waterproof seems to be a good choice of a mid-cut day hiking boot for tamed trails. Using it on harsh, rugged terrain might render it damaged.",
      "pros": [
        "A huge percentage of those who bought the shoe testified to its virtually no breaking in period",
        "It was very comfortable, according to numerous wearers",
        "Scores of owners mentioned that it runs true to size",
        "The Ariat Terrain Waterproof offered great ankle support, based on plenty of user reviews",
        "A handful of outdoor lovers lauded its versatility",
        "The lightness of the Terrain Waterproof from Ariat received approval from the majority",
        "Most online purchasers testified to the efficient waterproofing of this day hiking boot",
        "An expert reviewer and a couple of hikers loved the accommodating fit of the Terrain Waterproof"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A considerable number of users were crestfallen when the outsole and the toe guard separated from the rest of the boot too soon",
        "A few noted that the Terrain Waterproof should have more aggressive lugs to be suitable for hiking"

I don't know why it took me so long to try the men's version in 9EE (they don't make Women's Terrains in wide widths in size 10-11). I finally tried them, and I am once again a \"happy camper\" Note to Ariat: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE...make more wide width options in Women's sizes 10-11!!",

Has worn only these for past few years and swears by them for comfort and good support. Granted, they don't last as long as work boot and he is really hard on his shoes/boots, but ,for him, they last a year or 2. He is a very active person and he loves this shoe. Highly recommend it. They fit true to size.",

So I ordered them in a men's 10D width. They're perfect!!! They're darker in reality. Like the copper color from Ariat. These are so supportive and comfortable! I was in a job that had me running on my feet on concrete for the better part of 30 years. As a result, my feet are pretty much trashed. With fall and winter approaching, I wanted water proofed footwear. Thanks Ariat!",

My wife purchased a pair of these Ariets and man are they sharp looking. I'm an 8.5 and they fit perfectly. Just finished spraying with Kiwi Boot Protector. 24 hrs drying time and water beads off. Been wearing every day to break in and the 1st couple hours feels like I been wearing for months. Great boots guys! Highly recommended.",
