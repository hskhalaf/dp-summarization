The sound quality is excellent. Strong bass, very clear mediums and bright trebles. You can connect to a protable device like celphone and get high volume and strong sound because the sensibility are high and the impedance are low, only 16 ohms. The earmuffs are very comfortable and fit excellently. It has a very good isolation from outside noise. These Headphones are definitely PREMIUM!",

I wanted something that would sound good with rock music and I found that headsets like beats are bass driven and distorts rock music. So for half the price this set delivers amazing sound quality, and yes there are better headsets that will cost way more but for the price these are better then I expected. The only negative is that when running you hear a thumping, so when I run I switch to to Koss 75 over ear headset.",

CONS: Not sure why the 3.5mm input is hanging off the headphone...I fear that it might get caught on something and rip off. The cable that it comes with is threaded and shielded, but doesn't unwind very well.",
