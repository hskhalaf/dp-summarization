I have ordered these two times and both times I couldn't have been happier. One of the things I picked in culinary school is how important hand towel is to everyone and I have brought this loving home with me I have to have plenty in my home kitchen. I hate slick weak towels. These are the best I have purchased at a reasonable price.",

I have used all sorts of towels for all sorts of cleaning and these so far are at the top of my list for quality at their price. I will try and remember to post and update in several months to see how they perform over time. So far they absorb more than competitor's towl at the same price point. I also think these are thicker than some others at this price point.",

The only issue I had with them is when I first washed them, the black towels seemed to tinge the white towels slightly - so you may want to wash them separately from everything else.",
