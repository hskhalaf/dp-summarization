      "verdict": "Because of its rich and long history, it seems that the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star has already exhausted all its potential. The leather upper of the shoe provides a style and feature upgrade making the sneaker tougher but more luxurious. The low-top profile is not only favored by many, but its familiar silhouette also creates a feeling of nostalgia for Converse fans.",
      "pros": [
        "Several of the online reviewers note that these suit different age ranges",
        "A couple of the commenters were surprised that despite the leather upper, it is lightweight",
        "A high number of testers like the style of the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Leather Low Top",
        "It is a traditional sneaker with a bit of edge",
        "The leather, according to many, is nice, soft, and high quality, and gives a nice touch of panache on an outfit because of its sleek and sharp look",
        "One user even used this for his wedding",
        "The purchase is worth every penny, according to some of the buyers",
        "Many of the shoppers note that, like most of the Converse sneakers, it is versatile and adds a bit of spunk to almost any article of clothing\u2014jeans, shorts, and trousers",
        "Compared to regular Chuck Taylors, these feel more comfortable",
        "A few of the commenters are impressed with the thick insole as it makes the sneaker more comfortable",
        "The leather upper is easy to maintain and clean as mentioned by a handful of consumers",
        "The Chuck Taylor Leather Low Top can accommodate orthotics without making the feet look big, according to one tester",
        "One user noted that although they are flat, the rubber sole allows the feet to bend correctly with every step, similar to walking barefoot",
        "Despite a lifestyle sneaker, one who used this for weight training commended the shoe"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A high number of users feel disappointed that the sidewalls fall apart after a few months of use",
        "A couple agreed that the shoes are not as sturdy despite looking durable",
        "For those looking for supportive shoes, these are not recommended",
        "One user wishes that the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Leather Low Top has a color selection that is as wide as the canvas ones"
