Now I'm back at my own place only to find that my own much more expensive food processor works less well then this one, I came to regret it (actually I think I'll buy a new one and will kick the fancy one to the curb).",

Also four of the six rubber suction feet fell off immediately -- they were attached with tiny screws that only tapped 1mm into the bottom of the blender. The power switch felt gimpy and not solidly attached. And the cutting blade trapped a large amount of food inside it, more than I have seen with other food processors, making this food processor need more cleaning than most.",

      "text": "This shreds cheese amazingly well!!!!! When you get to the bottom of the cheese block, use the pulse option to get the rest of the cheese that gets a little stuck. 4 stars because the shoot is a little big for some single items like carrots, but it still works good. The slicing option is a very fine, thin slice. Not great for finger food, perfect for salad toppings though. This is easy to use, easy to clean, easy to move. It is super super fast. I look forward to many meal preps. :)",

I finally decided to settle for a moderately priced one because a cheap processor was better than none and i was tired of grating by hand and skipping over recipes that called for using a processor. This has been an AWESOME buy for the money and I'm almost embarrassed at how excited I am about a kitchen appliance. I've used it multiple times already for chopping spinach, cauliflower, blending frozen fruit for popsicles, grating cucumbers, etc. and it has been great every time.",

The food processor is loud, but not exceptionally so. It's no worse than a typical blender. The blade is sharp but not razor-sharp. This is probably a good thing, since some of the reviews for the Ninja food processor mention people ending up in the emergency room while trying to disassemble or clean that food processor.",

      "text": "Not worth the money! After 1 year - total failure. Within a month of normal use the suction cup feet started breaking off. Within 6 months they were all broken off, but that did not really effect performance. Shortly after that, the little clip attached to the bowl that is required to make the unit run (safety feature) broke off. I ended up jamming the clip and tapping it in place. It did function as a low end food processor, but safe yourself from having to buy another one within a year and go with better. Ninja is so much nicer!",
