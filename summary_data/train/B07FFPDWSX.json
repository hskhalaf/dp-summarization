It's *very* warm for its size and price, and I ended up moving it back a bit to get the right balance. Touch controls are nice. Our company safety department requires personal heaters have a tip-over shutoff feature, and this one passes no problem - tested it a few times and it's pretty sensitive to any tipping. The only thing I wish it had was adjustable temperature or fan speed settings. If it's too hot or cold for you, you just have to move it closer or farther.",
