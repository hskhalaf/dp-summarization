With the way it looks and similar items I've seen in the past, I expected some loose rivets and such, but this had none. This is a really nice case and I feel the value of it is far more than what I paid. Also, my surface pro 4 fits beautifully in here.",

      "text": "I had been using the same Targus laptop case since 2000, it was a soft-sided case that held up well for 4 laptops. I decided to retire it and order a hard-sided case for more protection from bumps in the rugged break room and coffee shop scene. I looked at zero-haliburton, but I just couldn't do the price. So I pulled the trigger on this one and it seems pretty sturdy, so cheers to 17+ years with this poor man's halibuton case :)",

I have it sitting open on a desk right now in hopes that it will air out before I need it. Alpine Swiss, AIR YOUR BRIEFCASES OUT before you send them to customers! Or air out the raw materials you use. Or something. Because making your customers wonder if they are inhaling poisonous fumes is bad business. Otherwise, the briefcase appears perfectly fine and as expected.",

I need to replace the handle, repair it somehow, or get a new briefcase. Bad design and bad manufacturing.",
