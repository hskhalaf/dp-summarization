Husband and I (220 + 120lbs respectively) have both tested it out too and we're surprised how effective such a small device can be. Love its affordability, compact size and that it easily tucks away beside the couch. Great product!",

Was disappointed that there were no specific instructions for this, as the box and enclosed workout ideas all say to \"inflate to specific standards\" I was expecting to have to inflate per weight or height...I guess not. I hope it can hold me.",
