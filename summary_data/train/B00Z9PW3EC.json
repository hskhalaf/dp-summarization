Definitely recommend!",

The five-lug forefoot is much more stable on turns than the old four-lug design of a couple of versions ago. These shoes last much longer than a standard pair of running shoes because the cushioning is not based on compression of a foam. That said, this is not the best shoe for runners just getting into a mid foot/forefoot strike unless you take that transition very slowly. Newton has other \"transition\" models you should look at. But for those already on board with the Newton philosophy, this is a good update.",
