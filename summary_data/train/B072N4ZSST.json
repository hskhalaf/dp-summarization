Given my recent experience with husqvarna warrantee support on another saw, I predict that they will come up with some bogus excuse to not cover it and I'll be out 300 buck here and 700 on my other husqvarna saw.",

I've heard that Honda's start every time. Husqvarna's don't start at all after the first use. What a nightmare. When you need a chainsaw for fallen trees and yours doesn't work. Indefensible.",

I adjusted the idler and the (L) (H) and I seem to have a proper idle and nicevtrigger response hitting my rpm. Not a big deal, but I was truly upset when all this was supposed to be done per the manual reading. Other than that, great chainsaw for the DIYer.",
