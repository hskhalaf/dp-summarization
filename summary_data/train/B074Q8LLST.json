      "verdict": "Emerica Reynolds G6s are Andrew\u2019s signature shoes that are just as badass as the 1998 SOTY winner himself. These kicks are definitely built for extreme skating because of their ultra-durable build that can withstand hours of daily abuse with nary a tear in sight.The cushioning and impact protection in these is also quite high, and with the cupsole construction, bruises on arches and heels are a thing of the past. The soles are the perfect combination of board feel and rigidity, and with these on, you\u2019ll never hurt your feet on gaps again.",
      "pros": [
        "A lot of Emerica Reynolds G6 shoe reviews mentioned nothing but praises for the kicks\u2019 durability especially when it comes to the three-piece toe layers",
        "Many commended the sneakers\u2019 high impact protection, which makes jumping down stairs and other high places painless",
        "Several skateboarders who wear-tested Emerica Reynolds G6 shoes claimed the support in these is amazing",
        "These are the perfect skate shoes, according to a good number of users who say these give a nice solid edge for grip and flick",
        "These sneakers from Emerica\u2019s skate lineup provide enough cushioning where you need it and are extremely comfy, plenty stated",
        "The shoes\u2019 board feel is excellent and is not sacrificed for padding or comfort",
        "A few noted that the fit is exemplary"

That might just be because of my wide toes. Other than that, super comfortable as expected from Emerica and Reynolds.",
