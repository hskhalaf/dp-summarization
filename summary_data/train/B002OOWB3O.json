It's only just starting to have glitchy problems (not holding drag'n'drops even after alcohol cleaning of all the workings). I'm a heavy user - 10-12 hours x 5-6 days a week of lots of word processing, spreadsheets, accounting, etc. - so I'm quite happy that I haven't had to replace it before now. It has survived my wear and tear and the odd (light) coffee spill. I added a pillow to support my wrist in a more ergonomic way, but otherwise nicely designed.",

My one critique is the button positions are a little farther away than I prefer given how little I have to move to access the trackball and the ring scroller. It is early so I am still getting used to the trackball, but everything else has been easy and intuitive.",

After using it for few months I noticed that my pointing finger gets stiff after all day use. Sometimes to a point that it hurts when I try to stretch it out. I also noticed that after months of use. Left side button seems to not respond to presses, unless I hit it harder. Not sure if the button mechanism wears out after constant use. At some point I'm probably going to go back to regular mouse as I'm worried that finger stiffness might become permanent.",

It tracks accurately to screen position, the buttons and scroll wheel are pretty sturdy, and monthly cleaning doesn't reveal it's collecting a lot of dust and grime. One thing to remember with trackballs, you need to clean them every month with a dry squeegee swab or cotton swab for best performance and increase its lifespan. If there's more pervasive gunk, dampen the swab with glass cleaner to get the crud off.",

It makes quick scrolling SUPER fast and efficient in websites, spreadsheets, Word docs, etc. I do prefer a thumb trackball over this finger trackball, but after getting used to the change, it's not a problem. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the right-click is the challenge to master. But again, the scroll ring more than makes up for the right click deficit. If Kensington can make a thumb trackball w/ scroll ring, then the left/right clicks will be super intuitive for the fingers, and this would make the PERFECT mouse!",

All in all though - I'm extremely pleased with this. Excellent if you have wrist pain.",
