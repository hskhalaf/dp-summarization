I really like that they are light on foot but unfortunately design made for only certain type feet.",

I'm really upset that they didn't fit because everywhere I read it said they were \"TRUE TO SIZE\" but they arent. The material is very foamy and the straps are not stretchy they are pretty stiff, and are held on by velcro which I dont mind. But they should have AT LEAST used a stretchy band. Or given more strap in the back to adjust.",
