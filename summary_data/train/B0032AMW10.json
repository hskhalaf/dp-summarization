It does seem to be a little small around the crown, but I like that it will sit a little high but still tight. LOVE the wide brim, I\u2019ll probably get this in black at some point as well.",

This hole is the kind that would quickly enlarge. The hat is well-designed and the style is pretty and chic, but the fabrication seems flimsy. Given it was immediately noticeable to me, I don\u2019t know how quality control overlooked it? Despite very much liking the style, I think I\u2019ll start looking again for a similar hat. I finalized my order after reading generally positive reviews so, hopefully, this is a one-off in terms of poor quality.",

Once out of the box, smoothing the rim (which has a malleable wire) takes some time and even then, the woven fabric of the hat retains wrinkles. I expect I will be able to cover the areas with a cotton cloth/handkerchief and carefully iron out the wrinkles with a low heat iron. Since the hat is not made of a natural straw or raffia, it may melt at high temperatures. So beware if you attempt this. If I can make it smooth, it will be an elegant, very useful hat.",

At one point it blew off my head and into the ocean, and my wonderful boyfriend jumped in to retrieve it. It also packs very well in a carry on bag, just make sure to stuff socks or clothes in the \"head part\" so it doesn't get crushed.",

And I ended up loving it, diva-sized brim and all. I even abused it during packing in my suitcase and it pops right back into shape no problems. Great purchase.",

It's not overly heavy and the brim can be bent to shape it as you like-- the quality is excellent. It shields my entire face and most of my shoulders/chest. My only concern is whether or not this baby can be packed flat (read: squished) and still come out of the suitcase looking good.",
