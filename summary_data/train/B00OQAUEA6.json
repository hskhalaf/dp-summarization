Cosmetology student tip: a little goes a long way with this type of formula. Start using a thin coating at first and then apply more to your liking. Works best applied with a sponge tip brush and patted in with your fingers. Eyeshadow primers last longer when set with a little bit of powder. It gives the eyeshadows more to stick to.",

It makes a nice base for the more vibrant colored lipsticks and they show up more true than just putting it on over your lips. I wish it lasted a little longer but it still helped my lipstick last much longer than usual",

I've never used it on my lips, so I cannot speak to that. I always use a brush with this 1.for sanitation reasons and 2.because the pot is quite small. There's a lot of product though. A little bit goes a very long way.",

It didn't work well with Shany brand eyeshadows, but they don't have very good pigmentation to begin with. With my other shadows though, it helps the shadow last all day without creasing and pumps up the real color and helps the shadow stick better.",

It is so thick and stiff that the eyeliner doesn't want to move across your lid and just breaks. Not the worst primer I've used, but certainly not the best either.",
