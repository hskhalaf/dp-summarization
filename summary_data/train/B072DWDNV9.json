We also needed something secure enough to hold in the cash. These boxes are very sturdy, many different compartments for bills and coins. It holds the money in nicely and doesn't get messy when you carry it around. They also come with 2 sets of keys which is great in case you misplace one, you have the other on hand. I definitely recommend them!",

Even with a broken hinge the cash box was functional for the booth - it held the bills and the few coins we received, but some coins spilled out in transit. The replacement box is even better, since the coin tray lid holds everything in place.",
