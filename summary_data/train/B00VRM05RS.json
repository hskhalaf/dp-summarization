      "text": "I have a 1958 Franklin Travel Trailer that is 13 feet long. I originally bought the 16ft cover and it didn't work because my camper is shaped differently from the R-Pod. I then tried the 20ft cover and it works perfectly (see pics). Great protection and I love that I can still open the door and get in without having to uncover anything. If you have a canned ham or toaster (classic camper shapes) make sure you buy this cover a few feet longer than you need it. Cheers!",

In less than a week, a brand new cover arrived at my door. No hassle, \"service\" or shipping fees and quick response. These folks really stand by their 3 year warranty.

Every corner had a hole and the corners are not sharp. Where the door handle sticks out a bit, the cover had a hole. Whatever protrusion it rested on, resulted in a hole. Again, this happened after only 2 months! It's 8mos later now and the holes are huge due to wind. The material is inferior. and they must know it because I have read reviews with the same complaint as mine. Spend a little more money and get one that will last.",

The advantage to the light weight fabric is, that it makes it easier to get up and over the trailer. It takes 2 people to put on, one of which who is on a step ladder. It fits just like expected. There is a zippered area over the door, and zippers over the storage area, so you can get into the camper after you winterize it. Over all this is a good cover and we'll see how it does in a Minnesota winter.",
