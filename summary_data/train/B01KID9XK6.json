I went ahead and purchased a second for my mother & children (to make them each their own oil). My mother has fibromyalgia and I started reading about magnesium deficiencies being reported frequently with her diagnosis. That being said, she is non-compliant and really doesn\u2019t use the oil-but, my father uses it for his neuropathy and loves it! He says it works better than Tylenol and on contact! When you purchase this particular product, the company that sells it offers OUTSTANDING customer service. I highly recommend them and their product.",

I dont know why but that next morning ( I took a bath at night) I felt much better! And I have taken baths before when I am sick. It was nothing like this. ALso right away my muscles felt more relaxed. I use it every time I start to feel a little sick now. The only thing is it works better if the bath is only warm like a babys bath. Normally I cannot do that, but if you have hot chills or fever, then it will be good.",

Let it cool and pour into the bottle of your choice for easy dispensing. :) I use this before I sleep to supplement magnesium transdermally. You can also add it to the bath, but I wanted a more potent and longer-lasting mixture. No noticeable results so far, but I'll keep it up and report back here if there's any change.",

It really does help with the aches that I have in my legs, and I'm so happy I gave this product a chance.
