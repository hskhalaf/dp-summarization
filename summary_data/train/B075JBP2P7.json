      "text": "These have awesome sound, and the case makes the battery life quite long. However, make sure you get the right fit. I have these for a couple weeks, and they kept falling out. So I switched to the smallest ear tips, and they kept in my ear. Then, I noticed they would still wiggle out just enough to muffle the sound. So I then switched from the standard rubber skin to the smallest ear wing skin. After these 2 changes, these now sound and fit perfect. Nice and snug, great sound and base, and they create a great seal, so I hardly hear anything else around me (which is what I want).",

Found out one of my ears is totally shaped differently than the other - once I figure that out and changed the ear bud sizes for that one ear, they are super sturdy.",

Everything seemed fine at first, but call quality quickly dropped after a month of casual use. Now when I make calls using the earphone, the other person can hardly hear me. For just listening to music, these were ok. Even after trying the different sized earbud things, they do become loose in my ear pretty frequently. Additionally, pairing it so I could use both earbuds at the same time for audio was very difficult (and I'm pretty tech savvy) and it still sometimes doesn't work. Overall they're OK, but disappointing.",

Update 8.9.18 - Lost two stars due to right earbud randomly losing its volume over a week ago. Even at max volume, you hear some little as it has become very quiet. Original Review Positives: Good fit and stays in the ear, connects easily, good battery life both on the earbuds and the case, simple controls. Negatives: There is a low constant buzzing in the background (music hides it, but really noticeable during podcasts).",
