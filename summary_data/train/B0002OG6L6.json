The only drawback is that when you purchase the battery pack and bluetooth adapter, both being optional, the cost is pretty high (around $400), which is about what my i9900 cost new two years ago. However, I am glad I purchased it because it fits exactly what I bought it for.",

It does a fairly good job in color photograph printing but the colors don't match the screen as well as my non-portable color printer, the Canon i950. The ink cartridges are quite small so any significant amount of printing means the expense and inconvenience of buying and carrying extra cartridges. Setup was easy and with no glitches. There really was no other portable printer options worth considering so I am fairly pleased. It does a decent job in \"monochrome\" for printing black and white text such as emails and Word documents.",

Secondly, the ink cartridges, which need to be small, really don't last that long so it would be a good idea to have a couple of spares.",

This saves tons of $$$ and so far seems to work fine. I'd buy this printer again!",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer Rugged, powerful and portable, the Canon PIXMA iP90 Photo Printer delivers exceptional performance at home or on the road. This compact printer can produce up to 16 ppm in black and up to 12 ppm in color, while achieving a resolution of up to 4,800 x 1,200 color dpi. Canon full-photolithography inkjet nozzle engineering uses a high-performance 1,088-nozzle print head that ejects precise and consistent droplets as small as two picoliters with remarkable accuracy. Your results: impressive resolution and dramatic detail on graphics and photos, wherever you're printing from.\n\n \n\n\nThis printer can connect directly to select digital cameras. Learn more about PictBridge. In a hotel room or a home office, the iP90 printer goes practically anywhere, yielding superb output on all your projects. Reports and memos will look clean and professional with bold, crisp text. Using the included Canon Easy-WebPrint Windows software, Web pages are automatically formatted, so they'll print properly with full color and without trimming off the right-hand margin. You can also produce 4-by-6, 5-by-7 and 8.5-by-11-inch borderless prints, with stunning edge-to-edge quality and razor-sharp detail. In only about 51 seconds you can print a 4-by-6-inch photo with the look and feel of a traditional photograph. And for convenience, you can connect any PictBridge compatible digital camera or DV camcorder directly to the iP90 printer and print photos--no PC required! Easy-PhotoPrint v3.0\nWhile most photo-editing software applications will brighten the entire image, Easy-PhotoPrint 3.0 accurately detects the subject's face and adjusts the skin to the optimum tone. Brighten dark faces caused by bright backgrounds. Choose from one-click automatic to correct the entire image all at once, or manual to correct just a selected area. \n\n \n\nBefore\nAfter\n Easy-PhotoPrint 3.0 also lets you select and print any image on your PC, perfectly trim images, correct images using lab-quality retouching features, correct red-eye, smooth facial lines and skin tone, sharpen faces, remove blemishes, and print in a variety of sizes and layouts. \n\n Photo Optimizer PRO\nPhoto Optimizer PRO does not simply adjust image data; it also makes adjustments in the printer driver. It assesses color balance, vividness, and brightness based on a histogram analysis of image data (raw image), and then makes ideal adjustments within the three-dimensional color space of the entire image, also making optimum use of the image's characteristics. Photo Optimizer PRO utilizes the functions of Bubble Jet printers to reproduce clear colors. Making multi-adjustments to a variety of images requires finetuning, because processes that are suitable for certain adjustments may be detrimental to other adjustments. \n\n \n\n \n\nAlso, each image requires a different balance of adjustments. For these reasons, Canon has spent many years accumulating enormous volumes of data on what it found are the colors considered by most people to be the most beautiful. Based on these data, Canon has undertaken analyses of a huge number of images and devised an algorithm that allows well-balanced adjustments to be made for every single image pattern, even those with complex compositions and hues.  Canon Smart Ink Features\nIf you're on-the-go and low on ink the iP90 printer's \"Ink Usage Control\" setting enables you to produce approximately 1.5 times more pages without lowering print quality. Plus, if you run out of black ink, just choose the \"Use Composite Black\" option and the iP90 printer continues to print black using a composite of color inks in the \"Ink Usage Control\" setting. These features are a convenient safety net when you don't have extra ink on hand.\n\n Versatile, Wireless Printing\nThe iP90 printer offers both IrDA compatibility and an optional Bluetooth interface enabling you to print wirelessly from a PC, PDA or mobile phone. For maximum portability, an optional Canon car adapter and rechargeable battery kit provide power on the go.\n\n What's in the Box\nCanon iP90 photo printer, iP90 printhead, BCI-15 black ink tank, BCI-16 color ink tank, power cord, universal AC adapter, setup software and user's guide CD-ROM, documentation kit; USB cable not included",
