Screws fit well into screw holes and the only real problem I had with it was the way the drawer guide goes together.

It's been several months now and it has held up very well to chopping (with a cutting board) and other cooking operations on top of it. We use it to store pots and pans and the shelves have not buckled under the weight. As far as I can tell, this is made out of 100% wood which was a draw for us since particle board furniture doesn't typically last very long.",

Fortunately it was an easy fix and the drawer now slides in and out without any unnecessary resistance. I'm usually horrible at self-assembly, but I didn't have any issues outside the mislabeled parts. So if you think you can't do this yourself, you probably can.",

But everything fit together perfectly, there were no imperfections and I am in love with this product. After searching for days from site to site for the perfect medium sized island, I really got my bang for my buck. I intend to put wheels on it eventually but it\u2019s light weight enough I can move it on my own. Over all 10/10!!",

      "text": "i tried wayfiar and ikea but this was the best hard top island for the price. I love that you can see it in your kitchen before you buy with augmented reality. I took off a star because it is a little wobbly. Leaning it against a wall and putting the microwave on top helped. Also the drawer was sticking every time I opened so i had to add a little spray grease and work it in well. Some of the paint came off of the slides in the area where it was stiff but that helped it slide a little better.",

I have it at the end of my counter for extra countertop space. It sits about 1/4 inch higher than my countertops. I may grind down the table legs at the bottom if I feel this is an issue. Not top quality, but fine for an apartment or casual space.",

The screws that hold the frame together are drilled into wood, not a nut-and-bolt construction, so there will conceivably be some long-term stability issues. But, for the moment, all is good.",

I chose this one cause it fits good in my small kitchen and goes well with island that I bought from same seller (and which is great). Also one of the chairs had small scratch, but that's not an issue that compromise quality like the table top problem.",
