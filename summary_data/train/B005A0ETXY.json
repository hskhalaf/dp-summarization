But the coiled cord to the sensor is a little short. And they way the dome cover works, you find yourself trying to hold something like a squirming animal trying to take readings. Would be better if the dome cover snapped off instead of a little chain holding it on. Even a flip over design would be better. It does work, is more accurate than an app on your phone. But a little more design care would go a LONG way.",

Good news is the other 2 LED lights I bought came in at 92% of advertised, and the other was 112% of advertised. Bottom line..... meter did what I needed, it is very well built, easy to operate and comes with a hard carrying case. Great product.... great value!",

The product is easy to use. But, I don't have any idea how accurate it is. Light levels fluctuate on a log scale so the readings vary tremendously. Most informative is the fact that you can see quite well below one lumen. I put it in a closet to get below one lumen. And I went outside and pointed it at the Sun for a billion lumens. Very wide operating range.",

Using this meter I measured the LUX at the counter level and saw that reading under the supposedly equivalent LED was as much as 400 LUX less than the halogen.

      "text": "My son needed a light meter for his science project. Because of the good reviews and low price, I picked this one. I have no experience with light meters, but this one was easy to understand and gave consistent readings. this is embarrassing to admit, but figuring out where the battery goes was the only problem. I thought I was going to break it when I finally pulled the orange covering off, but there it was :) The battery was still in the clear packaging, so that has to be removed and the battery connected. then we were in business!",
