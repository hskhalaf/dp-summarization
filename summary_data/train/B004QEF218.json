If you look, the thing is still buckled shut. My cat weighs 8lbs, he's not exactly a bodybuilder. I can only imagine that it got caught when he jumped or something. The whole point of a breakaway collar is so that it unbuckles in case the cat gets stuck. It failed to unbuckle, but I guess I'm happy that it's flimsy enough to break anyway?",

The collar didn't come off easily and I'm truly worried what would have happened if I wasn't home or if I was asleep when this occurred. Please test the collar out and make sure it easily comes off before putting it on your pet.",

It's important that we have a bell of some sort as the poor dear is still very skittish from being on the streets for months her first four-six moths of her life. She's gotten much better, but still often runs and hides when she hears a new voice in the house or something spooks her (as often happens with cats), the slight jingle of the bell helps us locate her to comfort her.
