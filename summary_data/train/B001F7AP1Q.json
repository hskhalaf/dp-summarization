It feels great in the hand, as long as you buy the correct handedness because they are ergonomic. The battery lasts a long, it charges quickly, and the charging pad is small but effective. I like the blue light on it, but it's not overdone because it only illuminates when you pull it out of sleep mode. I wish there was a button to change the scroll wheel between smooth and \"clicky\" but the extra buttons by the side are easy to map, and nice to have.",

I thought for sure because the batteries got warm/hot that they were getting current. so my original thought was that the battery that came with the mouse was old and lostthe ability to hold a charge. so I bought a 4 pack of NIMH rechargeables. they got warm but wouldn't hold a charge either.",

The BlueTrack technology works just like it's supposed to. You can use this mouse on any surface except clear glass and it functions perfectly. The addition of the extra two side buttons is great for any sort of photo or video editing, and is a nice feature for gamers who don't want to invest $100 in a mouse. The only downside is the scroll wheel. It doesn't click as you scroll, which makes over scrolling a hassle when you're getting used to the mouse, but you get used to it with regular use.",

Add to that the ridiculously LOUD clicking when activating the front buttons and I'm not impressed. The old Intellimouse Explorer 2.0 it replaced was much more comfortable, precise and quieter in use. Pretty sad when they can't improve on a design from 7 years ago.",

I did have older Microsoft IntelliPoint mouse drivers on my machine, so that may have aided in the ease of my installation. The main point is that this mouse does work with Windows 7.

      "text": "I have bought a number of wireless keyboards and mice over the years and have always found the mice to not work consistently and this mouse is no exception. Most of the time it works fine but every now and then I have to re-seat the battery to initiate the connection between the mouse and the wireless receiver. The battery seems to wear down a little fast and I have to keep a wired mouse in my drawer which I have had to use a couple of times. The scroll wheel is smooth when it is rolled and doesn't click with each small scroll which is not typical of most mice and which I am having trouble getting used to.",

      "text": "I bought this mouse a few months ago and have been using it ever since with my laptop. I absolutely love it. Yes, the mouse is bigger than some, but the design actually fits my hand perfectly, with optimal resting positions for 3 fingers and your thumb. And the BlueTrack technology is amazing. I literally used it all over my house, on everything I could try, and it worked everywhere. Walls, carpet, ceiling, my pants leg, you name it. Overall I am extremely satisfied with the product as a whole, and my onyl wish is that Microsoft would update their drivers so scrolling in iTunes wouldn't be an issue anymore!

I restarted my computer several times and tried to reinstall the drivers. Nothing worked. I went to try the USB transmitter in a different jack and literally burned my fingers. I'm really disappointed - this was a great mouse (until it wasn't).",
