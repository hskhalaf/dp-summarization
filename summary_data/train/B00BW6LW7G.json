I recommend reading the book with camera in hand and going through the various choices and learning how to properly select them. Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR.

The T5i will continue to record, it will just however break the video up into 4gig parts. This one is also touch screen and the feel of the camera is a little different but pretty much has the same body as it predecessor.",

      "text": "I bought this camera as a gift for my daughter and she was thrilled. It replaced an older Canon that she has used for years. I know the description states that this camera is body only, but not knowing much about cameras, I did not understand that it did not have a lens at all. I thought all cameras came with a basic lens and that this one just didn't have any additional lenses. So if you are as unfamiliar with SLR cameras as I am, you will want to order a lens, if you do not already have one, so that you can take pictures.",

Capable of shooting in a number of recording sizes and frame rates, the EOS Rebel T5i is the new standard for performance, quality and simplicity. The EOS Rebel T5i enables easy manual control of exposure, focus and Live View features, even in-camera editing! Movie Servo AF allows continuous autofocus tracking of moving subjects while recording video. When shooting video with one of Canon's STM lenses, such as the new EF-S 18\u201355mm f/3.5\u20135.6 IS STM, Movie Servo AF takes advantage of the lens' stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous AF. With an STM lens attached, the EOS Rebel T5i is the standard for SLR moviemaking performance!\n\n \n\nResolution & Recording Sizes Frame Rates Full HD\n1920 x 1080\n16:9 format 30 fps (29.97) 25 fps \u2013 PAL standard 24 fps (23.976) HD\n1280 x 720\n16:9 format 60 fps (59.94) 50 fps \u2013 PAL standard Standard Definition (SD)\n640 x 480 30 fps (29.97) 25 fps \u2013 PAL standard \n\nBUILT-IN STEREO MICROPHONE, MANUAL AUDIO LEVEL ADJUSTMENT\nThe EOS Rebel T5i has an internal stereo microphone for improved audio capture and a wind filter feature to reduce wind noise when shooting outdoors. Sound recording levels can be manually (up to 64 different levels) or automatically controlled. A built-in attenuator is also provided to reduce audio clipping. For more advanced audio recording, the EOS Rebel T5i is compatible with many third-party electret condenser microphones with a 3.5mm diameter plug.\n\nVIDEO SNAPSHOT\nWith the Video Snapshot feature, the EOS Rebel T5i can capture short video clips (of 2, 4 or 8 seconds) then combine them automatically into one video file as a snapshot or highlights \"album\". With no editing needed after shooting, the compiled video is perfect for sharing online or displaying directly on an HDTV via the camera's HDMI port. Additionally, stills can be recorded during video shooting simply by pressing the camera's shutter button. During playback, video clips in an album can be reordered or deleted.\n\nSHARP AND CLEAR, WITH TACTILE CONTROLS.\nVARI-ANGLE TOUCH SCREEN 3.0-INCH CLEAR VIEW LCD MONITOR II WITH MULTI-TOUCH OPERATION AND TOUCH AF\nThe EOS Rebel T5i comes with a Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II. Using capacitive technology similar to today's popular mobile devices, this screen is touch-sensitive and delivers intuitive touch panel operation. Two-finger touch gestures can be used for zooming or changing images. Menu and quick control settings can be accessed, and focus point and shutter release can be activated with the touch of a fingertip using Touch AF. Displaying fine detail (at approximately 1.04 million dots), this screen is perfect for composing and reviewing images. Thanks to a solid construction between the monitor's resin-coated cover and the liquid crystal display, reflections are minimized, and the display can be viewed, without glare, from any number of angles. The LCD's surface is treated with a smudge-resistant coating to minimize fingerprints and maintain a bright, clear image display.\n\nCOMPLEX FUNCTIONS MADE SIMPLE.\nSCENE INTELLIGENT AUTO MODE\nThe EOS Rebel T5i features Scene Intelligent Auto mode, which incorporates a number of Canon technologies to deliver the best possible exposure. Joining Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure, Scene Intelligent Auto mode analyzes the image, accounting for faces, colors, brightness, moving objects, contrast, even whether the camera is handheld or on a tripod, and then chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any scene or situation.\n\nAMAZING EFFECTS FOR DRAMATIC AND GORGEOUS RESULTS.\nHANDHELD NIGHT SCENE MODE\nAccessible right on the EOS Rebel T5i's Mode Dial, Handheld Night Scene mode captures nightscapes with bright highlights and detailed dark areas, delivering results previously impossible without the use of a tripod.

By shooting three consecutive shots at different exposures (underexposed, correctly exposed and overexposed) and then combining the images, the final result maintains detail in both the shadow and highlight areas, ensuring the backlit subject is properly exposed.\n\nSEVEN CREATIVE FILTERS THAT CAN BE DISPLAYED IN REAL TIME\nTo add to the fun and creative possibilities available with the EOS Rebel T5i, the camera has seven different creative filters that can dramatically alter the mood and visual effect of any particular scene. Creative Filters include Grainy Black and White, Soft Focus, Fisheye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Miniature Effect, Art Bold Effect and Water Painting Effect. Each effect can be applied in three different levels (low, standard and strong), and easily previewed on the LCD panel in Live View. Since the filters can be applied to the image after shooting, it's easy to try several effects on the same shot during post-process.\n\nCLEANER IMAGES, EVEN AT HIGH ISO.\nMULTI SHOT NOISE REDUCTION\nTo enhance its already admirable high ISO shooting capabilities, the EOS Rebel T5i features an intelligent Multi Shot Noise Reduction tool that reduces noise even further than the camera's sensor and the DIGIC 5 Image Processor do. With Multi Shot Noise Reduction activated, the camera takes four consecutive shots, merges and aligns them. This eliminates more noise than the Rebel's traditional Noise Reduction filter, with little or no apparent resolution loss. Moving subjects are even optimized to minimize subject blur! Thanks to this clever feature, high ISO shooting has never looked better.\n\nFLEXIBLE AND RELIABLE RECORDING.\nCOMPATIBILITY WITH SD/SDHC/SDXC MEMORY CARDS, INCLUDING ULTRA HIGH SPEED CARDS\n\n\nThe EOS Rebel T5i uses popular SD, SDHC, SDXC, and is even compatible with Ultra High Speed (UHS-I), memory cards.

With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel T5i can display the Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.\n\n* Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer. In case of an issue with the Eye-Fi card, please consult with the card manufacturer. The use of Eye-Fi cards may not be available outside the United States and Canada; please contact the card manufacturer for territory availability.\n\nA COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF OPTICS PERFECT FOR VIDEO AND STILLS.\nCOMPATIBLE WITH EF AND EF-S LENSES\nThe EOS Rebel T5i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses and including the STM series optimized for video shooting. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer help to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light; STM lenses even feature a stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous autofocus while capturing video. With an array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T5i.\n\nMORE FEATURES FOR INCREASED VERSATILITY.\nLENS ABERRATION CORRECTION\nThe EOS Rebel T5i features lens correction tools that compensate for lens characteristics that can affect overall image quality. The EOS Rebel T5i's Peripheral Illumination Correction feature corrects light falloff in the corner of the image according to the characteristics of the lens being used. It even has correction data for a number of popular lenses stored in its memory. With the EOS Rebel T5i's chromatic aberration correction tool, distracting color fringing can be corrected at the time of shooting.\n\nFEATURE GUIDE\nTo help explain the specific function of features found on the EOS Rebel T5i, the Feature Guide displays a simple description helpful in determining the applicability for the situation at hand. It is displayed in each shooting mode, during mode dial operations, and for Quick Control screen functions. It appears automatically when a function is selected \u2013 a lifesaver when trying to determine the best mode or function for the next picture. The feature guide works automatically by default, and can be disabled easily through the camera's menu.\n\nGPS COMPATIBLE\nWith the optional GPS Receiver GP-E2 attached to the hot shoe or the digital terminal, the EOS Rebel T5i can record location, including latitude, longitude and altitude, and has the ability to track the trajectory of movement with its logging function. An electric compass records the camera's orientation during each shot, and world time information is recorded through GPS syncing.\n\nJPEG RESIZING\nTo create images suitable for sharing by email or online, the EOS Rebel T5i can resize JPEG files, in-camera, of varying pixels (aspect ratio cannot be changed, only the image size can be decreased) while leaving the original image untouched.\n\nPHOTOBOOK SET-UP\nPhotographers can share their images in book form with the EOS Rebel T5i's convenient Photobook Set-up feature. Users can easily choose specific images, images in a folder and even all images, then specify their sequence and layout. The results can be printed in book form with ease.\n\nIMAGE RATING\nTo help organize images recorded to the camera's storage, the EOS Rebel T5i makes it simple to rate individual images from one star to five. Therefore, image browsing, printing and slide shows can be based upon those ratings.\n\nSCENE MODE POSITION\nNewly featured on the EOS Rebel T5i, the SCN setting on the Mode dial activates a choice of scenes on the menu screen for quick access to features like Night Portrait, HDR Backlight Control, Handheld Night Scene and more.",
