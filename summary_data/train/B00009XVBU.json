No IS so handheld is near impossible for macro, and you really need to manual focus for macro as the autofocus just isn't accurate or hunts a bit too much. When you're in focus on a tripod though, the bokeh is \"unfreakinbelievable\"! (new word).",

The benefit of this Macro is you can be 1/2 a meter from the subject - which keeps you from frightening any critters you are photographing and gives distance between the lens and subject without shadowing. In addition the people I purchased this lens from were excellent and the condition of the lens was everything they said. I have been pleasantly surprise with the whole purchase experience.",

      "text": "I had the Canon 100mm F2.8, traded up to the F2.8L and returned as well then and got this 180mm instead. The 100mm on full frame still meant I had to be so close to the subject be it flowers which meant often I was casting a shadow, or I was scarying away a bug. It is super sharp, just the focusing is slow, however for macro I only use manual focus anyway. It is also amazing at close up portraits for eye lashes, sharp hair strands, dimples, bokeh is great too. Most of the time I am at F8 and more closed anyway so F3.5 is no loss due to DOF at this range.",

Macro lenses can uncover detail that would be impossible to detect by the eye and give new perspective to extremely minute subjects such as insects or the petals of a small flower, and this lens is no exception. The 180mm lens offers such features as three UD glass elements and an internal floating system, which combine to minimize aberrations caused by changes in the focusing distance; an advanced ultra-sonic monitor (USM) for high-speed, quiet autofocusing; full-time mechanical manual focusing; and a focusing distance range of 1.57 feet to infinity. Compatible with the EF Extender 1.4x and 2x, the lens carries a one-year warranty. \n\n \n\n * Focal length: 180mm \n * Maximum aperture: 1:3.5 \n * Lens construction: 14 elements in 12 groups \n * Diagonal angle of view: 13 degrees (at 30 feet) \n * Focus adjustment: Inner focusing system with USM \n * Closest focusing distance: 1.6 feet \n * Filter size: 72mm \n * Dimensions: 3.2 inches in diameter, 7.3 inches long \n * Weight: 2.4 pounds",
