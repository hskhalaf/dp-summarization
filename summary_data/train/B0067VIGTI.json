I hooked the loops on the hardware underneath the chair and that helps keep it tight. The back doesn't look as good because my chairs have a panel at the bottom that doesn't move, so the cover had to go under it. Its tight enough to stay in place. But the style is nice, the pocket and handle placement work fine. It looks just like the picture. I think it looks great for the price.If you want perfection, you'll have to spend $150 more. front & back photos",
