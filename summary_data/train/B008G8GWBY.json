I was advised to switch the leg pieces. This worked. The back piece fits perfect. So if you run into this problem, try flip flopping the legs. Beautiful chair! Recommend buying a cushion for it as well. Had this bench actually fit together and not have dents in it, it would have received 5 stars. The back piece is short by about two inches making it impossible to attach to the legs pieces. Very disappointing. And of course it's heavy and will be a pain to return. Ugh.",

In contrast, you don't even feel the shape of the letters on the backrest. It looks great!",

I think it will do well here in central Florida in terms of durability. It's fairly comfortable, boney butts will want a cushion. Light enough for an adult to relocate at will.
