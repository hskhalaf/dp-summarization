I would reccomend they find a better way to mount rims. Other than that everything went together well. It needs a little more reflective trim I think as it has no relectors on the rear. I just put two clip on relector/ flashers. Heavier than expected! Must weigh 28 punds, but not a nock as it is sturdy so for $100 you get a deal!",

The trailer pulls well, it\u2019s got a little weight to it but sterdy. I received a lot of compliments on it. The only con I have was the tires. I recommend buying some better tires. I just got some 20in x 1.75 BMX tires for it way better. I looked for weeks and decided on this one. Now let\u2019s see though how long it last. But again I do recommend this trailer.

Tip: thread the cover\u2019s corner through the metal latch on at least two sides; and use Velcro straps for the other two sides. That way if it lifts while riding it won\u2019t blow away. Oh, and it came with a bent pole but my husband was able to force it to work using brute strength. If I\u2019d had to do it myself I probably would have just returned it.",

Very easy to fix these little design flaws. For the price I guess I can't complain too much. I love it!",

When you make a left turn the spring is bent at more than a 90 degree angle. Also the part of the hitch that stays on the bike shifts with a heavy load and bends the spring further. I don't know how long the spring will last as I have only used it twice and the most weight I have pulled is about 20-30lbs. I only use this when I need to carry bulky item that will on fit in my panniers.",

Use a lock as a pin connecting to bike, added a rubber mat on floor for less movement of cargo instead of metal floor which is easy for things to slide. Cover is very nice, but seems to want blow off in windy days, use small bungie straps on each corner which solved problem. Very pleased with this purchase",

      "text": "I would almost give a 5 but one of the bolts was misformed and hard to work. The instructions were a joke for those of us tech challenged. Maybe a youtube video? Velcro does not seem sturdy and would of liked a reflector on the back (but i knew it didn't have one so i can not fault for that). I got this for my scooter so unfortuntaly it sits up too high. They said you could use it for a motorcycle i don't understand where it would attach. It looks as if items could slip out of the corners but i got some black duct tape for this problem. Also no bolt and nut to attach to the scooter/bike.",
