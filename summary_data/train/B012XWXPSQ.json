I followed the washing instructions on the tag and now it's about an inch shorter, an inch narrower, and the sleeves are almost 3 inches shorter than its original size - I'm afraid to wash it again.",

Now with just one wash its half an inch shorter on my arms and the shirt is too fitting for my liking. It also don't crumple easily. Used it for 4 days on a trekking trip in Durango and held well. Without any damage even after a rugged abuse. Summary: Buy your usual shirt size. Don't buy a size smaller.",

      "text": "I bought this flannel with high hopes, it\u2019s warm, looks great, has a nice loose fit, the collar is courdoroy or something and it looks like it\u2019ll actually keep its shape. My only gripe is the sleeves are very long for an XL. It\u2019s finally starting to get chilly here and went to put it on this morning and realized the cuffs at the bottom of the sleeves only have one button. All my other flannels have two so you can adjust the tightness, without this feature these long sleeves are going to constantly be in my way. I just emailed the company and will update you on what their customer service has to say.",

The second button falls far too low as well, so you can either button it all the way up and wear it like a dress shirt, or unbutton the top button and look like a member of the Bee Gees. There is no in between. It reminds me of the Gordon Gartrelle shirt Denise made Theo in that episode of the Cosby Show.",

Only wash in COLD water and line dry or AIR tumble in dryer. I purchased an X-Large shirt and washed in COLD water and tumbled dried in dryer \"AIR DRY NO HEAT\".

He lives in another state, so I have never actually saw wear it.",

The collar of this shirt measures 18 inches (from center of the collar button to the center of the collar button hole). The appearance when worn is ridiculous. I am returning it.",
