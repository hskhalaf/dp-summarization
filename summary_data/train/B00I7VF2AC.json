This boots are a little bit bigger, just a little bit. But I also have very skinny feet. You can wear warm socks with these boots and you\u2019ll be fine. They are snug, don\u2019t expect them to be as soft as your slippers or memory foam, they aren\u2019t. It\u2019s caterpillar so they hard, they solid, that\u2019s why they are combat boots. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been looking for. The price is awesome and the quality as well!",

They're comfortable and warm, I wear them every day and have gotten many compliments on them. I would order them again for sure, but as its panning out I probably won't need new boots for a long time. I did find that they were a little larger than expected, but I returned the first order and got the next size down to me within days with a very speedy refund. Couldn't be happier.",

Wearing them out of the box for a week straight out of the box isn\u2019t the best idea. For some reason the right boot dug into my ankle when I was breaking them in, but that seems to have improved. The arch support isn't that great, but works for me. I oiled mine, which improved the color since it was a little dull(and waterproofing as a bonus). They also held up well on a camping trip! They\u2019re a little scuffed up now, but it\u2019s expected.",
