This is a solid tool that has enough features to give me peace of mind when I'm out on my bike. I was a little dubious of the tire prys, which looked wimpy and smaller than others I've used. But after using them three times now (I had an unlucky spell this summer) I can say that they are actually pretty great, and their slim profile makes them easier to tuck into a bag than some of the wider versions. This is an overall fantastic value",

Upon trying to use the tool to loosen the nuts I found the tool completely useless.

Tried it out to install a water bottle carrier replace a seat on my bike and adjust the seat on my wife\u2019s bike. Was able to really torque Allen nuts without any problems. Comes in a little ziplock pouch. Love my new tool! Do not hesitate to buy this tool! It\u2019s perfect!",

I like the design and tools feels solid. I'm making some adjustments to my 1985 Schwinn World tomorrow and hopefully I'll give you feedback on how the tools feels when being used. It seems like a nice tool. Just don't lose the unlocking allen wrench.",

Most of the wrenches fit on my Schwinn Sidewinder, however, the metal and plastic mount flexed when I really needed to loosen a tough bolt. This showed how crappy the quality was made when I really needed it. It flexed a lot but I wouldn't imagine it lasting very long after a few tough bolts that need to be loosened. I'd recommend this tool as a back up that you keep with you on bike rides.",

Maybe there are some things where you wouldn't be able to fit the multi-tool, but they should have integrated a way to fit the separate key and unitize it.",
