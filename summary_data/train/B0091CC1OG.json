To simulate what this feels like, have someone press down on your nose and hold it in. Also the cutout for the eye area isn't right.

My daughters like a lighter weight one that I bought from \"The Friendly Swede\" on Amazon but the eye opening wasn't wide enough for me (hit the outside corner edges of my eyes). Love this one! Sooo, out of three different options this is my favorite!",

It fits perfectly and having the ability to remove the facemask and bring it back up to your face is seamlessly. When the wind picks up, I can barely feel the tundra wind hitting my face. The average temperatures I\u2019ve used this balaclava were in -12F to 32F (-24C to 0C). I highly recommend this product if you are working outside in the extreme cold.",

If you wear normal glasses, your breath does tend to fog them up, but I\u2019m pretty sure that will happen with most fabrics that go over the nose. The neck easily stays under your layers, and the nose and mouth part do pull down, however, if you want it to stay down, it tends to pull and expose your ears, and then the top part on your head starts to pull down the back. I would still recommend though. It\u2019s very comfy.",
