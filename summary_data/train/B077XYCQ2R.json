They liked its lightweight configuration, its versatile design, the responsive cushioning system and the comfortable fit. Conversely, there were complaints about a cheap-looking fa\u00e7ade, an extended break-in period, and an unsupportive upper. Overall, this road companion, while not being perfect, gained a following of avid testers.",

Then, it is extremely narrow in the heel area, such that it immediately hurts, even before standing in them. Nearly impossible to put on, since the shoe's tongue, being fixed to the sole, makes for a very narrow entrance - extra unlacing doesn't/can't help. Also, it came up in a search for shoes with a 'large toe box'. That is a miss as well. Never encountered such small shoes labeled 8.5 USA. These are cruel shoes...",
