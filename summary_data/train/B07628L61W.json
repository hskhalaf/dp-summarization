Needless to say, I should have worn both white and brown pants when I opened these. Now I'm waiting on the laundry to finish my load. Enough said.",

Around town, out to dinner, and of course the gym. BEST THING ABOUT THESE SHOES THOUGH, are that most of the time when I do not wear socks with my Vans my achilles tendon gets a nasty blister from the back of the shoe, but NOT this one. Perfectly comfortable to wear without socks. They also fit exactly the way I expected.",
