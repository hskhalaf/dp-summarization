Excellent sturdy two-pronged rubber grip handle. Plus, looks like the manufacturer got the message on not putting that impossible to remove sticker on the front. Mine didn't have one. The cons - the metal gauge is a little lighter than I expected. I had a contractors aluminum dust pan previously of similar size and it was a little heavier gauge. I still give it a 5 though.",
