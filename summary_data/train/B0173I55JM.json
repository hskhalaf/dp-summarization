Came with net, water starter stuff, fish flakes, filter with cartridges. It uses all 3 cartridges which is weird, would have rather had one big one with a spade but whatever. The filter is actually whisper quiet out of the box. LED lighting is a huge bonus, tanks of old had fluorescent bulbs which went out frequently (at least in my experience.) I'll try and remember to update this review next year or if something bad happens. No update means we're still happy!",
