The aluminum frame and carbon fork ride like a dream! I road it on a 50 mile ride this past summer among other lengthy journeys and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. As with any bike make sure to check every nut and bolt during assembly. They're not always torqued to spec from the factory. In my case the bottom bracket lock ring needed a little snugging up. If you're looking to get into road biking this is the bike for you!",

Amazon wouldn\u2019t accommodate the price difference so I had to repurchase. 2nd, on the manufacturing end, the bike is pretty dope, but for roughly $600 amazon or schwinn could\u2019ve put an L wrench in the bundle. Finally, I get that for hardcore cyclists this bike isn\u2019t crazy expensive but for a casual biker, for my money I at least hoped everything worked BUT I had to take it to a local bike shop (paid more money) to fix the brakes BC NEITHER WORKED!!!! VERY FRUSTRATED.",

I did replace the pedals and brake pads right away, they are very cheap. There were no other bikes for this price with carbon front forks.",

After 500+miles of solid riding, I can safely say that this bike is garbage. I now understand what quality, or lack there of, means. the gears are extremely low end, and they slip like they're made of banana peels. Tires are paper thin. Everything is coach class.Do not get this bike if you like cycling already or want to get \"back into it\". It will disappoint. It's better to apply this $299 to a bike in the $600 range.",
