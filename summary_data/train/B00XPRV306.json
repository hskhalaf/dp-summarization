The tension rod is right above the lip of the shower unit so it has a little extra support and it's never budged even with several full size shampoo/conditioner bottles and travel size items. I also like that it has the extra spot for razors. This set up has worked perfectly for us.",

      "text": "7/29/16: I like the product, so much so that after I set up the first one I bought 2 or 3 more, which will have arrived today (I'm living on a semi truck). I've had this first one up for about 1.5 weeks, & one of the least-used pockets seems to have been poorly stitched. I'm hoping that a whip-stitch with plain thread will do the trick, but I'm worried that it will have to wait for now, & that it might get worse. 3 stars. Edit 9/16/2016: I have been gifted with an un-asked-for replacement! I'm grateful & will switch out the other as it is indeed getting worse. 5 stars.",

I don't feel like it's gonig to tear or break from what I have in it and the mesh pockets help so If soap spills in it I just rinse it out and no mold because the holes let it drip dry! will buy another when we re-do our other bathroom for sure.",

No offensive odors from material as noticed with similar items that must be aired out a few weeks before can be used. Easily can see many uses for this organizer like putting child's toys in it for quick pick up, grab & go, keeping those little cars & other small toys from getting under foot. Fits well over the door hanging straight & steadily. Could also hang on closet bar or stick on wall with those self-sticking, eastpysiery release hooks. Would highly recommend. Thank you!",

Because the water collects under whatever bottles we have in the bottom pouches, we have had constant mildew issues. It could be a great product if we weren't constantly having to scrub mildew out of the mesh.",

The material is good quality, the stitching is well done (very important) and cleans nicely. The pockets are a good size. The smalls are great for misc items (razor, combs) the large are holding 2 full size slim design bottles perfectly. I have a very narrow tub and this is a great space saver item.",

Mesh, so it very quickly drys. Varied sized pockets enough to hold large shampoo and small nail files. Comes with three metal over the rod or door holders. All in all this worked perfectly. It folded up nicely so it didn't take up space in luggage. Very happy I got this and will use it again for traveling.",
