All other stores were out of this color, so when I found them on Amazon, I was really excited. They arrived today and I am both concerned and disappointed. These were delivered without a Birkenstock box and with a tag that looked like it was worn or copied. The shoe fits totally differently than the others I own; it is narrower in the straps and seems overall a bit smaller than the ones in my closet, even though they are the very same size. It makes me wonder if these are real Birks or counterfeit? Just saying...",

Most people think Birks are strictly function, but no longer true. They have made a wise marketing move - Wish there were more in leather, since there really is no comparison to leather.",
