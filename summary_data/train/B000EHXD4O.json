We have spaniels so they don\u2019t get a lot of air in their ears. Moisture causes issues in ears. Mites and bugs CANNOT live in tea tree oil. I use it after every bath, and about every 2 weeks as a preventative. Use everyday if dog has an ear infection or mites for 2 weeks. Just squirt some in ear, rub the lower ear and you\u2019re done! Super easy! Can also be used for cats!",

      "text": "This ear wash worked great as far as cleaning my dog's ears, including when he had an acute otitis externa infection, and did not burn or sting him at all. When I smelled the solution in the bottle, I noticed it has a VERY strong teatree oil scent and was afraid that it would be overbearing when used. However, after cleaning my dog's ears, the scent was very light. My only concern with this ear wash is that it did leave a slight green discoloration on the fur around his ears (my dog is a light/blonde golden retriever), but the discoloration washed off easily with soap and water.",

I soak the end of a cotton ball & massage the ear with the cotton ball inside her ear canal. She shakes, gets a teat & she's good for the day. You can do it twice a day with no worries. Smells good too! So does her ear.",
