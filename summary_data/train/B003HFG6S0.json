Unfortunately the monitor is NOT wall-mount compatable, although the screens slim design makes up for that. This is a highly recommended buy!

I don't have to deal with the glare from a glossy screen. I'm very happy with it. The controls are not immediately user friendly, but once you get used to them, they seem logical.",

Right now I have a 2010 Mac Mini, Xbox 360, and PS3 connected via HDMI to an HDMI switch which has one HDMI cable running into the port on the PX2370, Logitech external speakers plugged into the audio out and everything works FLAWLESSLY! Minor adjusting is needed to get the best picture possible but that's with ANY monitor/TV so really that should go without saying.

The monitor does have a tilt function, which wasn't immediately clear to me from the description. The picture is very sharp using my laptop and the included VGA to DVI cable. The connection between the neck of the monitor and the base seemed slightly unstable at first, but after reseating and tightening it a few times I think it will work out fine. All in all highly recommended.",

I find myself trying to lessen the brightness as much as possible to have it match my apple display better. My only complaints: navigating through the menu/settings could be more intuitive, the stand is wobbly and I cant seem to get it to sit evenly-the monitor appears to tilt slightly on the left. Nothing I cant live with. Overall a good buy.",

The blacks are dark and the viewing angles are good. I don't really have any complaints about the picture quality, it is truly magnificent. I do wish it had more output capability and a forward tilt feature. You will get a cleaning cloth in the box, use \"distilled\" water with it and it will dry without streaks and will be clean. I think this is a great monitor for the price and will probably be buying a second for a dual display.",

Running sound from the audio line out to the pc there was some noticeable buzz and the only workaround was to use optical out, which you'll need a dedicated sound card for but can find for $50. Over all great picture, easy to use, no headaches. Would love to get a few more to run a multi-monitor setup.",

Still a shame though. The software seems unnecessary, it doesn't do anything.

We see that a lot with Macs.\" ?! They also said that no Samsung monitors have Mac drivers. Back to Amazon it goes. Forewarned. EDIT: just received a Viewsonic 2436.

One tiny problem is with the power plugs. It's slightly tilted at the end point which makes it difficult to fit into some sockets. But once it is in, the screen works.So I guess I won't return it.However, another thing really bothers me is that it came without any instructional handbook nor warranty book. Because it's refurbished? I really don't think so. I registered the product on Samsung's official site anyway.",

However, it is severely lacking when it comes to displaying blacks around the edges(w.in 1-2in from the edge) of the screen. In this area it is clear that the backlight is bleeding through and blacks appear very washed out. Some might consider this a minor issue, but it bugs me enough when watching a film to draw me out of the story. For this reason I will likely replace this monitor in 1 or 2 years, rather than keeping or for 4 or 5 as I had originally planned.",

Running at full resolution gives excellent detail and color, and the brightness levels can be adjusted to all normal indoor conditions. I really like the even LED backlighting compared to LCD, and the lower power consumption is always a good thing. I previously owned a Dell Ultrasharp and this is a big improvement. The only thing I am not impressed with has been mentioned in other reviews, and that is the slight shaking of the monitor when the desk is bumped. A vibration resistant stand would be a nice improvement. I use for amateur image editing, SC2 gaming, and general use. Would recommend if you are interested.",

While it was kind of cool to have the tuner, I didn't use it often enough to offset the disadvantages; which I didn't realize until after changing to the Samsung LED display MONITOR, no TV tuner. The biggest differences are in the width, pixel accuity, brightness and refresh rate (2msec). There is simply no comparison. Faster, brighter, sharper; and supports a higher pixel density. The Samsung is right on 20\" wide. As a web designer, the extra width and white whites is very nice. Much less heat and of course LED uses less electricity than the flourescent backlight in the Viewsonic. Highly Recommended.",

A lot has been said of the lack of ability to swivel the monitor on it's base...this seems over-stated to me...If you want to change the angle of the monitor all you have to do is move it left or right with your hand...no big deal here...",
