This is the first time and they will work with support stocking as well. Very adjustable. My one negative is that I ordered brown thinking they would go with most any color slacks, WRONG! The color is a horrible washed out lookin dark tan. Makes the leather look fake!! I thought I had gotten the tan by mistake when I opened the box. Was going to return to get BROWN but when I looked at my order form they did send this horrible color they call brown. Very frustrating!!!!",

There are much better brands out there in this price category, so not buying Propet again.",
