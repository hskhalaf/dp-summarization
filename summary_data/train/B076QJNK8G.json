Mealthy personally reached out to me and apologized and provided me with a new pot that so far has worked great. I was so impressed with the companies personal and professional service that I just had to change my review. Although the first product failed and got a 1 Star, their service was a 5+. Changing my overall opinion to 4 stars. Buy with confidence the Mealthy Multi-pot. Thank you guys for making it right!!!",

It's so easy to use, and is a wonderful product that deserves every bit of praise that it gets. The enamel of the inner warmer pot chips very easily. Just a simple incorrect placement of the lid can break a piece of the enamel off, which is unfortunate. This doesn't seem to effect the usability of the product, but it sure doesn't make the pot look as pretty after having enamel being chipped. I hope Mealthy will make a revised version!

I cooked a 3ft pork loin (cut in pieces to fit in pot) within a hour to pulled pork stage. Even though I was cooking a lot of meat there was consistency in texture and taste. One loin cut wasn't softer or had more flavoring than the other.",

I made the right choice with the MultiPot. I am trying to end the last minute fast food stop but don't always plan dinner. The MultiPot makes it easy to cook a last minute healthy, great tasting meal my kids will eat. I really like the digital progress indicator which lets me know how soon dinner will be ready. The accessories that it came with are a great value. I especially like the bright pot holders which make getting the hot food out so easy.",

Customer support responded right away and sent a replacement within days. Very Happy with my Multipot.... Makes rice perfectly....What I love is I can cook my rice inside a ceramic bowl inserted into the pot using the included stand and a little water on the bottom. I serve the rice right out of the bowl.... no clean up ...I also like the electronic graph in front that gives you an idea where it is in the cooking process. Stainless steel pot cleans up wonderfully. Thank you Mealthy.... great customer support. !",

Within 5 minutes of emailing customer service with a question about natural release, I received the perfect answer. No extra accessories needed, as this one is complete.
