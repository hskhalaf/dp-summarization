Even though the sorting process seems slow, it only took a couple of hours or so to sort the whole 5 gallon jug. I have not used the coin rolling function, so I don't have a review of that as of yet.",

I highly recommend buying the pre-formed wrappers and make sure they are not dented! Or...sort/count without the wrapper first and then manually add into wrapper. I think out of $400ish dollars worth of coins that we sorted and turned into the bank...the teller said we were only off by under $3. Sounds great to me!",

What's that worth to you? You get what you pay for. The only issue I have is it stops each time once the coin wrapper is full so you can insert a new one. That happens often because this thing is fast. I wish it could autofeed new rolls. And speaking of coin rolls, only use performed ones. If you don't, you're gonna regret it. Highly recommended.",

Given the price point for me, I needed to be impressed and I was. I have only had it for a relatively short time, so I have no opinion on its long term performance...will advise if my opinion changes.",

When coin sorter was delivered, I feed in coins and started using it right away it jammed only once because of a Mexican coin that got into the hopper. So far have no problem, sorting and wrapping coins became a fun now. Definitely money well-spent!",

      "text": "Everyday we empty our change into an old coffee can or similar and over the past few years --wow, it's added up. So I sprang for this gizmo figuring it would save me time sorting & rolling ... or fees at coinstar. It did! The thing worked great. You can put in a good amount of coins at a clip. You'll have to change the paper rolls (purchased separately) often as it processes pretty fast. I didn't rely on the read out to count the total, so I can't evaluate that. But as a sorter & roller, Im very pleased.",

Easy to use, it counts, adds, batches, and wraps automatically. Easy to use The C200 recognizes individual denominations and sorts them automatically into large bins. No dials and no knowledge of coin dimensions required. Just load the hopper, press start, and walk away. Grand total of all coins is displayed and detailed reports for each denominations are within a button\u2019s reach. Counting, adding, and batching The C200 includes all the counting modes you would expect to find on a Cassida-designed coin sorter. Batch mode counts amounts as low as 1 coin or as high as 500. An easy-to-read LED display shows both number of coins and dollar amount for each denomination, as well as the grand total. One step sorting and wrapping It takes only seconds to exchange the C200\u2019s bins for the included wrapping attachments. One button sets roll batch amounts for all denominations and C200 stops automatically when a wrapper is full, great for fast-paced environments where there is a need to switch between wrapping and bulk sorting. Fast, but quiet The C200 is quiet in operation, even when counting and sorting at 300 coins per minute!",
