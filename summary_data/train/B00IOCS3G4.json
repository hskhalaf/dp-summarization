The Wrist Ripper gives me more alternatives as it can be held at different grips and provides for constant tension. 32 years of construction work has damaged my wrists and elbows to the point that I experience pain. The wrist ripper has not only aided in the development of my grip strength, but it has decreased the pain felt while working-out as I believe it has developed all the supporting muscles surrounding my wrists and elbows giving me more support and stability.",

The ripper is the best ever for three reasons: 1. The grips are fantastic - right diameter and amount of tackiness 2. The weight plate plug is a snap to use - with the snap connection 3. Build quality is excellent 4. No dropped weights - the bevels on the middle and the bulbs at the end give you tactile feedback of the grip dimensions 5. Strap wraps up more neatly than a rope or chain",

I liked the feature of being able to grab the ends for an extra exercise that the other products didn't offer. However, the end grips are very uncomfortable to the point where I think it did more harm than good. It actually hurt to use them which is the main reason I got this over other similar products. I ended up returning this which was my first Amazon return ever. The construction seems fine and the main grips aren't too bad (although I'd prefer foam over a thin rubber grip).",

Personally, I prefer the pump I get with using a lot of reps. Sometimes I use the wrist roller right after I finish doing reverse curls, this adds to the burn and the pump.
