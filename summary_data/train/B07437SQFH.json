      "text": "This is a very nice larger size laptop stand. It seems made very well, easily adjustable, and fits a really large laptop (like my 17\"+ gaming laptop). However, it really needs to be able to have lower adjustment on the legs (it's simply too tall) because even at the minimum height it puts the keyboard uncomfortably high. Also, the laptop and mouse \"lip\" is too tall and gets in the way of using the keyboard and mouse. Thankfully, they're removable, but it leaves four holes in the top of your tray. I waited too long to send it back or I would have.",

I would love a longer rest that fits in the current position. Still highly recommended.",

The tilting option is great and there are stoppers that stop your books or laptop from sliding off. There's no assembly required which was a bonus! It's also really lightweight so it's easy to carry to wherever I'm working. The only thing that could make this table better is a carrying handle.",

The main problem that he has is that when he locks it into a position, it doesn't want to stay there. we have made sure we are locking everything into place, but it just does not stay exactly when you need it.
