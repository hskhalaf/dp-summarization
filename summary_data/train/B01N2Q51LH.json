      "text": "From 50 degrees to 90 this jacket is very comfortable. With the lining out I'd feel comfortable at speed in this even above that temp. My only slight complaint is the liner retaining straps in the waist and one arm failed in the first couple of weeks of pulling it off. It looks sharp, is nicely ventilated and still plenty warm in the cooler temps. I haven't worn in the rain but it held up great in heavy fog with lots of humidity buildup it dried quickly and I stayed dry inside.",

It can be super airy and adjusted to fit well. The color is awesome, super visible. Main complaint, the armor feels not quite hard enough, but it works. It runs a bit small. I'm 6'2 and the XL feels short. Only 170lbs, so the rest is pretty roomy, but straps can make it fine.",

Update: I removed 2 stars as the zipper is difficult to operate. It requires fumbling to close the jacket. I would typically not remove 2 stars, but it really makes the jacket cumbersome to close. Update: figured out the zipper. It is a reversed (female?) zipper. Just had to hold the other side. Not sure why this is called a 'mens' jacket though.",

Sleeves bunch up a little on me, but otherwise has a better fit and look than the Joe Rocket, and costs 2/3 as much. Very pleased. The look is aggressive, but not as obnoxious as the Joe Rocket.

      "text": "Coming back after a year of wear and riding. It's a great jacket for warmer weather, good down to about 55f with the windproof liner in it, past that I'd recommend something heavier. The number of pockets is great, as is the adjustability at the waist and arms. The mesh is very breathable, making summer rides at 90f pleasant. MOST IMPORTANTLY it held up when I low-sided my bike going about 40 mph! I was wearing this over a t-shirt, gloves and a full helmet and walked away with a bruise on my shoulder and road rash on my knee (I've since purchased armored jeans). While the jacket was trashed, I was fine. Thank you Pilot!",
