In bad condition and way too big. Returned. I got another pair size 7.5 - still a bit too big. Worn them once and figured that they are still a bit too big. Obviously can't return them now. I kept them but wearing not too often. ..And Boooy oh Boy they get filthy so fast..",

I simply loosened up the laces and broke them in to make them more comfortable. That\u2019s all it takes. No complaints other than that. And bonus the shoe makes me a little taller. Great color scheme. Definitely will be ordering more !",
