      "text": "We do a lot of gardening in our overgrown yard, and I took a chance paying much more on this unit instead of cheaper corded or cordless ones. Now, after using it all over our yard on some pretty large, overgrown shrubs, I am so glad that I paid more for this powerful, cordless model. It works like a charm. Hasn't gotten stuck once on any good-sized branches. Mows through thick shrubs like butter. Very easy to operate and use. Worth every penny. (I think I'll carry on with this trend and get the Black & Decker heavy duty blower with the same battery; power is addictive....)",

I was concerned that the 60 volt battery wouldn't allow me to finish my trimming without a recharge but no problem. The trimmer doesn't have the power of my gas powered unit but it is lighter, better balanced and most importantly I don't have to inhale the exhaust fumes nor wash my body and clothes when I finish my work. In short, after doing my yard a couple of times, I'm very satisfied with this product. The trimmer is well made and priced very competitively when compared to other models and makes.",

Not really, there is a tiny sawblade thatscratchs and knaws and maybe, eventually, will wear thru a branch but the 24 inch hedge trimmer does not cut anywhere near 1.5 inch, brush more like 5/8 inch. I think the description is misleading. That said, it is a pretty good trimmer, well balanced and does the job on most stuff.",

I trimmed several large ornamental bushes, a couple of dozen box-hedges, some Barberry shrubs (very woody) and more. The battery is still more than half full. The blades did not jam - not once. It's very easy to get carried away - I'm used to a lot of resistance - my old trimmers were 12 volt and not neatly as powerful. So the first few times you use this, do it on an area that's as hidden as possible. It is heavy though!",

We have 2.5 acres with a Large 6' tall Oleander the entire length on 1 side. It cut the thick branches and it felt like it had a full charge after trimming 200' of badly overgrown Oleander. You will tap out before the battery does. Super powerful too. Makes it so easy you won't hire a landscaper. Much lighter than gas models and no cord to drag around. Its perfect and affordable.
