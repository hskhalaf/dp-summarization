Whilst unusual to complain about quick delivery these arrived after just three days (strange if ,as purported, coming from abroad) when initial delivery quoted was nearer three weeks. Not worn these yet so I reserve judgement but a bit concerned. Also disappointed to see they are made in China. No mention of that in the product description.",
