DON'T TRUST THEM AND DON'T WHATEVER YOU DO BUY A FIRESTICK FROM THEM. I AM NOW GOING ON EVERY WEB SITE I CAN TO WARN THEM OF THEIR SHARP PRACTICES. I'VE JUST LEARNT THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY. WHAT A SURPRISE. WONDER HOW LONG BEFORE THEY SCRUB THIS OUT.",

I get the feeling that the only answer to the problem is for all competing systems to amalgamate, and for it to produce really high quality programmes.",

      "text": "Received my Fire Stick today. It took all of 5 minutes to install and set up, it was an absolute doddle. I have a BT Home Hub and the wi-fi paired with the Fire Stick with no problems. I have a Samsung tv and had hoped to be able to power the Fire Stick via a tv USB port but an on screen message informed me there was insufficient power so had to resort to the power cable supplied. There are loads of excellent free programmes, films and music available to stream through Prime. My one disappointment is that I can't download music, to play in my car, as part of the package.",

But it has flaws:- 1) taking it to another house and trying to configure it there for use on another person's TV took about an hour of trial and error and requires creation of a WiFi hotspot that mimiced the original WiFi network it was connected to. 2) once voice control was activated it proved impossible to switch off and unusable thereafter. In both cases I was using the Android app to control. Hopefully taking it back home and to the handset control will allow me to switch off the voice control.",

We do not have a brilliant signal (despite Virgin saying they are the Bees Knees) and sometimes the picture pixilates and stops for a couple of minutes.

My previous review was 4/5 and read- I've not gone full 5 star as the device keeps buffering.

Streaming was distinctly inferior to playing DVDs. This is despite measuring actual download speeds on those devices in that location of more than 10 times what Amazon said was required. However, streaming works much better with the Fire Stick, and it's much more convenient to just stick it in an HDMI port and leave it there than it is to move tablets or laptops, connect them with cables and navigate to the appropriate page.",

I am not big on TV as so much of it is simply boring, but now I have a whole new world of entertainment to trawl for goodies.to watch. Films documentaries, cartoons. Stop, pause, resume. Instant access to any movie whether free, rented or bought. It is actually as good as Amazon say it is. The only downside is that am more interested in books than music, but Prime does not have a la carte menu of features. To be 100% I woukd like the stick with Prime that offers free kindle books and scrub the musicand photos.",
