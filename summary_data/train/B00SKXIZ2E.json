Being a novice, I was ready to stick it back in the box and return it. After I watched a few videos on YouTube, I figured out that if I resequenced them it may help. That plus a little valve grease now I have a working horn. I think most of the problems you have with buying online has to do with quality control when these products leave the manufacturer. Most of us are buying an instrument for the first time so we have no idea what to look for and how to troubleshoot.",

I had this trumpet for about three and a half months and the second valve got stuck like it was gorilla-glued. The insides of the trumpet corroded very quickly, which is what caused the valves to stick. I took it to a music store and they said it would be best to purchase a new one. I'm very disappointed. I would not recommend this model to anyone. It's a cheap model, but it's not worth purchasing. It's worth purchasing a trumpet that costs more but will be in proper order for years.",

The slides are a different story, one travels fine but the other gets stuck often and needs to be forced. My main complaint would be that the sound quality isn't great, but unless you're a professional that isn't super important.",
