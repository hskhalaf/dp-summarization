I ran 18 gauge wire from both to extend them and ran them to the top of my basement stairs so can hear them in the event they go off. (Knock on wood) For the price they are a solid 5 star product. Simple concept with water completing the circuit for the alarm. I am slightly concerned based off of some of the other reviews and them not working but all of my testing using my finger to complete the circuit was successful. These are a nice little addition for a little peace of mind.",

The water sensor is on an extensible lead, so that the alarm circuitry can be position well above any accumulation. The lead is long enough that the alarm can be placed at a conveient height on a wall, while the sensor is on the floor.",

When I received the unit, I put a battery in it and connected the leads with a jump wire to see what would happen. It does emit a sound but the sound is not loud enough to carry more then about 15 feet away from the source!!!. What the heck! It is nothing like testing your fire alarm and having to cover your ear to avoid the pain. If you have to be in practically right next to it to hear it, what good is it? I'm sending it back.",

    "description": "Size:Pack of 1Water damage is one of the main ways that the value of a home can be diminished. Accidents will happen! Water heaters break down and water pours out, washing machines overflow, pipes wear thin and leak - and when these things happen, water will start to destroy your home. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of water damage is that it can occur with almost no sound - you may not know you have a leak until your basement is flooded! Now, you can minimize the risk of water damage with this Water Alarm. The Water Alarm requires only a 9-volt battery (battery not included), and when placed on the floor it can detect water that is only 1/32\"deep! This is thanks to solid state circuitry which is highly reliable. The Water Alarm also has a 6-foot sensor wire, so that you can extend it into a sump pump, or simply mount it on a wall to stretch it to another location. Plus, up to an additional 200 feet of wire can easily be spliced in to provide extra length. When the Water Alarm detects water it emits a loud 110 decibel alarm (as loud as most car horns)! And don't worry that you will miss this alarm if you are out of the house when water is first detected - the Water Alarm will sound continuously for 2-3 days (depending on existing battery life). Consider one for the basement, one for the kitchen, the bathroom, or anywhere that water may become a hazard. Keep your home safe and secure with the Water Alarm. Assembly level/degree of difficulty: No Assembly Required.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nMinimize the risk of water damage with this early warning system For installation in sump pits or near areas requiring water monitoring like hot water heaters, air conditioners, washing machines or under sinks. Requires a 9-volt battery (Sold separately). Solid state circuitry is extremely sensitive and reliable. Detects water only 1/32-Inch deep when the alarm is placed on the floor. The Sensor has a 6-foot wire so it can be extended into a sump pit, or mounted on a wall and stretched to another location. (Accommodates the addition of more than 100 feet of wire, if needed). Loud 110dB alarm can be heard throughout the house. Battery-saver feature keeps batteries fresh longer. for 24 to 48 months",
