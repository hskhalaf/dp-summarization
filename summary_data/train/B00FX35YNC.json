The filter is very effective. 2 gripes: 1) The wand extensions should have a clip to hold them on - they tend to come apart as you use them 2) The top doesn't seal as well to the bucket as it could. When carrying it by the handle, if you bump it against you leg or whatever, some dust or whatever is in the drum leaks out",

Once we cleared the debris, we used the WorkShop vac to slurp up everything from nails, concrete dust, and cobwebs. I've used other so-called utility vacuums in the past, but the WorkShop blows them all away! So easy to wheel, and the suction is incredible! I'll never buy on from the \"competitor\" again!",

Having said that, thewhich I purschased separately is a nice addition and lets me easily swap between dry and wet pick up applications. Used it to suck up a small amount of water on the basement floor and it did an excellent job. Much better than my old (25 years) Craftsman vac.",

I hook it up to my tools in my wood shop for dust collection, and I have a dust separator in between the vacuum and tools. It begins to lose suction pretty quickly as the dust just immediately clogged. I\u2019ll try one of the filter bags and see if that helps. Aside from that, it moves an absolute ton of air. Far superior to Shop Vac at a much better price. I like that the hose attaches with a clip, instead of just friction. The onboard tool storage is superior as well.",

If I tried to use it for my purpose (EIFS and concrete dust), I'm sure the paper filter would be hopelessly clogged and/or chewed up in short order.

      "text": "This unit seems to be optimized for liquid pickup. It will do dry and do it well. But note where the hose inlet is. It is in the top. You cannot use a vac bag with this unit and you need to clean the filter frequently. For liquid pickup this not a problem. When using this vac I do wear hearing protection and use it solely for liquid. Also I note that they do make the same unit with the inlet port in the barrel so they can use filter bags.",

This greatly reduces the high pitched sound that is louder than other vacs I've used. This one drawback is well worth the power and had an easy workaround. I love not having to use bags. Easy to clean and nice fat hose clogs less often than others.",
