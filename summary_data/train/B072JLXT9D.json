I played it off like they were my sun glasses and there was something on the lens I couldn't get off. He ended up putting them on to see what I was talking about and all of a sudden got very emotional! My house is surrounded by trees full of green leaves! On our way to lunch he was pointing out signs, buildings etc that had green or red on them. Extremely pleased with the product! My husband's response was priceless! Ordering a pair for my daughters boyfriend. He has problems with red/green. Thank you!",

Without the glasses, he said everything looked green, but with the glasses, he could identify that there were pink flowers.

He then put the glasses on and was mystified at how green the grass was, the blue in the sky, he was amazed at all the colors of the flowers. I'm so pleased I tried this cheaper version and love the results. Now my kido won't be so mismatched when dressing himself.",
