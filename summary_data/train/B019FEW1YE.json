But this turd of a receiver quit working after only hours of use, not abused, not gotten wet as it is on my boat. Quit sending signal to all speaker channels. Amazon made it right and refunded my money, (thanks amazon) but this is most certainly a turd. I guess I should have kept the working cassette tape player that my boat used to have as it was working fine being more than 15yrs old..",

Nothing worked and JVC would not sent me a new one.They expected me to pay for shipping the unit to a service center in New York. Now it is too late to sent the unit back to Amazon. Now I'm stuck. The JVC service crew are a joke. Stay away from JVC.",
