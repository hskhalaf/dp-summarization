I chose this item to be on the counter top because I didn\u2019t like the tall standing water dispenser on my floor; this is still large for counter top. Hard to add jug to the top as there is a circular notch which enters the jug; water splashes everywhere. My son is 6\u20191\u201d and still hard to add jug to top of container. I am not satisfied, but I waited too long to return.",

The hot water is absolutely great for coffee, instant oatmeal, etc. I use my hot and cold everyday.",
