I am hoping they address this issue with a software update, but if it still won't work in 2 months, time to junk it. If you have any doubts, look on netgears own site. They host a forum. This is a common issue, and they cant/won't fix it.",

Regular dropped connections, disconnects from the mesh, poor performance, ridiculously complex setup for subscription-based parental controls via a third party app that I can no longer turn off. The list goes on. If I weren't past the return period I'd ship this thing back in a heartbeat.",

I can have my youngest son watching Netflix on Ethernet connection, my older son playing Xbox on WiFi, and I'll be watching Hulu on Ethernet and our connections will buffer, a lot. It's disheartening that I paid more for this system than I did for my Asus and it doesn't work as well. The WiFi range is fantastic, don't get me wrong but the product is lacking when it comes to using multiple devices at the same time.",

We have high speed wifi (275mbs) but the TV's were buffering with the wheel spinning. I put the Orbi router in the middle of the main floor and a satellite at the far end of the main floor. I put another satellite in the basement. Now everyone has high speed WiFi anywhere in the house. The main floor is just over 3000 sq ft. No more buffering. Installation was quick and simple. Highly recommend.",

That's why my attempts ran into a stone wall. He was able to reset the device to factory settings and from there the set up went just as it should have. Now I'm wondering if I should return the unit. What could be next?",

Tried everything suggested on the netgear forums to fix it, but now after a lot more research it seems like the issue is with the firmware and how it manages connections to the satellite unit, which is the entire selling point of the system. Currently running this with the satellite unplugged as that's the only way to keep a stable connection. Unfortunately it's too late to return it now, I feel like I've been burned.

Most things like the plugs needed to be either turned off and back on or had to be dropped and reinstalled. Overall, once the first one was done the rest came easy. Apple tv still a bit of a dilemma.
