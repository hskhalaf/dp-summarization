I drilled holes in box bottom and tied string to them, good thing, racoon would've taken the box. Watched one racoon work the boxes for 30 minutes one night. He couldn't open them, but saw him reach way in and break off bait chunks and eat it. So, some dead rats and at least one dead racoon out there somewhere.",

Comes with small stakes to hold it down, no directions, so I put them in the big end holes. Easy to load with bait. Holds one packet if you buy the bucket of packets. I guess the kids could shake it and the bait would come out, so be aware of that.",

      "text": "I have a small grove in Vista, CA. and a rental in La Quinta, both have problems with rats off and on (mostly going after avocados in Vista, and living in the palms in La Quinta). Effective easy to use solution for control. Poisoned rats can be a danger to birds, so I try and place these near where I think the rats nest is, which is generally in a place that birds cannot get to. Also, its trivial to check the traps and I find that once the rats in an area are gone they may not make it back for many months at a time depending on time of year.",

      "text": "Nice enough, but if you have no kids the double key locks are a pain to have to use to rebait. And I\u2019ll probably lose the key sooner or later and have to throw away the whole station and buy some other keyless model. I found what I think is by far the best station online called \u201cVole Control bait stations\u201d, They are SO much easier to check and add bait to. These box type ststions are more difficult to open after dirt and debris settles in to the lid snap locks. The Vole Control easily unscrews and they are made specifically for voles, preventing squirrels and chipmunks from being killed, which is a good thing. Good luck!",
