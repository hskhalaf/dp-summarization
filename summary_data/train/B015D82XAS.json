Did not order another one. I went a different direction. I did not want to take a chance on another one. I was disappointed because I liked ever thing except the lock.",

You will NOT be able to do that with the Fort Knox, it's much more substantial construction. And no battery maintenance for those of us that tend to blow that off. This one is my closet carry gun safe, I'll be replacing my sometimes-reliable bedside biometric safe with the top opening version of this one soon.",

I used to use a Gunvault Mini, and was always a little worried about the fact that it was battery-powered. And then the lock broke on it, which as it turns out is very common with those safes. I like this safe much, much more. The quality and peace of mind are well worth the slightly higher cost.",
