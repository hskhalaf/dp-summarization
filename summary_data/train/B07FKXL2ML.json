Even just $18, $36 and $180 would be enough. In Judaism, the letters in the Hebrew word for \"life\" have a numeric value of 18 (Hebrew letters are associated with a number, kind of like Roman numerals). So it's traditional to give gifts of $18 or $36 (a \"double life,\" so to speak) to commemorate rites of passage.",

It also comes attached to a greeting card so you don't even have to buy a greeting card. I put it in a birthday-themed cellophane bag with a ribbon attached and then wrap that in tissue and put it in a gift bag. Everyone loves the gift presentation. Awesome easy choice for tweens!",

No. 1....It looks much better to have $100 printed right on the card. No. 2...When it's not printed on the card there's always that doubt from the receiver......\"How much is really on this card ?\" You can do better. I'm sure $100 is one of the most common value card purchased. Next year PRINT $100 RIGHT ON THE CARD.",

Amazon gift cards are more convertible and usable then very specific ones (starbucks\\best buy, etc) since this can be used for anything from music to groceries to electronics.
