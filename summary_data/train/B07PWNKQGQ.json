The Pros: The lightweight structure of the Under Armour Charged Impulse is FANTASTIC! Midsole is soft enough to welcome all-day wear. The responsive platform is appreciated by me, as I like a springy underfoot experience. The upper unit is definitely breathable. Overall, the Under Armour Charged Impulse is positive. VERY positive! This running shoe is considered as a solid option for daily runs, all-day activities and competition use! The lightness of the build, the breathability of the upper, and the responsiveness of the midsole have become the highlights of this product for me! The Cons: NONE!",

I've been using Nike/Adidas for years but prices have gone up and quality has gone down, not too mention the soles wear out pretty quick. Took a punt on these, fit perfectly, really comfy insoles, colour and design are spot on, grip level good. Would buy again",
