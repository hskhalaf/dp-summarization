Had to use Google translate to work my way through the settings to get it changed to english. Once that was accomplished the tablet was great! easy to set up and navigate. Connected to wifi easily and seemed pretty quick. I think it is a nice unit for the price. I also bough myself a Nexus 7 around the same time. Admittedly the Nexus 7 blows this thing away in build quality and speed but it also cost twice as much.",
