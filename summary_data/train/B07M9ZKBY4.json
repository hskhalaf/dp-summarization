      "text": "Adorable design, too flimsy with even moderate wind. I purchased three of these. They look adorable from the window, but if even the slightest breeze comes through, it bends and then stands lopsided for the duration of its life. The regular 30-50lb bases you can buy Most places, tip right over when the wind blows. I had to spend another hundred dollars for the hundred pound bass at Lowe\u2019s to provide a little more stability. Do you umbrella, just wish it was a little more heavy duty .",

After about six weeks, they haven't faded or shown any deterioration during the hottest days of the summer. The metal structure is substantial and I haven't noticed any weak joints that look like they might fail. I did just purchase a third umbrella, along with covers to help maintain the deep blue color.",

In the past we always bought from Lowes or Home Depot and always bought those 9' umbrellas with that thicker, rougher feeling canvas. Well, these umbrellas have a smoother fabric, but they are high quality, not even remotely see-through, and they are very well made. They look better in person than in the pictures. We loved the two we bought so much that we bought a third one. Provides more than ample shade---BETTER than the big box store umbrellas!!",
