I purchased for a trip to Ireland/Scotland to reduce ball hight in the wind. I couldn't notice any discernible reduction in the height of my shots. That being said I did hit them straight and my putting was very solid on quick greens. A bit overpriced at $50 a dozen. Will probably stick to velocity and prior gen NXT Tour for the time being but all in all a quality golf ball.",

I do agree that the price is high and when I lost one I think I searched way longer then I should have. The only downside besides the price is the ball is not durable.

On approach shots, they just don't spin quite enough to give the stopping power I have come to expect, and chips will really roll out. The cover seems incredibly durable. I played 36 holes with a single ball, and it was still in good shape. I can see why some would like the ball, but I am going back to Titleist ProV line.",
