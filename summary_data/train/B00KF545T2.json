I feel like my son is pretty average size for his age and the hat fit well and looked good. It was a little big (emphasis on little) but the string held it on. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted it to be smaller. I also want to add since it is advertised as an adult hat that I feel like it would have been too little for my husband.",

It is a soft warm milk chocolate brown color. This would also work well for kids. Great costume buy.",
