It is a big bag that is supposed to made at once, so I had to experiment a bit for the best consistency. I found that 8 ounces of the mix (by weight on a kitchen scale) plus 28 ounces of cold water worked great. I run the ingredients in the blender and place them in my 1.5-quart Cuisinart ice cream maker for 25 minutes. I then freeze the results for an hour. The outcome is the perfect texture. The only thing missing is the swirls. :)",

I also bought the Cuisinart ICE-45 Mix It In Soft Serve 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White sold here on amazon to make it. I love the machine. The mix is amazing! Now I can make it whenever I like, and My buddy ordered some to make as well. LOL *dances to the Tiki Room song playing in my head*",

This is a lactose free, vegan friendly mix. It is intended to be used with water. Do NOT listen to others saying they used milk. I've tried and it curdles and clumps the mix. You also risk serving lactose to people who chose this product specifically because they have allergies that this does not contain. It is a great mix when used correctly- which is water only.",

If you have a blender, you can short cut the freezing process by substituting ice for water. A little more ice/liquid won't make a huge difference as it's pretty sweet.",

Texture is always best straight out of the mixer; once it's in the freezer for a while, it can go crystalline and too hard, which depletes the flavor and definitely kills the 'whippiness'. For those who love Dole Whip and are tired of making the trip to Menchie's (or Disney or the Dole Farm or whatever), this is the way to go.

With a Disney employee living here and approving, I can certainly say it tastes exactly the same as the real thing. I recommend stirring the mix with water and putting that in the freezer for about an hour before pouring that into your soft serve machine. You want your mix as cold as possible without completely freezing so it can be rich and creamy.",
