I tried playing the cajon, the bass was fine but the snare part is a bit out of tune, and I think that's where the soundwave instruments link comes in handy for setting up the cajon.",

I can confidently say that if you decide to invest in a quality cajon, go soundwave. Not only will you be pleased with the sound, but you will be able to actually tune the snares and impact head quite easily with the tool that is included. It also is significantly cheaper than any Meinl or LP model, and it arguably sounds better. The seat pad that is included is also the greatest thing you never thought you needed. I recommend this to all serious percussion players.",
