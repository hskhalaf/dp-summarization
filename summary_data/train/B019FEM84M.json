I am a middle-aged woman who was looking to amp up her work out, and not have to constantly move between my carpeted and bare floored rooms to change up my workout. I found the disks provided stable and effective movement. I have been very pleased trying the new exercises in the e-book, even an old girl like me. The core exercises are changing up my routine and I have seen a difference. What I would really like is the option for a larger disk since I use it frequently with a flat foot for skating movements, and a slightly larger disk would be more comfortable for me.",

I don't know if they would be good on hard floors. These help me have perfect form in my lunges, recruit more muscle, and give more challenge to my legs. Combine regular lunges with curtsey lunges and your booty will be on fire the next day! You don't even need to add weight (though you could). Since buying these I've used them about every other day. I also like them for mountain climbers, pike planks, and glute bridges.",
