These shoes, unlike the 5.11 were incredibly comfortable out of the box, little to no break-in required! These look great, slip on easy and stay on in varying conditions. I expect they will stay on my feet in heavy mud and snow much like the 5.11s have. The stock insole is very supportive and comfortable, the tread looks like it will wear like iron (like the 5.11s). I look forward to getting even more comfortable in these boots.",

Update - After about 3 months my feet hurt so bad in these boots I had to get rid of them. Not sure if that is a comment on the boot or my feet. I think I will go back to the Redbacks. I haven't found anything else that compares to them.",

I dropped a 35lb UPS (power supply) on my foot the other day with these boots on and ended up with a bruise on my instep...I expected a lot worse...the cap toe saved me. I have had these boots for a few years now, wear them 5 days a week and they look as good as new. I have had to swap out the insoles a few times but other than that they are BY FAR the best boots I have ever owned and I have owned 2 pair of Red Wings, Timberlands, Keen, and others.",
