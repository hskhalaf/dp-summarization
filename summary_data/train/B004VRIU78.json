      "text": "Use mainly for bacon and eggs. It will not simmer something like a pot roast. The temperature control is an on/off switch so either it is full on or full off and the temperature swing means it stays on at full blast for about 15 seconds boiling graving and liquids and then off for about a minute with no simmering or bubbling. With the control on the right side the further away side is the hottest, the closest a little cooler and the middle more cooler. You have to move stuff like bacon or sausage around else some cooks faster. Looking for something better even if it cost a little more.",

Nonstick surface works as it should. I like the steam escape valve and glass lid. My only complaint is that it is hard to use for simmering. At 250 degrees it boils and at 200 the heat is too low.

The only issue I have is that there is a kinda dead spot on the far right. If you flip it over, and compare it left to right, you can see the heating element falls short. Maybe because the temperature control is on that side. Make sense to me.",
