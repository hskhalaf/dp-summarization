We bought this to hold us over for a year until we remodel the master bath so we were being pretty cheap when we ordered it, and it is what it is. No leaks, no issues, just not a luxury shower head by any means. Worth the money spent, but definitely made cheaply compared to the old white one we had for years (15 years before it began to leak) so this one will hold us over but the pressure is not great and the feel is a bit plastic-like.",
