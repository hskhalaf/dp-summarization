Easy to put together right out of the box; the bolster is already zippered in and the mattress, once unsealed and expanded, fits easily into its cover and zips in to the bottom portion. So far it has been easy to vacuum and clean. The bed is light and easily movable, yet doesn't shift when on the floor. My old lab loves it! He is close to 80 lbs and the large size works for him. I will purchase this bed again.",

The bottom pad is super thick and dense making the whole bed very heavy, and the bolsters are PERFECT for my dog that likes a snuggly sleep. I will be getting another one for our bedroom soon.",

I would give 5 stars for customer service and buying experience. I'm giving 3 stars on product quality. I love the suede material on the top and sides of the bed, but the bottom is a cheap flimsy material that I am just waiting for my dog to shred - really disappointing because the rest of the covering is so nice and the foam inside is high quality. If the bottom was made of something more durable this product would be a 5 star product.",

Most importantly, the foam is firm and dense, affording older or arthritic pets the proper support they need. The materials were brand new, good quality, and precisely constructed with neat seams.

I bought it when my golden retriever was sick with cancer to have him be as comfortable as he possibly can be. This bed is amazing - he slept like a baby and it really meant a lot to me for him to be comfortable. This bed is so durable, it does not lose firmness or shape with time. I've had it for over 3 years and it's still good as new (and my pets are not petite ahem!) Great buy, highly recommended.",

He is a 50lb mixed and he likes to stretch out, rest his head on something or nest. this bed offers him space for all of those options. He used to always sleep on the couch or bed and now he prefers to lay in his bed because its so cozy for him. The fabric is nice and soft and the interior is like memory foam. Seems it will hold up much better than the pillow fill we had in our last bed. Ill update this review once we give it a wash.",
