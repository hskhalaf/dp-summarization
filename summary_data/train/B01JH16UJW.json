      "text": "I ordered this Tea after trying Fit Tea from a brick and mortar store. I looked extensively at online reviews and chose this Tea because of the great ratings. I have to agree that the tea works! I had reduced hunger cravings and felt less bloated than I had in months! I did not feel the urge to go to the bathroom which is a bonus because of the inconvenience of time! The taste is pleasant and it is safe and easy! Works for me!",

The tea also tastes pretty good\u2014 slightly lemony and not overly sweet. If you do like really sweet drinks, I\u2019d add a little extra stevia. I was also afraid it would be hard in my sensitive stomach, but it\u2019s actually been great. All in all, I\u2019m happy with my purchase and would buy it again.",
