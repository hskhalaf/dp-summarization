The back opens as a ramp and the \"roll out\" just like on tv. If your child doesn't already have one sea Patrol vehicle/character then you may want to purchase one to go along with this Sea Patroller.",

I bought new batteries thinking the ones that came with it we're worn out, but soon realized that the sound will only work if you hold down the battery compartment (very firmly) and sound button simultaneously--something my almost 3 year old can't do. She is very disappointed but we cannot return. Otherwise the toy has many pluses, but to see my daughter continually push the button in hopes of hearing a sound is sad to watch.",
