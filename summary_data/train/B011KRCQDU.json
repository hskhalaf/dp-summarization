      "text": "This is a solid game and just about worth the money in my opinion. However, I still think Wings of Liberty is by far the pick of the bunch. I found the Protoss hard to relate to and the story ultimately a bit dreary. It was a real chore talking to the characters on deck. The missions are also a little bit repetitive; far too many of them revolve around taking down multiple 'power cores' of some description. I still recommend the game but it might be worth waiting until you can pick it up on sale if you want best value for money.",

      "text": "Love this game. I'm a starcraft fanboy already, but the campaign in this is very very good. Heart of the Swarm felt like a bit of a middle child, not much happened and it meandered a bit. LotV avoids that and feels epic and meaningful from the start. Lots of old favourites from Brood War are back and it really feels like the best version of the game could ever be. Haven't even gotten to the Coop missions yet which are supposed to be great as well.",
