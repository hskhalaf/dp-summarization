Only mild complaint I have is that its sometimes a pain to unzip cause of the anti theft flap that sits on the zipper, but frankly I like the peace of mind that my stuff is more secure more than anything so its a forgettable issue.

      "text": "Zipper is very difficult to maneuver. Holes for lock very small. Assa abloy has a small padlock that I hoped would fit for better security but shank was too large. Pockets inside straps could use rubberized material to keep cards in place. Cable to charge not Apple certified? Would not charge phone.Would be helpful if item was available in small, medium or large. Only enough room to hold computer one text book and larger size would have been preferred. This was a gift for a tall, larger man. Only got feed back from recipient today with this feedback and that he couldn't use it. Very dissappointing for price range and past date to return.",

The only downside, people dimension is in the other reviews, is when I have my MacBook in the back the capacity of the bag seems limited... So if you want to carry around a lot of stuff this is NOT the backpack, but if you're commuting and want security for all of your electronic goods, this is absolutely perfect! Another added bonus are all the secret pockets, very cool! last but not least, the main zipper has the tiny loop for a TSA Approved lock. Great!",
