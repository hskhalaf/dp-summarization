However, cake is very difficult to release from the bottom plate (even with greasing and flouring). I think a different batter type and using parchment paper in the future may help. I like that this set comes with the offset spatula and icing smoother. I imagine I might be able to use these again for other things (not regular cake) so it's not a complete wash but, overall, I don't recommend this set.",
