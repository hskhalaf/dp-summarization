After wearing these slides about 6-7 times they are falling apart! I find it ridiculous that I can buy a generic pair at drug mart for $3 and they last all summer and a name brand that is seven times more expensive falls apart. I\u2019m not a brand name shopper by any means, but I certainly expected these to last through the summer.",

The sole is made of light squishy cheap foam material that I knew wouldn't last the second I held them in my hands. They also develop wrinkles the second you start wearing them. I've had these less than a month and the insole by the strap is already starting to tear in half I would not recommend these. If they can't last a few weeks as indoor shoes there's no way they'll last outdoors. The size was as expected, a bit snug at the beginning but it'll get worn in by the end of the week and then rip apart soon after.",

I am happy with my decision to go up at least 1 size because the size 1 I purchased from the store was way too small. I recommend customers to go up at least 1 size from your child's sneaker size.",
