I have not tried adding helium, but the balloons that I used stayed inflated for over a week so far. Great Deal on a light up balloon. The blinking light is built into the balloon, so no way to turn off or remove after activating without popping the balloon.",

Once the balloons lost air you could no longer see the lights inside the balloons, but my son cut Then out and decorated his room with the lights for Christmas. Two weeks after the party the lights were still flashing. They are flashing lights and will not be a constantly lit balloon, but they are a good purchase.",

Once I completed about 90 minutes of work to get them assembled and blown up, they looked freaking amazing... BUT not for long. By the time the party started most of the lights went out and they lost their luster. If you buy these- make sure you blow them up RIGHT BEFORE the party- so they don't go dim before hand. I blew these up between 3-430pm and the party started at 7- they were all fading and lackluster by then. Kids still enjoyed them though.",

I have also used them inside the house to target key areas and amenities that are special or upgrades. Keeps the buyers focused on the house and not the stuff.

So if the light does not stay in place, it can flip the balloons on their heads and weigh them down. The result for me was a cluster of saggy, sideways or upside down balloons, which was more sad than festive to look at. Would not buy again, or recommend to anyone unless these are redesigned.",
