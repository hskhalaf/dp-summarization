Nevertheless, I want to confirm that the quality of this spatula is outstanding and really deserve an appropriate mark. Even the box feels so quality, great design and feel. Same thing about the spatula itself. It looks better in life than pictured. The bamboo handle sits naturally in hand, and the steel is really high quality. Good balance and feel. Recommend! Hope this info was helpful. Good luck with your choice!",

The head is slightly smaller than I would have liked for this purpose but is still effective and doesn't rust, which was the main reason I elected to purchase this stainless steel spatula. I hand wash only as per seller recommendation, because I don't want to mess up the wooden handle. Overall, good balance, easy to handle and light, so I am happy with my purchase. Seller delivered as promised, good quality product.",
