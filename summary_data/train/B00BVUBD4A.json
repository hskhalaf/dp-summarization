I have a pretty picky eater, and she LOVES THIS STUFF. It smells like fish bait (I got whitefish flavor), so maybe make sure you have an airtight container to store it in. Fingers crossed we see an external manifestation of the food upgrade, but the fact that she loves the palatability is reason enough to buy this tbh.",
