When I opened the package, I noticed immediately that there were a few items that were scratched or damaged. I thought I could overlook these things because it weighed a ton and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint my children. But as I got towards the end of building it, (which was no easy task) I realized that this thing was basically ready for a landfill! It was really poorly made and flimsy. The laminated pieces were coming apart. The plastic footing for the legs were broken. The holes weren\u2019t machined precisely. In short, I really regret the purchase.",

Update 8/30/2016 - while the kids don't play it as often as I'd hoped, it's still in great shape and seems to be sturdy. We have moved it around the room a few times as we change the furniture layout and it's been fine.",

Assembly instructions were easy to follow and I had it togather in under 3 hours. You should have 0 extra parts. A long phillips head screwdriver comes in handy. Be careful not to strip the pre set holes. Once assembled the table is sturdy and plays well. The rubber handles are not very tight on the rods but I added a thin wrap of tape to the rod and problem solved. Other than the black players matching the black field, I have no complaints and would recommend this product.",

Set up took about 3-4 hours but would have been much faster with an electric screw driver. Be absolutely sure to pay attention to the placement of the rods of players at the beginning of the assembly, especially note that the holes at the end of each handle need to all be on the same side for each color (all the whites on one side, all the backs in the other). Rubber handles are comfortable to grip. Solid feel overall. We're happy given the low cost.",

Did not realize the small hole at the end of the rods went on the same side. He ended up taking the men off the rods and redoing them, better than removing the legs and disassembling.",
