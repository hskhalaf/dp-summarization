The speed drops dramatically when you reach 3 bars on the control and will never recover. \"13 Miles Long Range Battery\" claim on Amazon - FAIL!!!

Was very excited because the reviews were pretty great, however I am already sending it back. 1) It is MUCH slower than advertised, it took me 40 minutes to go 2 miles 2) The battery was fully charged and by the time I got 30 minutes in, it was down to 1 bar 3) It is SO HEAVY so carrying it to the elevator after folding it was very difficult. Overall would not recommend and I am really disappointed, as I really wanted this scooter to work out!",

I have averaged 6 miles at best. 2nd, on my most recent and last ride, the plastic rear fender, cracked in half while at top speed, the rear light is mounted to the fender and it jammed under the rear tire. It caused me to loose control and almost wipe out. 3, the front lock, which keeps the handlebars upright has come loose. I no longer trust it as it wobbles so much.",
