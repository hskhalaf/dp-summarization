I have emailed Optoma and haven't gotten a response about some kind of warranty, but it looks like they aren't going to fix this without me shelling out a few hundred bucks. After doing some research, it looks like they cheap out of the thermal paste with their chips and they burn up pretty fast. So, short of me replacing the dmd chip myself which will also cost a couple hundred bucks, it appears I'm out $500. Don't buy this garbage, it will fail on you.",

Picture quality is great, fan noise is minimal, just to bad it has this flaw... I hope Optoma sees this review and responds with a way to adjust or fix this issue.. I Will adjust the star rating if this issue gets resolved..",

The sound from the projector is loud enough to not even need separate speakers. The sound fills my entire room without it being at max volume. It was easy to set up and I absolutely love having it.",

It\u2019ll do it while presenting any random moving image. It\u2019s not terrible but it\u2019s noticeable. The older model didn\u2019t have this issue.

Also the picture is smaller than what you get on other projectors at the same distance. The projector only has verical keystone correction so adjusting the picture is entirely up to your mounting mechanism. There is no options to fix the image if it is distorted. The good things: Great quality picture, lots of good and accurate color, great black to white contrast ratio. Gets very bright even if you have ambient light. Super quiet.

They ended up not so good picture quality and I think they are mostly due to low quality optical system. Bad quality means you can never focus well in all area of the screen, which is why they always prefer viewing movie than ppt and text. This is expensive but it delivers the right quality to me, so it is worth the money. Picture is crispy clear, in both text modes and picture/movie/TV mode. Color is vivid. I simply project it on my wall with plain antique white painting and it delivers very good image. Recommend it!",

I've been on hold for 20 minutes with their support team trying to find a user manual. I already regret buying the \"budget\" projector.",

This is a great price for us - granted that the projector only displays 1080p signals (still a better display quality than out old projector) and has much better brightness and dynamic range. If you are looking for a great value for money (I can't really justify the big price difference between UHD and 1080P projectors) then you can't go much better than this projector.",

Another issue that I could point out is if you have your video signals controlled by a AV receiver and switch inputs, the projector like to cycle through all inputs looking for a signal before coming back to the original input. I find this annoying and haven't been able to turn this off, but aside from that I love it.",

This causes the image to be washed out and contrast to be off which hinders color reproduction. But in rooms with some ambient light it should have better performance. This projector also produces a rainbow effect which my other 3 projectors didn\u2019t.",

I replaced this with a higher model (4k), and that is working great!!",
