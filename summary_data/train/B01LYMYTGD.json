My only gripe is that it's a triangle shape and the carrying box that comes with it is a square, for some odd reason. It fits, but not well, and could pop open at any second. Seems to be an oversight.",

Edit: I thought I would add this. The stove's threaded portion has a brass insert that should last it a long time. Cheap stoves tend to be all aluminum, but not this one. If the stove base that screws into lindal valve is all aluminum, there is a greater chance to cross-thread it, if not wear out faster.",

I've had so many igniters fail across time on various camping devices that I pretty much expect to use a lighter anyway, so no problem there. I've used a range of Monoprice products over the years (mostly relating to electronics), and have always found them to be well made, affordable, and of great value, and this stove is definitely in that category.",
