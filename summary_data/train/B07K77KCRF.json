These were a breath of fresh air by comparison to my old pair of another brand and has made running pleasurable again. Comfortable and light on the feet yet sturdy, as in they feel like they will not come apart any time soon despite wear and tear. I am considering buying a different model from Asics to have on rotation",

They\u2019ve been excellent so far, they feel very light when running but also offer a good level of padding and support which massively takes the strain off the joints. They\u2019re very comfortable and also very breathable so even on hot days your feet don\u2019t get too hot while running which is good. Got to say this is my first pair of ASICS I\u2019ve owned and they\u2019re probably the best running shoes I\u2019ve owned.",
