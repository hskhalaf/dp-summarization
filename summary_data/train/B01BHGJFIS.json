      "text": "If you are familiar with the Spyder brand, then you will appreciate the quality of this jacket. It is the typical Spyder material - a thick cross between sweater and fleece. The lines of this jacket are very flattering - it is shaped at the waist and white piping accents the seams. I found this to run just slightly smaller than my other Spyder jackets but not enough to order a size up. But if you want to wear this over something heavier than a t-shirt or light top, then you might want to consider sizing up. But this is the excellent quality I have come to expect from Spyder.",
