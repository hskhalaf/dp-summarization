Quality of materials seems great. Looks like it can be cleaned thoroughly & easily. If it's installed and angled properly, I cant see why anyone would have issues with this seat. My kiddo always looks comfy & falls asleep with his head resting on the side padding. In & out is easier than his convertible car seat too and I have this installed in a truck, so that helps. UPDATE: This has really lived up to expectations and is holding up to our crazy now 2.5yr old very well.",

Things I like: Black color matches my interior. :) Same exact car seat means less fighting. 2 cupholders are nice, since they always put stuff in both. The big difference between this carseat and the more expenseive Graco's is that this one cant be turned into a backless booster. But by the time my kids will need that feature, these seats will be destroyed. And then I can just get a backless booster for $10-$20. All in all, this is a great product!",

If it worked, it would lift the seat about 1 inch. I've tried to stuff towels and sweaters behind/underneat the seat to help recline it but its always a struggle to set up properly.",

      "text": "I bought this one for my 3 year old because the other one we had was a little bulky and I got tired of removing it every time we had to switch cars. I wanted something that took less space and and still provided the same safety straps. This car seat is perfect for us, It was easy to install and it\u2019s easy to clean. My son loves it! And I got it for an amazing price. The only thing I would\u2019ve loved is being able to recline more for when he falls asleep. Other then that I would definitely recommend!",

The Graco Atlas 65 seemed like the best fit for what we were looking for. The arm/shoulder straps have plenty of slack available so your toddler doesn't have to contort themselves to get into the straps. We had a pull-straps to tighten him into our previous 2 car seats and this one does as well, but this one is by far the easiest to pull/tighten compared to the other two.",
