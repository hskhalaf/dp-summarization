This means that when it is fully pressed down, it won't fully cut the slices off; you'll need to manually pull/push the pieces to get that final skin cut. To me, I like this as I can back the corner off and the apple is still all connected which makes storing easy to avoid browning. If your expecting all the pieces to just fall apart after the cut, you might want to look for one where the core and arm blades are all the same depth.",

The pieces are extremely small and will eventually fall out. There are much worse things to be bothered about than that. My biggest complaint is that the corer isn't quite big enough for large apples. It gets most of the core, just not all. What's left on the slices is edible, the leftover core in some slices is a bit tougher (maybe 1-2 slices/large apple). It's also not very good with apples that aren't straight/flat/sits crooked). Overall it's a nice tool to have for quick slicing and coring; just not the perfect ool.",

It doesn't usually cut all the way through the very bottom of the apple (which is why I gave it a 4 out of 5), but I think that's a safety precaution.

Only complaint is it is not drawer friendly, as the wings are realy out there. But then, that's what makes it do it's thing.",

The handles are raised to assure ample clearance between your hands and the table. The OXO Good Grips Apple Divider is perfect for pies, cobbler or preparing a simple snack.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nOne second is all it takes to yield perfectly cut fruit slices with this tool by Oxo. Also a great tool for pears, the apple divider's soft, oversize rubber handles relieve and absorb the pressure from your hands for a nearly effortless cut.
