I don't notice any real change in my joints. The product has a difficult (strong) after taste, but I'm adjusting. I was using in a shaker at first, but I found it simply stirs in water. I use a minimal amount of water, so I can drink it down fast! It took almost one whole one to notice results. Now I'm on my fourth container and ordering more!",

I have already used one canister and have bought a second. I'm not sure if my facial sagging has improved, but I can definitely see a difference in the hardness of my nails. It did not take long before I saw that they are thickens ing a bit. I'm pleased with that as I have had thin nails my whole life. Jury is still out as to whether this will have an effect on the elasticity of my skin.",

The improvement in mobility and pain relief is nothing short of amazing. I have told everyone that will listen about this stuff. My husband started taking it after he noticed how the swelling in my hands has gone down. They look much better too. Instead of dry and scaly they look dewy and soft. I just sent my mother in law a can for her stiff shoulder and just ordered an 8 lb bag for home.",
