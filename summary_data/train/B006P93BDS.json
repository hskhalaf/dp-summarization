But the chemical stink from the material is unbearable - I can smell it several feet outside our guest bath at times. I bought two, somehow missing other reviews that mentioned this, so I basically threw $40+ in the trash. Oddly, they didn't smell too bad for me at first, but now that the stench is spreading, I'm past the return window. Big disappointment from a brand that I've otherwise had good experiences with. But it's now making me question the materials they use in all their items. Oxo, please fix this problem!",

      "text": "Love the concept. Looks nice and is easy to use. Unfortunately the plunger itself is cheap. Went to use it and the handle just pushed through the rubber portion - rubber tore in two places. We only actually used the thing a handful of times. I expected it to last a lot longer. Will be replacing with something else. Also unfortunate that you have to hold the bottom together in order to move the plunger from one location to another - just a function of how it releases. Wouldn't have been a deal breaker if the plunger lasted.",
