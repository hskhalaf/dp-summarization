I have multiple Soundtouch Bose devices which are supposed to work well together, but rarely do. Bottom line... if you are buying a single Bose system to produce great sound, you will enjoy. If you are trying to link multiple wifi based Bose systems as they promote, you will be severely disappointed.",

When it does work, it doesn't take long before it needs to be setup again, and there is no automated troubleshooting, basically you get an error code and a message to try again later. However, this product works fine in Bluetooth. Basically it's a high quality Bluetooth speaker with some presets that are activated manually.",
