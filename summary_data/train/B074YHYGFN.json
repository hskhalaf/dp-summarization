      "text": "Unfortunately, a couple months after buying this the leather started to peel away from the plastic shell and also started to deteriorate so badly that it appears to be melting. What's worse, the deteriorating leather works its way into the spaces between the volume buttons and causes them to stick. The back pockets are also peeling away from the shell...basically it's falling apart and it happened in a very short period of time. I know it's inexpensive and I didn't expect much, but for how rapidly this thing fell apart I would recommend buying something else and don't create the waste.",

Next, the biggest issue is that the pockets are actually too tight to use, so the added utility of the credit card pockets does not exits. If you want a case it is just fine, in fact I like it. But I bought this so I could occasionally go ultra minimalist and only carry my phone. On that front this case fails miserably.",

So far, it doesn't look like it will become loose anytime soon but that may change over time. I purchased the gray finish and it looks great. A co-worker of mine has one and it looked so great and I liked it so much that I purchased one the same day. It can be a pain to get a card in or out but not difficult and I am sure that will change once it gets wore in. I have no real cons here and you can't beat it for the price. I will definitely be purchasing other finishes.",
