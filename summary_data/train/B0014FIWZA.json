We used the small tray to store our fragile food like eggs and snacks the kids would frequently open the cooler for (so they wouldn\u2019t be digging around looking for them). We camped in August in Arkansas for 4 days and the cooler kept ice the entire time. On the third day, we added a small fresh bag of ice over the milk and the meat we hadn\u2019t cooked yet, but it was mainly as a precaution to keep it extra cold in that section of the cooler.",

By the 5th day i still have ice floating as i pull birds out to pack. I had one with shipping damage that Amazon replaced in 2 days. Better than settling for whatever stores happen to have in stock. Well worth the money, i wait for the sales paying $125 with no regrets!",
