    "description": "Style:Aluminum| Pattern Name:SingleMeguiar\u2019s Hot Rims Aluminum Wheel Cleaner is engineered specifically for uncoated aluminum and other delicate materials used in many aftermarket wheels. Ultra-safe and extra gentle, Hot Rims wheel cleaner is safe on uncoated polished aluminum wheels as well as anodized and powder-coated wheel surfaces. It\u2019s even safe on all brake components. Formulated with our Extreme Cling foam, it grabs the wheel surface to effectively and gently clean and remove brake dust and grime.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nMeguiar\u2019s Hot Rims Aluminum Wheel Cleaner is designed to be safe on all uncoated aluminum wheels and wash away filth with ease, leaving behind clean wheels. Its unique foaming solution, Xtreme Cling is designed to cling to vertical surfaces and break down stubborn road residue from metal.\n\nSafe for cleaning all uncoated aluminum wheels BEFORE CLEANING THE WHEELS\nKnow that there is a variety: The first step in wheel care is recognizing that not all wheels are made the same. Wheels are made from different types of materials and coatings. The product used on the wheels is determined by the surface which can range anywhere from chrome, powder coated, painted, to polished aluminum and many more. \n\nIdentify what it's driving on: The next step is to determine what kind of wheels owned. Most wheels that come with a factory-purchased vehicle are clear coated wheels. However if they have been replaced with aftermarket wheels, find out the surface material by contacting the manufacturer. Some wheels may even be coated with two or three different types of coatings, depending on how customized they are. \n\nCHOOSING THE RIGHT WHEEL CLEANER\nWhen using a wheel cleaner to remove brake dust and grime there are three products Meguiar\u2019s that are available for to choose from: Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims Aluminum Wheel Cleaner, Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims All Wheel and Tire Cleaner, and Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims Chrome Wheel Cleaner. Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims Aluminum Wheel Cleaner is safe for uncoated or polished aluminum, anodized and powder coated wheels. This is the safest Meguiar\u2019s wheel cleaner and is also recommended if you\u2019re unable to find out what the wheel type is. This is also the best product to choose if there are any type of aftermarket or high performance brakes since they are typically made of specialized components as well. Meguiar\u2019s Hot Rims All Wheel and Tire Cleaner is safe for all factory coated wheels.
