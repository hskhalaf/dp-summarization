      "text": "I purchased this shampoo for my Australian shepherd dog for itchy skin. He was always getting into the cattle water tank causing him to have a fungus (I guess). I took him to the vet and she gave him antibiotics but it helped very little. She also recommended a shampoo with chlorhexidine in it. I thought this winter it would get better because he would not be getting into the water tank but he still has problems. I used the shampoo but it hasn't helped much. I do like it as a regular shampoo for all my dogs, though.",
