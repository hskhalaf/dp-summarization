Although I haven't tested side by side or anything, my impression is that this is the best yet at getting all the stains off, leaving my teeth looking like I've just had them polished by my hygenist. I'm not sure why extra-whitening toothpastes always have extra-strong flavors. I can barely keep this one in my mouth for 2 minutes. If they toned it down a bit, it would be perfect.",
