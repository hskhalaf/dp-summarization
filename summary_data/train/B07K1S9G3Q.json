I still don't flush them, but at least I'm happy about not putting a ton of plastic into the landfill. Now, I just wish I knew the packaging itself was recyclable. I also appreciate that they make a fragrance free option. The only negative thing I would say is that the top flap doesn't stick very well and sometimes comes off. I just solve this problem by flipping the package upside down so that it stays closed and sealed up between use.",

The Kinder By Nature Wipes were thicker and stayed moist longer. Both had a natural/neutral smell which was also nice. Some \"natural\" wipes smell gross or have an added fragrance. Not what you want as a new Mom with a sensitive nose. These are more expensive than the average baby wipe but I believe they are worth the extra money. You can easily distinguish the ingredients and have peace of mind knowing what you are using on your baby's skin. Definitely recommend!",

When my son was first born, I bought Water Wipes, but found them to be too thin for my liking. The Kinder By Nature wipes are far superior in this regard, however, my one complaint is that the wipes tend to stick together when pulling them out of the package - this results in a big clump of wipes coming out at once. While this isn't enough the stop me from using the product, it is something that is a small annoyance during diaper changes.",

There is no way to pull a single wipe at a time with one hand. I usually have to pull out a whole stack, use two hands to separate 1 wipe from that stack, and then somehow shove the rest back into the small hole at the top of the package to prevent the rest of the wipe from drying out. It's a total pain.",
