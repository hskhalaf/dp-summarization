I don't wear belts, but it looks good in the photos with models wearing them, strappy heels, and jewelry. For smaller-busted women, I think it would look good with a strapless bandeau bra, even if it showed a little in the back. Excellent value and nicely made. Side seam pockets would take it to 5 stars for me.",

I\u2019m considering buying a couple of other colors because of its versatility in how & where I can wear this!

Fit will depend on your style and your chest/shoulders and height. I'm a short pear, with thicker lower legs. The small was the perfect size for my height and upper body, not too tight, but fit. Bottom of legs were fitted, but not too tight. I just felt that the baggy part hung out strangely and made me look like a weird diamond shape. If I would have gotten bigger, the baggy part would have hung to my ankles and looked even more strange.",
