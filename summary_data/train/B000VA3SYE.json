The PS3 is equipped with location free capability and remote play for my PSP, and all for just a little more than this LFBS!! I will be able to play and access A/V content from anywhere I can find an access point now. Maybe I'm missing something here, but doesn't the PS3 make this Location Free device obsolete?",
