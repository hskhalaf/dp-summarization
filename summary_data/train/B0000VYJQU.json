      "text": "I've used a 40G Smart disk with Firewire for several years and it works great. I needed a larger drive for my music collection and since I only have one FW port on my Mac G4 laptop I got this USB model. It just spins and chirps because it doesn't have enough power through the USB port. It would probably work great on any desktop or a more recent Mac laptop. The product is great and I recommend it otherwise. Also, their return policy is fast, easy and done online. UPS picked up the package the next day without question.",

From what I've read about other, cheaper external harddrives, I think I got a great deal and a winner. I transfer and delete everything from large .avi files to pictures, and it still works great.",

The speed was never a problem. I think the longest its taken was an hour to transfer around 50gb of files.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe \"drive for perfection\" is built into our line of FireLite portable external drives. Palm-sized, durable and stylish with outstanding performance and capacity, FireLite offers the ultimate in a convenient, highly portable data storage solution. FireLite combines the best features of today's hard drive designs in one attractive package. Quite simply, FireLite provides quality without compromise.\n\n Unique Magnesium Alloy housing\nFireLite's diminutive size and weight are made possible through the use of magnesium alloy for the drive's housing -- by weight, one of the strongest materials on the planet. Its thermal dissipation properties also help to wick away heat, increasing drive longevity. Hold it in your hand and you'll sense the aesthetic and functional advantages of a metal housing over plastic.\n\n No power cord needed\nBoth FireWire and USB 2.0 models are bus powered, meaning they can be powered directly through the FireWire or USB 2.0 cable used to connect them to your computer. For portability, this is the uost in convenience -- just plug it in and start using it! For configurations that do not supply sufficient cable power, FireLite can operate from an optional AC adapter.\n\n High performance\nFireLite's high performance hard drive mechanisms and electronics provide outstanding data transfer speeds with either FireWire or USB 2.0. For most software applications, you can use FireLite as an internal hard drive, then unplug it and take it with you when you're done!\n\n USB 2.0 or FireWire models\nFireLite hard drives are equipped with a USB 2.0 connection. USB models support USB 2.0 High Speed operation (up to 480 Mbps) and they will also work with USB 1.1 ports at slower transfer rates.\n\n Plug and Play\nFor recent Windows and Macintosh operating system releases, such as Windows XP, Windows 2000, Window Me, and Mac OS X, no driver installation is required. This is an enormous convenience when working with a \"borrowed\" computer; just plug in FireLite to maintain access to important data or transfer large amounts of data between computers.",
