I feel more comfortable knowing it\u2019s made by Samsung which is why I paid more for it then some cheaper off brands. I have to say it works well and I really like it. I also like that while charging at my desk that I can see the screen perfectly and even use it without taking it off the charger. The stand is well built and the quality materials are immediately evident. Wish list: Would like to see a 25W version like this for my new S20 Ultra",

If you have sensitive hearing and plan to keep this next to your bed I would suggest finding another charger.",

I bought this primarily as a secondary charging method for my Active2 and it will do that. From that perspective, it functions. Not worth the higher price, though, if you ask me. I kept it, though, because it is versatile.",

This one just came out and it is perfect. It even has a small LED that tells you if it is charging (red) and when it is complete (green). It's great to keep next to you on your desk so you can see the screen! Love it!",
