      "text": "The kit is useful and well thought out, but the quality control is poor. All of the edges on my hive tools had burrs and chips from machining. This is a big deal as they will be used for prying boxes open and I need the tool to easily slide between adjoining boxes without gouging the wood. I reached out to the seller to see about a replacement and never heard back. UPDATE: After my initial review the seller reached out and was able to replace the defective tools. The new tools were in excellent shape and works great. I\u2019m sure my experience was just an outlier and your kit will be a great value.",

      "text": "All tools should be adequately durable for beginning backyard beekeeping or as backup tools for the keeper. The smoker, however does not have an elevated frame base to keep the hot bottom surface off of ground or workbench. The lid fits well and the outside wire protection is strong. Includes a hanging hook. The bellows appear to be vinyl. The frame lifters and other tools are of a good quality. However, the brush bristles are really light/thin compared to the heavier brushes I have purchased and the top of the brush is a bit unfinished which will allow for accumulation of hive products.",
