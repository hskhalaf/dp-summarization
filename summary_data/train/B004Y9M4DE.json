The mascara IS totally waterproof and I can wear it to a water park with the kids and it doesn't flake or run, so they do get the job done. I just wish I could find a waterproof that makes my lashes as lush and full as the washable version.",

I have to use the Million Lashes first, then apply the Voluminous in order to have any volume. The brush is kind of odd also, it separates the lashes but because it is hard plastic it's difficult to work with, also is impossible on the lower lashes. I like a lot of things about this mascara, the formula just needs to give more volume. I won't buy again.",

I love this version instead of the waterproof because this one is way easier to remove so it\u2019s less stress on my lashes and it also lasts the day, but since my skin is a oilier than most it starts to flake by the time I\u2019m home ready to take it off but other than that it\u2019s a perfect everyday mascara for me.",

At night I take it off with coconut oil; removes easily with coconut oil. I have tried many, many, many mascaras. No raccoon eyes with this mascara. Stop looking and try this mascara. Would definitely recommend; I don't buy anything else.",
