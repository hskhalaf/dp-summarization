Setting the bottom and top vent correctly and using hardwood charcoal I was able to maintain a perfect 350 degrees while I smoked 3 chicken breasts. It took about 35 min to do. Make sure to mark the bottom vent with a sharpie. Writing half and open makes life a little easier. The absolute only downside is the legs. This is the only spot they went cheap on. If you're just moving it a little to cook then back there should be no issues. All in all I'm very happy",

A chimney with some lighter cubes or paper is so much easier. 15 minutes and the charcoal is ready to go. Even in 30ish degree temps it wasn't hard to get the temperature to 500+ and grill some great burgers or steaks (with some wood chips for some added flavor).",

Observation: Two 22\u201d grills give you 43% more grill area than one 26\u201d grill for only 21% more money than the cost of one-26\u201d grill. We have the 22\u201d and love it.

I\u2019m no chef, but I would put my food up against anyone\u2019s now that I\u2019ve been running the Weber Mastertouch.

But I have to say that, putting it together was absolute pain ! Getting those legs inserted into the connectors was tough - 'way-too-hard. The directions weren't entirely clear in showing how to assemble it, and took a while to figure-out. Also, there was a screw missing for the handle assembly; luckily, I found one in my tool kit that fit. Anyway, it was tough-going, and it took some shine off of owning this grill ...",
