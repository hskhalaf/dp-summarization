Although it helped some right when I sprayed it, the next day I'd be spraying again because the fleas were right back. So much for kills and repels. I tried for a couple of weeks thinking maybe it would slowly pare them down, but it never did. The dogs were miserable and so was I, so it was time to give up on \"all natural\" and solve the problem. Sprayed the same rooms and furniture with Adams and haven't had a problem since.",

After applying just once on my loveseat (remember to follow the instructions and stay away from the area for at least one hour), I stopped getting bites and irritations on my skin! Whatever was inside the furniture was killed by the spray. I'll definitely continue to use this spray on all my furniture and my carpets.",

The top, sides and the bottom of the box is wet with it, it actually reeks of the insecticide. Please let me know what can be done to rectify this?",
