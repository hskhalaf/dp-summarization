As usual it came in a classic Fossil tin. I did need to order an extra link because I like it to move on my wrist, but it's perfect! (Which can be ordered directly from Fossil. First 3 are free, just pay S&H)",

I would have love it for it to come in a different box, more elegant of something but it's ok. Update!: It's been a bit over 6 months and the color has faded a lil bit, like it's peeling. :( but the rihnestonea are good",

The band was extremely small, as if someone had removed links from it, and it was running.(nothing to keep the watch stem from being pushed in) I went online to see how to set it....filled directions- it would not keep time at all!! I was so disappointed!!! I loved the look of this watch and would have liked to kept it had it worked!!!",

      "text": "I love this watch. It came down to either this one or another semi similar that was a bit more basic. Decided on this one because of how much I liked it but I was needing a watch for everyday wear and I should've known better because I've already lost one of jewels. So now saving this for nights/weekends and just ordered the runner up for everyday wear :) Super excited to have both. Now just have to find somewhere to get the jewel replaced. Not sure if there was a warranty on this one.",
