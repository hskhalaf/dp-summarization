Delivery took a week, all of the pieces that we needed for assembly were neatly organized in clear bags with labels and assembly was very easy. It's very sturdy without looking bulky. There's a backing (for the shelf part) that comes with it but we decided not to assemble it with the furniture because we wanted to see through the shelf.",

This is a much better deal than going out to Walmart and getting some cheap cookie cutter tv stand out of cheap particle wood. Believe it or not, the particle wood? Here used is actually decent. I mean the slab Is pretty thick and solid. I have confidence it will hold and last for many years to come.",

This is the FIRST TIME in my LIFE I have ever gotten together a piece of furniture without swearing like a sailor. The quality is so damn good I'm never going near some POS from Target again and I'm so excited for the matching bookshelf to arrive next!!!",

The two compartments are perfect for everything, including a tidy place for remotes. It took under an hour to put together with the surprisingly easy to understand instructions.
