      "text": "I got this to assist my older German Shepard with getting in and out of the cab of my 4-wheel drive pickup. This step is super easy to use and doesn't weigh as much as the ramp I purchased. There is no set-up and it isn't awkward to use. It stores perfectly in either the cab or the bed of my pickup. And since I'm a bit height challenged, it also helps me get into the bed of my pickup. I would definitely recommend this step to others and would buy it again if I have another need for this two-step",

My 21' Rockwood Mini Lite only has one narrow pull out step and short handrail and I needed something to give a bit more stepping room when coming out of the camper. I put the camper step in and put this one up to the entry way. It worked out perfectly and is much safer going in and out of the camper. It feels strong and durable but lightweight enough to store in my pass-through compartment. I would highly recommend this step.",
