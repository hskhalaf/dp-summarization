I like the thickness because its easy on my joints in practice, but unfortunately makes A LOT of noise when I'm trying to change positions, which is disruptive during group practice. What's worse is it slides too much, which it shouldn't do. I decided I cannot use this in group classes and just use at home for stretching and planks.",

Also, the blocks and the yoga strap give you the ability to push yourself further or relieve stress on certain areas of the body. As for the towels, I haven't used them but they are nice and soft and people have suggested that you can put them underneath your butt to lift up your hips and create a better posture. The only downside to this product is that since the yoga mat is foam, indentions in the foam can be made very easily. Overall, I enjoy using this product and I highly suggest buying it.",

I'm also not a fan of the fact that the mat is easily punctured so be careful if you have pets or you want to try to use this outside. I also don't like that the mat stretches when used on top of carpet and doesn't fully shrink back when used regularly. I do really like the accessories that come with the mat.",

Lego men do go through the plastic covering into the foam, but don't use them in your Lego battles and you'll avoid that issue. Even with the imprints he uses the blocks daily and they are awesome.

The towels also have a lot of lint and irritate the skin when rubbed across to dry. Pretty much useless. Only the blocks in this set worked well. Might have to return this set, was really expecting better.",

Ended up returning the mat, for a full refund, with no problems from the seller.",
