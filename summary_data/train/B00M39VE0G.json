Don't let the Old Fashioned Container fool you, Nellie's is the real deal. You only need a tablespoon to do the job, there is no heavy fragrance lingering for days (sorry ladies you will have to find another way to mark your men), and it works to clean my carpets, my dishwasher, and my car! This is a wonderful and convenient product, Thanks Nellie's!",

We use both cloth and disposable and sometimes I forget to wash our diapers for a few days...In fact, sometimes the terrible smell in the laundry room is what reminds me to wash them...Anyways, even when the diapers have been sitting for a few days, the diapers come out so clean and NEVER smell!!",

For extra stinky clothes (ie. my boyfriend's sweaty work clothes), I add 1-1/2 spoonfuls. I'm still using way less than most liquid detergents and I'm extremely happy to have made the switch to an environmentally safe and non-toxic detergent. I'll never go back!",

I am normally very sensitive to heavy, perfumed laundry detergents, so I was very happy with the mild scent of Nellie's Laundry Soda. As a plus, you get a cute little reusable tin!",
