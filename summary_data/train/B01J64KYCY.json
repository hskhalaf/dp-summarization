      "text": "Seems odd that Light Weight would be a review item on an anchor. Aaaanyways, this is a beautifully packaged design. The padded bag is a great feature as it keeps the anchor from making a ton of racket in the boat. There is a lock ring that keeps the anchor prongs open or closed. I found that only opening one or two would allow me to slowly drift and fish longer runs. The rope is soft and definitely strong enough for the task. The thickness makes it easy to weigh anchor.",
