Definitely on the hard side of the medicine ball spectrum; if you're looking for something softer go elsewhere. I should note a minor complaint: It's a bit larger than some other brands I've seen in stores. Maybe that's a feature for some people but it seems just a bit too bulky to me, especially at the 15lb level. Not enough of an issue for me to deduct a star, but worth mentioning.",

This ball demands respect - the longer one holds it, the heavier the ball seems to get. Just try walking around the block with it! Great wrist workout among other things. Takes air like a basketball, bounces like an evil one, watch your toes! Box arrived in great condition, ball was securely packed.",
