We were using the Costco branded chicken flavor dog food before this, so that was a bit cheaper per serving but they do not make a senior diet formula so onto Purina One we go. This style of food has chunks of chicken and smaller kibble than the Costco food so that suits my little 15 pound dog a bit better. My Wife is a Vet Tech and she says this is one of the better mass foods out there, even better than the non prescription brands her hospital sells. I trust her expertise so my two older dogs feast on Purina One Senior Formula.",

The value is also decent but we're feeding 25 collective pounds of dogs here so you'll want to buy the small size to see if your furry friends like it and adjust accordingly.
