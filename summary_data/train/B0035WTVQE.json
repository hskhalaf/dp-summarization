      "text": "I have owned a Fujifilm F70EXR 10MP camera for several years. I carry it with me all the time. I bought a second one as a backup because its photos are so sharp and the camera is so user friendly. After years of heavy use the zoom feature began to fail, understandably so. In attempting to purchase another copy of the same camera, I came across the F80EXR with two additional megapixels. It is almost identical. I tried to find a new model of a point-and-shoot camera with comparable resolution and was unable to do so for less than $400. Therefore I knew from experience that this camera would fill the bill.",

      "text": "This camera has not given me the quality pictures I expected. I purchased it a couple of years ago after my Pentax broke. I am the photographer for a couple of organizations. With my Pentax I never had to worry about getting excellent photos. Perhaps I need to study the lengthy booklet more in order to get better results. In my opinion the settings dial is a real glitch. The dial often moves without my knowledge as it is too sensitive. I noticed other reviewers said the same thing but I did not understand until I purchased this camera. It is truly a problem. I would not highly recommend this camera",

I love the large viewing screen and wide selection of types of photos you can produce is amazing. It does more than my husband's $700+ Canon SLR Digital. I became interested in it because a friend had the F70 model and her photos were very impressive and the size and weight were perfect for me as I don't want to lug around a heavy camera or even one that has to hang around my neck.",

    "title": "Fujifilm FinePix F80EXR 12 MP Super CCD EXR Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD",
    "description": "Fujifilm FinePix F80EXR - 12MP Super CCD EXR, Fujinon Super EBC 10x Wide Optical Zoom (28 - 280mm), 3.0\" High Contrast LCD. Other features include: Face Detection w/ Red Eye Removal, Face Recognition, Pet Detection, Tracking Auto Focus, Dual Image Stabilization, Multi-Frame Technology, High Sensitivity 3200 ISO, 6 Scene - SR Auto Automatic Scene Recognition, Smile/Blink Detection Mode, HD Movie 720p w/ Sound - HDMI Connector, Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n The FinePix F80EXR is a sleek, compact digital camera that combines intuitive use with the most advanced features, including Fujifilm's award-winning EXR technology. Among its many features, the FinePix F80EXR has an impressive Fujinon 10x wide-angle optical zoom lens, a 12-megapixel Super CCD EXR sensor, a large, 3.0-inch high-contrast LCD, Face Recognition, Pet Detection and HD movie capture at 720p. \n\nEncased in a beautifully sculpted metal shell with a double coated lacquer finish and measuring only 22.9 mm thick, the FinePix F80EXR comes in black The FinePix F80 EXR offers several enhancements over its predecessor, the FinePix F70EXR, and boasts marked improvements over competing long-zoom digital cameras, particularly in the areas of color and design, image quality and capture technology. \n\nFinePix F80EXR Highlights \n\n\n\nFace Recognition\nNow, users can register up to eight (8) faces, along with names, birthdays and categories, and the F80EXR will prioritize focus and exposure right on the faces of those special people. Users can also use Image Search to view images of a registered person. Compared to models from other manufacturers, Fujifilm's Face Recognition has faster recognition speed, greater number of names displayed, and the ability to recall the most often shot subject. \n\nSuper CCD EXR\nLong zoom compact cameras, as opposed to standard compact digital cameras, typically use a smaller sensor that is vulnerable to difficult lighting conditions since light has a harder time reaching the CCD sensor. To mitigate this vulnerability, Fujifilm has introduced its award-winning EXR technology into the FinePix F80EXR, allowing for significant improvement in image quality against the competition. \n\nFujifilm's EXR technology uses the human eye as the basis for the perfect camera sensor, creating a Super CCD sensor capable of registering excellent levels of detail when switched to its HR (High Resolution) mode. The FinePix F80EXR is also capable of offering excellent quality in low light and superb highlight detail in contrast light when switched to its SN (High Sensitivity and Low Noise) mode and DR (Wide Dynamic Range) modes respectively. \n\nSuper Slim 10x Zoom Lens \nIn conjunction with the Super CCD EXR sensor, the FinePix F80EXR features a Fujinon 10x Wide-Angle optical zoom lens that produces crisp high resolution results throughout the focal range, from 27mm wide-angle to 270mm telephoto. The lens of the FinePix F80EXR features Super EBC Coating that keeps ghosting and flare to minimum to allow for optimal picture quality. \n\n10x optical zoom in action. \n\n\nPet Detection\nFor those who enjoy the company of four-legged friends, the F80EXR has Pet Detection, allowing users the ability to detect up to 10 faces of dogs or cats and automatically optimize the focus. The F80EXR is programmed to recognize 57% of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cyno Logique Internationale (FCI) Registered Dogs, 80% of the Top 20 Dogs in the American Kennel Club (AKC) Ranking and 60% of The Cat Fancier's Association (CFA) breeds. Pet Detection works by matching various dog or cat data of facial parts with patterns to detect the dog or cat being photographed. \n\nHD Movie Capture\nWith the ability to capture movies in HD quality--720p HD--the F80EXR also has a micro HDMI Port, making it quick and easy for users to realize the full benefits of their home theater system and to share all their special moments. \n\nTracking Auto Focus\nThe F80EXR also has Tracking Auto Focus, which allows users to track a moving subject automatically for still picture capture. \n\nAdditional Features  * 'Super Intelligent' Flash: The FinePix F80EXR offers a flash control system which efficiently controls the level of flash for a given exposure to produce beautifully balanced flash illumination across the foreground and background. Gone are the ugly washout shots where the subject is blasted with light and the background dark and unexposed. Super Intelligent Flash is most useful in macro photography where the contrast between subject and background can be especially challenging, but is also effective for night and backlit photography. \n * Face Detection and Automatic Red-eye Removal: To provide perfectly exposed and focused portrait shots, the FinePix F80EXR is fitted with Fujifilm's latest Face Detection technology which is able to track up to 10 faces simultaneously, at almost any angle to the camera. The system instantly corrects red-eye and then saves both the original and the corrected image file automatically. \n * Dual Stabilization: Long-zoom cameras need stabilization more than any other compact, with handshake and subject movement a particular problem in low light at telephoto range. The FinePix F80EXR reduces blur to a minimum by deploying Picture Stabilization to automatically increase shutter speeds to freeze action, and CCD Sensor Shift Stabilization to counteract the problems of handshake. By cleverly combining these two, blur is reduced to an absolute minimum. \n * 3.0-inch High-Contrast LCD: The FinePix F80EXR is fitted with a high contrast 230K-pixel 3.0-inch LCD. The high contrast LCD is a considerable benefit in bright light, and means that the camera can be pitched at various shooting angles to enable framing of awkward shots. Viewable at 160 degrees both vertically and horizontally, the LCD is bright and clear for beautiful rendition of shots in playback. \n\nEnjoy blur-free images with Dual Image Stabilization",
