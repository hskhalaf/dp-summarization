Water spread a tad more on Amazon brand. Poured 1/4 cup of water and spread was same, but water leaked through the Wal-Mart pad. Amazon pad did not leak. My vote is for the Amazon brand. We have an older pug, a finicky Chihuahua, and a 25 pd spaniel mix with our manners. The pads are used everyday, so cost and effectiveness are important.",

They are not the thickest pad I have bought but they do not leak. More important than thickness to me is how the pad curbs the flow of urine. Some like the Allmax are thicker pads but the urine spreads out too much and it will reach the dog's paws before she is done. The Amazon pads inhibit the spreading better which for me is a big plus. Highly recommended. I hope this review helps a little in making your decision!",

I've been buying Walgreens brand Pet Shoppe for my boys 7 & 9 y/o Poms consistently. Their price in the beginning was $5.99 for 50. Now, wait for sale price of $9.99. These are exactly the same (lighter blue) with approximately .4in extra on all outer edges. Inset same size. With the convience of my Amazon Prime, I am going to now order their pp pads Right Here. Thanks Amazon Prime. You guys are really doing a great job and your CSR's work very hard to make a happy customer.",

Maybe the first few were defective; but since then, I've had no trouble. You can see in the first picture the urine spot. I lifted the pad to expose the floor underneath so you can see the dry floor that was beneath that pad. I'm happy to report that Sophie has learned how to use the pads - they really do work. I just purchased a second box also.",

I've found them handy to have around, even if it isn't for the dog. Pros: - Amazon Guarantee - Product Quality - Competitive Pricing Cons: - You still have to clean up after your dog",
