After a month of use, this flash does not dissapoint, especially for the price. Very powerful. The batteries last quite awhile and the recharge is pretty fast enough for my needs. I primarily use this flash for Macro work with a LumiQuest soft box. The combo works great. It is a big flash, so be aware before purchasing. Doesn't bother me, but might for others. I am a happy customer.",

Incredible buy. 8/2/20: Just died today. Could not even do a test flash. At least my older Neewer TT560 lasted 3 years. Sadly, this one lasted only three months. Time to go back to major brands or higher priced Neewer products.",

I wanted simple and low cost making this a great value and was surprised how quickly it recharged between cycles. I cannot justify spending a hundred or more at this time on a flash unit until I get better acquainted with my camera system. Think any beginner or budget minded person is getting a bargain with this unit.",

I purchased it with a$10 filter set i got as well. The value for the price is awesome. It takes 4 Double A batteries and lasted for 6 hours while I was shootin a proposal. It probably would hav e last longer had I needed it. I also took about 300+ pictures as well. Love it.",
