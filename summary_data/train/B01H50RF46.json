Also, the zipper color is more maroon than pink which is what I prefer. However, I wish the company made an all black version (like the men's style) since not all women like pink/red colors",

She is a medium in most women's tops and this fits snug, which is perfect - enough room for a long sleeve tee shirt underneath or tight with a sweatshirt underneath, but room to put a sweatshirt or jacket over top too. We found it works best with a tee shirt, then vest - keeps the heat closer to the skin than putting over a sweatshirt. This works great and gives her plenty of warmth to last several hours.",

I am always cold and it takes me a very long time to warm up once I get really chilled. So, when two of my boys decided to do football this year I knew I needed something to help keep me warm. This helped tremendously! It warms your entire back all the way up to the neck as well as the front pockets. Now I just need heated pants!\ud83d\ude09 For me, it has definitely been worth the cost. It will be great for the start of soccer season too.",

One thing to note is that the logo is a bright light when its turned on. It feels conspicuous, but I'm getting used to it. We bought one for my mother-in-law too. She likes it too. I would recommend this vest.",

      "text": "I love the overall feel of the vest. It is lightweight. I have two issues with the vest. The first is that the cord does come out of the battery pack. When I put the battery/cord together and insert into the pouch it inevitably comes out. Now when I go outside to feed horses it comes out again. This is a drag. Secondly, the fit around the hip area is too tight with a sweater. I am 5'4\" and 115 pounds. If I put layers on this vest doesn't work. I'd opt for something else if given the chance.",

I need to press it to make sure the battery pack is connected before turning it on. But otherwise, awesome buy.",

With a fully charged battery, it would only work for 4-5 hours on low. Not the described 10 hours. The seller had us return all the batteries except for the last one sent out. Expect to order an extra $70 battery to achieve the described run times.",
