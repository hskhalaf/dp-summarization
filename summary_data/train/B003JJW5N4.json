The downsides I see are that some of the paddles have rough handles- as if they weren't sanded well enough in the factory (so we had to sand them ourselves), and the handles also seem about 1/2 inch to an inch shorter than others we have played with, which has given a few of us blisters where the end of the handle dug into our hands after playing for an hour. Not bad, but not the best ever. Ping pong balls are standard and I have no complaints about those!",

At the time I ordered them they were only $12.35 for 4 paddles and 3 balls. As usual you get what you pay for (and inexpensively made set). I will suggest that you spend a little more and buy the better quality model STIGA Performance Table Tennis Set (ASIN: B00345XX5W). They are currently $29.99 for a set of 4 paddles and 6 balls. Stiga's customer service is second to none, if you have a problem they will make it right, and that is why I am giving them a 5-star rating.",
