Duck is similar to canvas, very durable, heavyweight cotton but it is a little thinner and easier to sew securely closed. The colors are deep and rich. The bags are durable and have already survived a cornhole tournament and several family gatherings. Good product.",

This isn't a flaw of the product, but merely a fact about the composition. I speak from experience as two of my cornhole bags were left out during a rain shower and discovered several days later. The bags had started to smell from the wet corn. Love these things and like the fact they come in many different colors!",
