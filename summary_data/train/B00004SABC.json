At 12x it was hard to focus and this did not pull enough light so everything was dark. During the day it works great but then you still have shaking issues. I think at 12x you really need to start looking at binoculars with image stabilizers. All in all this product is solid, can take drops, and does its purpose. My only issue is that it is very hard to focus.",

Also, the 8x is about right, the 10x are a bit jittery. Very convenient to use, just pull out of the pouch, no lens caps to deal with.

They are well built though and surely have a long lifetime. Somehow focus seems to drift out of view although this is a minor problem really.

      "text": "I got this as a present but we both use it on hikes. It is great for seeing birds very far away in the distance. The images are clear and it's easy to use the rotating knobs for focusing. It comes in a soft, thick casing that protects it. It also has a string that can be looped around your neck. The string is sort of thin, but very sturdy and durable. Wish it was a bit thicker or had padding for the neck area, but this would make it more bulkier. So if you are looking for a small and lightweight pair of binoculars in a compact protective case, this does the job very well.",

The magnification and clarity met my expectations. I recommend these.",

My grandson wants to use them to look at birds and wildlife. They are powerful, but the nicest factor is that they are so lightweight when hanging around your neck. No one wants a dead weight! The case is very lightweight which is all that we wanted, so if you want something more substantial you might want to purchase a different case, for example an inexpensive camera case. The case doesn't detract enough from the quality of the binoculars to warrant a lower star level.",

I ended up using a pair of 8x21 Tasco cheapies that have a much clearer image than these. The 2x extra magnification doesn't do any good since the image is so bad. I don't know if mine are defective or if it is just the quality of the binocs. They are also much bigger than I expected, but still very compact. I will definitely be returning these. We'll call the 1 star rating for the compactness and look & feel of these.",

The only con I can mention is the internal reflection under certain lighting conditions. It can be severe, but easy to eliminate by shifting position. Magnification is high enough to make a difference, but low enough to steady these light binoculars by hand. I use them at shows as they are discreet and keep them in my bag on my bike.",

The dial that allows you to focus the right eye is very loose, and requires constant adjustment. Yes, they were cheap... but what is the point if you can hardly use them?",

Frankly with anything that is greater than 12x 32 I expected it to be shaky and grainy so I am not to disappointed. Nonetheless, there is a reason this one costs about $30 and the mid to high end ones cost $400 plus.... so given the price, its a great carry along for hikes. I have another powerview which is 7x and it is much clearer...albeit doesn't focus in as much.

On the plus side, it is small and fits in my purse.
