They have been run continually for 12 hours, seven days a week throughout last summer and this summer and have never had one problem. This fan can be mounted or propped on the floor. It\u2019s three levels of power are helpful as you can use the fan in various settings. If you need a heavy duty industrial fan, this is the one to buy. I am completely satisfied with this purchase.",
