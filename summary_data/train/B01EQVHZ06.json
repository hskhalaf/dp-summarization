It's not heavy on the feet and legs if you know what I mean. It's white so I put it inside a duvet cover. As far as the sound other reviewers spoke of, I guess. It doesn't bother me and I don't hear the ruffling sound really. It might be because I have it in a cover? I would recommend it.",

      "text": "We bought this duvet a few months ago, and at first it fit nicely into our queen sized duvet cover. But gradually over the weeks the duvet has obviously compacted in on itself and shrunk considerably. The duvet is now much too small for the duvet cover, creating all of this extra fabric around the top that annoys us immensely. If my return window hadn't passed while I was distracted by other things, I would return it now.",
