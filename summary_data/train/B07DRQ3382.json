She really enjoyed the process and is already talking about needing a full garden. Out of the two types of seeds she planted, only one of them grew. Well, about 2 of the 8 seeds actually sprouted in total. But we are both excited for this process and enjoy watching how rapidly it grows in our kitchen window.",

Giving them the benefit of the doubt going to try it there way with half seeds if they don't work out I've already started watching videos for the second round.
