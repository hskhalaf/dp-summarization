When I blow dry and use a straightener, it feels like silk and is virtually frizz free. I don't like using a lot of heat on my hair, so this product is great for my air drying needs as well. I have used it in the past and tried out other products but always end up coming back to this. It just works.",

It does not help with frizz and smooth out your hair, it turns your hair into an even worse texture than what you started with. It flattens the bulk of the hair out while increasing the frizz. It's terrible. I have medium coarse hair which is what it is supposed to address. The seller must know this, as the product is non-refundable. It arrived with weird tape on it to hold it closed and not in a box. So maybe the issues are it due to being old. I don't know. Buyer beware.",

Since I have long and thick hair it takes 4-5 pumps applied to the wet hair and then blow dry. I straighten after some time and my hair stays shiny super straight and frizz free for 3 days. I stock up on this serum in case I run out \ud83d\ude00 !! I would recommend this to all who are looking to get the hair frizz free and straight for cheap.",
