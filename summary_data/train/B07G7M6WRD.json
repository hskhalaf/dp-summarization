The machine is very easy to use and no sticky at all, no messy after use and simply rinse with water. I owned an old one and waste a lot of pancake mix because the cooking plate is not deep enough. This one is perfect. The 3 different tray are able to switch depends on what my kids like at the day. definitely love it.",
