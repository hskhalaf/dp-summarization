I LOVE LOVE LOVE the kid setting. It plays a video of a dancing clown in the front and helped me get some great shots of my nephew. The beauty setting isn't too shabby either :)",

I am very... no, extremely happy with it, great purchase! This camera has it all, is light, thin, is easy to use, it totally touch screen driven, great features like multiple face recognition, smile shoot, effects for different situations, HD video recording is awesome and one of the nicer ones is that small LCD screen in the front that allows you to shoot a perfect photo of yourself! With the other cameras this is difficult because you don't actually see the shooting view. I recommend it :)",

The front LCD makes taking self shots a breeze and the touch screen controls are idiot proof. The TL220 takes great pictures in all conditions and the video is impressive for a camera also. I doubt you will find one for 79 bucks like I did but even at 200 these are a deal.",

While accessing your pictures it has a swipe feature to go to the next picture or you can just tilt the camera and it will take you to the next picture. If you need to rotate a picture just swipe which way and the picture will rotate. For a 12 MP camera its very good. Con: Don't drop it! The camera was once dropped from 2 ft. and now the optical zoom has issues sometimes. I was still under warranty so I was able to get a new camera.",

I especially like the option where the camera automatically picks up on the surroundings to take the best quality picture. It just takes awhile to take the picture when you push the button. I prefer a faster rate, but for all the options and i love the dual screen, it's still a good camera. The front screen is a little hard to turn on. You actually have to tap it pretty hard in order for it to turn on which makes me nervous I'm going to break the front screen.",
