The parts are packaged securely and are well labeled, the instructions are simple and clear, and no tools were required. For the same price you'd pay for a beat up used TV stand from a thrift store this is a real bargain.",

Instructions included, but it's so easy you could figure it out even without them. Box had a couple dings/scuffs, but the stand was well packaged and arrived with no damage. On sale for $26.99 this was a great value! Of course, would also work well as a TV stand. Perfect if you are looking for a simple, but good looking stand for a smaller TV. Rated for up to 32\" TV but could probably go up to 40\".",

It's excellent for people who constantly move like myself since it's very easy to assemble/disassemble and is not very bulky. I recently lost the feet to these TV stands and contacted their support. There was no hassle and they quickly provided me replacements free of charge. Definitely a great product and a company to back it up.",

It took me 5 minutes to assemble the whole thing. No allen wrench, or wierd teeth plastic peices. The whole thing is basically just giant screw on tubes you do by hand. If you don\u2019t want to spend an afternoon putting together a TV stand, and want something sturdy enough for a tv and some consoles, this one is a great buy.",

The only parts that are lower quality and cheaply made are the end caps on top of the unit and the little feet on the bottom. It is very easy and quick to assemble even for 1 person. The wood shelves are true black, not a black/brown. Don't put anything at the back of the bottom shelf. It is quite difficult to reach.",

I have my 39 inch TV on top room for my digital cable adaptor and stream box, my VCR/DVD player in the middle and on the bottom silver radio which matches it. It looks great put together in 5 minutes. Adds a nice touch to bedroom. The only negative which is not a big deal the wires in the back are visible for your TV. cable etc but it looks really nice so glad I got it great for the price.",

That being said, I wouldn't put a TV much larger than 37 inches on this particular model. The stand was very easy to put together, and I had no issues following directions. The multi-level shelves are a nice option for storage. I compared it to many other TV stands, and I think that this may be the best quality for this price. It's not the most attractive thing in the world, but it was a good deal and I'm ultimately pleased with this purchase.",
