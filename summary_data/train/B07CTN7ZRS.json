It has a mesh upper that not only keeps the foot fresh and comfortable but also trendy enough to complement a variety of outfits. Whether a casual or sporty outfit, it can match and create a statement.\u00a0Just one note to incoming buyers, they may have to order at least a half size larger since it was reported to fit narrow and run small. In doing so, a comfortable fit can be secured.",

It takes several minutes for me to wear this and also if I have thick socks it is really difficult for me to put in to the shoes. After wearing for more than 3 months, I realized that because of the pressure I put on the shoes (since i need to press hard while putting in), the back side of the shoes has started to torn out. Hugely disappointed with the product. The only thing I like about it is it still looks nice from outside when I wear it.",
