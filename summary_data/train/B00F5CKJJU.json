After seeing (on This Old House) just how insanely fast a room can go up in flames (a mere 10-15 seconds!) I realized that I needed to get a REAL extinquisher ASAP. So I asked my cousin, who's a firefighter, what type and size I should have for my one bedroom apartment. He said \"5 pound Class ABC extinguisher\". That's what THIS is. I placed it centrally in my apartment and now I feel much more at ease.",

Sturdy metal handle /trigger, no need to worry about it breaking like with cheaper products constructed of plastic. I also like the fact that it is refillable. I'd like to get out and practice with this, but will have to find out where I can have it refilled first. Many thanks to the poster who recommended this product over the less expensive plastic-handled fire extinguishers.

Cheap fire extinguishers with plastic valves aren't rechargeable. When they lose their pressure you have to toss them. This fire extinguisher arrived fully pressurized and in excellent condition. Comes with a metal hook (for wall hanging if desired). Some upgrades are totally worth it. :) Consider what this item is intended to protect - you, your family, and your property.

We wondered if it could be broken without tools in time of crisis. On closer inspection, it seems intentionally breakable. The box it was shipped in arrived with corner holes and significant damage. There wasn't much packing material within the box, so the heavy metal items within, combined with open space, really challenged the cardboard.",
