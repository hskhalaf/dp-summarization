So far it has withstood multiple dings on everything from metal to wood, has been submerged in the ocean for extended periods and withstood extreme tempreratures. The sapphire glass is definitely worth getting for a battery powered watch at this point, the inclusion of actual maps on only the 5x is a bit of a disappointment but for my wrist I am most comfortable with the 5s size. The quick change bands are nice but a bit on the expensive side for a piece of rubber. Overall I am pleased with the watch and it functionality.",

Moreover, as soon as I put a chest strap midway through the workout, the HR goes up to 150 BPS.

This one is at a reasonable price now, has a neat display, style and perfect size. Not too big nor tiny defying the whole purpose of a sports watch.

The gps is great i have used it for hunting and long multi day hikes. The only thing thst is a little off is the heart rate monitor i runs a little high for my activities and low for resting unless you use chest strap monitering. For people with large wrist the saphire looks great for smaller men and women it may feel large/ bulky.",

They can both be found on Amazon. 13 days of battery life at least with some to spare. I use the watch for time, date and reading texts. I do not use the maps, or many of the other features.",

You can also use it as a navigator by loading maps which may need some tinkering, if its outside the USA. The battery lasts for more than 10 days with my GPS usage and general use, so you are never stressed to charge it. If you can splurge the $, go for it you won't regret it .",
