I assumed that it had simply lost it's charge so I tried to recharge it and so I could use it again, once it showed that it was fully charged I unplugged it and tried to use it to light a candle, it didn't work and instead I noticed that the handle had become warm and soon smoke started to come out of the charging port. And some of the plastic had melted a bit. I threw it away once it had cooled down.",

It works great in the wind although, if it's too windy, it lights a candle but the wind blows out the flame (not the product's fault. Blame the wind). I minus a half star because if you're trying to light a candle and the wick is embedded in the cold wax this will not work. Since there is no flame to melt the wax surrounding the wick it cannot light it. I needed to use an old fashioned flame stick. While this isn't a design flaw, it's an annoyance.",
