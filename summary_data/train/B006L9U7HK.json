Shows small spots where the light spots through the green. That's a quality issue. Second, the stem is kind of cheap. Just a piece of thin hollow tube that's not very well plated. It screws into the base and I had some problems getting it started, and as careful as I was I'm pretty sure I cross threaded it. Still, it works and isn't terrible but if you're looking for high quality I'd say keep looking.",

The pull cable feels great and the mounting screw portion doesn't feel as Chinesium as similarly priced items. I'll upload pictures when the office theme is complete! I paired it with a 3000k (amber/yellow) LED and leave the light on through the workday. The spikes in power effecting other lights doesn't effect this lamp with the LED bulb. A regular size bulb will fit this without sticking out the lamp.",
