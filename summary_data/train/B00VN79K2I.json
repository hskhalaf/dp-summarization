About to order another bottle soon. I also use it on my face at night especially under and around my eyes as a moisturizer. I hope Amazon never runs out.",

I apply the castor oil to my eyelashes every night after removing my makeup. I have noticed a HUGE change! I have thicker, longer, and healthier eyelashes! I'm not dealing with eyelashes continuously falling out when I remove my eye makeup. Amazing! My hands are extremely dry, especially at night. This product is the only thing that keeps them from hurting at night. Thank you!!!",

My hair is easier to manage and moisture for my ends when I twist and style my hair. My face is smoother and glowing. I will definitely be keeping this castor oil on stock as a staple for my skincare and hair regimens.",

So if you're looking for a natural healthy oil to help your hair grow and keep your skin smooth, buy this now!!!",
