      "text": "these sandals seem adequate for the gym, which is why i purchased them, however they are rather stiff and probably not your lounging type of sandal. More importantly, for potential buyers with moderate to fairly wide feet, it should be noted that these flip flops are narrow. Due to their rigidity and stiffness of the plastic material of which they are constructed, there is no possibility for wearing them in or achieving expansion. They are narrow enough where going up a size will likely not work for you if you have significantly wide feet. In sum, they run narrow and thus i had to return 'em. Hope this helps....",

They fit exactly right, and they are actually better than the Adidas I used to have, meaning, these dry super quickly. The old Adidas, for which I paid around $30, stayed wet most of the time, they cracked, the color went away after a couple of months, and bottomline, it was a waste of my money. These are perfect. Again, all I need this is for the shower. They are very comfortable and the price is great. Get them!",

Since the top strap is molded into the shoe, I don't see if ever breaking. My ONLY complaint is that the US Size 13 shoe was a little bit too small--slightly short, and slightly tight. Too small for me to want to wear them regularly for their intended purpose. I wish they made a 14! However, the customer service was so good and responsive, that I give this product 5 stars regardless. Just be sure to order up if you have any questions (and you don't have a size 13 foot)!",

The inner and bottom texture is good to prevent slips, and kind of feels like one of those nubby massage balls. Opted for the blue because black is boring - it's a good, dark, cornflower blue. The center toe-thong is fine. I don't usually like them, but in this case I feel like it helps them stay on and prevent slipping.",

      "text": "These sandals were cheap and relatively comfortable. The fit is pretty accurate and they serve their purpose in dorm / gym-like settings. The design doesn't drain water water very effectively, so I sort of wish they either had raised bumps or some holes so you're feet wouldn't squish around after you've left the shower area. All-in-all not a bad buy for the price.",
