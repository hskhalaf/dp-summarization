Picture darkened a bit, but that's expected for a home system, but when you're into the movie, you don't think about it. Comes in a cute box, with a soft cloth bag, lens cleaning cloth and USB cable that you plug into your own power source. I'll be ordering a few more.",

The True Depth worked okay and the 3D was what I would refer to as good. Then I tried the pair I bought my wife and was blown away at how much better they are. The Ultra Clear provide a much better 3D experience as far as picture quality goes. Secondly, the build quality is superior. And lastly, I just think they are far more comfortable to wear. Also, they block out most of the light surrounding the eye making the movie experience much more immersive.",

Typically with my old pair I would have to increase the brightness of my display to compensate for the added darkness of the glasses but with these no adjustments need to be made. The only downside to these is there is no button to invert the lenses so sometimes I will have to do that through my projectors menu when activating 3D but that's not really a big deal. All in all I'm very happy with these and will buy again if ever needed.",

I was a little reluctant to buy these because I've never heard of the brand, have never seen 3D outside of the theater and had very low expectations of how it would look using a DLP projector (Optoma HD141X). Extremely surprised at how great the effect was. No regrets. For reference - fixed screen size is 120 inches, 13 ft cast. 3D image looks good with or without blackout curtains. The glasses seem very well constructed, charge via a powered USB port, have everything you need in the box. Have watched several movies without needing a recharge. Interested to see how long the battery lasts.",

Not only do they lose sync, but they discolour the whole image to a nauseating degree before doing so. They're also front-heavy, and are uncomfortable after an hour or so. I was able to slightly improve the sync problem by covering part of the sensor with electrical tape, but this wasn't enough to completely resolve the problem. I'd recommend the Optoma ZD302 instead. Much lighter, and rock-solid sync.",

Worked really well with Benq HT1075, syncing once in 3D is instant once you hit power button and the glasses were fully charged in about an hour. No ghosting, lose of sync, no yellow or red tint and they reserve brightness very well with no issues. For $25, I believe these are the best DLP 3D glasses available, if you have a DLP 3D projector, buy these now.",

The 3D image was perfect and striking! They are well constructed, durable, comfortable and priced right. I just ordered four more pairs of these glasses today....",

Also, one charge seems to last through several movies, but its a good idea to charge them once a month or so even if you're not using them to maintain the battery.",

I had to replace my white SainSonic 3D glasses which were worthless - they stopped working because if you don't use them regularly they just die! These glasses at least have instructions that mention that you need to use and charge them once a month. Which is a pain for people who don't watch 3D movies once a month, but I guess that's as far as 3D DLP technology has come. They're not uncomfortable. My main complaint is the little rubber cover over the USB charger port. It's tough to open.",
