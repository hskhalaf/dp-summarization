I found another fill valve behind the zipper that was not closed. There is a check valve, so the tube deflated very slowly. However, the leak was enough to cause concern and for me to consider returning it. I have since closed the valve and am pretty sure this is why so many reviewers mention leaking. The tube is really great. If you buy one, however, make sure the secondary fill valve is closed and secured.",
