      "title": "Great workspace PC! Be aware of the dual display requirements.",
      "text": "This is a great little machine! I bought 5 of these for our data entry team. There is no wireless, and expandability would be a challenge if you're looking to add internal hardware. The only challenge I had with these PCs is that they do support dual displays, but one is your standard VGA port and the second is HDMI. I had to pickup HDMI to DVI cables to work with some of our non-HDMI displays. There is a bit of Pre-Installed Acer software that I removed unclutter the desktop, apps, and processes. Love the smaller foot print. Front powered USB and High Speed ports are nice. Keyboard and Mouse are corded. No thrills there.",

I paid about $150 less than what it's selling for now (not sure why the increas in price), but even at this price I would still highly recommend it. The speed when surfing the web is excellent, and set-up was very easy. If you're going to buy an Acer, stick to the ones with this type of processor and graphics card.",

Although it has an core i5 processor, this computer is slow and lags when playing videos. Save yourself some trouble and don't buy this piece of trash.
