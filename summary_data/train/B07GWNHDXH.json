However when I juice, I mix up the fruit and veggies so that after I toss in something like a carrot or kale I follow it up with something juicy such as an apple or lemon or cucumber which I find lubricates and clears the chute. Excellent juicier, I highly recommend it!!",

Bought a new cap and then found the original hopper on top does not fit as it is unstable. Pressed on and made juice and found the quality is not the same.

    "title": "Omega J8006HDS Nutrition Center Quiet Dual-Stage Slow Speed Masticating Juicer Makes Fruit and Vegetable 80 Revolutions per Minute High Juice, 200-Watt, Silver",
    "description": "The Omega J8006 nutrition center is a masticating style juicer. Sometimes referred to as a low speed juicer, the nutrition center processes at 80Rpm, whereas most other juicers process at a speed of 1, 650 to 15, 000Rpm. The low speed protects and maintains healthy enzymes, prevents oxidation and allows juice to be stored up to 72 hours without degradation. The Ultem auger is 8x stronger than most other plastics and the powerful gear Reduction is equivalent to a 2HP motor. The dual stage juice processing system extracts the maximum amount of juice from fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, even wheatgrass! You can also use the nutrition center to turn nuts into nut butters (an all-natural peanut butter), make baby food from natural, fresh ingredients, whip up soy milk, extrude pasta, grind Coffee and spices, and mince herbs and garlic. Make delicious and nutritious drinks and snacks that everyone will love. Measuring 7in wide, 15. 5in deep and 8. 5in tall. Usage of more frozen foods (fruit, ice cream, etc. ) than liquids leads to the foods sticking to the sides of blender jars or the mixture becomes stiff (frozen) and will not flow. The juice screen is already installed in the juicer note: some noise is to be expected. Please set the juicer on top of a thin towel to help stabilize and mitigate noise. As a natural immune booster, Omega Cold Press Juicers deliver a potent dose of antioxidants to boost and support overall health and immunity. Cold press juicing is one of the most effective ways to easily access nutritious enzymes that help to improve immunity and overall health. Don\u2019t eat your fruits and veggies\u2014juice them! Get a day\u2019s worth of vitamins in one delicious juice!",
