      "title": "reliable mounting without drilling holes",
      "text": "Wanted a net that was easy to use without having to drill holes in my pool. The clamp mounts are a bit bulky but work perfectly. I tied the net on and taped the ends, which lets me pull one post our and put it on the side when not in use, and then I just snap it back in when we want to play. My pool is 18' round, net fits by using a little bit of the extra slack. You could probably go up to a 21' pool without issues, not sure about much bigger than that.",

The first time the ball made contact with this bad boy, the entire contraption fell apart and my Mother in Law laughed at me for 15 to 20 minutes! The yellow included ball had a leak before it was ever used. I feel as if I was ripped off! You will love this, if you love garbage! P.S.- The material is thinner than dental floss.",

Unless the top of your pool is 100% completely flat which nearly NO POOLS are, the mounting system for this net will not stay clamped to the top of your ledge regardless of the amount of herculean force you use to clamp it down,... it will simply slide off. dont waste your money on this chinese-made garbage, keep looking elsewhere for a better product.",
