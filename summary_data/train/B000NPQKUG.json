After unpacking all of the parts for assembly and spending an hour assembling this cabinet and cleaning up all of the packaging, I discovered that all of the included shelves were about one half inch too short. Not a single one of the shelves were wide enough to sit on top of the adjustable side pegs. If I even touched the shelf much less put anything on them they would all fall to the bottom of the cabinet. Very poorly made and a complete waste of time and money. I\u2019ve already thrown it in the dumpster.",

The divider in each door had a visible gap and the doors did not meet, there was a tapered gap of 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch and worst of all, the shelves were too short to span between the pins in the cabinet sides. I could not keep the shelves in place. The only fix would be to makes the shelves longer or remanufacture the cabinet case to bring the top and bottom mounts closer to each other. Manufacturer needs to implement quality control measures, as the design is good and the materials are good.",

In hindsight, I probably would've bought a different cabinet had I known it holds significantly less DVDs than advertised. I would still recommend this cabinet, but you might want to take that into account if you have a large collection you want to store and display.",
