After reaching out to Amazon, the third company fulfilling the item and Baby Jogger we discovered the stroller was a very old model, (and apparently a defective one). Amazon and the third company refused to help us since it was more than 6 months from purchase, and overall very (!!) poor costumer service experience. We are buying a new stroller.",
