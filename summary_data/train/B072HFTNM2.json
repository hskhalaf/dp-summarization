I have an inflammatory skin condition which can exhaust me during the day, and keep me awake all night long, so I have been putting it on my back, and the pain disappears within about 20 minutes and the relief lasts about 6 to 8 hours.

      "text": "I don't know if frankincense oil does anything so many fans claim it does, so my rating isn't bases on efficacy. I can say that this oil seems of high quality, that I have ingested it multiple times without any digestive or other issue and that it was delivered quickly along with a query from the seller about if I was happy with the product. So if you're looking for organic ingestible frankincense, I think you'll likely be happy with this purchase.",
