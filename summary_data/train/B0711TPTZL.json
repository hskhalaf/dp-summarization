Pros: - No Setup - Plug it in and it works. - No noticeable speed degradation. I don't have test equipment to verify it gives full Gig E Speeds, but it works perfectly well with my multiple video streaming devices connected to it. Cons: - None. It just works.

The issue was clearly the Verizon router (that I was stupidly renting from them) because when I connected directly via Ethernet cable, the speed was fantastic. It took some finagling as my ONT data port was for Coaxial only, so I had to call Verizon and get them to switch it over to Ethernet. But once I did that, the setup on this router took less than 5 minutes, and as you can see in the speed tests, this router is awesome. The test was run from a room away from the router with several other devices connected at the same time. Yay!!",

One warning to those new to network equipment: 5 ports means that you can connect up to 5 RJ45 connectors. If you are connecting to a network, be sure to count that connector (i.e. network plus 4 devices). These smaller switches seem to fill up fast. In my office I have 1 port to the larger network, 1 port each for my laptop, scanner and printer (my scanner and printer are stand alone). That leaves only one free port.",

There was no 5G option, and it was impossible to use the cellphone application with this product.",

As long as you can hide the wall wart, this thing looks really great, and it's hyper-fast. I got it to replace my formerly high end 100MBPS switches that were quit sharp in their day. This is smaller and tighter and nicer. Takes up less space and looks great and works great.",

      "text": "I needed a simple switch to be able to connect to my Google Home router to connect a gaming computer and a home hub that both needed ethernet. I wanted something small that would fit easily next to my router and not take up a lot of room on my desk. This is the perfect little router that does exactly what I needed it to! I have no complaints at all, and highly suggest this to anyone that needs a few extra ethernet ports!",
