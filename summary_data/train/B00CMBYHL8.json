But I've finally decided I just need to get rid of this damn thing. I'm tired of my toast shooting out and flying across the counter. I'm tired of it taking a very long time to produce an unevenly cooked piece of toast, I'm tired of the bagel setting not actually doing anything different than regular setting and I'm tired of a lift function that barely lifts. It gets two stars only because it's beautiful and it does produce toast.",

The only thing I would improve on this is having the lever go higher so small pieces of toast are easier to get out.",

I purchased this toaster in October- it stopped working at the end of January. 65.00 for a toaster that lasted 3 and 1/2 months with light use seems extremely poor quality in a product. I'm deeply disappointed in this product",
