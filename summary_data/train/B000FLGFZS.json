I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s from incomplete combustion. If you can keep it fired up it\u2019s OK...right now it\u2019s a useless decoration on our deck. AVOID",

Assembly was not overly difficult as some of the parts were already partially put together but no complaints. I gave it a test run last night and again this am. It worked pretty well again for $100. The gas door isa. Bit rough and requires caution. I will likely sand it down. The heat is throws off is not massive as it uses a small disposable propane tank. I bought an adapter for a larger tank and will try that as well but mostly pretty pleased and the product looks pretty darn nice as well.",

Everything about this device is way cheaper in quality than just 10 years ago. I get it -- everyone has to get the highest margins on their products. Too bad. So at least you are forewarned now.",
