It's also an idea book. Recipes are flexible and don't require strict adherence in order to achieve an outstanding dish. You'll learn new techniques and combinations. I'm not a vegan, I'm simply trying to decrease the amount of red meat I eat and become more versatile with that veggie box that gets delivered every week. Good stuff!",
