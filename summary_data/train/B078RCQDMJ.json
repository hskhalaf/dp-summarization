There are pockets in all 4 interior corners and there is a loft provided as well as a footprint. You cannot beat that for the money but the single pole system which works well is heavy. I also worry about the close tolerances of the interlocking poles as any sand or dirt would impede them coming together. You just need to be careful with it.

Wondering about overall durability and how long that will last.

After all the good reviews on this company and this particular product, really wondering about their quality control.",

This is not an ultralight but it has a useful ultralight option by not using the inside netting/bathtub floor, instead using the rain fly as a tarp and sleeping on the very nice included footprint. They include everything you'll need. Did great during two week trip with lots of rain - no leaks!",

It's barely large enough for the tent itself, if you have the ground sheet or anything else in there it's like stuffing 10lbs of stuff in a 2lbs sack, just not going to happen. We ended up buying a GEERTOP adjustable tent compression bag for it that worked perfectly. I am eager to see what else this enterprising new gear maker has to offer.",
