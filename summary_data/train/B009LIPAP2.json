It was used only on occasions and had roughly 100 hours on the lamp when the unit expired. To have it repaired (something to do with the board) the cost was $350.00 The BenQ is even more powerful and has a better picture quality than the Optoma. We are able to project a clear picture or movie twenty feet away, believe we could go even further if the room would allow.",

    "title": "BenQ MS517 2800 Lumen SVGA DLP Smarteco Projector",
    "description": "Offers stunning full-screen presentation with the finest details. View larger THE BEST VALUE CHOICE FOR A SMALL-MEDIUM SPACE\nFeaturing a brightness of 2800 ANSI lumens, a high contrast ratio of 13000:1 and a SVGA resolution, the cost-effective and eco-friendly MS517 offers a stunning full-screen presentation with the finest details regardless of the ambient light level.\n\nFeaturing multiple input options to fit every need. View larger SMARTECO\nWORLD-LEADING SMARTECO TECHNOLOGY FOR A GREENER ENVIRONMENT\nAs the first DLP brand to incorporate Philips' ImageCare technology into its projector lamp system, BenQ has taken a further leap, developing its own SmartEco Technology to perfect what DLP can do for energy saving in the 21st century classroom. Built with this brand new invention, the MS517 brings together uncompromised brightness, exquisite picture quality and optimized lamp life through innovative features.\n\nBlank the projection screen whenever you need to redirect the students' focus. View larger \nSave up to 70% of your lamp power with No Source Detected mode. View larger ECO BLANK MODE\nThe Eco Blank mode allows teachers to blank the projection screen whenever they need to direct their students' focus back on them--or simply when the projector is not in use. When activated, this special feature dims the lamp power automatically, lowering the total power consumption by up to 70%.\n\nLamp power is automatically adjusted to maximize saving. View larger SMART ECO MODE\nThe Smart Eco mode is designed to use only the exact amount of lamp power a projector needs to deliver the best contrast performance. With this feature, schools get to provide students and teachers uncompromised projection quality and reduce the total cost of ownership by extending the lamp life and lowering power consumption.\n\nNO SOURCE DETECTED MODE\nThere will be times when a projector is turned on without a display source, such as a classroom PC or notebook. To avoid a projector from running with full lamp power, BenQ created the No Source Detected Mode to lower the projector lamp brightness to 30% after the projector has remained unconnected to a display source for more than three minutes.\n\n0.5W IN STANDBY MODE\nWhen inactive, the MS517 keeps power consumption to a minimum with 0.5W standby power, achieving what was once a challenge for earlier projector models. This technological advancement in energy saving certainly helps extend the projector lamp life and lower energy costs.\n\nTHOUGHTFUL FEATURES\nThe MS517 projector supports 3D Blu-ray via HDMI \nInstant Restart lets you turn the projector back on immediately when it has been switched off by accident SUPPORTS 3D BLU-RAY VIA HDMI\nDesigned to maximize your audiovisual enjoyment, the MS517 brings to you unlimited 3D entertainment via HDMI. The 3D formats supported are 3D field-sequentials, 3D frame-packing, 3D top-and-bottom and 3D side-by-side.\n\nCLOSED CAPTIONING\nDisplay subtitles in video content without the need for an external closed-captioning device with the MS517. It's perfect for viewing in educational settings such as language classes where a transcript of onscreen dialog is desirable.\n\nUSER-FRIENDLY I/O PORT DESIGN\nTo enable easy access for everyone, the I/O ports are clearly printed on the projector housing so users can find the port they need straight away. No squinting your eyes or bending over for a closer look.\n\nINSTANT RESTART\nThe Instant Restart feature gives teachers a 90-second window period to turn the projector back on immediately when it has been switched off by accident--no waiting necessary.\n\nIncludes teaching templates to make your job easier QUICK COOLING\nCooling time itself has been reduced by over 60%, saving your time and minimizing the risk of heat damage to sensitive internal components.\n\nTEACHING TEMPLATE\nTo make your teaching job easier, BenQ has added the teaching template function to the MS517. Now, with four different line pattern designs to choose from--Letter Formation, Musical Staff, Worksheet and Coordinate Chart, you can easily write or draw on whiteboards as well as blackboards without the need of drawing lines or charts.\n\nCHOOSE THE RIGHT BENQ VALUE PROJECTOR THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU\nMS502 MX503 MS517 MX518 MW519 Native Resolution SVGA (800x600) XGA (1024x768) SVGA (800x600) XGA (1024x768) WXGA (1280x800) Lumens 2700 2700 2700 2800 2800 Contrast Ratio 13000:1 13000:1 13000:1 13000:1 13000:1 Lamp Life Up to 6500 hours Up to 6500 hours Up to 6500 hours Up to 6500 hours Up to 6500 hours HDMI \nHDMI w/ Blu-Ray 3D \nHDMI w/ Blu-Ray 3D \nHDMI w/ Blu-Ray 3D Throw Ratio 1.86-2.04 (53\" @ 2m) 1.86-2.04 (53\" @ 2m) 1.97-2.17 (50\" @ 2m) 1.97-2.17 (50\" @ 2m) 1.41-1.69 (62.25 @ 2m) SmartEco \nUp to 70% less power use \nUp to 70% less power use \nUp to 70% less power use \nUp to 70% less power use \nUp to 70% less power use",
