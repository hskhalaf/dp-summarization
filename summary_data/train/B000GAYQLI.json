I have banged it into things many times, I wear it in the shower every day, wear it in salt-water when I surf, and it still looks brand new. It is everything I wanted in a watch and people usually think I paid a ton for it because it is a G-Shock. I usually just take the compliment and don't tell them that it was under $50",

      "text": "Great watch- durable, nice looking and easy to use. Now that's not saying much- I'm of the type that will set it once and never touch it again. But for a timekeeper, it is a godsend. Not expensive, by far, yet fulfills everything everyone looking for a utilitarian watch will want. I set it once, right when I got it, with atomic time, and haven't touched it since. Keeps time extremely accurately, running (for me, at least) at most about a second or so fast on a weekly basis. Overall 5 stars and effortlessly worth the price.",

It is one of the cheaper priced G-shocks but it looks fairly good in my opinion. It has all the features I need, date, time, second count, and day of the week.",

The styling of the watch still allows me to wear it around the office in \"Office Attire\" and it compliments each outfit perfectly.

You don't have to worry about damaging this watch. Does everything and more the most expensive watches do for ma fraction of the cost.",

Went surfing with it, ran with it, and even played sand volleyball with it and it held its expectations. Now when I go hiking or swimming, I always where this watch. I also set alarms so when I know when to start heading down the mountain or when it's time to get out of the water. If you are looking for a simple yet extremely durable watch that can handle your outdoor lifestyle... this is the watch to get.",

I would go with an upgrade if you are looking for something with a more rugged appearance, there is a lot of bulky plastic on it. I have viewed some of the other more expensive ones sense getting this one, and will probably get another one with the metal looking buttons and screws, and with bigger numbers.",

Never clean it, just abuse it, drop it a million times, hit it while wearing it a lot and has never failed. Read the reviews and took my chances. Has worked perfectly for the last 3 years. Guess it's a hit or miss thing. Will rebuy once battery dies (but there's no indication of thar happening in the near future and that's 3+ years!!!)",
