      "text": "The format may be plain, but it is practical because you get more space to write on for each day. Our family uses it as a wall calendar by the phone. Two holes on the top make for easy mounting with two big nails. This calendar and the generic office supply ones have the same hole spacing so next years calendar can be mounted on the same holes. Near the current year's end (like October), the next year's calendar can be mounted behind the current helping you schedule those events as well. I prefer this to my electronic calendars because the kids and hubby can reference it too, and information can be easily added while you are on the phone.",

Now again I am taking blame for making the assumption that 2017 calendar would not be an option when searching for a 2018 calendar but I think that in 2018 or any time after say September or October and later the previous year the default should be the next year.
