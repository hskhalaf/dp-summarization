      "text": "I've owned a pair of older Sennheiser headphones for many years but wore them out over time. I was satisfied with them but these new ones are so much better in all ways. Better sound including simulated surround, better fit, better wireless and way better battery life plus an extra battery always charged and ready to go! Way cool wifi headphones! The wife never knows I'm listening to TV late at night because there is little or no sound leakage. Love Amazon and their delivery. One click shopping, it's great!",

The only downside is that after using them for a couple of months to give a decent review, I read that I should have received a second battery that wasn't in the box (it does say it on the box, but no mention in the instructions). No big deal for a $20 battery though. It is worth noting that they use a proprietary battery vs. something you can buy at Radio Shack. I am happy with the purchase.",

You have to make sure that your receiver output doesn't saturate the transmitter circuit; I had a cheapo DVD/CD player that did just that, and even Natalie Imbruglia had a Neil Young like distortion. The unit has a very good discriminator, and noise is kept to a minimum. , I can't call these one star phones. The nature of wireless is noise. There is always a tradeoff for convenience...",

They work great inside the home from room to room (one level home) and to various points out into the yard (1+ acre). Lightweight and comfortable. No problems with breakage or wear, they still look new. On average, they are used several times per week for about an hour or so per use - but during football season, they are used MUCH MORE! I recommended these to a co-worker whose husband is loving them so much that he bought a set as a gift for someone else.",
