Although it is reasonably large, I would not recommend this for outside flying. It is not powerful enough against even moderate winds. To fly inside, it is reasonably stable and not bad for a beginner. Only comes with Asian power cord so you need to buy and adapter so that adds to the price. Despite any name trying to sell you one, these are all WLtoys Helicopters. You can step up to a v913 with brushless motors for a little bit more.",
