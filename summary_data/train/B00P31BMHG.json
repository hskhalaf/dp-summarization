I wasn't even able to get the tape to fit completely where it is placed (there's about 20% of it hanging off the edge of my desk) and it doesn't wiggle, doesn't peel or anything. The Anchor itself is made out of a tough but flexible plastic, and even with two cats constantly playing with it it refuses to fall down. It's placed basically right next to my computer chair and I bump it constantly - but it does not fall off. Can't recommend it enough.",

I have several pairs of headphones I switch between depending on whether I'm on calls, listening to music, or if batteries are running out. I now have two of these hooked to the underside of my desk on either side. They keep my headphones off of the desk and out of my way when I'm not using them. They provide a great place to charge headphones. While my desk is not entirely decluttered it's at least much more under control now that the headphone situation is tucked away under desk.",

That's where the Anchor comes in... a simple molded rubber hanger with powerful adhesive that sticks to the bottom of your desk (or wherever) to hang your headphones on. After cleaning the bottom side of the desk area where you want to stick it, you simply remove the adhesive covering, press and hold in place for about a minute, and voila, you have a headphone hanger. I currently hang a pair of giant Senty headphones, as well as a pair of smallish bluetooth headphones and the Anchor handles both individually or at the same time. Would totally buy again.",

I like how it is able to be moved a bit and isn't rigid so you can grab your headphones without worrying its gonna bend an odd shape and break and plus its not metal. Don't get me wrong, but, having it be made out the material it is instead of metal or aluminum is pretty nice. Does exactly as it advertised.",
