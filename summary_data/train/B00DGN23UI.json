They fit perfectly and don't hang down when wet or full - I really don't like diapers that do that and I've never had that problem with the Swaddlers. I like the wetness indicator because sometimes you just can't tell! For this purchase I received a gift card from Pampers - but I have tried other brands like Huggies, Honest, Seventh Generation and Luvs, but none of them are as good and I always regret when I try something else, and always come back to Pampers. I highly recommend these diapers!",
