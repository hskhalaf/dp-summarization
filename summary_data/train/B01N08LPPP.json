I also use Asus motherboards on all of my computer builds. A good company with good products. The range is good, as I can use the WiFi portion in any room of my house as well as in my detached garage. A true home run!",

You can jam a toothpick in there, or open up the router and pull the spring out of the switch, which leaves it \"on\" all the time. Still a good router for the price. My old RT-N66U is now a wireless access point, minus a working power switch. I bought a 3-year Square Trade warranty because of the problematic power switch. It was only $1.95.",

The 5Ghz signal does not go as far. It only goes about 20-30 feet (probably because it's in a closet). All in all, I'm currently happy with the ease of setup, speed and availability of the signal.

It set up easily and is working perfectly, has twice the range of my old router (it's reviewed as one of the best for range). Couldn't be happier! (Make sure you get the B1 version, the previous version is completely different and does not perform nearly as well).",

This router is super easy to set up and if you have any experience with asus routers its ever easier because the setup looks just like the older models setup. Great Range and the price is competitive with other routers in its class",

I should have listen to the other reviews but I figured since I set up our last one that this one would be just as simple. Well looks simple but does not give ANY instructions for when you run into problems!! Hope this can be returned because I plan to send back immediately! You should go with another one unless you have a background in tech support.",
