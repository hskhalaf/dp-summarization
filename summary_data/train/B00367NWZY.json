This same unit is available through grizzly that has been delayed in production for 6 months. I know because I was on the back order list since Dec 23 and got frustrated and ordered this one, mistake. Now I know exactly why grizzly won\u2019t accept these due to QC issues.

I like the larger suction swirl pattern in the disks that fit around the sanding sleeve. The smaller one just had holes. I also like the tightening nut on top. No wrench to get lost. Just remember that it tightens the opposite way. Lefty tighty, Righty Lucy! I don't use this a lot so will see about the longevity.",

It doesn't bog down, sands smooth and with an attached dust collector or vac. there is NO saw dust anywhere except in the collector. Very impressive. Changing spindles is quick and easy and replacement sanding sleeves are both reasonably priced and readily available. I would recommend this unit to anyone.",
