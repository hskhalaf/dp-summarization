It is so easy to use & you will have no more soggy foods because you did not have to pour or ladle .. you simply spritzed, sprayed pr misted ..... ah , the good life with true flavorful healthy food.

The spray was very generous and the flavor excellent. I am particularly partial to Greek olive oil so this was a bonus. The glass bottle and spray mechanism are of high quality with initial usage. Only time will tell if this holds up and I anticipate that it will. I highly recommend this product to add to your kitchen.",
