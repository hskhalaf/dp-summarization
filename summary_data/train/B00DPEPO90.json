Much more durable too. Lots of space in the toe box, good with a reg athletic sock, but can also accommodate a thicker sock in the winter. I swapped out the insole with a Sofsole memory foam. And it is heavenly. I can stand for 10hrs with no problems. I may never wear another over hyped, low performance Tim again!",

They offer very good support to the ankles and foot. If you don't have foot problems like me, these will probably be great for you. I needed a boot w/ very good padding on the insole.",
