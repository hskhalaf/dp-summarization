      "text": "This headphone set has poor sound quality: it lacks midrange, and attempts to compensate by boosting treble and bass, but in a bad way. Mids are still scooped & music sounds poor & cheap. The hissing white noise is intolerable, unless you like white noise then these are perfect for your youtube noise videos. I tested these with (remastered) Led Zeppelin, Physical Graffiti, and Hillsong United, Zion. I would've also tested with Maxim Vengerov or a Rachmaninov concerto but didn't bother after listening to two albums. I'm not an expert but I am a musician with sound engineer experience.",

Noise reduction is great when something is playing, pretty crummy though when there's no audio. Fast charge, easy to pair Bluetooth or wire jack, play/pause and fwd/rwd buttons are handy.

I have to maneuver the wiring with tape on the left side in order to KEEP the sound in the right ear. My headphones always go out in one ear eventually, but never THIS quickly. October 2018 EDIT: I was sent another pair for free shortly after posting my initial review, but these too are acting up. If the wire gets moved (whenever I move my head in any direction), it can result in static, the sound coming out in only one ear, or silence.

Sound quality is great. Product quality has been great. Battery life has been great. The plug in wire came in handy when I arrived at the gym and found the battery was dead due to me not plugging them in all the way when I had went to charge them. That hard wire is great to plug in when on an airline as well. Extremely satisfied.",

      "text": "Decent headphones for the price. Purchased for teenager to use with phone (who didn't start using regularly until past 7-8 months). The fake leather/fabric on the headband started peeling off a few months ago (just after the warranty expired) and has only gotten worse. Bit of a bummer - hence the 2 star review...otherwise 4-5 star review if they hadn't started coming apart. *Updated rating from 2 stars to 5 stars 5/27/2020* This vendor sent me an unsolicited, new, replacement pair of headphones for the pair we had which (at the time of the initial review) started coming apart just outside the warranty period. Excellent customer service. Very impressed. Recommend to others!",

The BIG minor flaw is the low battery sound.... it will annoy you every 2 mins or so, telling you the battery is about to die with an annoying noise in your ears interrupting the music. One single time notice would be enough but this keeps making the sound again and again until it dies... fix that and these will be golden!!",

Try listening to Kacey Musgraves and you will see what I mean about the mid range. I did give it two stars because it is pretty comfortable and pairs well. Comfort is important.

This can be solved by lowering the volume to mid-low, but who does that? *Media buttons: the buttons make a circle where Up/Down is for volume and Left/Right for Previous/Next Track.

I put these on and they were comfortable from the first second--no need to break them in or wait for them to stretch out. The sound quality is great and it was easy to set up with my Chromebook. I only wish there was a way to determine how much battery life is left--my MPow bluetooth earbuds will tell me when I turn them on whether the battery is high, medium, or low so I have some type of indication as to how charged up they are. Other than that, these are an excellent headset!",

      "text": "I had my Bluetooth earphones for almost 2 years and they still work great. I use them to watch TV at night to not disturb others and I have a slight hearing impairment so these make hearing the TV much easier. They have survived my grandchildren using them, being dropped, they have even survived falling asleep with them on. They still hold a good charge that lasts almost 24 hrs. My only complaint is that the memory protein earmuffs started flaking off in the first year. Now they leave flakes on my ears, face, clothes and I cannot find anyway to replace them. I refuse to buy a new earphone because they work great.",
