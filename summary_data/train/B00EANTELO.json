It still gets full Android support with the latest Android versions and security patches sent as regular updates. If you want a good, reliable Android tablet then you really can't beat this. The price is a true bargain and you don't get many of those these day. Highly recommended!",

Getting a really suitable case is an insoluble problem owing to the bad arrangment of outer slots, mike and camera. But in other respects it's light, robust, has an excellent screen. I pray every day it will conk out or break when I drop it so I can justify replacing it, but it refuses to die, despite careless treatment.",

In less than 2 years I've had to replace the charging port twice as it kept breaking and refusing to charge. It also developed a sensor error where it wouldn't change from portrait to landscape or vice versa (this is a common fault with gen 2 Nexus' - Google it...) I really want to give it 5 stars as this is such a good device, just let down by the hardware. I'd buy another if they were cheaper and pretty much treat them as disposable as the cheaper Asus/Fire tablets are, but it's just too expensive to have poor hardware.",

The version I was supplied came with a European plug but the vendor apologised and said they would send the appropriate plug to me in the post. With just browsing or reading you'll get about 6-8 hours of life out of this device, with games that can come down to 3-4 dependent on the game. Overall a great tablet that I can take anywhere with me and hold in one hand.",

I would rank it in my top 3! Pros The display is brilliant!! The design is slick!! Performance is very good!!

The USB port had become loose and the touchscreen suffered pangs of unresponsiveness on occasion. Those faults developed towards the end. Yet when I went to research a new tablet to replace what I thought would surely be a dated and obsolete piece of tech I could find no other in the price range that sported the same high quality display with such a long battery life. The closest was the Nvidia Shield which has superior graphics if not display but this was at the cost of battery life. Love the Nexus7.",

I have bought a Google Chromecast to cast to the tv as you can't use a wired connection from the slimport . I think they should fix that to make it unbeatable.

I am awaiting some adapters to see if I can increase its use with the use of memory sticks. I am uncertain about having to have a Google account to get the best out of it as I am with all 'cloud storage'.",

Google did make lots of suggestions about trying different chargers and software fixes etc but it is actually the physical port on the device which is the problem. So I won't be buying another one if it ASUS branded. If something is not going to last you may as well go for a cheaper option!",

Didn't play many games on it but the office app helps in lectures and very easy to use",

And it is an extremely fast device compared to my very old single core android phone, large apps some over 100mb download in mere seconds and we pages load instantly, multitasking is very fluid with apps changing instantly with only an attractive transition animation in-between. The stock android experience is clean and simple although you may get less bells and whistles than other modified versions of android and I have noticed some really nice keyboard features on the Samsung galaxy note 8. But I have experienced no lag which I hear some versions of android on less power can be troubled with",

Also, lot's of games are optimised for lower resolutions, which means they are tiny on this screen, although I guess time will solve that. Also maybe there's a setting for lower res somewhere I haven't found. Biggest drawback is lack of instructions - I know it's fairly intuitive, but no manual at all. Maybe put an electronic one on front screen to read if you want?",
