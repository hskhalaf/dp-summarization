I sent this model back the next day and opted for the more expensive ET-3700, which is a dream in comparison.",

Also the model I received (7/2019) did not have an ethernet port, regardless what the description says. Wifi connection was a disaster and I could not get the scan to cloud function to work even with the help of customer support. Print quality was great, and loading the paper was simple. The models above the et-2760 seem to address these issues, so if are considering this printer I would definitely skip this model.",

      "text": "Very, very happy with this printer. Small in size but works great! There's a review that says it's loud but you can change a setting to turn on Quiet Mode - nice and quiet then. This is the 3710. For those worried about wireless, it comes with the WiFi and WiFi Direct disabled - yay. And it has Ethernet as an alternative. I tried double-sided printing and worked great - this was on card stock. Using ink bottles instead of cartridges not only less $ but so much easier.",

The only downside is that it does not have a document feeder on top, and we had to figure out how to scan multiple pages into one PDF document... (not easy)",

You couldn't buy the cartridges ahead of time because they have a \"time\" chip inside that would not let you print if you didn't use it fast enough.
