I've only tried four different types of this this kind of product and haven't found any to be great but this was the worst so far and the most expensive.",

Some people complained about the scent in their reviews, but I actually really like it. It\u2019s a soft tea-tree scent, so it smells really clean.

      "text": "This is a miracle product for those with acne scars. It goes on smooth and can be worn alone or with makeup. After using it once, I won't leave the house without it. It's not a concealer, but for minor imperfections or discoloration, it works wonders. And it does not cause acne, which is huge concern for me. Well worth the price.",
