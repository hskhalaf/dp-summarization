This unit has a metal body, which is more durable and easier to clean than plastic.

RAM and CPU are well above the minimum, and the unit is thin, light, cool, and quiet. This is an excellent computer for everyday use.",

I sent in all the paperwork indicating WINDOWS 7! I'm going to sell it as is and get something else. My bad idea to buy it. I trusted ASUS - have used their mother boards for years.
