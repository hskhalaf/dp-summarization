      "text": "I purchased this for my cat who refuses to come in the house. I put it in the laundry room to help her stay warm in the winter. To make it more attractive, I put it on a shelf with her food and scattered catnip inside. To date, she has refused to use it and the catnip remains undisturbed. She is a very picky cat and if her food didn't disappear or I didn't hear her meow now and then, I'd think she'd left home for good. I guess she's really a ghost cat. So, my rating is based on the fact I cannot actually rate the product. If my cat used it, I would give it five stars.",

However, the bed looks like it would be super comfortable with a sturdy roll around the edge that you pet should feel they could lay against or curl up and be snugly and warm while napping. The fabric is sturdy and should live up to a lot of use for years to come.",
