It holds at least 28 cloth diapers and 23 inserts (shown in photo) with room to spare. This came assembled and all I had to do was take it out of the box and plastic, unfold, and voila\u0300! The best part is that it's compact enough to fit in our laundry room/pantry at our apartment or can be folded and put away or taken with us.",

But I recently did a local antique show, and realized it was perfect for displaying a handmade quilt, and several other small items which would have gone unnoticed if they were just folded on the table. light and very compact folded, and a very good value with fast shipping.

Obviously it's not a heavy duty rack and meant more for clothes, small bath mats or towels, but it works great and folds up very easily.

When in use, it has many options for hanging many types and size garments. The only thing I don't love about it is when you unfold and snap it together to use, the rough metal hooks are wearing away the paint on side it snaps onto. Therefore, it's getting torn up and not looking as nice anymore. There should be a plastic piece it snaps onto instead of bare painted metal or something. Either way, it works!",

PGE rates in my area are at present .39 on peak (when i am home) My dryer draws 5 kw and would run for about 1 hour to dry all these clothes- so each time I use this handy little rack I am saving about $2.00 pre tax and my clothes are not wrinkled.....",

The more costly X shaped racks are superior because they hold much more (more than twice as much in my case) , are less likely to tip over or collapse while using, and fold smaller for storage. I never use my Amazon Basics clothes drying rack. My Moerman rack (or any similar rack) is much more versatile. I think this Amazon Basic rack is fine if you do not have many clothes to dry.
