I also don't know where the catnip would be, it's a very small toy and the entire body is filled up by the squeaker mechanism and it's all sown shut.",

However after tossing it to her a few times she played with it! Tossing it in the air and pawing at it and grooming it, she seems to be enjoying it. The fake fur is very soft and the squeaker works fine without being too loud. I would recommend for anyone whose cat likes light soft toys. Be warned though that the raccoon is very small, the skunk is slightly bigger.",

They stay entertained by it longer than other toys because it makes a noise when they hit it (so if they keep hitting it, it keeps squeaking, making them want to keep hitting it). Other toys don't interest them because they have to work harder to make it interesting. This toy is definitely worth it if you want something they can play with on their own, without you having to throw it around for them.",

So, depending on your cat, it might be a hit or miss.
