While it works great for schrader valves, it does not work as efficiently for presta valves. Locking the valve in place on a presta valve is a challenge; so is releasing it without losing lots of air in the process. Today I tried it again on one of my bikes with presta valves. Very frustrating process. I ended up having to use an older pump of a different brand. My final opinion; great for standard/schrader valves. If you are looking for a pump for presta valves, keep looking.",

There should be absolutely no air loss if the switch is in the center position. Air should move in one direction hopefully into the tube. None of the glue-less patches worked. Useless",

The OVOS pump would take about 8 pumps to get my tires to about 65psi, whereas the Vibrelli would take 16 pumps. I would return this pump and get another but they all look the same, small tube.

The gauge seems to be accurate in measuring PSI, however, upon unlocking off of a presta valve it releases 15-20 PSI, which means you would always have to over-inflate by that much to get the pressure you want. This of course is impossible with a high pressure road bike tire. It may work better for a mountain bike tire but it's of no use to those running high pressure. Returning.",

HOWEVER there is one design flaw--when you put the lock lever back in neutral (to unlock the fitting from your valve stem), this opens the air path to whatever you were just inflating--meaning a bunch of air rushes out while you struggle to pull the fitting off the valve stem. So you're going to lose a few PSI from whatever you just inflated when you pull the pump fitting off. This is unavoidable.",

The Lezyne pumps have been the pump of choice for me, but their attitude towards customers was more than disappointing, and so decided to try something else. The pump does not have a release valve, and that raised the concern that the tyre was losing pressure on disengagement. I asked customer support, and their response was immediate, with good suggestions on how to make sure any pressure loss is minimal. Now it works well. This is a great pump and fantastic value.",

Once I got the connector attached to the rear tire, the connection was not secure and had to be reattached a couple times to get a good attachment. Compared to previous pumps, this took a lot more strokes to get the pressure in. I've returned the pump and would not recommend this product.",

The pump motion is seamless. The large pressure dial is one of a kind. The craftsmanship is unique and the price very reasonable. This pump is a superb value.
