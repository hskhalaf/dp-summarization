Google searches reveal countless Canon customers experiencing lens problems with the PowerShot line. Stay away from this brand of cameras",

      "text": "I've been an amateur and professional photographer for 50 years. This is my favorite pocket camera. It does not cost a fortune, so if I lose it -- and you do lose these things -- I am not out a fortune. This is the third one I have owned It takes decent video with sound, and good still shots. It has a good variety of pre-programmed 'modes,' and I particularly like the silent or stealth mode. It is durable. Survives minor falls. Relatively moisture-proof, unlike the Casio. Not fazed by very hot or very cold weather. Battery life is excellent, and it can be re-charged on the same charger in Europe or the USA. How can you beat it?",

Bring the pics into Photoshop and with a couple clicks you end up with REALLY stunning shots. But even straight out of the camera I'm amazed. Especially for the money. Now, if you want to drop some serious money, the best bigger, but not as big as a DSLR, digital camera out right now is the Olympus OM-D E-M1. Mind-blowing. But $1,400.",

It's easy to use, very fast, and I think the thing I'm most excited about is how clear pictures without the flash on turn out. A camera that takes non-blurry photos with the flash off is a feature I had yet to have found in a camera, and this one did the trick. I'm excited to use it more :)!",

The included software leaves a lot to be desired. Where do the down loaded pictures go? There is no obvious menu for setting a destination folder. I have not found those pictures so far. Am going to delete the software from the computer.",

    "description": "Color:BlueThe Canon 6152B100 PowerShot A4000 IS 16MP Compact Digital Camera, in blue, boasts advanced capabilities and chic style that set it apart from the crowd.

Touch a button and you'll be shooting brilliantly lifelike 720p HD video.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nTAKE A CLOSER LOOK\nAdvanced capabilities and chic style set PowerShot A4000 IS digital camera apart from the crowd. In a new high for the A-Series, it's equipped with a powerful 8x Optical Zoom to get you close to the action fast, and a 28mm Wide-Angle lens and Optical Image Stabilizer that deliver beautifully clear images with more excitement in every frame. This chic, compact camera in a range of appealing colors has a 16.0 Megapixel Image Sensor with DIGIC 4 Image Processor to ensure superior resolution and fast performance. Beautiful images are easy thanks to Smart AUTO that picks the perfect camera settings for 32 predefined shooting situations, and Intelligent IS that automatically optimizes image stabilization based on the shooting conditions. Touch a button and you'll be shooting brilliantly lifelike 720p HD video!\n\nZOOM IN ON WIDER, STEADIER SHOTS\n8x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle Lens The 8x Optical Zoom (35mm equivalent: 28\u2013224mm) in PowerShot A4000 IS digital camera is the most powerful ever seen in Canon\u2019s A-Series.It gives you a huge range of potential images from a single location, which is perfect for sporting events and other occasions when your shooting stance is fixed, or times when moving in too close might disrupt the action you\u2019re trying to capture. The lens\u2019s 28mm wide-angle perspective puts more image in every frame for dynamic, exciting shots.\n\n\n\n\n\nOPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\n\nHIGH RESOLUTION, HIGHLY ADVANCED PERFORMANCE\n16.0 MEGAPIXEL IMAGE SENSOR WITH DIGIC 4 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nWith the camera\u2019s 16.0 Megapixels of resolution, your images are rich and clear, with textures and tiny details faithfully reproduced even at the long end of the big 8x Optical Zoom. This high level of resolution is ideal for creating the largest prints, and allows you the flexibility to blow up and crop any section of an image to express your creativity. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor powers the camera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advanced systems and features, ensuring fast, reliable performance with low battery consumption.\n\nDIGIC 4 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nCanon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, HD video and Face Detection Self-timer.\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS\nSMART AUTO\nPhotographers of all levels appreciate a camera \u2013 especially a go-anywhere compact digital \u2013 that takes the hassle out of capturing beautiful images. The PowerShot A4000 IS digital camera gives you Smart AUTO \u2013 sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture when shooting still images.

Toy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect. Monochrome Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue. Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors. Poster Effect Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts. Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint. Fireworks Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.

The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want.\n\nIFRAME \nWith the PowerShot A4000 IS digital camera, you can also shoot video in the Apple\u00c2\u00ae iFrame format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos.

It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light.\n\nA STEADY IMAGE IS A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE\nINTELLIGENT IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.\n\nPanning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.\n\nMacro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.\n\nDynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.\n\nPowered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.\n\nTripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.\n\n\nHELP YOU WON'T NEED HELP TO FIND\nHELP BUTTON\nThe PowerShot A4000 IS digital camera is designed to be fun and easy to use, even for beginners. A new Help Button on the camera\u2019s exterior brings up the help menu any time you need it, right on the LCD screen. From here, you can scroll through a variety of topics that answer your questions with clear explanations, offer helpful shooting advice, and show you diagrams highlighting the position of any buttons you'll need.\n\nMORE WAYS TO GET CREATIVE\nSCENE MODES\nScene Modes are fun, easy ways to give your shots a distinctly artistic feel without the need for any extra lenses and filters. Super Vivid heightens and saturates colors for eye-popping intensity. Poster Effect eliminates gradations between colors for an illustrative feel. Miniature Effect enhances perspective in a scene, blurring the top and bottom to make it look as if it were created with miniature models. You can also make a quirky portrait using the Fisheye Effect or add a beautiful single-tone effect with Monochrome. Toy Camera Effect simulates a vintage look as it capturing the photo using a toy or pinhole camera.\n\n\nCHARGE UP AND GO!\nLITHIUM-ION BATTERY\nThe Canon PowerShot A4000 IS digital camera uses a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery.
