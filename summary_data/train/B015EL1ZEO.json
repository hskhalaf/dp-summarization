I love the different textures on the mat so you can really clean different brush types and densities easily and thoroughly. The mat itself is easy to clean when you are done with a little Dawn dish soap (removes any oils or leftover makeup from the mat). I highly recommend this and I used it with my Beauty Blender Bar (large bar in the black container) and had amazingly clean soft brushes in no time. Highly recommend this cleaning mat.",

It's a mess seriously cleaning this thing is the worst. The foundation sticks to the materially and it's gross. I used it once then I just put it in a drawer. For eye brushes it was not bad but wasn't amazing. No joke the fondation and blush brushes had this thing like caked up in the grooves and was just a disaster. I don't even wear that much face makeup",

So this mat is a god send. It is so easy to use to get even the most stubborn of foundations out of brushes to the littlest of eyeshadow out of delicate blending brushes.

A lot of people don't realize how many germs can live in your makeup brushes, especially if you do touch-ups throughout the day. I do a deep cleaning of my brushes weekly by using my Prism Brush Bar and this mat. I usein between deep cleanings to change colors and products. I like the size of the Express Brush Cleaning Mat as it fits well in my sink and is easy to store when not in use.",

      "text": "This mat is what I have been missing. I was using a face brush that was the size of two half dollars with the same silicone texture. I can appreciate that this mat is 4x bigger and gives you options, as far as, which surface you would like to wash your brushes on. I would definitely recommend to anyone, but if your on a budget do what you have to do to get the job done.",
