The product came with a quick start instruction page that was in English - a photocopy page that was missing instructions for installing the kickstand or more specifically WHEN to install the kickstand during the assembly process.

Because it is light weight it jumped and danced on the hardpan or rocks at times, but you fairly quickly get the knack of controlling it. Maybe a bigger and heavier unit would not have jumped as much, but a heavier jumping tiller would probably beat you up more and after the initial ground breaking, this unit is easier to maneuver.

No more mixing gas, easy starting, better control, ease of operation, all make this unit a great addition to my gardening experience. The kickstand is a very nice feature, which eliminates trying to balance it, while filling the tank with gas. I can not be more pleased with this unit than I am.

I was able to till my garden in about the time it took me with a large machine. It has plenty of power and is lightweight. I also found it was very easy to control the tiller, even at full speed. This should be a big help during the season. Bottom line, I think the premium is worth it, and would recommend this to friends.",

The unique, curvy tines (blades) can till a full 10 inches deep. Then with a simple flip of the tines, you can precision-weed around delicate plants and seedlings! This is a gardening tool you'll use all season long! Don't hold back! Put this tiller through most any challenge!
