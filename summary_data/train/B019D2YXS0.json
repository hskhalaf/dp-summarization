I also read where someone said how the arch on the shoe didn't hit their foot right. These are great for me. I do have a high arch though. They are worth at least trying. Everyone's feet are not made the same. I've only worn these around the house so not sure if they hurt or not but as with most heels, the more you wear them the more you break them in. I'm satisfied with these!",
