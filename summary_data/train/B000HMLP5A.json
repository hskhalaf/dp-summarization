Most subs do have an auto on and an on, but this lacks both--it's just auto on. Then, I had a defective sub, because when the sub went from auto off to on, it created cracking sounds--like soft firecrackers. I ended up returning it two days after receiving it. Too bad, because I love Onkyo products generally. Go with Onkyo's THX certified sub woofer. It is a fantastic sub!!!!!",

This will send a constant LFE level to the sub so it will always stay on.

I was very disappointed in the onkyo receiver but this sub has done a very good job and puts out plenty of bass for my use. I normally watch bd and listen to rock music with my home ent sys. If there is one thing I don't like about the sub it's that it has a small light on the front of it that is always on when in use. I wish more of my home ent sys did not display lights.",

Seems to be they would have been better not implementing this feature. How much power are you really going to save??",

I read others saying this rattles at high lvls .. dont believe it The only rattling will be the knick knacks on the shelves and the walls lol ... This is an awesome unit ... Just remember its MUCH larger than the picture suggests",

It can really crank out though deep octives, also with the frequency changer you can make it do the high bass sounds......... Sounds like it dosen't make sence but it dose. It was shaking my whole room and everything in it, a beast sub. Also one funny thing it shuts off when theres no bass in the song at verry low volume. And the grill never makes funny noises, it prob the stuff around it shaking out of it mind...............overall GREAT.... Ohhh i forgot something, its really big you will be happy:)",
