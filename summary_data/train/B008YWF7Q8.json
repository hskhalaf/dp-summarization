Some retailers seem to be \"updating\" their men's PJs to include mismatched tops and bottoms, side pockets in the bottoms (who needs pockets in PJs???), and girlie drawstring bottoms with NO FLY! That's why I am very happy that I found these traditional Hanes PJs for men and would highly recommend.",

They are not warm under the covers and are literally, \"No Sweat.\" The fit is comfortable and the colors subdued. The durability of the cloth remains to be tested.
