These were super easy to use on our labradoodle who had gotten so out of control with long, curly, tangled hair, I thought the groomer might turn us away. I thought I'd save the $90 haircut and give this a go on the bet that we could start doing ourselves and have these paid for in only two haircuts (even with an extra blade)! I took advice on reviews and got a sectional blade to switch out when one gets hot. Works like a charm. Highly recommend. Before and after pics attached!",
