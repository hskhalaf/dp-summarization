Maybe two sizes were the issue? A warning to others that my gun, or maybe my operation of it, was temperamental. My last finishing nailer, a Bostitch, blew plastic parts out of the assembly when it broke. So I've repaired this one and will see how it does. I like the features of the gun: offset so I can see my work, a built in blower to clean-up after myself. But it seems to me I saw a review elsewhere that one needed to be careful about the brand of nails.",

    "title": "Hitachi NT65M2S 16-Gauge Finish Nailer with Integrated Air Duster, 2-1/2-Inch, Silver (Discontinued by the Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Style:Hitachi NT65M2SThe NT65M2(S) 16-gauge finish nailer features a non-slip elastomer grip trigger and ergonomically designed simple flip actuation switch. It is ideal for installing molding, chair rail, cabinetry and other fine finish applications. The NT65M2(S) accepts 16-gauge finish nails in lengths ranging from 1\" up to 2-1/2\" and is equipped with Hitachi's signature air duster button to conveniently blow away dust and debris instantly to clear the work surface. Includes Safety Glasses (875769), 1/4\" NPT Male Plug (190001), No Mar Tip (881751), Carrying Case (885676)\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Hitachi 16-gauge finish nailer is designed to meet the needs of the advanced do-it-yourselfer or the professional trim carpenter. This model's built-in air duster button permits air from the compressor to bypass the nailing function, so you can clear away dust from your work surface for better nail prep and a clearer view of your work area. Its compact, lightweight style is easy to hold and easy to aim, for precision nail placement that won't wear out your arms. Use this versatile nailer when installing molding, chair rails, cabinetry, or other fine finish applications. \n\n The NT65M2 comes ready to work, with a selective actuation switch that lets you fire sequentially or on contact, depending on the job and the application -- and no tools or additional parts are required to make the change. It also has a tool-less, easy-to-clear nose that makes removing nail jams simple, plus a tool-less depth of drive dial that adjusts for flush fastening in a variety of materials. If you want superior control and a professional-looking finish, this is the easiest way to get it. \n\n This nailer features a 360-degree, fully-adjustable exhaust port that blows air away from your face, a no-mar tip to protect your work surfaces, and an elastomer grip for better control and accuracy. It accepts fasteners from 1 to 2-1/2 inches, 16-gauge. It weighs only 3.7 pounds. It operates at 70-120 psi, and the magazine holds up to 100 fasteners. This model comes with safety glasses, a tool fitting, no-mar tip, hex bar wrench, and a case. \n\n What's in the box:\nHitachi 16-gauge finish nailer, tool fitting, safety glasses, no-mar tip, hex bar wrench, case. \n\nChoosing a Pneumatic Nailer\nFor small household jobs, an old-fashioned hammer is the perfect stand-by. But if you've got a bigger project on your to-do list, then a pneumatic power nailer could be your new best friend. Pneumatic nailers are a great alternative to traditionally powered nailers, because they're capable of providing more power -- and they operate with fewer moving parts, so a pneumatic nailer can take more abuse than its corded or battery-run cousins. \n\n A Word on Air Compressors\nAll pneumatic tools require a steady supply of controlled, compressed air in order to work properly, and nailers are no exception. Bigger compressors with hardy motors and large tanks generate higher PSI levels and maintain them longer, so you'll probably want a piston-type, two-stage compressor to power your nailer. Smaller or single-stage models are fine for little projects, but if you need a pneumatic nailer, the odds are good that you're looking for some intense PSI and CFM ratings. Sometimes, a pneumatic nailer will come with its own compressor -- or it can be purchased as part of an air tool set. \n\n How Pneumatic Nailers Work\nPneumatic nailers use compressed air power to cock and release the hammer. In order to fire a fastener, a valve opens to let air fill a cylinder -- which has a piston that's driven down hard and fast. This forces the nail out of the gun and into your workpiece. Then the piston recoils, and another nail is loaded. \n\n Important Points to Consider\nCheck manufacturer's guidelines to find out what pressure (PSI) and volume (CFM) of air will give your pneumatic nailer the best results. Also, keep in mind that any restrictions on the air hose will diminish the tool's performance. Hoses that are very long, contain too much moisture, or are incorrectly sized will reduce air flow. This can prematurely wear out your tool and cause it to perform poorly. \n\n General Features\nMost models will feature a rubber nosepiece to prevent scuffing and marring of your workpieces, plus an exhaust system (rear or adjustable) to keep sawdust and debris out of your face and away from your project. Pneumatic nailers usually have an adjustable depth of drive, and depending on the model, they can accommodate nails up to 2-1/2 inches long, in a variety of different gauge sizes. With a powerful enough compressor behind them, they can shoot thousands of nails a day.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe NT65M2 was designed to meet the needs of a professional trim carpenter. Hitachi's selective actuation trigger lets you change from sequential to contact fire with the flip of a switch. The integrated air duster is a useful feature that can be used to blow dust of off your work place or saw. A 360 degree adjustable exhaust allows the user to direct the exhaust away from the work and or the user. Nail placement is accurate by the tool free dpeth adjustment. This tool comes with a case and a no mar tip.\n\nSee more",
