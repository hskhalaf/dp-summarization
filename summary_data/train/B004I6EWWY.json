In the past two years I switched to the Advanced Shout which seems to do an even better job with things like tomato paste, red wine, red cranberry juice, blueberry and strawberry stains, etc. I keep it handy in my laundry room, my closet and even keep some in my travel bag. It has saved more clothes from the trash bin than I can remember. It works fast, does not leave a shadow or mark, and does not fade colors. Suffice it to say, I'm a believer and I highly recommend this product!",

When I notice them as they come out of the dryer, I spray them with this, let sit overnight, then spray again and wash on hot. Hasn\u2019t failed me yet! The only downside to this product is that the little \u201cstraw\u201d inside is angled funny, so as you get to the bottom of it you have to hold it and the clothes at an awkward angle to get the product out.",
