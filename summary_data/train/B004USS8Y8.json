The two carry handles and backpack straps provide plenty of carry options. Folds very flat for travel. Easily fit all my gear; fins, boots, mask, wet suit, towel, swim suit, snorkel, weights, etc. I highly recommend this for a good quality, fairly priced piece of gear and from it's competitors, I really, really like the larger side zipper compartment that holds more accessories, etc, than the other competitors flat pocket zipper compartment. I highly recommend this quality, versatile bag for all your dive or beach gear!! :)",

      "text": "This type of bag is great for wet gear, very sturdy, holds plenty, and I like the back pack style so you can distribute the weight on both shoulders, but it's not as easy to load from the top as a duffle bag style unless you have a second person to hold it open for you. Not a big deal, but something to consider. Over all it's a very good bag. If you plan to travel a lot I'd get something with wheels instead, however, because there's no way to make dive gear light if you're hauling on the cruise ship or through the airport. Also it's probably not secure enough to be a \"checked bag.\"",

The only minor tweak I would wish for is to have the shoulder straps shorter so the adjustment buckle is higher up to grab. With the current setup, the adjustment buckle ends up right behind my love handles and isn't the easiest to get to while I'm wearing the bag like a backpack.",

Bag held up great, and easily carried everything we needed. However, the shoulder straps are too narrow at the top, causing them to ride on my neck. Not a big deal for the 5-10 minute walks between the room and the boat, but I also used this as my carry-on bag for the flights. During extended carry periods (lines for getting on board, long hauls through connecting airports, etc...), the straps pulling on my neck got to be quite uncomfortable. The addition of a waist strap might alleviate this.",
