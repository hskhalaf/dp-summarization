The diameter of the top is not a standard size and I fear even if it were then the magnet protrusion of the lid would complicate things further. I hate to leave critical reviews especial for a small company but I feel that it's important to share this with folks. I wouldn't have made the large purchase if I had known this.",

Pressing the lids outwards from the inside alleviated the problem somewhat, but not enough so we ended up buying bar neodymium magnets to serve as a sort of baseline. With the added bar magnets, everything is good, but I'm a little upset I had to get them to make these usable. I like the labels that came with it, and there was a label for every spice we use, which I would guess is more than the average household.",
