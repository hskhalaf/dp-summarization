Maybe paper collated nails would work better but they are hard to fine. I guess for occasional home use it is ok but I would not recommend for the heavy user. I will say that I did like the Rigid from HomeDepot.",

However, in toe-nailing studs, I had to set the nails since the nailer did not drive them deep enough (with 120 lbs of pressure). Also, the Feeman can not seem nail as fast as the Porter Cable without allowing the compressor to have some recovery. However, for the price and as an occasional homeowner user, it works well. (no complaints). The nailer seems to be built well and no ovious issues. Much quicker than hand nailing for a reasonable price.",

I'd buy it again and would buy Freeman's other products as well. If the framing nailer is an example, their other products are an excellent value.",
