The pump works great for blowing up and for removing the air to store easily. The cover is nice but its hard to get the mattress rolled up well enough to fit in it. Long term I'll probably just use a king sized pillow case. Great product. Don't hesitate to spend the money on it.",

One drawback is that he is 6'1\" and his feet hang over the edge of the bed. For him it is about 5 inches too short. Totally our fault and yet another example of how we should have read the fine print on measurements more carefully. I am 5'6\" and could sleep on it without hanging over.",
