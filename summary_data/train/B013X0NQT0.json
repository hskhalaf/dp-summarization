I\u2019ve played around with emissity but it doesn\u2019t help. There doesn't seem to be a way to calibrate the temp. I've emailed Etekcity directly but my expectations are low. Thus is probably okay If you need approximate temps (oven, fireplace, etc) but ifneed something accurate, buy something else.",

The thermometer itself is well built and comfortable in the hand. I like using it and my wife laughs at me while I measure the temp of everything around me (including her haha).",
