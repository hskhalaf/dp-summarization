It fits my cooler packed lunch (~6.5in wide when full) and even my computer or a few notebooks next to it. Also plenty of space for my hydroflask, travel coffee mug, computer charger and other miscellaneous items as well! I was also worried that the straps might not be sturdy/strong enough for how much weight I was planning on putting in it on a daily basis, but the straps are leather with what looks like very sturdy stitching. Excited to break it in!",

It is very roomy, the zippers work smoothly, and the shoulder straps are sturdy as well as comfortable. The rosy brown/brown color looks very professional and classy. The smaller bag that comes with it, is one of the reasons I chose this particular bag, and I love it, too! I walk several city blocks to my office, and this bag has been the perfect one for me. I am very, very pleased with my bag!",

It not only came inside a dust bag, but also wrapped carefully in bubble wrap and then in the plastic shipping bag. Zippers all work smoothly and it\u2019s an extremely nice bag, holds a lot of stuff. I just ordered one for my daughter too because these are great for traveling, especially the smaller purse that comes with the bag. That\u2019s great for holding airline tickets, credits cards, etc. and using as a wristlet purse. Very good deal.",
