Many of the 1 star reviews will say that it's a cheap imitation due to the fact that an Army E02 folding shovel is supposed to be sharp as an axe....That being said, don't listen to them. The product is supposed to ship with a dull blade by law and local hardware store should be able to sharpen it for you.",

It's not fancy by any means, but it's a great simple product that beats most of the brand-name collapsible shovels in terms of price.",
