And the magnets hold it together with very little gaps. One star off because it has been a week and it still smells like rubber. We had to leave the door closed for the first few days just to get rid of the smell. Now it's somewhat bearable but still smells. Update. Upping my rating from 4 to 5 stars. I bought another one for my parents house. Placed the order yesterday. It arrived today at noon. Amazing.",

The strength of the magnets to keep the doors halves together is marginal at best. The final straw for returning this product was when the glue on the provided hook and loop tape failed. We thoroughly cleaned the application site, but that didn't matter. We came home to our screen in a pile at the foot of our door.",

Of course, once the strip tore loose, the screen didn't self-close any more; plus it has a tendency to magnetically stick to the steel entry door or the steel table next to the door in our breezeway (but that's not a \"quality\" issue).

My only problem with it is the adhesive strips don\u2019t hold up at the top very well so I had to use the tacks (included) to keep it attached to the door frame. If that part sags at all the middle does not fall back together where the magnets hold it closed. Otherwise, love it. Everyone that comes over and sees it complements how handy it is.",

I highly recommend that after you install the double sided tape, use the pins (included) to hold the screen down. I didn\u2019t used it at first and it made the screen slowly peel off. Once i pinned it down the screen is very sturdy.",
