This was obviously a used or returned item that I was expecting to be brand new and without GUM FROM SOME STRANGERS MOUTH! This is the most ridiculous thing I have seen from an order so far.",

The Furbacca is really better or at least as awesome as in the advertising. I would highly recommend this for kids and or big kids. And the shipping speed through Amazon is very fast. My only gripe would be the amazon shipping label on the outside of the product box. It was not sent in a shipping box. I am not sure why this was done, This definitely took away from the manufacturers packaging",

After reading reviews and researching I chose this guy. Say hello to Furbacca! A Wookie and a Furby that sings, dances, speaks, coos and hums the theme songs! He\u2019s cute, funny and quite odd. His eyes have LCD screens built in and display images too. We are all extremely happy with the brand new \u201c2015\u201d Furbacca-Furby .He\u2019s cute, fluffy, smart and is not overly annoying nor glitchy.

I wish this model's language adapted more like how I remember old Furbys but the Star Wars songs and wookie noises are fun.",
