I also occasionally use it for simple travel videos (hiking, boating, family fun) and it does a good job. The variable aperture isn\u2019t ideal for indoor shooting (video or photo), obviously, but for the price point, it\u2019s a good workhorse for outdoor videos, especially for personal use.",

Good things about this lens = sharpness in the center of the image is very good, relatively small size, very light weight, quick and accurate autofocus, reasonably priced (particularly 'used', as people are selling off this kit lens left and right).",

    "title": "Sony 28-70mm F3.5-5.6 FE OSS Interchangeable Standard Zoom Lens",
    "description": "This affordable high-performance zoom lens is not only compact and lightweight, but it has been specifically designed to bring out the best in the a7-series full-frame E-mount bodies as well. The zoom range extends from 28mm through 70mm, providing easy access to the most frequently used angles of view, and thanks to an advanced optical design the change in overall lens length during zooming is minimal\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nFE 28-70MM F3.5-5.6 OSS FULL-FRAME ZOOM LENS\nThis affordable mid-range zoom lens for 35mm full frame format cameras combines high optical performance with compact, lightweight convenience. The FE 28-70mm is ideal for a wide range of subjects, and is dust and moisture resistant for consistent reliability. Optical SteadyShot image stabilization included.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nCIRCULAR APERTURE\nWhen changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. \u03b1 lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.\n\nED (EXTRA-LOW DISPERSION) GLASS\nAs focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.\n\nASPHERICAL LENS ELEMENTS\nAspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.\n\nLENS-BASED OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION\nGyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nINTERNAL FOCUSING\nOnly the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if you\u2019re using a polarizing filter.\n\n\n2013 Sony Electronics Inc. All rights reserved.
