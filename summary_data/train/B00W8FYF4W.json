Though I can see how it could get uninteresting if you play quite often. This is the first game I have bought in about 8-10 years. However, I really like this one because there is no bad language and I don't have to worry about my kids walking in and seeing someone naked or blood and guts everywhere. It is very difficult to find clean, entertaining games (I know I am in a small minority). Overall, I enjoy it.",

It's a bit too good in quality (my PC slows considerably) and the game conveniently comes with options to better fit the demands of the computer's features. I do need to connect to the internet every once in a while to play it, (even if I want to offline) but I love this game. Thanks so much!",

Skip this--Just go to Origin and buy it there and you can download it play right away--without waiting for a code to come in the mail, geesh! BTW- Great game! Superior graphics, solid FPS with a heavy Star Wars Theme. Play as heroes, fly X-Wings, gather rank through XP and use credits earned in game to \"level\" or buy new blasters and appearances. Fun!",
