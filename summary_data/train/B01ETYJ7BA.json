I fully charge it, take a few pics, then try to turn it off, but the indicator light next to the power button stays on, and within a day, it's dead again. It didn't come with any instructions, nor are the online instructions very useful or comprehensive, so I'm just assuming the power button works like a normal power button--click on, click off. Seems like a reasonable assumption. But this device seems to not work like that. So ultimately, it's almost completely useless. Sad. I had high hopes.",

They have left me high and dry in the middle of a chat conversation. I will email them, but don't have much hope of getting anywhere.",

Now it\u2019s your turn to try the revolutionary technology that\u2019s putting the fun back in photography!\n\nAbout the Startup \nDescribe your product in 3 words.\n\nIncredible instant photos. \n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nWe started working on Prynt during our last semester of college, inspired by the idea of combining something tangible with something digital. Turning your smartphone into a Polaroid seemed just crazy and cool enough to work. \n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nPrynt is the first photo-printing case for your phone, and it lets you share more than just an instant by saving a video inside of your Prynt photo. We designed Prynt in Paris with an emphasis on an authentic camera experience that\u2019s integrates seamlessly with your phone. \n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nBuilding a team and watching the people that have joined us develop. We are also really proud of the diversity in our team; because everyone brings a different point of view, we are able to be even more creative as a company.",
