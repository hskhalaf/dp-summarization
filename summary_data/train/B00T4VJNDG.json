The lancets received work fine although they do not fit as snugly in the lancing device as the Bayer brand lancets do. It is necessary to make sure the lancet cap is loosened (twist cap to loosen) so that the lancet once inserted into the lancing device doesn't slip forward when the lancet cap is pulled off prior to use. I will likely purchase this item again as the lancing device wears out from use. Recommended product!",
