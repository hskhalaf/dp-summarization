One of the welcomed features was the Pivot Point as it allowed for smooth twists and turns without putting pressure on the knees and ankles. The cage-like lacing system also appealed to many training enthusiasts who were looking for a shoe with adequate lateral support. Though the trainer received positive reviews, some wearers were not pleased that it did not have adequate ankle and heel support. It also caused foot discomfort and pain for several individuals.",

During weight lifting they felt flimsy and like my feet weren't connected with the ground. During dynamic movements such as burpees and box jumps they felt flimsy and sloppy. I also tried some short runs in workouts with them and got calf cramps. Unfortunately I'll be returning them. They also cause pain for my bunion. I had high hopes for Ryka and I hope these shoes aren't indicative of the entire line.",
