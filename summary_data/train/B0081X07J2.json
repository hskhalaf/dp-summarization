Doesn't work touching hands and tummy. 30 seconds and turns off, it takes that to respond so it's not ongoing if that's what you want. I am extremely disappointed. Grandsons birthday is a couple days away and really thought this was going to be a decent present. I read great reviews not sure if they actually have the one I received but this is far from being a 4 star let alone a 5 star rating!",
