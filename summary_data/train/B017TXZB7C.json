Be aware though (and this is why I am docking a point) the sizing chart is slightly off on the picture. A medium it says is 3.5-4.75 inches (which both my wife and I fit in this range). The packaging for the medium though says 4-4.75. I was just over 4 but my wife was just under. They still worked but want people to know the issue.",

Best ones I've used. Use multiple times per week and they are very durable. Another very nice touch is that the Velcro strap around your wrist is long enough where you don't have to completely unravel the strap to get on and off...just makes them easy and quick to throw on and off. Best I've ever seen/used.",

The finger holes are rectangular shaped and pretty big so they slide when she tries to use them, exposing the skin that she is trying to protect with these grips. Also, the cut of the leather for the finger holes is cut at a slight angle, so it almost has a sharp edge that digs into her painfully when she tries to use them. Might try to trim that off with a razor blade, but hate to do that with an almost new item. Don't know how much use we'll be getting out of these.",

I'm sure if I pushed through it I'd just develop thick, scratchy callouses that would only bleed occasionally -- yeah, no thanks.
