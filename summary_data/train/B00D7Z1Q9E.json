As others have noted, but just to reinforce, the bulbs hum noticeably at all dimming levels, when tested in a variety of inexpensive to very expensive switches. The range of dimming is quite limited, and no where near approaches the range of incandescent bulbs or newer LEDs. Thus, these may be useful- if found at a great price - in an application that does not require dimming, in which case a CFL bulb might still be a better cost-option.",

In addition, I added a Lutron Toggler dimmer switch to replace the original on/off switch. Now I can adjust the lighting in my Family Room to set or suit the mood. The bulbs only get hot at the heat sink around the neck of the bulb and you can touch the globe of the bulb, at full brightness, without burning your fingers. Since the ceiling fan hangs fairly low, It provides a bit of safety feature, should small fingers try and touch the glowing bulb.",

To me 'mail it in' is simply code for 'we don't want to stand behind our \"warranty\"'. Do the math, Feit. How much are you spending to process returned bulbs? How much are you saving by not sending replacement bulbs to customers who have a warranty claim when they don't mail one in? How much goodwill are you losing as a result?",
