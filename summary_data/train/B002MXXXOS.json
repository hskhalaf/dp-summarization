I am trying not to get out of the house, so I cannot go out to find replacement spacers ( if that is even possible) and I cannot hang the pegboard up without them. I guess I will have to return the item as it is both broken and incomplete! If I could give this a 0 I would.",

      "text": "I thought this would be a cost-effective organizer for my craft room. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with any worthwhile set up instructions. The instructions seem to refer to holes that don't exist because they were filed in with plastic. The metal parts that came with the set are unexplained and mysterious. We've drilled out the holes and attached them to the walls, but this is a very inelegant solution. Once you get the pegboards up, there are a selection of mounting options using the pegboard. But putting the pegboards up is an exercise in frustration. There are better options out there, including purchasing pegboards from the box store and doing this yourself.",
