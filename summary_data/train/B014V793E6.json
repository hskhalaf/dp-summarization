I've tried several since moving back to the US 6 years ago and I can easily say this is the best one I've found.

So when I ordered this product my one hope was that it\u2019s installation would not require \u201chandiness\u201d. It did not! I installed this product to my toilet in like 7 minutes. Instructions were straight forward and easy to follow, and the product itself was designed with ease of installation in mind. IF THAT\u2019S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU, I will say that the product works wonderfully. I haven\u2019t tried any other diaper sprayers, but this one does the job and does it well. Great pressure, so I high that I\u2019d suggest a water shield because without one I\u2019m sure there\u2019d be a mess.",

I didn't report it or try to get a refund because i thought it was just worn out from almost a year of use.

The hook for the toilet had holes that were too small for the screws provided. I contacted the seller and the same day they sent out a new holder and screws Priority Mail.

Parts are sturdy and have necessary o-rings to prevent leaks. I like having control of the flow both with the shutoff valve and the sprayer handle. Cons: The sprayer seems to catch a little when taking it off the holder. Nothing extreme, but it could be annoying over time. Happy so far, but I may have more feedback once we start spraying diapers with it later this year. Will update if necessary!",
