We took this bag camping overnight when the low temperature took a surprising dip south to 40 degrees. It is rated for 32-50 and definitely fulfilled our expectations. Coleman's sleeping bags have been reliably good in our experience. We have bought Coleman bags and tents for the last 15 years and have always found them to be good value.

Coleman isn't the lightest or highest tech...but they have mastered simple, inexpensive products that last. Construction is good, straight seams and no 'irish pennants'' all over. Length is good (I'm 5-6\") and plenty of room inside it. Not a mummy bag, just standard sleeping bag shape. Now...this thing is new and the interior fabric, while heavy duty, is also stiff. Like new flannel shirt stiff. I will probably wash this (per tag) to see if it softens up any.....just cause of that I'm dinging a -1 on the stars.",

    "title": "Coleman Green Valley Cool Weather Adult Sleeping Bag",
    "description": "Sleep comfortably when camping in temperatures as low as 30\u00b0F with the Coleman Palmetto Cool-Weather Sleeping Bag. Featuring a brushed polyester cover, cozy cotton flannel liner, and a ComfortCuff that surrounds your face in soft, warm fabric, this sleeping bag is ideal for cool nights in the great outdoors. Fiberlock construction keeps the insulation from shifting, reducing cold spots and increasing durability, and a Thermolock draft tube helps prevent heat from escaping through the zipper. The 2-way patented ZipPlow system plows fabric away from the zipper to prevent snags and frustration. When it's time to pack up, this lightweight backpacking sleeping bag rolls and fastens quickly with its Roll Control design and Quick Cord system. This adult sleeping bag can accommodate most people up to 5 feet 11 inches tall and is machine washable for easy cleaning.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nIdeal for cool weather camping where the temperature range is between 30 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit, the Coleman Green Valley sleeping bag is durably constructed of a polyester cover with soft, cozy cotton-flannel lining. Three pounds of ColeTherm insulation keep you comfortable throughout the night, and the bag measures 33-by-75 inches (W x D), fitting most campers up to five feet, 11 inches tall. QuickCord storage means fast, tie-free closure of the sleeping bag when it's time to strike camp. \n\n The Green Valley sleeping bag includes Coleman's ComfortSmart technology, meaning it's full of features to keep you warm and comfortable, such as: \n\n * ZipPlow: Prevents zipper snags by plowing fabric away from zipper \n * Roll Control: Locks bag in place for easier rolling \n * FiberLock: Prevents insulation from shifting, increasing durability \n * ThermoLock: Reduces heat loss through the zipper, keeping you warmer \n * Certified Temperature Rating: Independently tested for temperature accuracy \n * Zipper Glide Tailoring: Allows smooth zipper operation around the corner \n * Comfort Cuff: Surrounds your face with softness \n\n The Coleman Limited Warranty\nColeman has been in business for more than 100 years, and continues to produce high-quality, affordable tents, lanterns, table-top stoves, and more. All Coleman products have a warranty against defects in material and workmanship, and the Green Valley sleeping bag includes a limited five-year manufacturer's warranty. \n\n About Coleman Outdoor Products\nMore than 100 years ago, an entrepreneurial young man named W.C. Coleman had an idea for manufacturing better lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. A century later, Coleman's current catalog features a wide-ranging array of products that make spending time outside a pleasure. The company crafts coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days, airbeds that are comfortable and won't deflate during the night, a complete line of bright and long-lasting LED lights, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and more.",
