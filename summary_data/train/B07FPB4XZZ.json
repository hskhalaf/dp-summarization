Also, the crank itself is easy when opening, but one umbrella is extremely difficult to close, I feel like it may break quickly, so try not to open and close often.

I will post again in a couple years and let you know how colorfast it is. The ad was clear it was a 9\u2019 umbrella so my hope that it was bigger was just that. It seems ok. And if is really Su nBrella fabric and is as colorfast as the one I\u2019ve had for four years or so it was still a good buy.",

The very first time I opened it, the rope snapped out of the mechanism. After lots of attempts, we finally got it back in place and tied it through a metal nut to keep it in place. When tilted, it spins around and around at the slightest breeze. I also do not think it was Sunbrella fabric and I\u2019m shocked that Sunbrella allows this listing to claim it.",
