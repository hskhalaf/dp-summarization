From other reviews, it sounds like other customers have received empty boxes or dummy phones. Customer service is processing a replacement. Hopefully that goes alright.

Replaced it with an S10 bought at my local T-Mobile store. No question as to authenticity. The moral of the story: if you want a phone that you KNOW is authentic, works and is backed by warranty . . . buy it from the manufacturer or your carrier.

I'm giving another 3rd party a chance, and honestly I'm not really optimistic . Amazon provided me a courtesy credit which was nice; however, there's no real way of knowing if the seller is blacklisted.",

I just had a 45-day around the country road trip, like 99% of the time the Samsung Pay worked(except the gas stations), so I just kept a Costco credit card in my car for gas and didn't need to carry the wallet with me anymore. But sadly the newer model Samsung Galaxy S10 e moved the fingerprint sensor to the side power button, which makes that sensor much less responsive and hard to use. keep your S9!",

The Bixby thing is OK. But sometimes it won't respond. It takes so much patience for the QR code to be scanned. Mostly it won't scan the QR code. Camera is good. Previous phone was Redmi which had much battery life and speed with double amount of apps installed",
