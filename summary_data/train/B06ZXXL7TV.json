We haven\u2019t used them for pool shoes, but for regular summer shoes he can wear without socks. They are very comfortable and easy to clean. We got the bright green/yellow color and I\u2019ll say they are very colorful. They\u2019ve been easy to keep up with at crowded bouncy houses or anywhere else kids run around with no shoes. I would definitely recommend these to friends.",

We are going to use them today but when i tried them they seemed pretty comfy and the spandex seems to help help to that he doesn't get hurt at the top!",

Good price and glad they have some gender-neutral colors (we got the grey and orange). She seems to find them comfortable, doesn't try to take them off or anything like that. I originally ordered big after seeing the other reviews, but ended up getting something closer to the same size she's wearing in other brands.",
