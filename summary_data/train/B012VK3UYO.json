Most watch stands don't take into account for the possibility that people use cases on their watch. This stand does just that, While there is no good way to use this stand if you wish to use nightstand mode but it is still possible. The Cable management could be tighter. Would be even better if they machined it into the aluminum to better cancel the cord, but over all a good design.",

The round charger has to go on the back of the watch, and then the watch just flops on the table. I love how this stand neatly permanently houses the charger, and then I just set the watch on the stand. It was well designed with feet on the bottom so it doesn't move easily. I also like its classy, gold look. I highly recommend this stand for people who like organization in their lives.",

Also the company sends a cute thank you note that is a sweet touch. Very happy with this product will order from them again",

The hole that comes in the rubber insert is just a hair too small for the charging puck that came with my watch. I simply took my trusty rotary too with a small grinding bit, and SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY ground away at the channel where the cord goes. It only took a few minutes and presto, the puck for my watch fit perfectly. I simply place it on the charging stand, and it charges my watch without fail. Not just for iFruit, after all!",

In addition, it looks nice and it wasn't hard to set up. I'm very happy with this purchase.",

With this stand, it always charges 100% and is the iWatch is cool to the touch in the mornings since it's using the original Apple cord.

When asked for a review I mentioned the above problems and customer service said improvements were made after I purchased in December and then was given a refund so that I could purchase the new and improved one. I didn't expect that at all and felt like that was above and beyond good customer service. I'll be purchasing the new one soon!",

The hole to place the round apple charger is too small, so you are not able to push the power source flush to the top, therefore, it holds the watch but no connection can be made. I tried pushing it so hard, I thought the cable was going to break and gave up trying to make it work",
