This camera has a great feature, vari-angle LCD that extends freedom of shooting from high angle to ground level view. Highly recommended. Excellent service from seller and super fast delivery!",

I also have a K-S1 with this problem. An internet search will tell you all about it. As far as I know, Pentax has not offered any recall or extended warranty to fix the issue, which first appeared on the K-30 and K-50 models. I'm very disappointed that Pentax can let this problem linger through so many models. It makes me question the reliability and quality of their cameras.",

I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for an entry to intermediate level camera that's on a budget. I've included a few photos I've taken with 3 different lenses. The lenses used were a DA L 18-55 for the Landscapes, a DA L 55-300 for the bird shots, and the night time shots a DA 50.",

THE BAD: - Its video quality is middling to poor. An all-round good Pentax camera offering good quality you would expect but should only be purchased for the image quality aspect as the video shooting leaves some to be desired. If video will be important then maybe try something like this Canon here:",
