They're easy to raise, lower & tilt. I love the crank-to-tilt feature! All of our guests comment on how pretty they are. We lower them every evening, but leave them in the tables. They were unaffected by thunderstorms & wind. A good buy!",

Just keep winding the handle until the umbrella tilts to the position you want. I did not want to have to fight with a button mechanism so this was an important feature for me and it's easy to operate. The umbrella came essentially assembled already (just 2 pieces) and arrived super fast. Excellent product and very pleased with purchase",

Seller contacted the factory, factory responded to the seller with a message saying they don't make eight foot umbrellas. I'm told my only recourse is to return the umbrella. They need to relist this umbrella as an 8ft umbrella, rather than a 9ft. At least the quality is better than most, but it should be for the price.",

The pole is bronze in color, but coordinates well with my gray patio set, because it isn't too brown. The color looks bright and cheery and I have already received a number of compliments on it. Definitely an uprgade from my faded red umbrella. There is a Velcro strap to keep it closed, which works great. We live in Utah and have very strong wind, and it stays put (when it is closed).",

Or perhaps, we were all trying too hard to figure it out. It's easy, but no one had experienced it before. It was a construction worker who figured it out. We were all afraid to break it.

Umbrella is now working well and actually pretty terrific.",

We especially like the strap with a velcro closure which secures the umbrella firmly when not in use. They appear quite sturdy and have a vent on the top which allows wind flow. For the price, I feel we got a great buy. Our pool furniture is turquoise and white and the umbrellas match perfectly. Observers have remarked that they add a \"touch of class\" to our pool area.",
