And I was looking for something to keep his hands warm riding in new england winters -- he said that every part of him was cold but his hands today. So I do recommend these especially for the price.",

The coldest I used them was around 10F (-12 C) and the fingers stay flexible during 20-30 min rides. I used them in one thunderstorm and they keep the water out for about 20 minutes. A minor point is that the dye seems not to be uniform, I got 3-4 'white spots' near the wrists. No size guide is given for these gloves, so I used XXL which I also have in Gore running gloves.",

    "description": "Looking for a superior solution to keep your hands warm while you ride your motorcycle? Look no further than our men\u2019s genuine leather, cold weather riding gloves! No matter when you choose to ride, do it while keeping your hands warm with these stylish and fitted leather gloves. We construct our fashionable and cozy gloves from real leather, meaning you can rely on them to last for years. Plus, these gloves aren\u2019t just for one occasion! We\u2019ve specifically designed these gloves to be used for a wide variety of activities. Whether you\u2019re attending a business event, a wedding, or engaging in outdoor activities like bicycling, golf, or motorcycle riding, our gloves can give you the warm protection and grip your hands need. If you\u2019re engaged in rough work or you need some extra heat for your hands, use these gloves as a thermal lining. They\u2019ll slip under a pair of large gloves and cinch tight with their elastic at the wrist. They trap the heat inside, keeping your hands warm. Our gloves can fit most hand sizes and come in S, M, L, XL, and XXL. With a beautiful black coloring, these gloves will serve you well through all your parties or activities during the winter.
