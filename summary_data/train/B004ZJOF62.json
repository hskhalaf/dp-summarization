      "text": "I bought this for our 18 year old cat who loved to seek out warm places. As she got older, she had a more difficult time staying warm. She loved this \"condo\"! It doesn't get too hot, just warm. So, I didn't have to worry about her getting burned or anything like that. It's easy to put together, take down and very easy to clean! Unfortunately, Misty passed away recently. I gave this to my sister for her kitties. When we get new cats, I'll purchase this again!",

I have three kittens all under a year old, so the size is perfect for them right now, but they still have a lot of growing to do and it will be interesting to see how it holds up. Very attractive looking and even though the kittens completely ignored it for the first couple of days, they now love it and take turns using it. The youngest and smallest of the three likes to sit on the top, which is good since I am not quite sure how sturdy it is. Overall, great for the price.",

It provides adequate heat for South Texas and cleans up easily. I start by brushing it off and wash it with soap and water occasionally. The flat top is a great idea: I can put my jar of Meow Mix up there to drop into the bowls that are right outside the house door.",

One thing I appreciate is that the top zips off if the kitty doesn't want to come out, and digs her claws in. I can open the top and snatch her out before she knows what's up.",

Hopefully she learns to associate it with warmth soon, but right now she prefers to be held! The pad doesn't get super hot, just slightly warm to touch. It kind of feels the warm patch a cat would leave behind after they've been sleeping on your bed. This is great because it means kitty won't overheat when sleeping inside. Will update later when kitty is older to report whether she actually uses it regularly.",

Two of our cats, one about 8 lbs, the other about 16 lbs curl up in one bed - it's snug, but I'm sure it's extra warm that way. There is a learning curve for the cats however. you have to coax the cats into the bed at first, because my understanding is that the bed has to have weight on it to get warm, but once they are in it long enough to realize it is heated, it's a cat magnet. Had one of the beds for about a year and it still works great.",
