I would say I could install one but the phone does have a data indicator so you know how much data is used and you can set a bar to notify you when your limit has been reached or close to reaching. The phone works great. Does not lag. Picture is great. Camera can get fuzzy with certain lights but so do many other cell phone cameras. Sound is amazing. Sounds so clear coming from a cell phone.",

Even if I was only 10 ft. away from the router, nothing. My latest issue is that unless I have an active call, I do not receive incoming calls. It rings once and goes directly to VM.
