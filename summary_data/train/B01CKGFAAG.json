The bolts provided to assemble the chair are entirely too short to support any weight for the rated usage, however, the independent purchase of longer bolts has made the chair usable. I am only keeping it because it would cost too much to ship it back for a refund. I would not buy this chair if you have other options.",

The fact that this chair only had 1 review should have been a red flag, but because I was so over the whole process, I settled on this one and I do mean settled! This chair looks and feels great until you sit in it. There is absolutely no lower lumbar support, at all! This is the most uncomfortable chair I have ever sat in. DO NOT waste your money on this one. The previous reviewer stated that she received the chair at a discounted price in exchange for her honest review, but I think her honest review was influenced by the discount she received! #junk!",

I replaced the wheels with the ToolKee Rollerblade Office Chair Wheels Casters which are large and roll much better. Many people simply buy a chair in this price band and complain but if you add the wheels its easily a chair worth a hundred more. I also suggest buying two achieving a partners desk even with smaller desk sets.",
