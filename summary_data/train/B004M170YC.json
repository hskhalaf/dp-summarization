I was skeptical about it but I am surely happy with my purchase because it is lightweight enough to be a vlogging camera but also makes it look like I mean business when I'm recording a video for my youtube channel! another plus would be the flip screen! I had to have it once I saw that it was a flip screen AND that screen just so happens to be a touch screen! also the best customer service I've ever got on Amazon!",

With a little experimentation, we have learned to take some great pictures! We took newborn pictures that rivaled some of our friend's professionally done pictures. I even had people asking who took the pictures! The controls are easy to use and understand. The battery rarely needs to be charged. We can tell a big difference in quality between the pictures taken with our camera vs. the pictures we take with our phone. I'm really glad that we have this camera for special life events and family pictures.",

Other than that the other upgraded features don't make a difference to me. The $200 extra seemed too much just for that.

You still have all the features of a point and shoot, but a couple additional modes to allow more freedom. there are explanations for many of the settings to help you learn as you choose your options. And the camera is small enough (with an average size lens) to travel easily.",

The only bad part of this camera is the continuous shooting; this is bad especially if you are taking pictures of sports. I have also notice that it tends to overexpose pictures in bright sunlight. Of course this can be fixed by using manual settings Pros Video and picture quality - 18 Megapixels! HDMI output Great and fast autofocus Cons Slow frame rate - (sports) Live view AF is laggy",

It has everything that I expected and more, great pictures; for the amateurs is very easy to use and very complete for the experienced. The only thing that I might recommend to anyone looking to buy this camera is that they should get the 18-135mm lens to have more versatility, I got it with the 18-55mm because of the cost but in the future I plan to upgrade the lenses.",

The kit lens the T3i comes with (EF-S 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 IS) is fine for a while but if you take a lot of pictures you might notice that it can give you soft pictures at the telephoto end.

By simply rotating the monitor, you can hold the camera directly overhead for above-the-crowd shots at concerts, or hold the camera at a low angle for kids and pets. By rotating the LCD monitor fully, the EOS Rebel T3i becomes the ideal camera for self-portraits. The EOS Rebel T3i freely enables easy angle adjustments even if the camera is mounted on a tripod or has a battery grip attached.\n\nModel used is not EOS Rebel T3i and is used to illustrate vari-angle feature only.\n\nWith 1,040,000 (dots/VGA) pixels for spectacular detail, the advanced, smudge-resistant monitor includes high transparency materials plus anti-reflective and water-repellant coatings to provide clear and bright viewing. Superb for reviewing, editing and deleting photos or composing new images in Live View function, the Vari-angle Clear View LCD monitor is also the perfect means for accessing camera settings like ISO, metering modes, AF Point selection, the horizontal Electronic Level and flash options. \n\n\nAutomatic Scene Analysis for Standout Color. \nNew Scene Intelligent Auto mode and Picture Style Auto incorporating the new EOS Scene Detection System to capture beautiful scenes with ease. \nThe EOS Rebel T3i DSLR\u2019s new Scene Intelligent Auto mode unites five Canon digital camera technologies \u2013 the new Picture Style Auto, plus Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure \u2013into a powerful new feature for photographers. Using the advanced EOS Scene Detection System, the camera automatically analyzes the image, taking into account faces, colors, brightness, movement and contrast. Scene Intelligent Auto then chooses the enhancing features to deliver maximum impact. Blues and greens are more vivid, \u201chot\u201d colors are more fiery, and skin tones are smooth and truer to life. \n\nIntelligent Scene Analysis for Superb Exposure. \nEnhanced metering with a 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system for accurate metering between exposures, and 9-point AF system utilizing a high precision, f/2.8 cross-type center point. \nThe EOS Rebel T3i features a sophisticated, 63-zone Dual-layer sensor designed to complement the 9-point AF system. By taking into account the color and luminosity surrounding chosen AF points, this system delivers an advanced level of accuracy for better results even in difficult lighting situations. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized; the EOS Rebel T3i gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as in a theater or concert hall. This makes the EOS Rebel T3i ideal for scenes with extreme difference in brightness such as brightly lit scenes or backlit scenes; the camera balances exposure of the main subject at the background, and exposures are not overly influenced by bright areas in the shot. Since the EOS Rebel T3i provides high-speed X-sync (\u201cX-sync\u201d means the fastest shutter speed that can synchronize with a flash burst at the moment the shutter is fully released) up to 1/200 sec., the range of photographic expression is dramatically increased, allowing the EOS Rebel T3i to be used with confidence in bright scenes or dim.\n\n \n63-zone Metering System\n\nMake Your Images As You See Them. \nExpress your creativity with advanced imaging features like Basic+ function, Multi-Aspect function and Creative Filters.\nBasic+ is a new creative imaging feature that makes it easy to create the image effects you want. It can be set with the Quick Control screen in Basic Zone modes. Basic+ provides two options:\n\nShoot by ambience selection\nBased on the Picture Style and its parameters (sharpness, contrast, saturation, and color tone), the exposure compensation and white balance correction are adjusted to attain the selected ambience. You can also can also select the strength of the ambience effect.\n\nShoot by lighting or scene type\nAlthough the actual parameter set is the white balance, the settings are expressed in more understandable terms.\n\nThe Multi-Aspect Function of the EOS Rebel T3i lets you express an image in one of three ways by matching the aspect ratio to each scene. In addition to the camera\u2019s standard 3:2 ration, the Multi-Aspect Function includes a 1:1 ratio that creates the sensation that the viewer's gaze is focusing upon the center of the image. At the 4:3 ratio, you get nearly the same aspect ratio as a regular TV or a 4:3 computer display. The 16:9 aspect ratio provides a wide look, much the same as HDTV.\n\nThe EOS Rebel T3i incorporates five in-camera Creative Filters so you can artistically manipulate scenes without the aid of an outside computer. Soft Focus lends a dreamy, romantic aspect, while Grainy Black and White gives a dramatically gritty, hard-bitten look. Miniature Effect creates an illusion in which expansive subjects are seemingly reduced to doll-house-like proportions, and Toy Camera Effect recreates the colors and softness rendered by cameras with a plastic lens, an effect often sought after by art photographers. Fish Eye Effect mimics the \u201cFisheye\u201d lenses that are favorites of professional photographers for their quirky, convex perspective. \n\n\nNever Miss a Moment. \n3.7 fps continuous shooting up to approximately 34 JPEGs or approximately 6 RAW. \nThe EOS Rebel T3i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second (fps) for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34 full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS Rebel T3i can capture even rapidly-unfolding scenes with ease. \n\n\n\n\nPhotography Made Truly Easy. \nNew Feature Guide offers short descriptions of each function and Quick Control screen for easy operation. \nThe Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR demystifies great photography by including an in-camera Feature Guide. Appearing on the camera\u2019s LCD, the Feature Guide displays a simple description or advice for the respective function. It is displayed in each shooting mode, during Mode Dial operations, and for Quick Control screen functions (during normal shooting, Live View shooting, movie shooting, and playback). The Feature Guide appears automatically during Mode Dial operations and when a function is selected on the Quick Control screen. \n\n\nFlexible Storage with Memory Cards. \nCompatibility with SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards. \nThe EOS Rebel T3i uses popular SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards. Compact, inexpensive and available in increasingly large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel T3i DSLR\u2019s compact and lightweight body design. \n\nAdditionally, the EOS Rebel T3i is compatible with Eye-Fi* SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and an internal antenna for wireless, high-speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel EOS Rebel T3i can display the Eye-Fi\u2019s connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.\n\n*Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer.

With a dizzying array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T3i with superlative Canon optics.\n\n\n\nFlash Photography\nWith a flash sync speed of 1/200 of a second, the EOS Rebel T3i also features the acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. With any of the flashes in the EX Speedlite line, E-TTL II provides reliable flash output whether shooting fill-in flash pictures in sunlight, or using flash in total darkness. With E-TTL II, the exact same 35-zone metering sensor used for measuring ambient light is also used for flash metering \u2014 giving even finer metering command of the image area. If you prefer a broader area for flash metering, there\u2019s a menu setting to change to \u201cAverage\u201d flash metering \u2014 where the entire 35-zone area is measured evenly for flash exposure. Additionally, the EOS Rebel T3i has a Speedlite transmitter built-in for convenient, full-featured wireless control of EX-series Speedlite flashes set as slave units.\n\nThe Canon Speedlite 430EX II is the ideal step-up accessory for powerful flash shooting with the EOS Rebel T3i. It has excellent flash power (maximum guide number of 141 ft./43m at ISO 100), and is the perfect way to get great flash pictures when you can't get right up to the subject. The 430EX II is also great for bounce flash, with its tilting and swiveling flash head. It automatically zooms the flash head to cover lenses ranging from 16mm up to 105mm or longer with the EOS Rebel T3i. Of course, it works with the camera to provide full E-TTL II automatic flash exposure. And the 430EX II has a powerful AF-assist beam, which allows the camera to autofocus even in total darkness on subjects as far as 32 ft. from the camera.\n\n \nSpeedlite 430EX II",
