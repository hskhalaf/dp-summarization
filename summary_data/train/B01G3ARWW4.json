I actually wouldn\u2019t have bought it if I had noticed the artificial sweetener as an ingredient. I managed my way through half the box and then couldn\u2019t deal with it any longer. Too sweet and I got headaches. Also, it doesn\u2019t taste like actual strawberry or kiwi, just the industry standard flavor of \u201cstrawberry-kiwi\u201d. Not tangy or tart at all.",

I think I\u2019m just older now and they\u2019re too sweet for me. But they are really convenient and I\u2019m sure are great for kids still for snacks.",
