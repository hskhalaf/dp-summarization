Reels are just to hold line so I thought I would try this reel. The drag and reeling seem smooth but after reeling in line the drag system loosens up. So when you try to strip line off it again it backlashes since the drag loosened. Get what you pay for I guess.",

It frequently loosens and randomly freewheels causing a nasty birdsnest/backlash. I exchanged feedback with the seller concerning the capacity issue. Their response was \"sorry about that but we'll increase it on the next version\". No offer to exchange. You know I purchased this because it is a good looking reel and looks sweet on my rod... better than a name brand black unit. However functionally it is junk.",

However rigorous testing with the backing and fly line it has not damaged either line. Compared to other high end cnc reels these perform as good if not better. The drag works well with no complaints. I bought this reel after using the 7/8s for a saltwater trip and was extremely impressed with the durability and how smooth the reel and drag performed. Changing from right to left handed was very easy.",

I am a right but prefer to reel with left hand. Watched YouTube video . when unspooling line from reel there is no option (that I have found yet) to turn ratcheting on or off. Currently there is no ratchet. It is silent. Overall appearance is really nice. There is a little play between the spool and its axle; however, it is not significant especially for what we paid. With the availability of the spare spool for $25 this is a really nice bargan. Items were delivered on time.",

There are plenty of saltwater species such as Redfish, Speckled Trout and Snook for this little reel to handle. The build is solid and feels like a more expensive type machined fly reel. For the money and the quality, you just can't beat the Piscifun Sword fly fishing reel.",
