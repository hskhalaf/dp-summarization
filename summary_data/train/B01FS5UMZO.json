      "text": "I've been using the long IKEA plastic shoe horns (that look like a snake) for many years. They have been great for getting my shoes on quickly, as I'm often taking my dogs outside and don't wear shoes indoors. The plastic keeps cracking, though, every year or two. I first bought the blue handled ones and now this orange one. Hopefully, these metal ones will last longer. My only suggestion is to make the logo or something on one side more apparent so I can quickly identify the correct side. I used a sticker, which I'm sure will fall off at some point.",

This tucks neatly into a book rack by the couch, and is long enough to avoid struggling to reach the boots. I can't say how the handle will hold up, but I'm fairly sure the metal blade will never bend--very sturdy.",

There may be issues with the para cord, but i have not had any problems since I pay close attention to the potential issues (as others have warned). The ONLY issue I Have with this unit is that the tip of the tongue is HUGE and not suitable for kid's shoes. Otherwise, it's a great adults shoe horn. (ladies dress shoes may also have issues with this tip of this unit being too wide. Great quality metal though, enjoy!",

He keeps it in his sports bag and uses it to get his various athletic shoes on quickly. I wondered at first about the longer handle but it gives great leverage which is probably why it's good for kids and older people.",
