It is everything we expected it to be! By keeping the clay wet there is plenty of power to make the pottery. The directions are easy to follow and the kit includes everything to make several finished pieces. My daughter really loved it and was able to make the second piece by herself.",

First the clay would not mold, no matter how much water you spray on or dump on (lol) and then to have to try and form it as the table somewhat spun...needless to say, nothing came out remotely like it should have, and there was no lack in trying! The clean up was a disaster. Good luck to anyone who takes on this craft. The idea around this is goo, but allot needs to be done before its perfected.",

It took longer than 24 hours for the turtle to dry enough to paint (more like 48 hrs) but we live in a humid climate, so that may be the issue. She loves it. I love that she loves it.

I put one of the unopened clay disks on it, so it slowed down even further. I thought if the kid had to put any pressure on it to sculpt, it would likely stop rotating completely. Even without anything on it, it was loud my kid thought the motor was burning out. Incredibly disappointing for the kid because it seemed like a good creative outlet. It also had four holes in the turntable surface to anchor their molds. I think this would make it really difficult or messy to freeform the pottery.",
