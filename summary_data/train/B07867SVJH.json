For my bathroom without a window, but I do have fans. I may get another one for other guest bath. They do recommend an air gap be left around it of 19 inches which is a lot. Update. Give it the gap and it collects a lot more water. I put it on the floor for many hours and move it around. Bathrooms look a lot cleaner afterwards, it brighten them up.",
