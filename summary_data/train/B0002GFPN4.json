      "text": "It's a coated Remo skin. Can get tight and tasty near the rim, or produce a big fat dead blow. Nice scritchy-scratchy brushes sounds. Detunes so very well for that 'bwaoouuiing\" noise. You can even put these on your toms, at the very least doubling your fun! And they're cheap enough that you can bang the crap out of them with little financial consequence if they split. Remo's quality hasn't changed appreciably during the 15 years I've been playing, far as I can tell, so there's zero reason I can't recommend this skin. There might be some more boutique pieces, but why, unless you're doing super serious session stuff in the studio?",

Soon after I got this head, I bought an Evans UV1. The Ambassador is good, but the quality, durability, and sound of the UV1 far surpasses the Remo head. Bottom line: All hail Evans as the greatest drum head makers in the universe try the UV1",
