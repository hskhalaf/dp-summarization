I've worn vibram toe shoes sprinting and while working out so my feet are used to being in a barefoot state for some time. Walking around all day, no matter my environment or weather, I have really enjoyed wearing these Glove 4s! Even if they do tend to hold a strong odor, yet somehow dry very quickly.",

I'm a disabled veteran with a spinal cord injury which has left me with very limited feeling in my feet, so any skin issues can become enormous medical problems. It's the whole reason why I ordered these wide shoes. I would like the same model shoe again. I returned them, but I would hate to go through the return process to find another defect.",

In regular shoes I wear a 12 E and these fit more like a 12.5 EE. If I buy another pair I will probably buy a 1/2 size smaller.

I was pleasantly surprised by how the tongue was replaced by simply wrapping the inner wall of the shoe over the top, such that there is only a slit opening near the outer wall. Visually, it makes the shoes look streamline (while making it still look like a normal shoe by preserving the normal lacing). Functionally, it fells even smoother on the inside (which is more comfortable).",

I got these after having the Saucony Peregrine 5 which for me had too much soft cushioning which made me feel unbalanced especially on trail runs. These have just the right amount of cushioning for me where trail runs on uneven ground feels balanced and controlled, and yet they have just enough cushioning for me to be comfortable on longer general walks or hikes. I use these for the gym, travelling from A to B, running, hiking and a bit of trail running here and there. They look great too. Just perfect for my use case.",

There is so much more support than my other brand of minimalist runners I\u2019ve been wearing in recent years. Haven\u2019t been to a run or workout yet in them, but have been breaking them in and can\u2019t imagine an issue. Color and style is great, too. (I ordered men\u2019s because the color and style options were way closer to what I like. So tired of \u201cgirl\u201d shoes!) My only complaint is the elastic-y shoes strings. I find them too thin and annoying, and doubt they will hold up long. Otherwise, I think I have a new fav shoe!",

If you have been using a competitors shoe in a wide and want to buy this shoe, I would recommend going a half size up. Which is a shame because the length of the shoe is perfect for my foot.",
