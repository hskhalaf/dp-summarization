The included bonus corner bumpers feel very soft. As with all baby proofing, it can slow down those with age or arthritis, but these have proved successful.",

At first it was hard to put the knob covers on but once you align the notches right they click in place fairly easily. They hold so well that it\u2019s actually hard for adults to take off. This is reassuring because as my niece gets older I know she wont be able to just rip them off. The table corners are a great bonus too. Four wont be enough for now but as my niece gets taller we will end up purchasing more.",
