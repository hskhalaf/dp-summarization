After asking the men in my family to use the gas mower to mow the lawn, I got frustrated brought the Sun Joe mower and did it myself. I am not mechanically inclined. It was very easy to put together. It did get stuck on a few twigs which were easy to clear. Most annoying was the grass catcher, it filled fast and if not emptied feeds back into the mower and jammed it, again even that was easy to clear. Overall the Sun Joe did an excellent job and I got a really good work out!",
