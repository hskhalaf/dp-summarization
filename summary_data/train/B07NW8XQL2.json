      "text": "I bought the mower from Amazon because local store wanted $70 to deliver but Amazon delivered free plus I got a 5% reward on my credit card and a donation to my favorite charity. I was a little intimidated when I saw the crate, but I had no trouble at all assembling it. (I'm a 70+ year old fat woman with two arthritic knees.) This mower mows well and doesn't leave any clumps of grass in the yard. My only complaint is that the Craftsman folks decided to switch sides with the mower deck lift and transmission control. Why did they do that?? The reverse mowing safety feature is more annoying than on previous mowers.",

      "text": "While you are cutting, especially in the fall, debris blows forward from the mower deck. Particularly in the fall when trying to clean up leaves they are always blowing forward and you never get a clean yard. Debris also gets jammed in the belt covers and you cannot just blow it out, takes a little more force to clean it. I have had two craftsman before this and this is by far the worse designed one yet. When I tried to contact Craftsman about the issues, they straight up told me it is not our product, contact the manufacturer. 2nd year and it runs OK, but not worth the $'s for these problems above.",
