If you're buying for a younger or rowdier crew, consider a more durable one. I do like that everything can be stored together and decide the clutter. The stand fits the slim model but not very snugly. Not an issue unless you plan to travel with it in the stand. Overall, a good choice for a budget price. Four stars instead of five bc of the light weight structure.",

Fits the Pro just fine. The support legs for the disc cases are poorly designed but overall a good buy.
