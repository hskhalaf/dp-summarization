It has 3 settings for heat, medium seems to be all we need. A blue light for when it's dark so you don't miss. And very easy to connect to the toilet without tools. If you want to tighten it a little extra some pliers will do. If you've never had a heated toilet seat do yourself a favor and order now. Bemis is our go to brand for toilet seats they make the Rolls-Royce of toilet seats.",

During the brutal winter in Chicago... the highest setting was an absolute savior. It was so warm and comforting you didn\u2019t freeze while trying to pee. The added nightlight is MY FAVORITE FEATURE. in the middle of the night when you don\u2019t want to blind yourself by turning on lights, this cool blue led built in nightlight easily guides you to the toilet and isn\u2019t too annoyingly bright. Would purchase more if I had More toilets in the house but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m obsessed with these though.",

This seat is an excellent alternative, also working out freqently it helps aleviate the tension in the lower back, plus assiting with sciatica. More than just a warm toilet seat. Also the little one stopped using the training potty, and started using the big potty. That's clearly the warm seat !! App around excellent device. Great mounting hardware and adjustment ability.",

The only thing I would say that's not amazing is that if you have a bony behind, after sitting on it for a few minutes- it will not be as comfy..
