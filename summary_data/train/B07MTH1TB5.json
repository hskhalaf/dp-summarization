Though it was marked true to width and size by most people, there were complaints that it was inconsistent with the brand\u2019s measurement scheme. Another point of dissatisfaction included the lack of arch support. But in the end, the footgear came highly recommended because it was comfortable and quite supportive.",
      "pros": [
        "The comfort provided by the Skechers Flex Advantage 3.0 - Stally during extended periods of standing and walking was commended by numerous reviewers",
        "Plenty of people appreciated the style of the trainer",
        "Multiple owners marked the footwear as being true to size and width",
        "The durability of the merchandise was praised by several wearers",
        "The lightweight nature of this model pleased some users"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A minority of testers complained that this model was short in length while the width was either too wide or too narrow",
        "The arch support of the Skechers Flex Advantage 3.0 - Stally was lacking, said one critic",

The big toe of my other foot also felt slightly jammed against the top of the shoe; Size 6 shoes usually run a tad too long at the toe for me",

I already own a pair of Skechers studless golf shoes for summer and I'm impressed that they are comfortable and waterproof. I wanted some shoes with studs for Autumn golf when the ground gets a little slippery. These Skechers Flex Advantage 3 are just what I wanted. They were comfortable straight from the box. They keep the water out and they look good. The studs provide the extra grip I wanted for Autumn golfing so all in all a great purchase at a great price.",
