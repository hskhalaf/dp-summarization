I could probably have gone for the regular width, but the extra room feels real good. Wearing these is like walking on marsh mellows. No break in required. Really soft, flexible and comfortable. Wore them out the box for 18 holes with no issues These are actually more comfortable than my running shoes. I was disappointed when I took them off and put my running shoes back on after golfing today.",
