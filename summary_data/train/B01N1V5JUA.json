Whatever you do, HIRE someone to put this together. I hired Amazon Services patio furniture assembly to put this together. $122.00 well spent!!! It took two technicians (who do this for a living) 6 hours to put this together. Once it IS together, it is amazing. The pieces stay together, but the cushions slide off. This was solved by using some double sided carpet tape between the base and the cushion.",

The instructions are pictures only and we were able to follow most of the instructions fairly well until it came to the canopy. Looking at the full color pictures on Amazon helped with those final steps.",

The plans for the canopy are actually opposite in regards to size of polls needed, but it was fairly obvious when you start to build, easy correction. we'll see how the pads hold up, they do slide around, but added none slip material underneath and pads seem to hold on better.",
