I use glass espresso cups and you can see through this liquid. Not sure how these have such great reviews? Maybe I got a bad batch? For the price tag I won't be trying again to find out. Literally the only Peet's product I haven't enjoyed. Note: To be fair, I tried a couple of capsules from each of the 4 varieties before leaving this review. All had the same result.",

Peets (from whom I have had coffee for years) is right up there in the running for the ribbon; perfect fit in the machines, rich and robust and creamy head in each cup. And the price is right! Will be trying other brands over the next few weeks but of the 4 I have used so far, Peets leads!",

Worked well--no problems with the quality, fit, etc. HOWEVER, two things that I'd like PEET's to address here: 1) The pods are NOT recyclable. Forums state that Nespresso will discard any third party pods sent to them for recycling. Peet's really needs to come up with a program for recycling. 2) I understand the packaging says \"Made in France. Distributed by Peets\" or something to that effect (I threw my packaging away then found this out later through research). So is this really Peet's coffee, known and loved by many...? I'm dubious. Is this just Peet's *name* applied to a non-Peet's product?",

I did not have any expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor. I think the packaging is quite intuitive as they are able to store more pods with a smaller footprint.

They use the inner gas in the individual pods to keep the grounds fresh jut like Nespresso. They don't have as many flavors or varieties that Nespresso does but at least I like and use all of the flavors that Pete's includes, with Nespresso it seems like I was always left over with one or two types that I didn't care for. Other Nespresso alternatives have been disappointing in their freshness and many other ones have plastic pods which isn't as environmentally friendly. Pete's is the only non-Nespresso brand I will use.",

One thing I really like about Peet\u2019s cups is the intensity number of the beans is printed on each cup so there\u2019s no confusion. Other cups don\u2019t include the intensity number on the individual cups. For some reason, there seems to be an issue with cups getting crushed or dented in shipping. On my last shipment, one cup was pretty severely crushed, but fortunately, I was able to fit it into the machine to use. I hope that the packaging improves because I don\u2019t want to deal with having to return cups I can\u2019t use.",

Today was the last one (not last pod) Nerissimo which is ranked as a 10 so I expected bitter. No, it was smooth as Barry White.

The pods immediately crush when put into the machine, something that has never happened to me with other pods. They look almost identical to the Nespresso brand pods, so I think it has something to do with how flimsy the outside of these ones are. Super disappointing experience!",

The only issue is that the expire in two weeks. Yes, you can drink after \u201cexpired\u201d but it\u2019s kinda ridiculous that they have expiration date of two weeks out. So here\u2019s the deal great price and flavor but be aware that they expire in two weeks upon delivery. So 5 for value and flavor and 1 star because they are about to expire!",

Unlike the Nespresso-brand and Starbucks-branded capsules, I found the espresso made with my Peet\u2019s capsules to be exceedingly bland \u2014 almost tasteless, in fact. It\u2019s clear that Peet\u2019s is a brand that cares about their product, but they just didn\u2019t nail the flavor with these... Too bad, because the price is VERY reasonable! Looks like I will be returning to Nespresso/Starbucks, after all...",
