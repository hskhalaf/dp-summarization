    "description": "Joyce Chen 31-0066, 13.5-Inch Nonstick Steel Dome Lid for 14-Inch Wok. Joyce Chen's slogan \"Eastern Cookware for the Western Kitchen,\" reflects her focus on providing high-quality, versatile tools and products that have Asian flair, but can be used in a western kitchen. This Nonstick Steel Wok Lid is a handy kitchen addition, designed to fit 14-inch woks. If you've lost your lid or started your Joyce Chen cookware collection with a gift that didn't include a lid here's what you've been without. Will also fit many skillets and is a simple and easy cover for serving dishes. Features nonstick interior and exterior and birch wood knob. Joyce Chen opened her first restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1958. The restaurant flourished, and in 1973 a larger Cambridge restaurant was opened. Chen also began writing Chinese cookbooks and in the 1970s began hosting a cooking show on public television. She found that the selection and quality of Chinese cookware in America didn't live up to her high standards so she developed her own. Today, Joyce Chen Products come from all over the Pacific Rim to bring the best of Asia to you.",
