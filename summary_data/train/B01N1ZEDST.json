I have a 300ml diffuser and put 6 to 8 drops of the oil in. I have it sitting by my side of the bed but it will fill the whole room. My husband loves the smell and will relax and knock him out. I also sleep more soundly using this oil and feel so much more rested in the morning. I will be buying more of this before I run out. I highly reccomend and you will not be disapointed.",

Anyway, we put 5 drops in a diffuser. That was a little strong. I\u2019d start with 3 for a small room. We all knocked out w/in about 30 mins. Yay! Sadly, I woke up after 4 hours. The good news is: they both slept through the night for the first time in forever, and all 3 of us felt way more rested than usual. Even though I only got 4 hours, I feel like the quality of sleep was better than normal. I\u2019m gonna use it every night :)",

I really love sleep blends that include copaiba. I kinda won't even consider one that doesn't. This one includes copaiba and I'm very happy! This particular blend of essential oils may not be as strong as some, but for the price, I'm stoked. Would buy again.",
