Nothing beats getting into a warm bed in winter, and we all prefer the blanket to a heated mattress pad, because if you get too warm during the night, you can simply move the blankets off of you versus being stuck on a hot mattress. Twin and full come with a single controller, and queen and king offer two controllers (1 for each side of the bed). Cannot recommend these enough.",
