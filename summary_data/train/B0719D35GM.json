I have done 10 min only and you can go longer each time, the first few times you feel like some stains were lifted and others werent , so you think it looks blotchy . Dont be scared its lifting the really bad stains first !! And the blotchiness you feel is there but goes away until the next treatment. It worked in 4 days, i saw the difference in my teeth. No photo shop needed ! Im continuing to use it and reordering refills :)",

I was happy to see whitening but horrified that only parts of each tooth were white while other parts of each tooth were not. It looked like something was wrong with my actual teeth. It didn't cause any tooth sensitivity but I don't recommend this if you want an evenly whitened smile.",

I also started using a hydroxyapatite toothpaste and mineralizing mouth wash immediately after treatments and on the days afterward. Unfortunately, 7 treatments in the LED light completely and mysteriously stopped working. Of course it\u2019s a few days after the return window, so looks like I\u2019ll have to wait to finish the whitening kit until I find another brand of light.",

Next time I will run it the 3 cycles. Rinsed my mouth. And my teeth to me felt clean and Seemed alittle whiter. I will try it again in a couple days but longer! Not that difficult to use.

I used for 30 min a day before bed. Only side effect was a little gun sensitivity but nothing terrible! I\u2019ve already recommended to my aunt after she saw my results. I\u2019m impressed! Update - months later I get compliments on my teeth all the time! I use the kit once a week for maintenance. I\u2019ve referred 5 people to this product!!",

Pros: obviously it works to whiten Inexpensive Cons: The flavor was just okay Causes some discomfort if you don\u2019t get the excess off your gums The custom fit tray doesn\u2019t really get a superb fit, even after following directions and repeating a few times. Overall, a good value for the price if you don\u2019t want to do professional whitening.",

I did 30 minutes on my first session and saw IMMEDIATE results. Yes, it taste a bit funny but its worth the price. I repeated it 3 days and my smile is noticeably whiter.
