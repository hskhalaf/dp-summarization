I never remember to use a primer, and occasionally remember concealer (set with powder before shadow), yet it\u2019s still super bright. It blends beautifully, and a little goes a long way. The only thing that caught me by surprise is that they\u2019re not all matte. A couple shades have a bit of shimmer but it\u2019s not overly noticeable, which I prefer since I\u2019m more of a matte person. Totally worth the money.

The colors are BRIGHT and I always get compliments. They also blend well. I attached just one look I've done with this palette.",

The color range is not bad at all, this was the first time I have ever used eyeshadow and I found it very user friendly! You don\u2019t need to pack a lot on to get a nice pigmented color except for the obvious colors (yellow/orange) that are lighter and needs a little more product to be easily seen. I didn\u2019t make a dent in any of the colors after constantly redoing it, as I\u2019m new. Recommend!",

Therefore, I purchased several other similar palettes from Juvias Place which show up fine. So, if you're Black, these may not work for you in the way you anticipate without a white primer.",

I'm now wishing I kept the original one. The 2nd order was even worse. Half of the colors fell out of the pan, and the palette hasn't even been opened. Returning it one last time and won't be considering getting another replacement.",

When it came the first thing I noticed was that none of the colors were very pigmented, and the red looked more like pink on my skin. On top of that if you try and get more out of the red by using a lot of it on your lid, it will stain your skin pink for a little while, probably a day or two ? Anyway it was overall pretty disappointing, I like NYX\u2019s other products like their setting spray and eyebrow pencils, but this was a bust :/",
