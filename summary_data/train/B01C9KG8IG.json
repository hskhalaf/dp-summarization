Would love to know how to fix it, any advice would be very helpful. 2 stars because there seems to be know way to reach out to the roost team for support or replacement.",

Good ergonomics is important, but I can\u2019t carry heavy bags, as they compresses my shoulder and that exacerbates the condition. This lightweight solution is ideal for me. I have also discovered that the included dictation program in my macbook pro is more accurate when the laptop is in this stand. I use my Macbook\u2019s internal microphone, and I don\u2019t know if it works better simply because the stand places the microphone closer to my mouth, or if exposing most of the bottom of the laptop changes the acoustics, but regardless, it has been incredibly helpful.",

I've noticed a significant reduction in my neck and back pain, less tightness in my shoulder muscles and even reduced wrist pain since I now use a wireless keyboard and mouse.

Like others, initially I complained because there wasn't an even lower height option, but actually, there is a wisdom to it: the screen should be high enough for you to sit straight up, and this way it forces you to sit properly.
