You'll need to order special 1/2 guitar strings ( and secure them properly to the bridge and wind them properly on the tuning pegs. Once you do that, this guitar will sing. We love this guitar.",

      "text": "Guitar arrived quickly and in good shape. It plays well, although strings are a little too close together for my fat adult fingers. The strings were (appropriately) loose in shipping but poor quality and (D string) broke when tuned. The replacement strings that came with it seem ok. It holds a tune after the strings have a chance to stretch and sounds so much better than the cheap plastic toy guitar which it replaced. The neck and fretboard are spaced well for a child, and it seems like a durable well built instrument.",

      "text": "We received our first order of this guitar and one of the strings was rusty from top to bottom. We ordered a replacement and one string is again rusty and buzzing when played. It's very cheaply finished and has one too many fret dividing lines at the very top. We are returning our second one now and trying a different brand.",

      "text": "Actually not bad. Picked it up so I could have something with me in the woods in case I was struck by inspiration there. No buzzing on the frets. It obviously take a number of times tuning it before it will stick, but whatever, that's nothing new. Just tune it A-D-G-C-E-A and it should be set to sound like a normal acoustic in standard tuning. Decent buy for the ridiculously low price.",

My husband is a musician and is a little frustrated with how quickly it gets out of tune be we expect that to slow some as our son learns better technique. For this price I didn't expect much even thought the reviews were favorable. I am so happy we ordered this for our son to get started learning guitar.",

The guy is still a little big for my son, who is a big three year old, but he still puts forth the effort and loves it. I would recommend purchasing some strings and replacing them but other than that the guitar is great and stayed tuned a lot better than I thought it was gonig to. I would recommend this to a child learnign to play.",

It has lasted amazingly well, is built sturdy and has soft, nylon-type strings, that don't hurt little fingers when making chords. The guitar strings have never broken. In addition to its sturdiness, what I really like about this guitar is that it can be tuned and played like a real adult guitar. My boyfriend has played guitar for 30 years and occasionally tunes this guitar and plays it. The sound is really pretty good.",
