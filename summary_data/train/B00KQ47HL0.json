      "text": "As an inspector in the auto, aircraft & industrial fields, the juicer looked over engineered. It worked real smooth. The only problem arose after squeezing 30 lemons. The main support shaft to base would not remain tight. The screw holding the two together kept backing out making for a very wobbly vertical assembly. Apparently the shaft and the base hole that the shaft fits into are not even close to the same diameter. It should have been a press fit but that won\u2019t work either because the cast iron base would eventually fracture from the forcing of the solid steel bar into it. 3 Stars- looks good but not durable.",

The dual-lever action is superior to rack and pinion. The base is cast iron and the thing won't move or tip on you. I use it every weekend to make enough juice for a week and store it in mason jars in the fridge.",

The packaging by New Star is woefully inadequate, so the handle ripped a hole in the box. And finally, the feet are not extending forward far enough, so one cannot just pull the handle without having the whole thing tip forward. As a result, operating the press requires a significant dexterity, despite its heavy weight.",

My wife and i fill a 5-gal bucket with grapefruits and oranges, slice them and squeeze them, and end up with 2 gallons of good tasting juice for breakfast.",

      "text": "A clever FAKE. We own an OrangeX juicer, it is a hunk of solid metal that makes pressing OJ a joy. This is a FAKE, designed to ape the OrangeX. It doesn't have the same weight. It is not stable, when you pull the lever down it tips toward you. Some of the parts are roughly machined, such as the cup insert which had sharp edges. It is half the price and well, to be fair, exactly half the usefulness. To this day, can't believe I bought it, it's just that the picture was UTTERLY similar, should have returned it.",

      "text": "I bought this as a gift for my sister for christmas so I don't use it often, but they live nearby and we go over for orange crushes often. They love it and use it on a regular basis. I always hear there comments about how much juice you get out of t he citrus and how easy the press is to clean. It's very heavy and sturdy. You can tell it is something that was made to last for years and years. All of the bars in my neighborhood have similar (if not the same exact) looking juicers to make crushes and they seem to hold up with constant use year over year. I highly recommend this juicer.",

I straightened the arms in a vice once. The second time I had to do this, one of the cast iron arms broke and the other cracked. I've not been able to find anyone offering replacement parts. Mine lasted one year of daily use squeezing 1-2 lemons daily.",
