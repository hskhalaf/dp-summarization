They do a good job of reducing a Butt to smaller chunks, the teeth are too large and too far apart to get the pork to a final size. I also wish that the back of them was solid and not hollowed out. It would make cleaning them a lot easier.",

Shredding is difficult because I can't get enough force to pull meat and you absolutely can't lift a hunk of meat using them because they slide back over your knuckles and you lose your grip. I have small hands and can't really use them, but got them for my boyfriend and they are difficult to use for even his large hands.",

If your hands become wet or 'saucy' you will have a difficult time keeping a grip. The grip is just not well designed.

He was glad to receive them but after their first use he was ecstatic. The claws tore through the pork in an easy, efficient way that forks couldn't duplicate. They're power tools of a different kind! I'm putting these up there on the list of best gifts for him, because they are so useful but still inexpensive!",

I do know the beef roast had been processed long enough in the smoker when I used the fork method, it almost fell apart on its own. I'll try again after winter has left MN sometime next spring and do both pork should and another beef roast.",

I'm an amateur cook so don't often splurge on specialty equipment but I'd have bought these long ago had I known how easy they make the job. They're sturdy enough to really go to town when shredding. The form fits my hands nicely so control is good. The points are sharp enough to easily pierce meat without being so sharp that I worry about stabbing myself. Clean up was a breeze in the dishwasher. I'll likely prepare more shredded meat dishes now that I have these claws.",

However, that being said, I have used several times for lifting heavy meats out of pan and works well for that. Just jam in the tines and lift. Also, these would work better with regular handles than the hand holes.",
