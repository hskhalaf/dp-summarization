I don't have a TF card yet, so it was recorded on my iPhone using the WiFi connection. It is just intended to be a scenic 360 degree view. FOLLOWUP: I too have ran into a couple of obstacles with little to no damage to the drone. Both times it was because I tried to fly before the GPS satellites were acquired.

We purchased two batteries to make sure we had enough power while video our ranch property. Unfortunately the battery time does not last very long, example is after ten minutes it starts to beep. It takes too long to charge while we are using the other one. I am hoping to search for a faster charger or a longer battery supply. Other than that it's great, pictures and videos are great. We are still working on getting better at using it.",

One other problem was getting the app to connect to the camera due to the 5g capability of the aircraft. Other than that, Very fun to fly and handles very well, takes awesome photos and excellent videos.",

A wonderful bonus is the carrying case that\u2019s included. Overall the obstacle avoidance that it does have is much better than most other drones. I was incredibly impressed with how stable the drone was. It was able to lock onto its location via GPS and even under high wins it held steady with no problem. Happy customer!",

This drone has everything that we are looking for yet in our price range, plus it comes with a case that makes it very easy to carry everywhere.
