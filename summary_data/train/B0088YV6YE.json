The glass even stuck a sliver in my girlfriends foot. There's fiberglass dust on everything in the room after using a flashlight, you can see it sparkling. It bothers me I'm stuck on the couch or breathing it in and laying in it. This is unacceptable and I demand a refund. Behold right before my eyes when I investigated, under the cover, the foam is surrounded by a fiberglass bag! Sad for a product that would have been a good value otherwise.

We love the mattress but without the additional topper it's a little too firm for us. I would still recommend this product to anyone. Our queen is still in perfect shape with little sag. We expect the same from this one.",

As for the quality... it's great, and I can't even tell there's no boxspring(another reason you could go smaller). I would say it's a pretty firm mattress but that's something I wanted.

Also, I think I'll be adding a medium firm/firm topper for a little more support for my back as well.

We will see how long it lasts but even if I only get a solid year out of it, that\u2019s a better than my last coil mattress that we only got to use for a year before it wore out and it was way more expensive.

I\u2019ve rotated it for the first five years and then started flipping it. Seems the memory foam has to good of a memory lately. Waking up after a couple hours to move to a different spot because I feel like I\u2019m sinking. Was hoping that it would last longer. Guess I\u2019ll try a mattress topper for now. Update: Topper did not help. Mattress sags to much. Guess the mattress\u2019s memory is just to far gone. So disappointed.",

So I picked the Lucid 14' plush memory foam. It arrived so fast! I made sure it was on the right side when I put it on my bed. NO smell at all and within 2 hours of opening it, I took a nap on it!!! WOW. WOW! Is all I can say. I only have 1 issue and that is now I have to buy steps so my dog can get back on it and that is IT!!!!!",

I followed the instructions included with the mattress, letting it expand for a minimum of 48 hours. A positive note...it has very little off gassing. However, in terms of comfort...I would say that it has a medium feel. It's definitely NOT SOFT OR PLUSH. If you're looking for medium, this will probably be a good solution, but if you're looking for a soft mattress, this is not it. I gave it t 2 stars because I believe that it's a quality mattress, but doesn't provide the comfort level that it advertises.",

    "description": "Size:King| Style Name:2019 Model Medium-Plush MattressThe Feel\nThis plush mattress is all about plush comfort. At the surface, a 1 inch layer of bamboo charcoal infused memory foam is quilted into the cover. Bamboo charcoal is especially good for sensitive skin and has improved thermal regulation. Beneath the top layer is a 3 inch layer of ventilated, gel infused memory foam. This layer helps improve breathability and temperature for a more comfortable sleep climate. Beneath the comfort layers, this mattress has a 10 inch high density foam base for excellent support.\n\nThe top memory foam layers contour to your natural curves during the night and add plushness to the surface. The memory foam also helps to isolate motion transfer between sleeping partners.\n\nAll LUCID memory foam is created using open cell technology. This prevents lasting body impressions and creates a more durable foam.\n\nSoft, Breathable Cover \nMade of a cozy TENCEL blend fabric (10 percent TENCEL lyocell, 90 percent polyester), the soft cover creates a breathable air layer at the top of the mattress. \n\nConveniently Shipped for Easy Set Up\nAfter your new mattress arrives, simply take the package into the right room, remove it from the box and protective wrap, and watch as it expands.",
