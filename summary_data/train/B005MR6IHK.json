      "text": "I like this tuner over the snark, especially for begginers, because it shows you which string you are tuning to, when the tuner is set to \"G\" (G fo guitar). The way this helps is that, if someone is tuning the A string, the display should show the number 5 on the lower left corner (for 5th string from the bottom). Instead of showing G#, G, F#, F if it's too low, or A#, B, C C#, etc, if it's too high, it will simply show that you are too low or too high. Again, something that beginners might struggle with, since their ears are not tuned to what the notes should sound like.",

Hubby has perfect pitch (envy) and says the tuner is not accurate. Otherwise, easy to use and see, but I need to be tuned correctly. Bought a Snark Super Tight, will see how this one does.",

You have to hold the power button to turn it off. If you just press it it toggles between the different settings (chromatic, guitar, bass, violin). I also think that the Snark has a wider clamp to clamp. Not as nice as a Snark. Small differences in convenience. Tunes well, no issues there. 4/5",

The display turns green when you are in tune. I clamped this on the headstock and compared it with my name brand name pedal chromatic and it was dead on.

      "text": "It's pretty amazing how easily this thing works. Unlike my other tuner which needs the room to be quiet so that it can hear my acoustic, this tuner clips on to the head stock and tunes in a noisy room (a must have with a house full of kids running around...haha). The tuner also can change settings between chromatic, guitar, bass, ukulele...Which is great because we just purchased a Ukulele and not used to the tuning yet. This tuner makes it easy.",

The price was cheap compared to other tuners I have used in the past. I think cheap is the operative word.",

If the Rockstar game can do it, why can't this? Seems like lazy coding, but no other tuner at this price does it yet, either. guess they all use the same mfr. Can't comment on accuracy - seems ok to me but I don't have crazy-accurate tonal ears. Lightweight, easy to use. I just leave it on the guitar most of the time.",
