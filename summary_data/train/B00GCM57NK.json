That will allow you to get enough apps instead of a few. Picking from g3 and g2, I went with g2 because of lower battery drain and cheaper than g3 and with research they are similar in specs, even though g3 is still better but battery lasts less. Otherwise this is a great phone even for 2016 for a hundred bucks. Only issue I'm having is the battery draining so fast, so I bought a new one and hopefully that will fix it.",

Did I mention the SCREEN IS AMAZEBALLS!?!?! GREAT SCREEN, gorgeous picture... I purchased the ditztronic case here on amazon for it, it's very snug with an excellent fit and finish. Did I mention the amazing screen yet? Camera is equally amazing. only negative, speakerphone clarity is mediocre. I have the Verizon model which only has one speaker for the speakerphone, ATT/Sprint/Tmobile all reportedly have two smaller ones. Either way, this thing rocks.",

Never lags and the display looks fantastic. The only funny thing is the lock button being right on the back between the volume rockers, but you can tap on the screen to lock and unlock it and you get used to the funny position of the buttons.",

The first smartphone in LG's premium \"G\" Series, the LG G2 for Verizon Wireless brings everything together in a device with comfortable, functional, convenient and beautiful design. Powered by Android 4.2.2 and a super-fast 2.26 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, the 4G LTE-enabled LG G2 allows you to run multiple apps at once, browse the Web, or enjoy video and games seamlessly. And the 5.2-inch Full HD display is the largest display designed for one-handed operation.\n\nThe LG G2 offers a unique, forward-thinking design that's actually a bit backwards by placing all the buttons on the rear of the device (instead of along the sides). Moving the main buttons to the back of the phone gives you more control since this is where your index fingers are naturally located -- you'll wonder why they haven't always been there. Researchers have also found that moving the buttons also results in fewer dropped phones when adjusting the volume while talking.\n\nCapture sharp pictures and smooth videos with the G2's 13-megapixel rear camera, which features Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) technology and Full HD 1080p video recording. The LG G2 comes with 32 GB of internal storage (22 GB of user available storage) and up to 18.2 hours of talk time.\n\nEDGE-TO-EDGE DISPLAY\nEnjoy an immersive viewing experience that fits perfectly in your hand with G2's 5.2-inch Full HD in-plane switching (IPS) display. Its sharp, 423 pixels-per-inch resolution shows off every detail, while its IPS display gives you bright whites and rich colors with a 16:9 cinema-like presentation. In addition to the expansive viewing experience, LG's innovative Dual Routing technology reduced the phone's bezel to a mere 2.65mm on the side edge. For more efficient energy usage, the LG G2 employs Graphic RAM (GRAM) technology, which reduces the display\u2019s energy use by up to 26 percent on a still frame and increases overall usage time on the device by approximately 10 percent.\n\nGO FURTHER BETWEEN CHARGES\nThe G2's step design 3,000 mAh battery gives you impressive power, without compromising style. With SiO+ technology (an enhanced version of the lithium-ion batteries), the G2's battery provides maximum storage capacity and long-lasting efficiency, with a thinner profile than traditional batteries. You'll get up to 18.2 of talk time and up to 275 hours (11.4 days) of standby time).\n\n13-MEGAPIXEL CAMERA WITH OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION\nCapturing important moments in shaky conditions is a breeze with the rear camera's Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), which maintains focus while you hold the camera for less blur in photos and less shaking in videos --even in low-light settings. The Multi-Point Autofocus improves focus and depth of field with 9 AF points, especially for images with multiple faces or moving objects, while the Super Resolution Zoom provides more detail and sharper zoom quality, helping maintain clarity with 8 times the normal digital zoom. With the Dual Recording/Dual Camera feature, you can activate the front and rear cameras simultaneously to put both you and your subject in the shot with picture-in-picture technology.\n\nThe 13-megapixel rear camera also captures video in Full HD 1080p resolution. The Audio Zoom feature helps to focus in on what you want to hear by using multiple stereo mics to amplify sound from a specified angle and de-emphasizing the surrounding noise for video recording and playback. The rear camera is complemented by a 2-megapixel front camera for video chats on the go.\n\nLG G2\nSPEC HIGHLIGHTS\n * 3G/4G LTE connectivity\n   \n   \n * Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system\n   \n   \n * 2.26 GHz Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor\n   \n   \n * 5.2-inch touchscreen IPS display (1080 x 1920) \n   \n   \n * 13-MP rear camera (with Full HD 1080p video) + Optical Image Stabilization\n   \n   \n * Front 2-MP camera\n   \n   \n * 32 GB storage + 2 GB of RAM\n   \n   \n * Wireless-N Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0+ NFC\n   \n   \n * GPS for navigation and location services\n   \n   \n * Up to 18.2 hours of usage time\n   \n   \n\nDesigned with the power and volume buttons on the back of the phone. STUDIO QUALITY HI-FI SOUND\nThe powerful Snapdragon 800 processor also helps the G2 to boast impressive sound features such as Hi-Fi sound playback and HD multichannel audio for enhanced sound quality. The LG G2 features 24-bit/192 kHz Hi-Fi playback that reproduces studio-like quality sound, far superior to a CD.\n\nLG ENHANCEMENTS\nQSlide Function.

Write or draw on any screen using just a finger, adding a personal touch to everything. And with On-Call Notes, jot down ideas during a call and access them later on from G2's call log entry.\n\nQuickRemote.

Save a full Web page rather than a limited screen capture.\n\nClip Tray. Lets you copy and store multiple items, such as a screen shot, to a PC-like clipboard for use in other applications.\n\nSlide Aside. Move between up to three apps at once, by using three fingers to slide your current screen aside, and access another app.\n\nGuest Mode. Customize the G2's experience with two modes -- one for yourself and one for a child or guest -- keeping your personal information and device settings safer. Access Guest Mode by unlocking the device with a separate lock screen pattern, letting you control which apps are available for a different user.\n\nKnockON. A simple knocking gesture is all it takes to wake G2's display without picking it up or pressing the power key. G2 senses the gesture and turns the display on or off automatically.\n\n\nVERIZON'S 4G LTE NETWORK\nCovering over 90 percent of the U.S. population (287 million people across the country), the Verizon Wireless 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) network provides average download data rates of 5-12 megabits per second (Mbps) and 2-5 Mbps on the uplink in real-world, loaded network environments.\n\nYou'll be able to stream HD movies without the annoyance of constant pauses to buffer the video stream--as well as quickly download HD-quality movies right to your phone in minutes. Additionally, you'll be able to download a new song file in about 4 seconds or upload a photo to your favorite social networking site in about 6 seconds.\n\nWith the enhanced security of 4G LTE, you'll be able to maximize productivity and efficiency while you're out of the confines of your office with the ability to tap into most VPN networks with less waiting and faster responsiveness. You'll be able upload 10 MB presentations back to your team in less than 25 seconds.\n\nIn areas serviced only by 3G, you can expect download speeds of 600 Kbps to 1.4 Mbps and upload speeds of 500 to 800 Kbps in Mobile Broadband coverage area.\n\nGoogle Now. ANDROID 4.2 (JELLY BEAN) OS\nFast, fluid, and smooth, the Android 4.2 operating system (nicknamed Jelly Bean) offers effortless movement between home screens -- like turning the pages of a book. And it includes faster orientation changes, quicker switching between recent apps, and smoother and more consistent rendering throughout your mobile device. And widgets work like magic. As you place widgets on the screen, everything else automatically moves to make room. When they're too big, widgets resize on their own. \n\n\nBrowse and download thousands of free and paid apps from around the world via Google Play or the Amazon Appstore for Android. \n\nSmooth Operator. More reactive and uniform touch responses mean you can almost feel the pixels beneath as your finger moves across the screen. .\n\nLive in the Now. With Google Now, you get the right information at just the right time -- before you even ask. It can tell you today's weather before you start your day, or when the next train will arrive as you're standing on the platform. .\n\nPhoto Sphere Camera.
