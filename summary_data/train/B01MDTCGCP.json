What they don\u2019t show you is the zipper on the side pocket, which makes it a good spot for anything that likes to fall out of bags. The inside microfiber is awesome, and eye-catching, and if you don\u2019t unzip fully you can open both the laptop and the cover and they will hold together. IF you like a tight fit, the 12-12.9 fits the MBP better. This one has enough extra room to fold when the computer is in.",

I like the fact that the covering can sit and the zippered pocket can unzip 180 degrees. I can leave the sleeve on the table and leave the compter in the covering without moving.",

It's constructed so you can use the notebook without removing it from the case, but I wonder about airflow for cooling, so I'll remove it for use. Measure your notebook.

The zipper runs around the bottom of the case, opposite the direction of the zipper for the smaller compartment.

Plus, that zipper does little to offer cushion on the bottom of the case, where your laptop would come into contact with the ground or a desk. So I have to be very careful about how I place this case, lest I dent up my MacBook. This case looks great, but it's all show and no go.",

Another important note is the way the case is designed: instead of opening along the top where the handle is, case opens from side-bottom-side. Which means, if you were in a hurry and did not secure the zipper the entire way, it might decide to open enough to drop out while using the handle. A better design would have had a zipper opening only along the top, along with the handle, so even if it were left open by accident, the carrier would carry the laptop like a bag.",

      "text": "Great case. Perfect for my HP laptop at the office. The office gave me a rather large, padded briefcase to lug the laptop around in when I travel, but it's not big enough for my other carry-on items. Now I can protect the laptop with this case and then carry it in my backpack, along with my other items - plenty of room, and only one bag to carry. This sleeve is well made and seems like it will last a while. While not really a negative, I will say that the brown handle is useless for me. I don't have any plans to ever carry this thing around like a briefcase. I am very satisfied with this purchase.",

Three further thoughts resulted in me purchasing the 12-12.9\" Pro case. a) I wanted something that protected all around, b) something that could also hold my charger, c) something with a handle. This case was exactly what I was looking for. There's sufficient protection to satisfy my anxious nature, the fit with the folding case is great; there's about 1/4 on all sides. The quality of the case is impressive.",

      "text": "If you are looking for a laptop bag, this is perfect for lightweight laptops. Love this strap, carrying it has the professional feel. Much better than wearing a backpack. I haven't used it enough to judge it's durability but I'd say it's a solid bag while I've been bringing it to work 3 times a week. I think 15' laptops have a better feel since carrying it with a 14' feels a bit small. It doesn't rattle back and forth with all the empty space which is definitely a plus. I am using it with my Thinkpad yoga which is a 14' laptop and I've been loving this bag so far.",

Not built for water or drop protection, so buyer beware! If you're a bit rougher with your laptop, find a harder case. This one is strictly for light travelling and protection. Highly recommended!",

It's actually 2.5\" longer and 1.5\" wider than a 15\" MacBook Pro (2017). I want a cover that actually fits my laptop nicely without wasting all that space when I put it in my backpack. You need to order the 13 - 13.5\" model which should fit the 15\" MacBook Pro more snugly. I just ordered it and will see how that works. Otherwise it's very well made.",

      "text": "I wanted a simple but soft sleeve for my new iPad Pro 12.9. This seemed to be the right balance. It's well made. The interior is soft and won't scratch and the zippers are nylon/plastic so they won't scratch either. One design choice bothers me. The sleeve unzips and opens on bottom and sides and folds at top where handles are. If one is not careful and you don't zip up the case immediately, you might forget and grab the handle to pick it up. If you forget to close the zipper, your tablet/computer falls out. I should have looked closer to see how this zipped. Going to have to find another sleeve. Too much chance for human error.",
