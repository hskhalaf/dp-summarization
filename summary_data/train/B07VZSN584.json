Now that I have bought another boppy, this momma and baby couldn't be happier. His latch is better, there are less steps to put it on (no buckle that just comes undone anyway) and it is just more comfortable overall. Boppy is where it is at. Won't be venturing off again. And this print is just so cute! PSA from a mom who has had multiple children with reflux... GET THE WATER RESISTANT PROTECTOR as well. The pillow will last forever.",

The shape fits perfectly around her waist and allows her to balance our daughter with ease for long marathon feeding sessions without too much discomfort. Breast feeding takes a ton of effort and time so any little thing that makes the task easier is worth the money in my book. The cover is washable which is great since it will eventually get messed up no matter how careful you may try to be. The animal prints are fun without being too busy so overall, I have no complaints.",

Boopy was way too soft and didnt hold the form well crunching in the middle as overall pillow is small (my wife is pretty petite so we don't understand why it is so small), My Breast Friend is an interesting idea but not useful for all chairs, positions, quality of fabric and pillow isn't great neither feels cheap as material and foam. Fisher Price was a winner for us it is sturdy, material is sheer and good quality, and it works overall in multiple setting chairs/bed etc.",

I have given it one less star because after less than a month use, it isn't as firm as I hoped it would be. nothing too drastic but enough to notice after having to frequently readjust baby.
