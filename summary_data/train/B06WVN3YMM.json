After a few months the center compartment bottom tore from the side thus one of the two items I spent almost 40 dollars, is now trash. The other bottoms bowed. I would comment the manufacture must expect you to store tissue or feathers in the compartments. I suggest if you are looking for hanging storage, look elsewhere. I did find a replacement item from a different company that is strong and made well.",

I haven't used these for anything heavier than t shirts, yet after only a month the weight of the organizers is causing a buckling of the fabric which is only stabilized by thin cardboard. Also the \"drawers\" are not easy to use because the sides are only fabric without any reinforcement. I'll probably replace these with a version that is anchored across the entire top section.",
