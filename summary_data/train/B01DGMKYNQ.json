I had a part of the watch hammer break and I asked them how I could do about just a replacement hammer and they said don't worry about it, we'll send you a new kit. Don't worry about sending the old one back, we don't want to inconvenience you in any way. Great product, great customer service and a quick response. Needless to say i'd highly recommend them!",

Spent less for this kit than I paid the jeweler to change the original band which I ended up putting back on after removing the extra links. Will keep this around for future adjustments or battery replacements.",
