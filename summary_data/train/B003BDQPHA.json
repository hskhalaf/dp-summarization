Tried a drill press with HSS Ti coated step bits and they did nothing against the hardened edge from the plasma cut. Put this burr in a rotozip set to 15k rpm and it hogged the hardened material right out with very little effort and once past the heat affected zone it REALLY cut the soft steel fast!. Didn't even seem to dull, worked as good for the 40th hole as it did for the 1st one. Great product for a great price.",
