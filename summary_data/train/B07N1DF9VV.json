Even if you push in the output tray and let the print job fall to the floor, the output tray sensor still stops the function even when there is nothing in it.

      "text": "We purchased this product for business use in a marina where there is not a stable internet connection. We enrolled in the instant ink service, but because our internet connection was unstable the printer would not allow us to print until we connected to the internet. Our only option was to cancel the instant ink service to continue using the printer. When we cancelled the service they shut down the ink cartridges and we were still not able to print. We were forced to pay additional fees and to go buy additional \"non-instant ink\" cartridges for $200 just to use the printer. Would not recommend to my enemies. Please do not buy.",

      "text": "An All in One printer that for the most part works fine but it does NOT scan to computer (mac of any OS version). You can scan to a multitude of locations but NOT to a directory on your own hard drive directly (only if you have a separate cloud drive, or setup network shares). A vital function of scanning missing means that you have to control the scanning from a computer which means lots of walking back and forth, instead of being able to scan and control from the printer to a computer on a network. For an \"Office\" printer in its title, this misses out on an essential function and unacceptable from an office point of view.",
