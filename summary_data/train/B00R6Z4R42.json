And sooner when you don't have a spanner on hand to fix it, which leads to... 2. It requires a wrench to fix chain issues and tighten. Other brands, such as Worx, don't need tools to do this. 3. The battery life is poor. 4. Remember #1? It pops up constantly. In all, I pulled it out after a year of un-use and reminded me how much I hate this thing, so I thought a review was warranted.

I also managed to throw the chain off the bar several times, usually when cutting brush, but I can't guarantee that I had the chain properly tensioned. As other reviewers have noted, the automatic shutoff after a few seconds of non-use seems unnecessary. Surely extending the shutoff delay tp a minute wouldn't consume much battery power.",

      "text": "This thing is amazing. I was skeptical about what it could do, but it chewed through huge logs better than some 18\" 2-cycle gas saws I've used. I was able to take down AND cut up a small/medium tree (~30 feet tall) on one charge. Being able to cut without earplugs and not having the horrible smell and lingering sense of 2-cycle in my nose is an added benefit... and definitely much healthier! Only negative is that the bar/chain tool doesn't seat very tightly into the handle and falls out as you're cutting. Do yourself a favor and put that thing aside, or you'll be on a sawdust scavenger hunt.",

It's not that it's heavy - it's not - but the chain tends to fall up at the high angle. Small tool shop guy had never seen one, and had very high praise for it, the value proposition, and even the chain quality, which he said will take 4 or 5 sharpenings. Same guy said to use the sawzall at ground level instead of the chainsaw.",

There is no noise, fumes, or fuel mixing with it. Also, when I set it down on the ground while moving a log it stops instantly instead of idling on the ground picking up dirt.

      "text": "my husband loves this chainsaw. we received it, charged it fully and then went to sawing. We chopped down an entire apple tree (pretty dense wood) - then we went camping that following weekend and cut down several trees for firewood all on the same charge. I would recommend this chainsaw to anyone. No hassle with it starting, it works GREAT! We replaced our gas one with this one and could not be happier.",
