It can almost be used as a tinted lipgloss, but it imparts the color in one swipe and more swipes won't make it darker. The drawback is actually on the same lines, its more of a lipgloss with lesser moisturizer. Also it doesn't last, the moisture will rubs off, leaving a pinkish hue. In a nutshell, its good for a quick swipe and touch up for no makeup but pretty lips.",
