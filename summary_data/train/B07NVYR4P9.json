Does take effort to press down the filter to get the water clean and sometimes is does spray to the side. I weigh around 200 pounds and I put a boot on the top of the filter and force it down with my weight - result: clean filtered water asap. Recommended",

I poured some water in a clear cup and did not see anything. A great buy",

Its nice to know, that if I do run out of bottled water internationally, I would feel safe drinking out of the tap. Its very durable and consequently a tad heavier than I would like, but well worth the weight. The Holy Grail of water purification!",

My traveling companions used LifeStraws, which worked well for drinking. But that is all they are good for because the bottle filters the water as you suck it throught the straw. This one, however, can easily be used to pour purified water over toothbrushes or hands to clean them. Not possible with the LifeStraw brand.",
