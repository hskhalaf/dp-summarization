      "text": "Great product with easy setup and tear down. 4 people would be a squeeze, 3 people would fit comfortably, very roomy for 2 people with lots of gear. Poles are sturdy. The product was a different color than pictured, but I liked the dark gray and black since it absorbs more heat if the sun is out. Could see some daylight thru the pinholes around the window and vent stitching, but it is not loose or ripping the fabric and you can tell the stitching is high quality.",

Super easy to set up and take down, the air vents work great for ventilating the tent. The black interior worked great to block out the light and spotting fish through the holes was easy. Over all just love it!",
