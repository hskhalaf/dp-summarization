Our last pair of stools lasted ten years before finally giving up the ghost. I was immediately interested in these because they had a solid look and the seat/center adjustment screw looked heavy duty. Was not disappointed when we received them...the stools were completely assembled. They are very solid with a reassuring heft. The legs sit flush on the floor as there is no side to side wiggle. The seat is very comfortable and easy to pass the time while sitting on these. The price was very reasonable and delivery was quick. I highly recommend these if durability is a must.",

One of the three stools we purchased has a seat cushion that is slightly raised on one side. It looks like the side of the leather seat was not captured correctly by the metal ring and it pushed it up. I tried to remove it and re-position it, but could not. Its not that noticeable, but that is the only reason I did not rate it five starts.",
