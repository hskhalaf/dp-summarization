For example, as you can see in the picture, this inside block should fill the outer one, but instead it doesn't even come close. Sadly, all of the effects are like that! It makes many of the tricks unworkable. The illustrations in the instructions correctly depict how the props should be... yet aren't. Yes it's a children's magic kit, but for me that just makes me want to demand better quality... And so should you.",

It is sturdy, almost heavy (for a 7 year old), but it keeps him entertained for hours! My only negative would be it needs a clasp or lock for the case, so it can be easily transported. Currently it all fits in the magic box, but the box doesn't lock or clasp close and it has been dropped a few times with coins and rags and tricks rolling everywhere. STILL, give it 5 stars for how well it is made! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

This set contains 10 tricks and the props, high-quality, in a very solid wood case. Congratulations to this developer for this wonderful set!

      "text": "I have bought this set for several different children in my life-both girls and boys. All of them love it! It's very user friendly and easy to learn the range of tricks contained in the box. Comes with a mini-stage/platform and magic wand. Younger kids will likely need some help learning the tricks (ie: needing an adult to read the instructions and teach them what to do), but they will likely be able to master most if not all of them , with this help. Even when you know how the tricks work, it's still fun to watch the child perform them!",

I will have to sand it down before my kids get hurt..",

I bought this for my 10 year old son and we've both had a lot of fun practicing the tricks to make them seamless. I would highly recommend this set. My only \"complaint\" is that it comes in a hinged wooden box, but the box does not have a latch to keep it shut. This would make it great for storing all the pieces. Otherwise, it was a super purchase and I plan to buy the smaller kit for his birthday. Another quality Lisa and Doug product.",
