It was so loud it gave me a headache. Not a simple fan sound as others posted, a loud grinding rattle. It also didn't cool well at all. Called Honeywell and they were not helpful. I assume it's defective and sent it back, but it's very heavy and difficult to dissemble and get back in the box. So I'm not willing to try again. Overall bad experience and I live in a small area where it's not that easy to find things locally :(",

Seemed to cool well but the noise from the compressor once it kicked on was loud and very annoying. I tried to tell myself I would get used to it but I could not. I called Honeywell Customerservice and they said maybe I had a faulty compressor so I got another exact same unit. It was loud and disturbing as well when the compressor was on. I then bought a nice new LG model with WiFi that was a bit more but it\u2019s great. No rattle noise and works perfectly. So glad I did not settle for this Honeywell.",

The vent flap does NOT open automatically and has to be held open with tape. The fan setting on high barely pushes air more than 2 feet in front of it. My silver floor fan works better than this does at pushing air forward. I really regret this purchase, don't waste your money, buy a window unit if where you live allows it.",

It still works great, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s sucking up the electricity. I live in SoCal so the power bill last summer was $200.00 a month, for 3 months for a 650sq ft apartment. Hopefully this can knock the bill down! I don\u2019t like the fact that you cannot adjust the vent. It points up, so I need a fan to direct it. I hate that. But it does blow ice cold air, I LOVE that!",

My previous 8000 Btu unit had no trouble dropping the temp in this room to 68-72 deg regardless of the temp outside. For the $430 I paid for this unit I'm not impressed by it's performance. This thing isn't small either, with the hose and everything it easily takes up a 3' x '2 space on the floor.",
