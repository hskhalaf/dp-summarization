The worst part is trying to put them on. It's really tricky... like trying to mold them to your feet every single tiiiiime. I'm hoping the elastic portion at the ankle will give some and become more comfortable. I pretty much have to wear them without socks, or with very, very thin socks... otherwise, it would be nearly impossible to put them on. The shoes fit and feel nice, though. Time will tell. Oy! : )",
