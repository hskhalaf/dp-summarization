There is enough space in the front for baby to play with a toy and it keeps her secure. It has been washed many times in the washing machine in 7 months and is in great condition. I do wish the straps could be tightened more. BONUS- after baby outgrows it, it makes a fantastic travel pillow. It's perfect for mom to use as a passenger in the car on long trips.",

The Velcro is strong, she kicks hard too! My only gripe is there's no removable cover- my own fault for not seeing that. I just assumed most baby loungers would come with a removable cover. I have washed it in the washing machine and it was fine, I air dried it. It is somewhat resistant to spills. I think this is versatile for different ages.",

      "text": "We use this every day for nursing. The seatbelt portion is great to keep baby from wiggling down. I actually use this as a pillow to take naps in the family room when the baby takes his naps. Its very fluffy and hasn't lost any shape. I also have a boppy that I keep in the nursery and the leachco that I keep in the family room seems to be less bulky and obtrusive. I also have the whole family hooked on using it to support their arms when they hold the baby. Only thing is we bought a replacement cover as you cant take off the Sage Pin dot cover to wash it.",

This is great for babies who like to be reclined vs lying flat, and this position is actually more beneficial to young ones' spinal development.

I use it everytime I nurse and the baby likes to sit on it as well as be propped up on it for tummy time. It is such a great price and the pillow is great quality. DEFINITELY order this one if you are choosing a nursing pillow.",

He likes to nap in it, so I lay down on the floor next to him and use my computer or watch tv as he sleeps. It says spot clean, but I put it in the wash and dryer on low and it comes out fine. Great quality. It'll be in good condition to use for the next baby.",

I used it for her feedings, to keep her in one spot, for tummy time, helped her to sit in there. I found many uses of this pillow and i would recommend to any mother. It wouldnt be wrong. The only reason i gave it a 4 star is because i cannot take out the cover to wash. You will have to be a little careful there. Otherwise..great product, great value, great use. Enjoy",

This does the job during nursing but isn't as firm; a boppy is just made better. This doesn't come with a removable cover so you have to buy one. For $10-15 more I'm pretty sure you can get a boppy that comes with a removable cover, making it cheaper in the end.",
