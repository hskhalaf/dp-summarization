Yesterday I heard a loud thumping sound in the room, and when I went in to see what it was it was the speaker. The room smelled like something was burning, and I noticed smoke coming out of the speaker, so I unplugged it and put it outside. I am thankful that I was home and was able to unplug it before it burned up.",

Just leave it shut when NOT using it i'd say, in this type of install.",
