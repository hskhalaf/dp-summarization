I was very careful to install correctly and have plenty of experience with bike racks, yet one of the lower foam pads split straight up the middle during my 200 mile drive from Phoenix to LA making it so that the metal rack was rubbing straight onto my car's surface. Hollywood Rack's defective padding single handedly cost me nearly $1,000 in resurfacing and paint on my less than 1 year old car. This is a rotten product. Unless your car is already dented and scratched or you don't mind spending thousands of dollars to repair your vehicle, keep looking for an alternative mode of bike transport.",

Two adult mountain/hybrid bikes will fill up the space for 3 bikes very quickly. Be sure to pick up some extra bungee cords to secure wheels and whatever else. Check and double check all straps every chance you get especially if you're travelling far.",

It has 6 locking straps, in which 4 work great, but 2 will not stay locked in place and become loose. I am afraid the carrier will fall off the car. Outside of the straps, the carrier does the job. May return at this point if I can't get these two straps to lock.",

For the price it gets the job done. -Would recommended bungees/rope to tie the wheels and pedals down. They tend to spin from wind power at higher speeds. -Also would recommend putting something soft over the pedals as they can protrude and scratch car. Use a pair of old socks to slide right over each pedal, it works great!",

My only issue was that my bike was a smaller size, I'm 5' 4'', The posts that held the bike, were to wide to go through the center of the bike to hold it in place. I ended up returning it to fit smaller bikes. So for taller folks, this bike rack is for you!",

A bit uncertain about trusting a 2K+ bicycle to it. One other thought is mountain bikes with \"fat\" tubes don't sit in the rubber cradles very well. In my heart I wish I would have spent more money on a Thule.",

      "text": "The product lived up to the reviews I read and research I did on it. It mounts on the trunk of my 2007 Honda Civic sedan with no trouble and is very stable and secure. I really doubt it can be used for three bikes, but two should be doable (I use it for only one bike). I have a double suspension mountain bike, and purchased the adaptor (also made by Hollywood) that was recommended, but found that the bike fits just fine on the rack without an adaptor (your bike may be different).",

It's a shame you can't have it all! But otherwise this is a great product for the price.",
