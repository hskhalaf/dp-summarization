I still have a pair that are now over 10 years old, and they are far better constructed (and will continue to outlast) the pair I recently purchased. The thin faux leather shoe is of such poor quality that with every step you can clearly see your toes pushing and stretching out the faux leather. As someone who has a variety of shoes that are in excess of a decade old, I take care of my things. These shoes will be lucky to make it to March before falling apart. At least I didn't pay MSRP for these subpar Adidas shoes.",

I am simply stating that narrow shows in general and impact activities, even \"fashion running,\" could cause this painful condition.
