You can also order a charger from the aaxa website. Be sure to download the most recent firmware from their site for picture improvements not implemented in the stock firmware. You'll need a mini hdmi to hdmi adapter. I also recommend buying an HDMI switch to hook up multiple devices for easy switching. I have mine mounted in my bedroom and couldn't be happier with it. Awesome product.",

I will be reporting this to Amazon. UPDATE TO REVIEW: After this review, the company returned my device (without repairing it). At least I got it back. I will have it repaired myself. It requires only a simple weld to the loose clip.",

Of course that happens instantly now that the battery lost all ability to hold charge. I use a usb power supply.",

Unable to charge. $30 to fix. See photo of broken port. Not worth fixing for $30 for another 21 months. Didn\u2019t notice that it can\u2019t play WMV files. Only MPG, MOV.

I contacted with AXXA support, they were able to replicate my reported behavior but they never provide an official answer (much less a solution).

The remote works OK, however you cannot switch ON the projector via the remote (only switch OFF).

Customer service was very helpful and offered both exchange of the unit or refund. PROS: Outward appearance - projector looked sturdy; Customer service was very responsive and helpful CONS: Broken focus wheel There is a good chance that I would give 5 stars for a functioning device.",

This item fits the bill and I was aware and OK with the low amount of light output, but the execution lacks quality. I had to return the item because the focus wheel didn't work consistently. I believe that is a general quality issue, not a single broken item. Also note that, if you are looking for anything that can handle a presentation, this will only work if you are sitting very close to the projected image.
