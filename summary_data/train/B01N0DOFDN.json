This is a non-shiny, thick knit fabric that is pleasantly soft and draping after one wash on delicate cycle. As comfortable as any loungewear, but it can do the office or do dinner in the winter time easily. I particularly like wearing it with my black on white Zentangle leggings, with my realistic-looking holly and berry Christmas brooch.",

If you're a plus size with bumps and bulges, you might want something a bit looser.",
