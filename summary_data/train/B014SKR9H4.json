A few adjustments and it is working great.",

I'm always weary with 3rd party controllers, but I directly compared it to my on brand one and they're identical to the smallest detail, to the point I'm convinced they're made from the same lots of parts. There are only two differences. One: the markings (obviously) and Two: the thumb sticks are tighter. That's actually a significant difference. They're more firm. For some games this is a good thing, for others it isn't, depending on the types of inputs required of the game. But only a high level gamer, like a speed runner, would notice a difference in performance either way.",

I even have a micro USB cable threaded through the couch for my phone and other devices. A wall adapter would have also been helpful as I had to dig deep to find one that wasn't in use on micro USB device.",

Both of the trigger buttons, ZR and ZL, only work if they're pressed a very specific way. To be more clear, if I squeezed them toward the right or left, anywhere but directly down, they would fail to register. The biggest problem I've found with generic controllers is that the range in quality is usually quite large. In my case, I got a very low quality one which I returned.",

I compared it with the Wii U pro controller as well, and I prefer the snappiness of the Kommendable controller. The sticks and buttons are all crisp, although the D-pad can be a little annoying. This is something it has in common with the normal pro controller. When you press left or right on the D-pad, it's a little too easy to hit up or down accidentally. Otherwise, the controller is great. 5 stars.",
