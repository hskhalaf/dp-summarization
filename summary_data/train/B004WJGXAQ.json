Difficult to choke up on the handle at the same time because it's so thick up top. I think Husqvarna knows people will pay an extra $10 for something that looks pretty.

There were some rolls on the edge; but they were very tiny, not a show stopper. Nicely weighted. Not so heavy that you don't want to carry it to a camp site but, heavy enough to split wood with a couple of strikes. For the intermediate/beginning camper, you won't go wrong with this one. For the price, you can afford to make mistakes with it, with out breaking the bank. Purchase another sheath. The one it comes with does not protect the edge well. I think it's intent is to protect you or your pack from the edge.",

There are plenty of YouTube videos out there showing how ton refinish the handle of the axe with boiled linseed oil and how to put a quality edge on the axe - although it showed up with a nice edge. I did purchase the competitor's sheath off Amazon for short money, as many reviews claimed the Husq sheath had rivets that could damage the blade. So, if you're deciding between this axe and a $200 and you're using the axe for general use around camp, DO IT!!!! You won't be disappointed.",

The blade has a limbing profile, but it does an ok job with light splitting too. Rumor has it these are OEM'd Gransfor Bruks axes, and I have no reason to doubt it with the high quality and balance of these axes.",

The logo stamp is the only flaw. The stamp is ridiculously deep and too close to the cutting edge. This will hopefully not be a problem for a small hatchet used primarily for cutting roots during landscape maintenance. I do believe Husqvarna should rethink this deep stamp as I won't risk buying a larger axe with this stamp because of the greater force a larger blade will experience.",

It will definitely need protective collar, preferably metal, rubber might do it but would ruin the look of this classsic axe. Lacks power of fiskar for sure.

It's a total shame that the head is hung 10 degrees off-center. An axe is more than a well-forged head and a straight-grained handle. A decently-forged head _properly_ hung on a mediocre handle is a useable tool. I received an axe-shaped object. The only way to make it into a useable tool is to cut off the handle and hang the head properly.",
