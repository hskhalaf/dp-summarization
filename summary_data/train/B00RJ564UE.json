I used this product on a daily basis and after day nine the redness has decreased, the hair is growing back, and there are just a few scabs left. My cat is no longer scratching at the infected area and it is beginning to heal nicely. The product says you can apply the cream up to 2 times a day. I was only able to apply it twice for a few of the days just due to my schedule. But even with once a day application it has worked wonders.",

(I got rid of the acrylic but can't get rid of the grass!) He loves it when I apply ResQ to one side and then the other and insists on licking my fingers after each side. It's our ritual.
