I ended up baking mine and then wearing them around the house with skate guards on for a few hours one afternoon, and that did the trick. Google \"baking hockey skates\" for how to do this. Now they fit perfect and seem very sturdy and well-made, especially for the price. A quick $15 initial sharpening at our rink, and good to go! Unless you play or skate multiple times per week, these are probably perfect for you...I'm a casual once-a-week skater with my son, and couldn't justify hundreds on pro-level skates, these are awesome for me.",

Checked the measurements again after receiving the boots and again size 7 should have been perfect with a little room to spare. The product doesn't come with size guidelines online, what's making shoe size decision at this point impossible. $12.00 spent on returning the skates and left with no product. Very disappointing. Moving to a different brand. The skate box says US 7, EUR 39/40. I am a EUR size 39 and the skates were not just tight but I would say they were 2 o 3 sizes too small.",
