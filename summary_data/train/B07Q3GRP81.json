Less you hate Merica then you probably hate corn hole, cold beer, and having a good time. The weight perfect. Not like that girl I brought home late from the bar the other night. The only thing that has better aerodynamics is the bald eagle that\u2019s gonna be soaring high above your head while your tossing them. These bags having stopping power of a 50 cal dessert eagle even on the slickest of boards. So if your looking for the investment of a lifetime get these bags and keep calm and toss on!",
