He's 6'3 and fits in the chair comfortably, assembly was very easy, he assembled it himself in probably 10 minutes. I'm really glad I got this chair, music sounds amazing the volume is perfect and the bass is lit. Overall a really great product, I usually don't do Amazon reviews but I had to review this because this really is great. And worked good with our smart t.v.",

When you sit, you tip back, so you use your back and leg muscles to keep you from going too far. It\u2019s a cool looking chair.

While I'm not thrilled with the padding on the chair - it's not uncomfortable, just not as plush and plump as some other models - it has forward facing speakers right next to your head on both sides for the surround sound effect, so you feel like you are IN THE GAME. It's marvelous.",
