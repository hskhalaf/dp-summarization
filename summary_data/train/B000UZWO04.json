      "text": "Bought these to replace jacks I had on my trailer. They look stronger and sturdier than the previous BAL telescoping jacks that I had. They mounted easily and attached securely to the frame without any problems. While towing to the campsite however, the vibrations from the dirt road caused the jacks to lower themselves and sheer off the frame. Luckily the car behind us saw them fall off and flagged us down. I have never had a problem with BAL products, but these jacks should not lower themselves by themselves while driving!",

I replaced my rear scissor jacks with the BAL 24830 and it is night & day difference. These jacks are so much more stable. Highly recommend. The install was very easy with the only real work being getting my scissor jacks off.",

I used on a slightly narrower trailer than suggested so I cut the frame down, which was EASY to do and doesn't affect the strength of the design etc. Just chop-saw the outer rail in the middle and paint the cut part, then it slides together and DONE... took 5 minutes to modify the width. Strong enough to lift my trailer off the ground if needed.",

Auto Leveling System, still has shake in the rear living area. After installing the stabilizer jacks almost all of the shake is gone. I only had to drill 2 holes for the new jacks. I was able to use 2 existing holes. I also like the telescoping feature. It makes it very easy to adjust the width without sacrificing strength. I also added the BAL 20031 Deluxe Base Pads. These provided additional footprint for spreading the weight load. These installed very easy, also.",

Still will have to have a support welded on trailer frame for singles though.",
