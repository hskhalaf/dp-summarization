      "text": "I have bought several because my cat can destroy them (not declawed), with unbridled joy so much so that she has to take a nap after every session. She also likes to give it a wack whenever she passes it. The feather used to be gone before 24 hours pass but she's slowing down now in her dotage. I like its colorful design. I only just got it from Amazon and it came with other items. When I got down to it, she leaped on it from nowhere and went nuts with it. How she knew it was there, I can't imagine. Perhaps it somehow had a catnip smell?",

Our cats lie on their backs or sides and grab at both sides of it; although they use their claws, they are playing more than scratching. (For scratching, they prefer cardboard, not carpet or rope. Every cat is different, right?) We can't believe how much fun they have with such a simple item. It's sturdy, but we bought a second one just to make sure we'll have another when this one wears out!",

She tried to scratch the first time, and when it moved back and forth, she totally ignored it and walked away. Has never been back. I've tried to coax and entice, but its a \"no go\".
