The nozzle amplifies sound, and they notice. You point it away from them but one loud blast (to them, it's not loud to a human) and he stopped pulling. After the first block of a few loud blasts, I could use short barely \"hisses\" and get him to correct. Expensive, works as a reminder tool, would get too expensive as a training tool unless your dog is actually afraid of this. This pup is not afraid of it, but he responds to it as a correction.",

We were taking her on a trip and I sure didn't want her barking her head off at everyone she saw. Verbally correcting her was useless. This got her attention and worked like magic. Be very careful that you don't spray it AT the dog or anyone else! My boyfriend was carrying it in his pocket and leaned over, pushing the nozzle, and burned his leg when it sprayed on him. It would be nice if it had a safety nozzle, like pepper spray does. I imagine there have been quite a few accidental injuries with this product.",

I follow it with positive reinforcement and repeat thing like \u201cno biting, kiss\u201d or \u201cno barking.\u201d I only have to point at the drawer where I keep it and she stops to listen to my command.

It\u2019s never meant to be aimed at the dog, but sprayed near him or her. They don\u2019t like the sound and it\u2019ll interrupt the behavior-literally stopping them in their tracks, long enough for you to tell them to \u2018Stop That!\u2019 After the first couple of times of using it, we\u2019ve only had to show him the bottle and he behaves much better.
