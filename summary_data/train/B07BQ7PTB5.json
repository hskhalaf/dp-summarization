Now he is growing and he is needing some 4t clothes and he just turned 3 in September. My pediatrician was impressed at his improvement in numbers on the growth chart. Said whatever you are giving him he is responding well so keep giving it to him. This is such a lifesaver. Thank you!",

He/We have tried many protein mixes with most ending with \"this tastes like cardboard\", so that's good. Truly appreciate the quality of nutritional value compared to some other brands out there.
