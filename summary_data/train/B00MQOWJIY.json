The features of this shoe are perfectly suited for runners who want exceptional cushioning, solid arch support, and protection for a more cloud-like feel. The springy effect of the sole offers a more responsive ride for a more enjoyable run. The price of this shoe is indeed worth the quality and performance it offers.",

I liked the color a lot, and I like to rotate my shoes, so I thought these would be a good second pair. While they fit the foot just fine, the heel cup was about an inch shorter than on the Cloudrunners. Every time I would take a step, the shoe slid off of my heel - would have made for some AMAZING blisters. I returned these and bought another pair of Cloudrunners.",

I ran uphill for a mile in these and my feet were slipping all over the place. I normally buy a 1/2 size up for when my feet swell during a run, but these were just way too big.",
