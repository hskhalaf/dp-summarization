      "text": "Solid helmet that the ladies love! Nice finish on the outside, comfortable liner inside, and the visor doesn\u2019t fog easily, and is optically correct. Another solid product from biltwell. If I had to nitpick, I only have two changes I\u2019d like to see. Move the chin strap forward a bit so it is more under my chin and less against my neck. Secondly, make the mouth vent closeable for the cold mornings, and maybe add some brow vents that are also closeable for the warmer days. Overall it is a solid design, and feels great. Don\u2019t be tempted with the Chinese knock-offs, trust me, you will be disappointed.",

Things I don't like for the $250 price is the front vent isn't adjustable so cold weather riding is tough unless you stuff a rag inside. Also the visor does not stay in the up position very well, slightest motion makes it fall down. Since the \"anti fog\" visor fogs when sitting still at around 55 degrees, I lift it at stop lights but usually keeps falling.",

The large visor is clear and provides very good vision to your peripherals. You get the look and safety of a Simpson helmet- at half the cost. I absolutely recommend this helmet for anyone who is in the market for one. Additionally, if you ride in cold weather, you will need to ride with a neck gator up over your nose and mouth to prevent your face from getting too cold.",

I don't feel like i'm missing out on the wind in my face moving to this helmet from my halfie. I installed a Cardo packtalk 4+, which was super easy, and it has improved all of my rides.

It feels like a feather compared to my old Shoei and Scorpion, and there is plenty of airflow.

Definitely stylish, I paired it with a tinted shield and love it. Has pockets for headset,easy to install! Definitely a great helmet for the price. I plan to keep it in my rotation. Only downside is it is not the best for winter/spring as it has good airflow..wish it had vents yoh could close! Shield doesn't like to stay open on its own anymore so that is also a negative.
