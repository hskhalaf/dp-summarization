My betta was blue and iridescent white when I bought him, but his white parts turned orange-red shortly after I got him home. I decided at last to try there Wardley ones, which are just plain brown and do not appear to have dye in them. My fish's lovely iridescent color is almost completely back, after less than 3 weeks on the new diet! I am really delighted. He also seems to have more energy.",

They are small little pellets but what I like most about these is that once they sit in the water and soak up the water, as the fish eat them little particles go out from there and feed my smaller baby fish who are too timid to swim to the top of the tank for the fish flakes. These are perfect for fry in breeder boxes as well and I have raised many batches with these. I will never buy anything else!",

The shrimp pellets are the absolute FAVORITE of my cory cats and sucking loaches, and these flakes are also amazing. Almost not water waste, no bright dyes like other brands, and they make my fish so bright and happy. They adore these flakes and I suggest any wardley product if you're looking for a healthy, budget feed for your beloved swimmers.",

After the top 1/8 inch there was nothing but tiny, tiny pieces that my bigger fish can't seem to see. Most sink to the bottom of tank to crap it up. Evidently it is an industry wide practice to smash fish flakes as small as possible because another brand I previously used to like started packing very small flakes also. Too bad the label says \"Original Large Flake Formula\". I'll keep searching for a company that still produces large fish flakes.",

THEN he\u2019ll swim away, and he doesn\u2019t ever spit it out. He also began eating sooner rather than later after being moved to the aquarium. So I recommend it! Go forth and feed your fishy!",

The food is very fine and just sinks to the bottom. Going back to Tetra flakes. Those hold their shape even when you get to the bottom of the can.",
