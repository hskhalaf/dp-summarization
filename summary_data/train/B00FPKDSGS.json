Mine came updates with the latest ver.4 software, so the focusing is pretty good and the updated menu. This camera packs a serious punch when it comes to image quality, and because of its size and weight, you will always want to carry it with you. It also makes you slow down and think a bit more when shooting, which we all know results in improving your skill.",

Please note this camera does a whole lot more than what I need but nice to have and not need than need and not have! Also bought a Meike 35mm manual lens to shoot old school!

      "text": "Need to learn how to use focus assist. Once there, its a breeze. Really good low light performance. Good focusing speed. I carry this with me all the time. Its my go to camera. I am also using this camera with some old tele lenses for pseudo wildlife and bird photos. easy to get adapters. Performance equivalent or better than my 2010 vintage APS-C DSLR. A lot lighter to carry, a lot more compact.",

The camera feels significantly faster overall. It is not Olympus OMD fast, but compared to the previous X-E1, it is a very significant improvement. Love the camera.",

    "description": "Color:Black| Style:Body Only| Configuration:BaseX-E2 Body 16.3 MP APS-C X-Trans II CMOS Sensor with Phase Detection and EXR Processor II.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n * X-Trans* CMOS II & EXR Processor II, harnessing the full potential of each lens to capture breathtaking quality in every image.\n * World's fastest auto focus speed of 0.08 sec.** achieved by Fujifilm's unique phase detection AF system.\n * The design of prioritizes \"photographing\" enabling instinctive operation and high-speed responses.\n * X Mount Lens - the product of integrated lens & sensor development with original digital technology.\n * FUJIFILM X-E2 Evolution: Impact on Shooting & Playback Functions.\n\nSensor: APS-C \"X-Trans CMOS II\"\nEffective Pixels: 16M\nLCD Monitor: 3.0-inch (1,040K-dot)\nSensitivity: ISO 25600\n\nEVEN FASTER SO THE MOMENT CANNOT ESCAPE.\nWORLD'S FASTEST AF SPEED OF 0.08 SEC.** ACHIEVED VIA THE INTEGRATION OF PHASE DETECTION PIXELS INTO THE ADVANCED SENSOR.\nHigh-speed responses from the on-sensor phase detection AF system. Accurate focusing in dark scenes that only contrast AF can deliver. The FUJIFILM X-E2 has both, plus Intelligent. Hybrid AF for automatic switching to the optimal focusing system for the scene and conditions. A newly developed algorithm improves AF accuracy when shooting low- contrast subjects and dark scenes. The evolved AF system of the FUJIFILM X-E2 brings your subject into sharp focus so quickly that priceless moments will never escape your lens.\n\nEVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL COLOR REPRODUCTION AND EVEN HIGHER DEFINITION IMAGE CAPTURE. THE ULTIMATE SENSOR, APS-C 16M X-TRANS CMOS II.\nX-TRANS CMOS II FOR UNMATCHED COLOR REPRODUCTION.\nFujifilm's unique X-Trans CMOS II array eliminates the need for an OLPF, enabling the sensor to capture unfiltered light from the lens for an precedented level of resolution.\n\nLENS MODULATION OPTIMIZER TECHNOLOGY BRINGS OUT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE XF LENS.\nThe advanced Lens Modulation Optimizer (LMO) technology in the FUJIFILM X-E2 was made possible by the integrated development of the lens, sensor and processor. For each mounted lens, LMO high-precision processing of the lens focal length and aperture, as well as data from the screen center to the edges, corrects diffraction blur when shooting with a stopped down aperture and compensates for the slight blurring in the lens periphery. The result is edge-to-edge image quality with incredible sharpness and a sense of dimensional reality.\n\n* Lens firmware update required.\n\nX-TRANS CMOS II SENSOR\nCAPTURE EACH STRAND OF HAIR IN CRISP DETAIL.\nDue to the X-Trans CMOS II sensor architecture that eliminates the need for an optical low-pass filter (OLPF) and integrates FUJFILM's originally developed color filter array, the FUJIFILM X-E2 reproduces scenes with resolution and clarity rivaling a larger sensor.\n\nCONVENTIONAL ARRAY\nRepeating pattern in the case of an array of 2 x 2 pixel units.\n\nNEW FILTER ARRAY\nHigher degree of randomness with an array of 6 x 6 pixel units.\n\nX-Trans CMOS II sensor incorporates an original color filter array with a highly random pattern, eliminating the need for an optical low-pass filter (OLPF). These filters are used in conventional systems to inhibit moir\u00e9 at the expense of resolution. The X-Trans CMOS II sensor array lets the sensor capture unfiltered light from the lens, achieving an unprecedented level of resolution.\n\nINTELLIGENT HYBRID AUTO FOCUS\nWORLD'S FASTEST AF SPEED OF 0.08 SEC.* ACHIEVED VIA THE INTEGRATION OF PHASE DETECTION PIXELS INTO THE ADVANCED SENSOR.\nHigh-speed responses from the on-sensor phase detection AF system. Accurate focusing in dark scenes that only contrast AF can deliver. The FUJIFILM X-E2 has both, plus Intelligent Hybrid AF for automatic switching to the optimal focusing system for the scene and conditions. A newly developed algorithm improves AF accuracy when shooting low-contrast subjects and dark scenes. The evolved AF system of the FUJIFILM X-E2 brings your subject into sharp focus so quickly that priceless moments will never escape your lens.\n\nMANUAL FOCUSING\nDIGITAL SPLIT IMAGE**, THE WORLD'S FIRST MANUAL FOCUS SYSTEM TO EXPLOIT THE POWER OF PHASE DETECTION PIXELS.\nTapping the power of the phase detection pixels integrated in the X-Trans CMOS II sensor, Digital Split Image helps you manually focus your shot with greater precision. While checking the split image displayed in the LCD monitor or EVF, you can manually adjust for pinpoint focus, especially helpful when working with an open aperture or macro shooting.\n\nFOCUS PEAK HIGHLIGHT FOR PINPOINT MANUAL FOCUSING\nWhen manually adjusting focus, this function highlights high contrast areas of your subject for smoother and more accurate focusing.\n\nEFFORTLESS AND WIRELESS CAMERA-TO- SMARTPHONE PHOTO TRANSFER. ORIGINAL \"ONE TOUCH\" WIRELESS TRANSFER TO YOUR SMARTPHONE OR PC LETS YOU SHARE HIGH IMAGE QUALITY ON THE SPOT.\nYou can easily transfer images wirelessly from the FUJIFILM X-E2 to your smartphone or tablet after installing the free FUJIFILM Camera Application app. There are no troublesome ID and password settings; just press the Wi-Fi button of the top of the camera and then add the images easily to your blog or share them with friends on your social networking site. You can also use the FUJIFILM X-E2's built- in Wi-Fi to save your photos to your PC.\n\nBrowse the pictures on the camera from your smartphone or tablet, and select just the photos you want to download to your smart device.\n\n* \"FUJIFILM Camera Application\" for iOS may not be able to save certain movie file sizes / formats that cannot be played back on the smartphone. Please try a movie mode setting of HD (1280 x 720) or lower.\n\nSELECT AND SEND UP TO 30 PHOTOS AT A TIME.\nHighlight up to 30 images and transfer them to your smartphone. You can send them in the existing photo size or choose the \"3M compressed image\" option.\n\n* Maximum multiple image transfer is 30 photos or 2GB.\n\n\"LOCATION SEARCH\" LETS YOU FIND PHOTOS USING LOCATION DATA DOWNLOADED FROM YOUR SMARTPHONE TO YOUR CAMERA\nJust install the free \"FUJIFILM Camera Application\" in your smartphone, and you can download location data from the smart device and tag your photos with the data.\n\nSHARE IMAGES WITH A FRIEND WITH THE FREE APP \"PHOTO RECEIVER\"\nJust have your friend download and install the app in their smartphone or tablet.
