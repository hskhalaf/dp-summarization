      "text": "The device I received was the Chinese version (BKL-AL20). NO US CARRIER WILL WORK with this device. Also, the device is NOT unlocked. Huawei has stopped providing unlock codes, so the device can NEVER BE UNLOCKED. Looking at previous reviews and questions, I assume previous buyers got the US version. The US version is referred to as the \"View 10\". The Chinese version is \"V10\", seen in screenshots below. \"About phone\" in the EMUI settings says Model BKL-L09, which is incorrect. This device supports the following LTE bands which are consistent with other Chinese devices, but useless in the US: B1/B3/B5/B8/B38/B39/B40/B41",

But unless you are planning to dunk the phone into your swimning pool, the phone works fine. All the responses are quick and you do get the feeling of having a high end processor running your device. The user interface is a modified version of Android Oreo and its decent. However, one can always use Nova Launcher to tailor it as per the needs of the user. Camera quality is good as well and can give the flagship phones a good competition. Overall, very satisfied.",

      "text": "Incredibly fast, and the phone operates perfectly for my needs. I think it's a great entry level into flagship phones without purchasing a Samsung or iPhone. It fits well in the hand, and the quality of the screen is great. It plays emulators, games, multi-windowed apps, etc. flawlessly without hiccup. Only thing I'd say I dislike about this phone directly is the UI and how user friendly it really tries to avoid being. It can be changed, obviously, so that doesn't take away from the quality of phone that it is. Would also highly recommend buying tempered glass for this as your screen will scratch and get nicks in it very easily without it.",

Love the facial recognition unlock feature. Super thin. Zippy, haven't noticed any lag. Honor provided a clear tpu case and a screen protector installed(not tempered glass). The only issue is the lack of OIS in the camera, but if you have steady hands this is a non issue. DH liked it so much he's ordering himself one.",

I think I'd rather have this one than an iPhone. It's not that expensive, the camera is great, I don't mind the lack of image stabilization. So much storage it's crazy, the super charger is so useful and this phone continues to get updates so that's great. I bought a Samsung note 5 before on Amazon and I got screwed basically. The phone wasn't new and the charger was not original but with this phone, everything came legit. Brand new. Thank you for being honest and sending the right stuff",

I bought this to replace the GF's Samsung Note5, which her battery life was so poor now that she couldn't do anything with it past about 4 hours. I'm convinced that Samsung introduced an intentional bug in Google Play services to run the battery life in the ground. Planned obsolescence and all that. Anyway, this is a great little phone for the enthusiast that doesn't want to spend the money on the Mate 10 or the p20 pro.",
