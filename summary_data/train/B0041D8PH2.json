Right now it is ok, but if you have a dog that kneads the bed or scratches it before they lay down, this definitely will not last. Super thin.",

One of the dogs decided to chew a hole in it, less than 24 hours, a good sized hole and lots of little foam bits - foam is solid but dog took great joy in pulling out pieces. So if your dog is a chewer, look for another product, like the cozy cave style beds. There's a reason they are twice the price. They are more durable. The dog I purchased the bed for (not the chewer) seems to like the bed, he puts his back against the bolster and curls up. Nice cushion.",

The sides didn't have the same amount of firm stuffing. Really! If you are going to modify these beds as they get larger in size it should be stated in the listing.

However, a month or so later, when I took the cover off for the first time to wash it, I noticed the orthopedic (foam egg-crate) cushion was already substantially compressed and almost non-existent in the center. Disappointing! I will have to add more cushioning there. She sometimes claws at it, in a futile attempt to fluff it up in the center. My dog is definitely not too heavy (50lbs) for this size L bed, so it is not a size problem.",

I have 3 small dogs and 2 labs, I may have to keep buying more of these!",

The large is light and easy to move around compared to her giant bolster beds. Very happy with this one. If you have a large dog, you should definitely spend the $ for the XL though.
