I needed a High watt mixer that has enough power to mix heavy bread and pizza dough. This mixer has an 800 watt motor, 225 more watts than the top of the line home Kitchenaid mixer at half the price, 3 year warranty, 5 year on the motor. Have made several batches of dough, this mixer performed flawlessly, more than enough power.",

But I purchased this brand because it had attachments I could purchase. The blender and food processor have no power. It would be a waste to try the other attachments available. Very disappointed. And when I mix a thick batter for cookies the mixer tends to shake or jump around. So, I don't feel safe leaving it unattended. It might work its way off the counter. It does not meet my expectations of a multi purpose stand mixer.",

In hindsight, wished we purchased the 7qt, but my wife can still do enough dough for 2 loaves at one time with this one. The biggest gripe has been the accessories. The mixing paddle and dough hook both have a finish that come off after just a bit of use (presumably in the food). Cuisinart support has replaced them both a number of times. Finally bailed and purchased an after-market mixing paddle - still looking for an after market dough hook.",

Truly a \"desktop\" because of weight, but it doesn't seem to \"walk\" when it's in use. Very quiet. Given the larger motor and no plastic gear it's a no brainer to go with this compared to the KitchenAid which broke when a metal gear stripped. Add on: Have owned it for about a year.

This mixer replaces the kitchenaid mixer that after a few years of ownership has started to break down. I decided on cuisinart after owning their food processor for over 11 years(an still running). I wanted to upgrade to stainless. Now all my appliances match and are cuisinart. A very smart investment if I do say so myself. Hope this helps.",

      "text": "I really love the lighter weight (compared to Kitchenaid) and have had great results with double batch cookies. It works wonderfully well. However, for a right handed person used to adding ingredients with my dominant hand, the controls are on the wrong side of the mixer ??!!. I've adapted and face the mixer forward so I can get to the the release handle, on-off switch and speed control dial with my right hand but I'd really prefer to have the bowl facing to the right so it's easier to use. I was also a bit disappointed that the bowl was too tall to fit into my refrigerator--when I need to chill before baking.",

      "text": "If you are going to purchase this, be sure to have a 15mm thin wrench. You will need it to remove the bread hook. As the machine kneads the dough, the nut on the attachment tightens. The plastic splashguard to protect the nut and shaft from getting dirty also makes it really difficult to use a normal wrench to loosen the nut. A really poor design. The Cuisinart staff was totally unhelpful. As someone else stated, the warranty is useless, mail in service only and user pays shipping both ways. This thing is huge and would cost a fortune to ship.",

Unfortunately, after using it to whip cream last week the mixer now shocks anyone who touches the bowl or the silver band around the top of the machine. It doesn't have to be running to shock the user, it only has to be plugged in. The shock is strong--it is not a minor static-type shock. The warranty is for 3-years, so that is that.",

    "title": "Cuisinart SM-55BK 5-1/2-Quart 12-Speed Stand Mixer, Black",
    "description": "Color:BlackHoused in durable die-cast metal, this stand mixer features a powerful 800-watt motor that can handle the heaviest mixing tasks. Its large, 5-1/2-quart, stainless-steel bowl accommodates big batches--even double recipes. The unit also provides 12 mixing speeds, along with a 15-minute countdown timer and automatic shutoff, for maximum precision. Choose the slow-start function to eliminate splatter or the ultra-gentle fold function to carefully blend in delicate ingredients. The mixer's tilt-back head allows for easy access to the mixing bowl and makes attaching accessories simple. \n\n Accessories include a chef's whisk, a flat mixing paddle, and a dough hook, as well as a splashguard. The whisk aerates ingredients to increase volume or can also be used on slow speed to gently combine dry ingredients. Contoured to reach the bottom and sides of the bowl, the flat mixing paddle ensures thorough mixing. The dough hook makes hand kneading obsolete, while the splashguard offers an extra-wide pouring spout for easily adding ingredients. The stand mixer also contains three power outlets, including a high-speed outlet for its optional dedicated attachments (meat grinder, citrus juicer, blender, food processor, or pasta maker--all sold separately). The stand mixer measures 15-1/2 by 10 by 12-1/2 inches and carries a three-year product warranty and a five-year motor warranty. \n\n From the Manufacturer\n\n \n\nMore than 30 years ago, Cuisinart changed the way the world cooked. Now it's changing the way the world mixes with the Cuisinart stand mixer. The new extra-large Cuisinart 5-quart mixer has the power, capacity, and precision to handle any job a recipe requires and delivers more power to mix even the heaviest dough. There\u2019s also more capacity to double and triple recipes. The mixer comes with three accessories, allowing you to mix, whip, or even knead dough. It has 12 speeds to ensure splatter-free starts and fabulous finishes. In addition, Cuisinart offers optional attachments that can be purchased separately. Each attachment connects to one of the three power outlets on the mixer (two on the top and one on the front) to let you blend, process food, squeeze juice from your favorite citrus fruits, make homemade pasta, or grind your own meats.  Multiple Outlets Mean More Functionality \n\n \n\n \n\n 1. High-speed power outlet for the blender and food processor attachment (sold separately), which connects to the rear power outlet on top of the stand mixer. \n 2. Mid-speed power outlet for the citrus juicer attachment (sold separately), which connects to the front power outlet on the top of the stand mixer. \n 3. Slow-speed power outlet for the large meat grinder and the pasta maker attachments (sold separately), which connect to the power outlet behind the slow-speed outlet cover on the front of the stand mixer head. \n\n An Array of Helpful Features\n\n \n\nThe mixer's tilt-back head securely locks the stand mixer into a raised position, which allows easy access to the 5-quart mixing bowl and makes it easy to attach accessories. The stainless-steel bowl includes handles, which makes the bowl easy to hold, scrape, and remove, and it's oversized to let you mix larger quantities.  The mixer has a handy 15-minute countdown timer as well as a slow-start function that eliminates splatter for the most delicate ingredients. The fold function allows you to mix in ingredients at the lowest speed with two options--continuous, to blend ingredients, and pulse, to combine ingredients. Each pulse generates 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 revolutions of the flat mixing paddle, chef's whisk, or dough hook. The flat mixing paddle, dough hook, or chef's whisk spins independently while rotating around the mixing bowl for the quickest, most thorough results. No need to rotate the mixing bowl, Cuisinart\u2019s stand mixer does all the work for you. \n\n Features:\n\n \n\n *  Large 5-quart-capacity polished stainless-steel bowl \n *  Powerful 800-watt motor \n *  15-minute countdown timer \n *  Auto shutoff and 12 speeds \n *  Includes 3 accessories: chef's whisk, flat mixing paddle, dough hook \n *  Splashguard with pour spout to prevent spattering \n *  Recipe book \n *  Power unit: clean with a damp cloth and dry \n *  Bowls and tools dishwasher-safe (tools top-rack dishwasher-safe) \n *  Warranty: Limited 3-year product warranty and a full 5-year motor warranty",
