      "text": "Nice looking I would have given 5\u2606 but right out of the box there is a black marking, not sure if it's paint or black threads from manufacture, it seems to be defect like a painted on the white background *( picture attached) and second strange that the shoe laces were laced out of the box not a big deal but it supposed to be new shoe. And third is that the size seems smaller. As I ordered 11 M but it fits very tight like it's 10 narrow. Makes me think that it's not original Nike and maybe fake? I don't know what to do about the black paint or thread defect on the new shoe.",
