The 28-300 did not disappoint and performed very well. If you are a pixel peeper then maybe you need primes instead. For me the lens performs threw out its range extremely nicely.This range for me is exactly what I need for a walk around lens. It is a little heavy but I am used to its weight.I would recommend this lens for out door daylight shots. It shines in good light situation. If you need low light then look for a faster 2.8F stop.",

Please note this is not fully internally focusing/zooming, so the lens barrel does extend outwards when you zoom in. One final note, the shape of the lens feels excellent in your hand as you hold it to steady your shot. Highly recommended.",

I thought I would stay away from zooms and stick with primes when I switched to FF but I found I stopped taking my camera with me on my daily walks. And realized I needed the flexibility of a zoom during those walks - it's primary use for me - here in the NorthEast. I do carry along a 50mm for those times with low light as I'm not sure this lens will function well for me in anything but good daytime light.",

Not as sharp as the 70-200 2:8, but good for most shots.",
