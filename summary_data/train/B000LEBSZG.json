I'm sure it works just fine as a box cutter though. If you plan to use it in the same capcity as me, might I recommend instead something with a titatnium blade like a Kobalt (what I use now). These also have double sided (trapezoid) blades that are relatively cheap to replace and have many other blade shapes to choose from.",
