A couple of major issues I am very uncomfortable with is not being able to turn of the SSID without having major connectivity problems on the wireless side. The other issue is having to reboot the router every day to reset the wireless connection and be able to connect to the internet even when I can ping the router from my laptop.",

Although I'm pretty savvy on hooking up these sorts of networks, I followed the instructions in the quick start guide and they worked great. Got 22 Mbps at 100% signal quality and 66% signal strength, although the PCs are only 100 ft apart (two walls). Noticibly faster than using the internet connection sharing feature in Windows.",

      "text": "I bought the 614+ with the intent of using the Nortel Contivity VPN client to connect to my company's network. Tech support told me it doesn't work with Contivity, but does work with the Extranet client. I was unable to get either the Contivity or the Extranet client to work. If you don't need to use a VPN to me this would not be a bad product, but don't expect much help from Tech Support. I think they get most of there recommendations from Internet news groups.",

Performance on the wireless LAN is disappointing - hard to get a signal more than 25 feet from the base unit through any wall. 2. You must flash the firmware with their recent v2.0 in order to get reasonable PPoE performance. 3. No \"send keep alive\" option for PPoE DSL users. If you can reconcile with the unpredictability of wireless, this is still a good product at a reasonable price that is easy to configure.",
