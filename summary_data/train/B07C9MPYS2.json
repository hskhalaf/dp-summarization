I was able to glue it so you couldn't tell. There was no time to send it back or worry about getting a new one so that's why I glued ours. It's possible that during shipping is when it was broke. But after glueing we were able to use it. But all in all very nice product and ours came early. If I had to order it again. I would.",

Again, its cute, it served its purpose for pictures and it was readable. Thanks",

This piece feels quite solid. I\u2019ve also included a photo to show the width of the sign (approximately 1/8 inch) which appears to be a good size as I wouldn\u2019t want anything too heavy on top of my cake! Shipped quickly! Only slight downside is that it smells a bit like burnt wood, but I believe that\u2019s probably to be expected based on how it is constructed. Overall I would definitely recommend! Price is very good! (Several I priced on Etsy were more expensive.)",
