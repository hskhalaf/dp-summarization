It smelled musty and mildewy just like others have described, a horrible strong odor. I contacted the manufacturer and they said it must have been stored incorrectly. They suggested returning it. I did so and Amazon promptly sent me another. The second one also stank. I returned it to Amazon. Then I ordered one directly from the manufacturer. It stank. They said I could return it or try another. I said why not. It arrived yesterday and the 4th time was the charm, no smell ! So beware of the stench.",

Secondly, the device sat off-center in the cutouts, which was very noticeable with a white device. Thirdly, when I turned the device horizontally, there was a lot of tug on the leather sleeve at the top of the screen. This case needs some trouble-shooting done to fix these issues.",

The second thing is the zipper: it was balky, which wasn't a deal breaker, since I would never use it, but the zipper detracts from the case's otherwise appealing style. Third, the tab to prop up iPad wasn't high enough for me. I returned it and bought a Snugg.",

He wanted it in Vintage Brown and I must say it really does look like it's been around for some time. For anyone looking for a pristine looking cover, this not for you. It truly looks like an old book, just as described.",
