The TUF is a wonderful laptop that can handle whatever game I throw at it with no effort at all. Its battery life is impressive, as I can go around the entire day before needing to charge it. The lit up keyboard is very comfortable and keys not that loud . Overall it is an impressive device that is a real bang for your buck. You don't need a crazy 1500 dollar alienware when you've got this TUF friend around.",

Frustrated at this product, I immediately returned this product and opted to get the Dell G7 gaming laptop instead. If you are trying to get a great budget laptop for decent gaming, I would suggest an Acer Nitro 5 instead of this product.",
