I also had a problem. The part of the buckle that is on the inside of the left shoe, that goes across the foot, had a very sharp piece of steel that came to a point. I have Neuropathy in my feet and Never felt it rubbing my foot until I got home and took them off.I didn't bleed so I never noticed. I sent them back, but I'm going to reorder them and just check them this time.I did love these shoes.",

The disappointment is that this is not a blue, which I preferred, and it is not a gray, but more of a bluish gray which I actually like very much. The size fits perfectly and the comfort is fabulous! I love that Birkenstock sticks to what has been working for many many years, and continue providing the same excellent quality workmanship, and that I know what I am getting when ordering Birkenstocks.",

The style of these shoes is a little more expensive but they really are envied by others and she likes them a lot. I am a very frugal man and after finding her a pair at a yardsale and seeing what she has put the other pair through ( rain/snow/ beach/mud/grass ) you name it I figured they were worth the money.",

I was afraid of Birkenstocks because I remember many years back I tried on someone else's pair and didn't like the feel, but I love these. They are comfortable and fit my foot well. They don't feel big and floppy. I am pleased and am glad I ordered one pair for errands and this second pair for a little more dress up.",

Just got these for summer and although I thought they ran slightly larger, once I tightened the strap they were perfect and very comfortable. Much better than the original Birkenstock footbed or the Birkis. Will be ordering more.",

When I do a lot of walking, the regular footbed can rub in sensitive areas like the balls of my feet, my arches or under my toes. The extra padding of the soft footbed eliminates these problems, and it's the same price as the regular, so why not give it a try? The only drawback is that the padding makes them a little \"warmer\" than the regular footbed, so if your feet sweat a lot, you might be better off wearing socks.",
