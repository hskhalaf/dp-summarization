      "text": "I'm giving the Wilton Candy Melting Pot three stars because it does a great job melting chocolate. The issue I just ran into is that the purple ring around the silicone tub just broke apart at the seam after just three months of casual use. I always hand washed the tub in lukewarm soapy water (no dishwasher and no super hot water). At first I thought it was supposed to come apart for easy cleanup, but sadly that is not the case. The plastic ring and handle assembly appears to be held together with low temperature glue. Increase the durability factor and you'd have a winner here, Wilton.",

I used nestle toll house morsels & added a teaspoon of organic vegetable shortening in my melting chocolate to help thin it out a little bit for easy dipping & coating. The instructions said it's not dishwasher safe so I wash it by hand. It is very easy to use & I love using it. This melting pot will get a lot of use out of it & I am so happy that I purchased this. This is way better than a double boiler. I strongly recommend this product!",

This pot keeps it warm so there\u2019s no need to reheat. The only downside is that it took a little longer than expected to melt. About 5-10 minutes for a 12oz bag of candy melts on the \u201cmelt\u201d function, which ended up only being about half a pot once it was melted. Regardless, it is worth the wait. Once the candy melts are melted, they stay warm and the right consistency to continue dipping!",

My only word of advice for new users is that once you\u2019ve heated the candy melts, make sure to back off to the middle (keep warm) setting as keeping it on the highest setting can cause candy melts to start thickening/seizing up. When they say easy clean up, it\u2019s absolutely true. Just lift the inner lining out of the outer shell and flip the cooled candy melt \u201cblock\u201d out of the silicone lining and store for another time! This tool gets so much use and it is well worth the money if you\u2019re dipping cakes, cookies, pretzels, fruit, etc.!",

      "text": "I read lots of the reviews on this and some are not good but I took a chance and ordered it anyway because it had a larger pot than some of the others, plus it has an optional divided pot. So far I am very pleased with the Wilton unit. It melts the chocolate quickly and holds at a good temperature for dipping. I'll have to wait and see how it holds up but, initially, I'm very happy with it.",

The lower heat setting is around 140 degrees, and the higher setting is 200. The higher setting is perfect for tempering shea or cocoa butter. I would love to purchase a few of these in the future for making multiple lip balms at once.",

    "description": "Scent:StandardMake chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate covered pretzels, cake pops and more with the Wilton Candy Melting Pot. It features an easy-to-clean and convenient removable silicone pot with an ergonomic, heat-resistant handle and two easy-pour spouts \u2014 perfect for pouring melted candy into a decorating bag or drizzling directly onto treats. Once finished, simply chill the silicone pot until the candy hardens, then gently squeeze the soft silicone insert to pop out the remaining candy. The pot has two temperature settings, warm and melt so you can quickly melt up to 2 \u00bd cups of Candy Melts candy or chocolate in less than 10 minutes and keep it warm for dipping. An innovative heating base stays cool to the touch, a safety light indicates when the pot is on and it has rubber feet to keep it steady and in place on your counter. Powered by a standard 120-volt cord with polarized plug. Complete instructions included. Instructions- Wash removable silicone pot before and after each use. Be sure silicone pot is completely dry before adding candy. To preheat, place silicone pot in heating base; turn switch to Melt for 5 minutes. Use Wilton Candy Melts candy or chop melting chocolate into small pieces. Use smaller amounts for faster melting. Stir candy occasionally until completely melted. Add more candy if desired, up to MAX FILL line. When completely melted, move switch to Warm to keep candy fluid. If candy begins to cool and thicken, switch back to Melt. When finished, switch to Off and let pot cool before cleaning",
