Also, is this a sample size because I just paid $22 for a jar of moisturizer that is about the size of Carmex lip balm. I can\u2019t imagine it will last more than a week... so, considering the size & price, I\u2019m a little on the fence with this one. I\u2019ll update next week if my feelings change & this stuff changes my mind.",

    "description": "BOTF C.E.O. C + E antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer. THD ascorbate is the newer, clinically proven, oil-soluble derivative of vitamin C, which penetrates better into the skin while being exceptionally stable against oxygenation. With 5 percent THD ascorbate, this moisturizer is powerful at helping to fight the first visible signs of aging and restoring vital skin radiance. It is uniquely suitable for those with sensitive skin, because THD ascorbate is significantly less irritating than other forms of vitamin C. Once in the skin, it helps boost youthful-looking skin texture and volume, in addition to providing photostable, antioxidant support. Blended with protective, anti-pollution expopolysaccharides and refining lime pearl extract, this formula helps repair the effects of aging, environmental stress and pollution-induced damage. It is rich yet never greasy, providing hydration and antioxidant protection to the skin for a visibly younger, softer, healthier-looking complexion.\n\nBRAND STORY\nSunday Riley uses only cutting-edge technology and the highest quality ingredients, for instant, noticeable results, without compromise. Welcome to the world of Sunday Riley \u2013 clean formulas, for results you can feel good about.",
