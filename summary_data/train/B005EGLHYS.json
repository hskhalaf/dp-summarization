      "text": "Okay, I'm an old (female) bag with no one to help with these assembly projects, and I needed a piece of furniture on which to put my cable box, etc. So, I tackled it and succeeded! The instructions were quite good, and although it took me longer than most to put it together, I did it without any difficulty. It's very attractive and utilitarian\u2013a very nice addition to my living room and it matches my other furniture. I wish it wasn't as deep as it is; a little flusher to the wall would have made it perfect. But it serves its purpose. Be careful how you assemble and treat it though, because it chips very easily.",

It was fairly easy to put together except for the aggravating back board piece (thick cardboard and just annoying to tack on!) I love that My Canon printer fit perfectly on the shelf and I will be able to store everything I wanted to there. It was a little darker than I expected so I\u2019m not crazy about that but I\u2019ll live. I bought it to match the desk of the same design. It is very sturdy & heavy to not be real wood. Great for the price, in my opinion.",

      "text": "The delivery from Amazon was delayed by 4 days. The packing was very good. I like the cabinet as it uncluttered and housed my different devices like router, modem, printer etc. However the instructions in booklet are incorrect. The front vertical round edge molding in the booklet referenced as \"End Molding\" named \"O\" had to be removed and reinstalled again as the upper two shelves wouldn't be enter as mentioned in the last assembly step. The bottom drawer has instructions for putting 4 screws but there are only two holes. Also it does take a good 3-4 hours to assemble the cabinet considering you are told not to use powered phillips screw driver.",

The finish is a dark cherry as you can tell when it sits beside my fireplace which has a cherry finish. Well worth the money and time that I put into it. I bought it to put my play station game and controllers. Very nice and Sauder makes nice products!!",

Don't move it again unless you have to -- and then be careful. The drawer was a tight fit requiring some gentle (rubber mallet) encouragement to assemble. The rails are good and I expect the drawer to work faithfully for a long time.",
