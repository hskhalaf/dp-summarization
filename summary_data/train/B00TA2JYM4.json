This guy is my best friend and does the job in minutes!! I run it over my floors once a day, make a pile, and then use a Dustbuster to pick up the pile. Shake out the broom, and its good to go! I've now washed the head in my washing machine (and then dried it in the drier too) probably 5 or 6 times as needed, just when its gotten a little grey. Its held up well. Would definitely purchase again and recommend!",

      "text": "The handle is excellent with a large diameter main tube and large grips but it's light weight. The frame appears to be powder coated steel and should last a lifetime in residential service. The mop head is like a string mop. As expected, it does a good job on hard surfaces. The 18\" size is NOT inclusive of the strings so it's somewhat larger than 18\" on the floor. This is a serviceable tool for cleaning; it's not $20 worth of Chinese made,synthetic junk with a plastic handle and plastic fittings. It's light enough to be easy to use and heavy duty enough to last a long, long time.",

      "text": "I have usd many dry mops through the years. This one by far exceeds my expectations! It\u2019s very sturdy and well made and easy to use! The adjustable handle is nice because I clean houses for a living so I\u2019m constantly loading this in and out of the car. I can shrink the handle by a simple twist and bring it back up when I need to! It\u2019s nice too because I can also use a clean mop head and extend the pole to wipe down walls. I do this to help remove appt from wood stove usage when the dust settles on the walls. Great product! I would buy again!",

This connection clip is so strong I attached my Bona to it and it works great. Also you can attach towels to it for giant spills, and micro dust towels. Very maneuverable!!! This is the best piece of America ingenuity I\u2019ve seen for a long while. Wash the mop in A LAUNDRY BAG. (I do not receive anything for my reviews, on top of this, I don\u2019t lie - -try that for day).",

      "text": "I remember years ago my mom has a cotton dust mop and it worked great on dog hair. This is that mop on steroids, I ordered the 36\" mop and I can get the floors done in about 5 minutes. This is not some flimmsy mop, it will hold up for years to come. I really like the way the dog hair comes off when I shake it outside, no need to wash it every time its used. Best part made in AMERICA",
