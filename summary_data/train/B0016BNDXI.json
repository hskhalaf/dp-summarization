I had to have a reverse partial shoulder replacement which has taken (so far) three months of my life and cost (so far) well over $30000. The bar shortened in length during use despite set screw set \"tight.\" This is a class action accident waiting to happen The product should be removed from the market.",

It gets used every day for hanging briefly -- I can hear my spine clicking back into place -- and very mini pull-ups. Someday they might be feet-of-the-floor pull-ups, but right now my feet don't leave the floor. It relieves end of day strain from computer work and my long commute. Great tool for reversing muscle loss and helping keep shoulders strong and functional, not to mention the benefit to arm strength.",

The first time my 70lb child was doing pullups she cut her chin on the screws that are awkwardly placed right in the center of the bar where you complete a pull up. Poor design.

Cons: I find the grips too close together for my comfort (I end up placing my hands on the outer edge of the grips so they just get in the way instead of helping me grip). I can only use the bar for strict pull-ups, strict toes-to-bar, etc... It's not recommended for kipping or jumping pull-ups. Overall: For the price and convenience, the pros greatly outweigh the cons. I ended up using other grips (Soft GRIP POWER PADS - ALTERNATIVE TO GYM GLOVES, Weight Lifting Straps and Gloves  ) on top of the bar since the ones on the bar aren't useful for me.",

So just look out for it. I wish there was also a way to stop it from turning as it is possible to accidentally loosen it while you use it if not careful.

Also, it's a lot easier to spackle drill holes in the frame (from this type of pull up bar) than replace dented molding which results from the other style.",

With whoever built this, the screwdriver or drill slipped in the head, creating burs on each screw. They could have taken a bit more care assembling this, or at least filed the heads down, so the user doesn't get cut! That's what I did. Better yet, use a screw that has a lower-profile, and cover both screws with that black, foam-rubber stuff.",

The only downside is that the way I tend to grip the bar causes maybe a quarter turn every time I use it, which gradually loosens the bar.

Great to have a bar in a convenient place so I have no excuse not to bang out a set of pullups every time I pass (well... not every time, but that's not the bar's fault).",

I now need to get someone else to remove the half installed bracket so that I can put in better screws. (Sorry, I love to buy tools but am terrible with them - no the drill didn't slip - the metal of the screws is more like playdoh than metal.) All that means is that I haven't been able to use the bar because I can't get the brackets mounted. I'd suggest buying better screws before trying to install the bar.",

Assuming you're within the weight limit, tightening the screws won't actually 'support' you more, it will just increase the tension and the chance of your wood breaking / splitting 2) Be careful during installation. Since this isn't hanging, you'll want to make sure that the brackets are set up at the right height and distance. Use a measuring tape. After that, you're good to go--great device for the price.",

It doesn't damage the door frame, and it's strong enough to support my boyfriend's weight too. Note: It stays in place by turning in like a shower rod, so you can only do pull ups from one side. If you do it from the other side it will unscrew it. Totally fine if you are aware of this and stay on the correct side though.",

(makes all the difference.) so I didn't/don't have to drill holes, etc. shipping was fast also. I probably won't ever use it for chin ups, but if I do, I will feel confident using it. get a rebounder, you won't regret that either.",

One complaint is that I wish there was more padding. Yes you can adjust it, but you are still limited because you can't really do wide grip pull ups.

I very strongly suggest to install the bar with the screws, as supporting it only with the \"expandable spring\" effect will not hold any weight. I tried installing the bar only with the expandable effect and just performing a dead hang, the bar clearly slips (I weigh around 150-160 lbs.) The padding (grips) on the bar are very thin and not very comfortable if you are doing the pull/chin ups barehanded. The bar only rotates very slightly when pulling too hard (rotates on its axis, but does not slide). Other than that, if well installed, this bar will work perfectly.",
