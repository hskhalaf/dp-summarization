The zipper could use a little reengineering, and the manufacturer would do well to listen to seasoned Amazon shoppers on this. Overall the product is a great value. The quality is good, the performance is just right, and the price is reasonable.",

It worked fine at midnight when the temp was 20 degrees, but by morning it had dropped to 16 and the bag was barely warm enough. It seems difficult to draw the bag up tightly around the head / face area, which allows cold air into the bag. For other, more expensive bags I have used in the past, this has not been a problem. So, I was disappointed that it would not work for lower temps, but for the money it will serve my purposes.",
