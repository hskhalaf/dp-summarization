      "text": "I look fly in these pajama pants while binge watching my netflix shows. They are somewhat lightweight but quite warm, and most importantly they are ultra comfortable. They have two draw strings on the waist line that you can tighten on loosen depending on how much snacking you've been doing, and I appreciate having pockets on both sides so I can keep my phone and wallet handy if needed. These Nautica lounge pants are reasonably priced, and are the perfect lazy day companion. I've even went out in public with them on and got no weird looks, bonus!",

In recent months I've had the same experience with a bad fit for Nautica sleep shorts. It's too bad. First pair was five star. Update November 1st. I tried another pair and the fit is excellent, just as the first pair I purchased. It\u2019s nice to have the second pair now.",
