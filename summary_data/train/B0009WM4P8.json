Nothing fancy, light water resistance, anti slip soles, good ankle support. Over all a good boot for the price.",

      "text": "I don't wear these every day, but I like them for when I travel to factories that require steel toes. They are easy to slip on and off at the airport. Also very easy to slip on when I have to walk the dog in the snow or something. They do take some breaking in though, and they gave me some blisters the first time i wore them, but that's what you get for walking 3 miles the first day go get them. Any boot is going to do that.Make sure to get some thick wool socks and that will help. so far they are a good boot.",

      "text": "I bought these boots for my husband, and he is a hard fit. He was nervous a about the size being accurate, but he said that they fit perfect. He wore them the whole first day he received them and said they were as comfortable as his Tony llamas. He told me one was a little tight to get on, but they were perfect once he got them on. He told me the color was perfect for someone who was looking for a rustic look. They are sturdy, you cannot even feel the steel toe, and they are already broken in. No blisters from these boots due to breaking them in.",
