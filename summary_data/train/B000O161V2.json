Sure it's not a Hasselblad, but not everyone can afford to drop $40,000 on a camera. Auto focus works well. From turning it on, to focusing and taking a picture in good light it takes about 2 seconds. It's not like a regular non-SLR digital camera where you only get the dolphin's splash after he jumped or your kid after he's already run to first base. You can stop the action perfectly and at a reasonable price. I would recommend this to any standard consumer without hesitation.",

It does not autofocus with non AF-S lenses, but I consider it an asset since it makes the camera significantly lighter for walking around. Also, AF-S lenses are focusing significantly faster and quieter than the old screw-type ones. To use older AF lenses, consider getting Katz-eye for this camera to assist with manual focusing. I personally prefer manual focusing with prime lenses as it's faster and would get you exactly the results you want.",

The D40x is ready to shoot when you are, thanks to split-second instant shutter response which eliminates annoying shutter lag. Exceptional image quality is made possible by a high resolution, 10.2-effective megapixel CCD image sensor and Nikon\u2019s exclusive image processing engine. 10.2-megapixel resolution invites creative picture cropping freedom without loss of picture quality and delivers the ability to make enlargements of extraordinary size. Additional features include built-in flash with innovative Nikon i-TTL control, In- Camera Editing features with Nikon D-Lighting, Red-Eye Correction, Image Trimming, Image Overlay, Filter Effects and more. An ingenious HELP Menu with \"Assist Images\" helps you select the appropriate settings for many camera features, and the included 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX and 55-200mm f/4.5-5.6G ED AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor lenses allow you to start shooting right away. \n\n Nikon D40x Highlights \n\n Extraordinary Nikon image quality The D40x's high-resolution image quality is made possible by Nikon's high-performance 10.2-megapixel Nikon DX-Format CCD imaging sensor and exclusive Nikon image-processing engine, assuring stunning sharpness and color. \n\n Nikon's smallest Digital SLR ever Beautifully styled, the D40x makes high-performance digital SLR photography easier and more convenient than ever.You'll be amazed at the power packed into a camera that weighs just over 16 ounces. \n\n High-Performance 10.2-megapixel Nikon DX Format CCD imaging sensor Nikon\u2019s DX Format CCD image sensor delivers vivid color and sharp detail, great for making beautifully detailed enlargements of 24 by-36 inches and beyond. High resolution also provides room for creative cropping. \n\n Included 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX and 55-200mm f/4.5-5.6G ED AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor lenses These ED glass element lenses feature ultra-high speed autofocusing and Nikon's Super Integrated Coating minimizes ghosting and flare to provide even higher contrast and more vivid images, even in challenging light conditions. A new compact rod-type Silent Wave Motor (SWM) enables ultra-high speed autofocusing with exceptional accuracy and super-quiet operation. \n\n Fast startup with instant shutter response A fast 0.18 second startup combined with split-second shutter response and rapid-action shooting at up to 3 frames per second makes it easy to freeze special moments instantly. \n\n \n\nThe D40x is capable of shooting a rapid three frames per second. Shoot at up to 3 frames per second The D40x can fire continuously at a speed of up to 3 frames per second, capturing high-quality action sequences of children in sporting activities such as soccer, baseball and much more.  2.5-inch, 230,000-pixel color LCD monitor with 170-degree wide-angle viewing Playback images are easy to see and function menus are easier to use with a larger and brighter color LCD monitor. The large 2.5-inch LCD monitor enables image preview at up to 19 times magnification and has large type fonts with easy-to-view menus. \n\n 3 colorful display options All new display options: Classic, Graphic and Wallpaper. Carefully designed color schemes help make changing camera settings easier than ever. \n\n Built-in Speedlight with i-TTL automatic flash control Nikon's innovative i-TTL flash control evaluates flash exposure with incredible precision to achieve better automatic flash balance and deliver outstanding results. The built-in Speedlight is always at the ready and brings beautiful exposures in darkened conditions, as well as adding sparkle for fill flash in outdoor situations for enhanced twilight shots or an added impact to daylight images. In low-light or back-light situations, added illumination from the built-in Speedlight can make the difference between an average snapshot and a dazzling picture. \n\n 8 Digital-Vari Program automatic shooting modes Eight Digital Vari-Program Modes include: Auto Flash-OFF, Portrait, Landscape, Child, Sports, Close Up and Night Portrait; each of which adjusts automatically for optimal results for everyday shooting situations. Each mode considers lighting conditions and possibilities, aperture, shutter speed, white balance, hue, tone, sharpening and more to make creative photography as simple as rotating the mode dial. \n\n \n\nIn-camera editing functions include red-eye correction. In-camera image editing Highly versatile in-camera editing features through the Retouch Menu include Nikon D-Lighting, Red-Eye Correction, Image Trim, Image Overlay, Monochrome (Black and White, Sepia and Cyanotype) along with Skylight, Warm Tone and Color Balance filter effects. This provides greater creative freedom without the need for a computer, for those who prefer to send pictures directly to a printer.  New advanced HELP Menu system with Assist Images The D40x's newly introduced Assist Images help you select the appropriate settings for many camera features by showing an example image typical of that setting, as well as an advanced HELP Menu for the current item selected. The D40x's Question Mark icon (?) indicates that help is available for the currently selected item; just press the HELP button beside the LCD monitor to see a context-sensitive HELP page. \n\n Nikon 3D Color Matrix Metering II The D40x's 3D Color Matrix Metering II evaluates each scene for brightness, color, contrast, size and position of shadows and highlights, selected focus area and camera-to-subject distance, comparing that information against an onboard database of more than 30,000 actual photographic scenes. The result delivers instantly and precisely determined exposures for each scene, even in challenging lighting conditions. \n\n Fast, accurate 3-Area Autofocus The D40x's advanced 3-Area AF system and the refined algorithms inherited from more advanced Nikon digital SLR cameras deliver fast, efficient and precise Autofocus. AF refinements deliver greater precision with fast, more consistent subject acquisition and improved focus tracking for consistently sharper pictures. \n\n \n\nEnjoy easy in-camera optimization. Image Optimization options The D40x's Image Optimize setting lets photographers adjust color, contrast and sharpening, as well as other image settings, according to the type of scene or output desired. Settings include: Normal, Softer, Vivid, More Vivid, Portrait, Custom and Black and White, each of which are automatically adjusted based on sophisticated Nikon algorithms or user-selected settings for optimum results.  Up to 520 Images* per Battery Charge The supplied EN-EL9 rechargeable battery will allow for shooting up to 520 images per charged based on CIPA battery testing standards.",
