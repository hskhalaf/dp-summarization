I can feel an obvious difference between days that I drink this post-workout and days that I don't. Great taste, great results, I found my new go-to",

At first, it took me a few days to get used to the taste. But after awhile, the artificial flavor resides and the drink tastes like strawberry milk. I used 8 oz. of unsweetend vanilla almond milk and that's perfect for me. If you don't blend enough milk with the powder, it ends up tasting very sugary. So adjust the milk ratio to your liking. I don't recommend mixing this with water, it's gross in my opinion. I also like blending frozen strawberries in, you can make a berry shake!",
