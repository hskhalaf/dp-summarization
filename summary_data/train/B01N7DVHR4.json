Superman and Batman were as I expected. Makes a lovely gift or addition to a collection. Only thing that would have made it better would have been adding Wonder Woman to round out the trio.",

I really like the different look of Steppenwolf but the kids felt he wasn't recognizable. The only thing that I would caution about is the fact that Steppenwolf's axe lights up every time you swing it so the battery will most likely die out pretty quickly.",
