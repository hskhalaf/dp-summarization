      "text": "We have a hedgehog and the Silent Spinner is literally the best. The bottom stand detaches and you can screw the wheel to a wire cage with ease. I can only hear when Reggie is running if he drops a piece of food on it, since it clinks repeatedly while he spins. The pieces detach from one another, which makes cleaning so much easier. I'd say this wheel is great for a multitude of pets, but its especially great for hedgehogs since their little legs are too fragile for other wheels.",

The back portion detached from the wheel one day and the little plastic piece that holds the front fell off. It wouldn\u2019t reattach/screw on so I got a nut to fit the screw holding the wheel and something behind it is stripped and won\u2019t hold it steady. So the wheel is useless now and I need to buy another one. Overall decent quality but I\u2019ve had other wheels last years vs. only 6 months.",

Had this occurred in the middle of the night when hedgehogs usually run our little hedgy would probably be missing a toe. If you do have a hedgehog, get the non-silent version of this wheel that is molded from a single piece.",

Not only that, but the wheel broke one day. Luckily, while my teenaged daughter was handling it and not while the hedgehog was running on it. We proceeded to purchase another wheel (that is flat) and not only does the poop fly off, but the hedgehog prefers it- he runs on it for hours.",

The wheel had not fallen but he was running on it and was slung out of the wheel and hit the wall of the cage very hard.

My Degus were able to spin off the locking nut and chew away at the rubber sound dampener. Now when the wheel turns it's plastic on plastic and makes a terrible screeching sound. Would work well if you can keep that wheel on so they don't get to the rubber.",
