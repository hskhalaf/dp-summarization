It is Navy Blue. That was disappointing as you can see it when I wear low shirts which defeats the purpose of the band. So if your wanting something black, this is not it. The packaging is says black, but the band is blue. Will post pics when I get home. Other than that it is great",

It\u2019s also pretty comfortable. A bit tight at first and rolls down easily while sitting, bending, etc but nothing that you can\u2019t handle. Just be aware of sizing when you order. The medium says 6-10 but it\u2019s more like 10-14 I\u2019d say. Although I planned for this because of the reviews.",
