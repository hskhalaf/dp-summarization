I figured the tool bough would be made with a ticker material since they usually are, but it\u2019s just a really thin flimsy piece of felt. So I\u2019m a bit disappointed. I was hoping for it to have more use than just a halloween costume but oh well. It only is only a piece of Velcro to hold the belt on so you can only put a very small about of weight. Thankfully my 2 year old is small enough I can tie it in a knot at the moment.",

I've been told this is how they are suppose to be, but it's annoying to loose one of the pieces). Elastic on goggles is too tight and will need to replace. The pockets aren't deep enough to hold the tools, tools fall out. Belt is a junk piece of fabric and velcro so it also falls off.",
