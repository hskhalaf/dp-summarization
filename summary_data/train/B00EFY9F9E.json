On the backhand side the black rubber wasn't flat, had multiple small to medium sized bulges, making the racket completely unusable. I have requested a replacement, and once I receive it, I will update the rating as well as the review. EDIT: I got the replacement and it's all good now. I would rate this racket highly for beginner to intermediate players. If you are below 1200 rated, you will be ok with this. Anything beyond that, you will need to invest in a custom-made solution.",

I actually started feeling like trying to put spins on the ball made a difference! After playing with this paddle for a few months, I'm spinning and chopping with ball on level with some of the people who have been playing for years. Some of my coworkers have other paddles they've bought which I've tried, but this one just feels the best to me. Lightweight with good speed and spin!",

However, it feels somewhat harder to control, and I don't have as much spin generation as I was expecting from this racket. The spin feels no different, or maybe even a little less compared to the STIGA Titan. I play ping pong nearly every day and competitively locally, and have had this paddle for about a month in a half. Somewhat disappointed in this racket.",

Didn't think it would make a big difference, bought it to leave at my work (because all the paddles there are almost broke) Little did I know that this paddle is amazing, it is effortless to hit the call with force, also amazing spin control. Changed the entire game :) I will note the weight of the paddle is slightly more, and feels like it's up in the paddle not the handle. Took some getting use to, but I'm liking it now. Only 1 complaint, the handle isn't super comfy, the flat in the sides make it feel like your holding a rectangle instead of a round handle.",

In fact the speed of the paddle was so much better than my existing sets that I had to relearn control of the ball. This paddle is highly recommended for anyone who is not a beginner. Like: Speed, spin and did a great feel. Dislike: Stiga should have included a paddle cover for this awesome paddle.",
