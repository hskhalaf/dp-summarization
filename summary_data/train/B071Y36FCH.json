This is my 14th knife from Dalstrong and will be used to spin up a catering company in the near future. The Dalstrong whetstones will keep the edges \"screamingly sharp\"! We will butcher our own meats (buying in bulk is the most economical way to go), and several of the knives will be indispensable to our work. We will be purchasing additional knives as we add employees in our small family business. I highly recommend these knives and the company behind them - a LIFETIME Warranty on all products!",
