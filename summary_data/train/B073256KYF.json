It was nice to have the middle of the rope marked and an extra rope to put down on the ground with stakes to show who wins. The only thing I would mention is to tape the blue things on the end of the rope. They came off easy after a few times of tug of war. All around a great rope and it comes in a nice storage bag too!",
