SO, THAT IS BAD! It's tedious and a little dangerous in the sense that it does not contain the pill entirely during or after the cut...but it got the job done. Update, I've used it on less than 20 pills and it's just crushing them now. Ya get what you pay for!",

      "text": "I've owned several different designs of pill-splitters, and this is by far the best. It holds the pill in place so that it's easy to split it into near-equal halves (not guaranteed, but pretty close). I use mine a fairly often (not daily, but more than weekly). After a couple of years, the thin flexible plastic shield--that slides up over the blade every time the splitter is opened--broke, and whole splitter ceased to move well. (You can extract the broken shield, but then there are other issues, I don't remember exactly. ANYWAY, it's inexpensive, so I just bought another one, and was HAPPY to do so.",

      "text": "This is the second one of these I've owned; the first one lasted about a year, and after using it one time a day for that year it failed. The cut is not always perfect, occasionally resulting in big-side, small-side situations. But it's better than several other pill cutters I've tried. I'm using this exclusively for small 5mg thyroid pills for my cat. Since those pills are fairly small, they will sometimes fall out the wrong end of this cutter, and I certainly would not try cutting a pill any smaller than these. But as I said, this works better than any of the other cutters I've tried.",

You have to hold the splitter at a perfect angle towards you so that the pills fall into the front section. The mechanism is astonishingly dysfunctional.
