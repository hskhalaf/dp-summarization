The vase is gorgeous but the original vase box is old and shabby. It looks like it's returned by someone before. You cannot say it's brand new at all! Even though I was so disappointed about that , I still want to keep the vase! I just love its simple elegant design. As the gift for my friend, I will buy a Waterford one from Macys.com.",
