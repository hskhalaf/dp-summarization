The package came with several types of adapters that will suit your particular needs and although the plastic is very much plas-tic-yyyyy, it is holding my dash cam up just fine and the suction cup went up and stuck the first time. It's been 3 days since I installed it on my windshield and with the \"heatwave\" we've been experiencing in California combined with the cold rush of air conditioning, there's been no negative impact on the suction mount. I am completely satisfied with this product and for $8.99, you don't have very much to lose if you don't believe me.",
