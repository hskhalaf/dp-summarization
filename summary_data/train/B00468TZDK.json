Was proud to display it and share with the birds & squirrels. Would appreciate a credit or refund. I would like to recommend a purchase to other customers but unable to do that at this time.

One weird thing is that there is a green connector piece that is on top of the solar panel on the upper bowl, and I don't know why they didn't make that black to hide against the black panel. But all in all I am extremely happy!",
