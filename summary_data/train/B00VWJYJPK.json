      "title": "Great Little Camera",
      "text": "This is my third Olympus Tough, which should tell you about my commitment to the brand. I like the TG-4 camera, and I am glad that I purchased it. The setup could be a little simpler. After one weekend on the Suwannee River, I lightly scratched the viewer screen, so I highly recommend that you order glass screen protectors before use. The battery charging access door came open while on the river which could have been a disaster, but no problem. It could have been user error, so I will check very carefully to see that the doors are double latched before each use. The camera meets all of my expectations otherwise. It takes great photos.",

The picture quality is not as good inside as I would like inside, but I've used it mostly on a boat or around the pool and have gotten great results. I have a larger DSLR camera for other shots. The video quality is great, also. Lots of different settings for every photo op.",

You end up with a purple smudge in the center of all your photos. The more you zoom, the worse it is. I sent the camera back to Olympus and paid to have the issue \"fixed\" but there is no change to the image quality. If you don't zoom too much, I imagine you won't have too much of a problem but this should not happen on a $300+ camera.",
