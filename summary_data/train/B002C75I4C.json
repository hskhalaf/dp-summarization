They are a little bulky to walk around in, so I wear them mostly while watching TV.",

I used to use just wool socks, which did OK, but I would inevitably get chilly feed. These booties stopped that. With my heavy wool socks and these boots, my toes are toasty warm all night, even during a -40o night last winter. They are too hot for me for anything other than winter, but everyone is a little different. If you are looking for something to warm your feet, these will definitely do the trick.",

Toasty warm for indoors, sole is a little on the flimsy side, would not expect them to last outdoors. I wanted a slipper to keep my feet warm indoors and thats what I got.",

I suggest you buy them one size up from your usual shoe size, they run a little small in size. The bottoms are great for inside mostly, with just enough of a sole to use if you have to run outside for something. I must confess I ware them to bed most of the time in the winter.

    "description": "Twenty-five years ago Baffin Footwear began manufacturing insulated and non-insulated footwear products. While traditional molded boots are suitable for some conditions, they are not ideal for cold temperatures. Baffin combines leading molding technology with a foam-based inner boot system, which creates a hybrid style of high-performance footwear. This equates to more warmth, better fit, and superior comfort. Baffin boots are different than most shoes and work boots because the sole and midsole are molded to the base in one continuous process. The sole itself is a marvel of modern engineering because it is made up of several advanced thermo-set polymers that are combined together to achieve the right balance of warmth, protection, low weight and grip. Baffin is dedicated to offering boots with functionality and fashion, while still maintaining their legendary performance.",
