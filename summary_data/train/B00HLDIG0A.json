      "pros": [
        "The Canon PowerShot N100 packs a larger-than-usual sensor and a lens that starts at a bright f1.8 aperture, a combination that gets you better photo quality in low-light conditions than you'd get from a typical point-and-shoot",

        "It's heavier and bigger than the similarly spec'ed PowerShot S120",

The flash does not pop up automatically when needed. There is a indicator in the screen that shows need to use a flash. One has to pop up the flash using a button on the side. Also, I felt that the menu system was not intuitive in setting up the different modes. I was thinking of giving 3 stars but the images come out good. So, 4 stars.",

The lens achieves a bright f/1.8 aperture at its widest, enabling shallow depth-of-field that is perfect for creating portraits with beautiful, soft background blur while the wide-angle gives your images a distinctive sweep and grandeur, capturing landscapes, cityscapes, tall buildings and wide groups of people with ease. And with a focal range of 24\u2013120mm (35mm equivalent), the lens provides the PowerShot N100 camera with the versatility needed to capture moments creatively.\n\nOPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\nBEAUTIFUL IMAGES AND INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE START HERE\n12.1 MEGAPIXEL HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nThe PowerShot N100 camera employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor to capture precious moments in the quality they deserve. Delivering state-of-the-art imaging performance and optimized for use in compact cameras, the sensor utilizes a sophisticated light-capturing design to provide high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.\n\nDIGIC 6 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nA camera made for capturing the moment in a whole new way, the PowerShot N100 camera is equipped with the very latest Canon proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor. With the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot N100 with outstanding processing power for the camera's Dual Capture mode. And video recording is better than ever, as the DIGIC 6 Image Processor enables Full HD in MP4 format. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM HELPS PROVIDE EXCELLENT LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE\nThe PowerShot N100 camera features the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM to capture the moment with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. With the Canon HS SYSTEM \u2013 a combination of the camera's 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor and the powerful DIGIC 6 Image Processor \u2013 you'll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality at high ISO speeds; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The Canon HS SYSTEM also lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur in a variety of situations for incredible photos and videos.\n\nRETHINK PHOTOGRAPHY WITH CREATIVE SHOT\nCREATIVE SHOT MODE\nExpanding upon the innovative features of the PowerShot N, the PowerShot N100 camera features an advanced Creative Shot mode to make creating artistic photos even more fun. In Creative Shot mode, the camera captures the original composition and automatically produces and saves five additional variations by using advanced Canon technologies to apply filter options based on the individual scene, subject and exposure. On the PowerShot N100 camera, over 40 filter choices are available and are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy. With Creative Shot mode, the result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.\n\nREMEMBER THE DAY IN CRISP HD\nHYBRID AUTO\nEasily preserve the story of those special moments with the PowerShot N100 camera's advanced Hybrid Auto. Hybrid Auto records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips and pictures* into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions, or any time you're shooting many shots in one day. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.\n\nAnd with the PowerShot N100, not only is the \u201chighlight reel\u201d stunningly beautiful, you can also tell the story of your day with behind-the-scenes input. Select the size of the images shot with the rear-facing \u201cStory Camera\u201d and position them as you like to further personalize your highlight video. As the story doesn't stop with the press of the shutter, the PowerShot N100 camera's Hybrid Auto continues to record approximately two extra seconds of the photographer's expression, resulting in a short video that captures the full emotion of the moment.\n\n* Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.\n\nFLEXIBILITY TO COMPOSE, CREATIVELY\n3.0-INCH TILT, CAPACITIVE TOUCH PANEL LCD\nLeverage the flexibility of the PowerShot N100 camera's innovative 3.0-inch capacitive touch panel LCD for more fun, creative shooting. More than just a means of reviewing your photos, the LCD monitor allows for 90-degrees of tilt to open up new perspectives when framing shots \u2013 shoot diagonally, horizontally, from low angles or high for the perfect emphasized shot, even when using the rear-facing secondary camera. The top-mounted hinge keeps the PowerShot N100 compact, even when folded out. Adjust settings and modes using the intuitive touch-screen menu \u2013 use gestures to zoom, rotate, and select images. The versatile control provided by the capacitive LCD makes operating the PowerShot N100 an easy and fun experience.\n\nSTORYTELLING IN BEAUTIFUL FULL HD\nCAPTURE STUNNING 1080P FULL HD VIDEO WITH A DEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON\nTell your story not only with photos but with the moving image too. The PowerShot N100 records stunning Full HD video with spectacular realism in a format that is easy to share. You can simply touch the dedicated movie button to start and stop video recording, so you're always ready to capture the moment as it happens. The camera records in lifelike 1080p Full HD, so even when played back on a big-screen HDTV, your videos are crystal clear, with smooth action and beautifully natural color. With the power of the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, video can be captured at 30 frames per second in the popular iFrame\u00ae Movie or MP4 formats. Using the iFrame Movie format gives you compatibility to process your video in a wide range of video programs, furthering your storytelling ability; MP4 videos are perfectly sized for quick online sharing \u2013 whether you're showing relatives what the kids are up to or posting status updates on social networking sites.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nINTELLIGENT IS\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot N100, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're shooting still images or video.\n\nStill Image Shooting Normal IS Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning IS Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. Video Recording Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting. Active Tripod IS When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake. SMART AUTO\nSmart AUTO for the PowerShot N100 makes it easier than ever to capture the sharp, bright, colorful images and videos you're looking for. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58 predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results. Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects, and landscapes at evening or on a bright, snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as \u201ckeeper\u201d shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot N100 ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Movie Digest & Hybrid Auto Automatically selects shooting settings for optimal quality and records a video clip every time you capture a still image. One day's worth of clips are then combined into a single video. Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions.
