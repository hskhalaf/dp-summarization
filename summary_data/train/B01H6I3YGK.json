For a transmitter with a claimed \"proven range of 295 feet\", this distance didn't seem to much to ask. But in my case 30 feet was clearly at the maximum range of this so called \"long range transmitter\". At 30 feet my music sounded hollow and tinny (think old school AM transistor radio), and there were frequent annoying signal drops.

      "text": "I purchased the Oasis (BTTC-500) Bluetooth (BT) transmitter/receiver in order to create a wireless method of listening to my TV without disturbing the rest of the household. Due to TV output problems, I was unable to use the AUX connection; however, the customer support team at Avantree provided exceptional support and walked me through the setup process for the optical connection between my TV and the Oasis. The optical connectivity is outstanding. It provides crystal clear sound without hiss or background noise that might be found on other Bluetooth devices. I would highly recommend this product. Its clarity and transmission range are exceptional.",
