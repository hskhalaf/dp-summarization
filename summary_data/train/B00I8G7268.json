I bought this because the price was so much better than what you see in the grocery store, but it's not worth it if it's going to arrive damaged and Amazon provides no way of rectifying the situation.",

Although we use a lot of peanut butter in our house over time, the 40oz jar is massive and will last us a long time. Great consistency, flavor, and shelf life. Probably not very healthy with the added sugar, but a good substitute over other \"snacks\". If you found my review helpful, please vote below so I can improve my future reviews for people like you.
