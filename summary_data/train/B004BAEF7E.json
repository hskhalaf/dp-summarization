It washes well but doesn't dry well at all, it holds a lot of water so it needs to drip dry for a long time before being able to go in the dryer.",

We had recently purchased a $1200 mattress so discarding it was not practical. We chose to encase it and the box springs too. This along with all the other suggestions of pillow encasement, cleaning, decluttering, and regular vacuuming seems to have solved our problem.

Once you get used to installing as an entire mattress casement it gets easier the more you handle it and you find your own way to easily install it. I would highly recommend buying an entire casement over a partial encasement, especially for those living in more tropical climates where bed bugs can be an issue. Great way to protect your mattress and prolong the life of your mattress.",

The retail packaging was marked as 18\", not 15-18\" (see photo). So I'll return it - but not sure what size to order. If I order the 9-12\" option it will be too small. According to the retail packaging (and photo) the choices should be 9\", 12\", 15\" and 18\". I'll call Customer Service and then update my review",

You need 2 people to fit the encasement: first time, we positioned the mattress vertically; it worked but is quite tiring. Second time onwards one of us now lift each corner while the other slides the bottom of the encasement below the mattress. With some nasal hygiene and this allergy-proof sleeping environment my allergies stopped in one week.",

      "text": "mattress covers always come off on the corners and we have to pull the cover back under the mattress to keep it in place. The SafeRest Premium cover is an all around cover with a hidden zipper. Consequently, the mattress is indeed covered and protected against any water or liquids. It is a great buy and you will never have to deal with the corners coming off the mattress. Highly recommended !!",

I suffer from all kinds of allergys and have to always buy everything hypoallergenic if not I'll have itchy skin and these do the trick for me. I feel safe in my own bed now.",

The first thing I noticed is five sides of this item have a nice feel to it, made of cotton, as opposed to others that have a plasticky feel to them. the top is terry which is nice but personally I think it is unnecessary. I would appreciate the top to be like the other five sides just as much. the protector zipped up nicely and was covered up at the end by a Velcro top. It is very quiet, have no problems with this. it is worth spending a few dollars more for this.",
