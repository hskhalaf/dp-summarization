      "text": "I bought 400 ft of string lights for my daughters wedding & kinda disappointed that the bulbs are so thin! They need to put extras just incase they break as your putting the bulbs in their sockets or accidentally bump into each other or something. No they didn't come with extras and didn't even think about that until I opened up the box and worried that they might break easily SO I bought extras UPDate : All the lights worked & The wedding turned out beautiful!! Even tho they.bumped from setting them up, not one broke : ) Happy Mom",

Here's the fix that got all of them working. ***UNPLUG FIRST*** That's important. :) Use a pick to pry out the gold piece that runs along the inside - just a little bit. You can see in the picture; 1. How it arrived; 2. Prying the piece; 3. Fixed (notice how little it needed). I haven't hung these up yet, but so far I'm happy now that they are all working. It was a pretty quick fix that is acceptable considering the price. Will update after use. Thanks!",

      "text": "These bulbs work great, just a couple things to note for anyone looking to purchase- They do not come assembled, meaning you need to screw in every single light bulb into the string. Several bulbs did not screw in, so I had two empty spots. They do NOT have plugs on the ends, so you can not continue the strand to another strand (not that you would need to since the string is 100' long) One of the bulbs fell out after the lights were all hung. Kind of startled me. (Could have been that it wasn't screwed in properly). Overall, for the price, it's a good set for being so long.",

There is not way to connect a new strand to the first strand. That was a no go for me. I was trying to string them all the way around our pool. Second, and this was an aggravation until I realized that they wouldn't string together. The bulbs are not installed for you. You have to install them. I purchased 300 feet of lights with 100 lights per strand. That would have gotten old if I had to install them all. We returned them and purchased lights that string together.",

The socket is so narrow that it is impossible to reach anything in there to pull up on the tab. The lights will have to be taken down. Next time, I will purchase a quality commercial set of lights.",

Once we had hung arse trend of lights it really looks great over patio especially for a surprise party that we threw for her daughter really set the mood. Unfortunately something occurred to where the wiring snapped in half and a large portion of the strand of lights came crashing down. I don\u2019t know if this was due to the wind and hook, the wiring being too thin to withstand the wind or something else but due to this we were only able to enjoy the lights for about 2 1/2 weeks.",

We came across these from Brightown and my husband at first was skeptical that they may be too long but they were PERFECT! We ordered and paid extra for next day delivery and they arrived before 2 pm which gave us more than enough time to set up before the BBQ. We got A LOT of rave reviews from our guests who now want to purchase a box. Great value for your money and they are super bright since they come in a pack of 100 lights.",
