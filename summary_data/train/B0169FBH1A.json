      "text": "out of many we have tried this is THE only treatbag that won't spill the treats (even small kibbles) when you bend over or lie down. you can run, jump (and fall) without worrying about EVER spilling your treats. Dog will focus on you, instead of possible lost kibbles on the ground. It is also very EASY to put treats in the bag. grab a handful of treat in your hand, stick the hand in the bag, release and pull the hand out. Simple. no need to close the bag, as it self seals itself. bought more so we'd have them for the future in case the product disappears from market.",

Timing is everything when I'm clicker training with my pups...I can't click the trick and then not reward for 20 seconds while I'm fumbling around with a lesser treat bag. It's pretty easy to clean, but I recommend placing a baggie inside the pouch to help last longer between washes. Even with the wide opening, I don't have a problem with treats falling out. The strap is a snug fit on me, but it DOES fit and I'm a large lady.",

IMO this is the best treat bag on the market today. The company is very responsive as well, helped with a product issue ASAP. Cons- the interior treat space is pretty large. If your a professional trainer you may not need to refill it multiple times a day, but for the typical dog owner it's too large in there.",
