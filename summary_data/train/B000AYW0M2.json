Genuine leather is flexible and does get hot and sweaty like synthetics, hence by lining this band with plastic it negates the benefits of the leather--- just DUMB! I've had a miserable time over the past few months trying to get a decent watch and have ordered and returned several during this \"time of Covid\" so I'm keeping this one. But if, like me, you wanted that \"genuine leather band\" note that you won't get it with this watch.",

I couldn't fit it into any hole. The gold looks cheap as well. Overall, it kinda looked like some kid's watch you can pick up at the dollar store. I'm a fan of certain Timex styles but I don't care at all for their styles that look dirty cheap. Gotta return this one.",

Simply put, it looks nice. As for the leather band, it's a simple \"genuine leather\" band - note that \"genuine leather\" does not mean high quality. As a strap, it works. It's a little stiff, but still useable, and replacing a mediocre strap is easy. I'd recommend this watch even despite the leather band.",

Eventually after hundreds of showers (some swimming) condensation builds up under the crystal...still works but more difficult to read. But at $30 I can easily replace. All other parts of Timex watches (band, springs, clasp) are durable as well. I really depend on Timex.",

I have a 6 3/4\" wrist and the band is too large so the excess strap sticks out and catches on things. Since the watch was so cheap I will eventually buy a new band. 2) As others have noted, the date function is pretty impossible tor read unless, perhaps, one has perfect close-up vision. It's pretty useless so \"why bother?\". If I were the designer for Times, I'd ditch this function or move it from the #3 position and make it large enough to read and thus be usable.",

Water resistance stands up to frequent hand washing but I wouldn't wear it in the shower or pool. Once the battery is replaced then it decreases the water resistance and it increases the risk of water leakage and it gets steamy inside. Crystal face stands up to bumps/scrapes very well. Scratches show but it's never cracked. Love the indiglo feature to quickly check the time in the dark. I replace it about each 2-3 years when it's too scratched up or steamy inside.",

Although I don't use the light on the often, I really like it ! All in all this is a great watch ~ after all it is a Timex!!!\ud83d\ude0a",

Haven't had this problem with any other Timex I've owned. Maybe just a bad band on this one?",

Mine is 5\" and there are 3 holes left, so this watch will fit. Very attractive looking with the right size dial. The indiglo light comes in handy in bed in the dark to read the time.

The date function is difficult to read, but I think that's my old eyes and not the watch. You have to get operating instructions at Timex.com. I'll check back if I have problems, but right now I'd definitely recommend this Timex, good value.",

      "text": "Nice watch, easy to read. Band is too short by at least 1/2 inch. I can buckle it, but it is way too tight. I really can't use the watch until I replace the band with a longer one. The band that comes with it is beautiful but it is 6 3/4 inches, not including the watch face itself which is 7/8 inch. I need at least another 1/2 inch, 3/4 would be better. I am average size, but find that women's jewelry (bracelets, watch bands, etc.) are too small for me. I wish the option of a longer band was given at the time of ordering the watch, as few aftermarket bands are offered, and most are men's styles.",

I have very small wrists (I can put my thumb and forefinger around my wrist and have them touch with no effort) and my previous watch got very loose when the leather relaxed over time. With this watch I'm on the second smallest hole instead of the first, so when the leather wears out I can make the watch even tighter. Definitely worth the money- this one was even cheaper than my broken one!",

I am in my sixties and the main reason I love this watch is that the white face and the black hands are very sharply contrasting so it is easy to tell the time, even at arms length.
