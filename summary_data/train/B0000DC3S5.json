(ie. wet hands, splattering milkshakes, dropping, etc.) I have had this phone over a year and it still does the job. The range is not really an issue with me, but there is static if I take it to my office in the rear of the building. However, this is not much different than others I have owned. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that I wish it had an earpiece volumn and the words on some of the keys are wearing off from constant use.",

It's a great concept if they could just make them work well. Sure wish we could find a good waterproof phone!!!",
