For size reference for others - 36 C/D chest, size 6 jeans from Gap. Across the chest and at the bottom at my hips is where it was too tight and if I had any type of sweater or thicker top on under it, it would be too tight. When I stretched my arms out front all the way I could feel it pulling across my back too much, so decided to upsize to a M instead, so that should fit just right now.",

Lots of pockets, and they are roomy and zippered. I love the fur lined collar. This jacket looks great with jeans and tennies, or with dressier clothes.

Definitely a winter coat! The white isnt solid - the cuts in the design give it the appearance that it is sheer ( but it isnt) in areas. I like the colors better- pink , purple and teal green.

Its a great coat! I find it runs a bit small, so you may want to order the next size up, especially if you put a bulkier sweater under it. It washes in the washer just fine too. I wear it for everyday, and found out exactly how well it retains your body heat when out shoveling. I love how lightweight it is. I'll be keeping this coat for a long time. I",

I wear a 12-14 and ordered a XL, I could have gone with the large but the extra room will be great for a sweater under it, although I doubt I will need it. It was very warm and comfortable.
