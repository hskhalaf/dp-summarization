This seems to be a design flaw. Also, the locking bolt is plastic and the nut is plastic, so at best this is a temporary product. The handles are aluminum and appear to be comfortable. If the person using it pushes down evenly with the handles, then the seat will work fine for them. Any uneven pressure will cause the seat to flip and your elderly person is on the ground. I wouldn't order it again or recommend it to a friend.",

      "text": "I actually ordered this for my daughter-law's mother who is almost completely handicapped from a muscular disease. This seat arrived on July 2nd as promised, installed right away and her trips to the bathroom are so much easier for her. Because she is rapidly losing strength in her legs, she now can comfortably lower herself onto the seat instead of crashing down and hurting her spine. Her husband who is her care giver stated that his job is now so much easier with this seat. It has added comfort and ease to their devastating situation. It is well made and very sturdy after attaching to the toilet bowl. A five star rating for sure!!",
