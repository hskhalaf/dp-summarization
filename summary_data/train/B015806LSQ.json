The track pad clicking action also produced a very loud sound in the bottom left of the trackpad, but did not produce that sound anywhere else. Everything else about the chromebook met expectations, and it feels/looks like a nice machine. I have requested an exchange and will update this based on the second machine I receive. EDIT (updated to 5 stars): I received a replacement chromebook. The screen is much better now. I tend to have 5-10 tabs open at a time and I have noticed no stuttering or lag whatsoever. I would recommend one (and have) to people.",

Sadly, ChromeOS still doesn't seem to handle alternative resolutions gracefully; when I selected the resolution I needed (1366 x 768), the text was very fuzzy. (I had hoped this problem had been resolved by now, which is why I bought this CB.) I also found the fan whirring irritating. I've reverted to my older Toshiba A3120, which also has a lovely screen. Faster would be nice, but not with the fan noise and the eyestrain. Hoping for better with the next iteration.",

I bought the same model without the illuminated keyboard as a gift for my daughter, and they when I saw the backlit model, I bought one for myself. It's a joy to work with, with the enhanced browsing performance thanks to the 4GB RAM, and the convenience of the backlit keyboard for hunt-and-peck typists like myself! Why didn't they do this before?",

You can lift it with one hand and carry it around easily. Not only is it portable but its not slippery and you can easily grip it. Another quality it has is how fast it updates. You turn off and turn on your Chromebook and BOOM! there is your update. Unless you want to download softwares, this laptop is great for anything else. I also really like its Sound on and off and screen brightness buttons up top. They are just the little things that make your experience great. I love it.",

      "text": "2017 Update: After ~16 months, the battery has malfunctioned. The Chromebook will only work if it's being charged. Once I unplug the charger, it turns off. RIP. The size, battery power, display, performance, are all in line with my expectations. I wanted to give it 4/5, but I can't do 4/5 based on my personal demands. By demands, Chrome OS doesn't support a load of file formats I would like for it to run. Maybe in another 1-2 years the OS will support what I use on Windows.",

Surprising that this happens, as I expected the system had enough processing power and memory to handle these tasks simultaneously. Overall it is a great system, and I use it in place of iPads because it is compatible with almost any website, and it websites load their main pages instead of mobile ones that the iPad often defaults to.",

It looks like it is \"not in place\" correctly. I really hope I will just get used to it. On the other hand the device is nice, fast, with an extremely nice screen and keyboard. The sound is mediocre. Also, the upcoming possibilty to install Google play apps is much expected! For the price i bought (299$) - much recommended!",
