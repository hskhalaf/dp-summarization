      "text": "This is one of the best products that I have ever owned. I have taken it on a couple of international trips, and it will keep your phone and tablet charged for days without having to mess around with the plug converters, etc. It also acts as a backup battery for my MacBook Pro, and the power brick will work directly to charge the MacBook Pro, so when you travel, you only need to bring with one power brick and USB-C cord. The unit is elegant, durable, and fits nicely in any carryon luggage. It's a bit heavy, but given the massive power storage, that is expected.",
