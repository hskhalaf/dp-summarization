It is well designed, feature rich, and seems very durable. Plus, it's fun. And for any kid--like my nearly 4-year-old grandson--who's obsessed with all manner of trucks, this is pretty exciting. Now he'll have a platform to load and carry his prized excavator. I've attached a rather imperfect video that shows some of the main functions.",

It may not be an expensive piece but for the cost it performs well and it has a trailer that automatically lowers a ramp, disconnects, and stands on jacks! The steering is a little flaky due to the all or nothing way the wheels turn, but you'll get used to it. It used 2 battery packs and personally would not give this to a kid under 10 years old. Looks good enough to be on display with other RC models.",

Includes wheel chocks that lock into various spots on the flat bed to help secure cargo. Comes with 2x batteries, one for the cab and one for the trailer (AA required for the remote). They are the same battery though so you could drive the cab twice as long with no trailer functions if you choose. I would say with younger children it may be slightly difficult to drive given the gooseneck connection between truck and trailer but the fast and slow speed options on the remote should help Overall it is a good truck.",

I have three issues with this, though... which also apply to the other toys from this company: 1. There is a noticeable delay in radio transmissions, so the truck doesn't respond right away to commands. 2. There are no limit switches, so you end up grinding gears on servos A LOT. I figured those will wear out very soon, at which point I'll just place some limit switches and replace gears with metal ones. 3. Battery dies incredibly quickly. I'll probably be replacing this in the near-future.",
