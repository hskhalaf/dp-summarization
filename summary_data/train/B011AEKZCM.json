The system comes assembled with exception to the pre/post carbon and sediment filters so it's super easy to install. I had added a de-ionization cartridge before the remineralization cartridge and man it's some of the best water I have ever had. Does a great job. I would recommend this to any one looking for clean pure water. Our parts per million count prior to the filter is over 650. Coming out of the de-ionizer it's 0! I'd say that's pure. After the remineralization cartridge our ph is in the 8-8.5 range. So it's clean and healthy for my family.",

It took me about 3-4 hours to install but only took that long because I am a super cautious person and wanted to make sure I got it right the first time since you need to cut hoses and drill into things. I also had to end up drilling a hole in my sink for the faucet which took me some time. The video they made truly makes this install super easy to follow and complete A++ on their instructions. If you are drinking bottled water, save your time and money dealing with that and install this GREAT product. I have had for 3 months now with no issues.",

This system has twice the capacity and was easy to install. I'm very handy in plumbing though and used the existing drain connections and water supply lines to speed up the install. My install was under 30 minutes. I had a little problem with one of the hose adapters, which are loaded with Teflon, not wanting to seat straight but after a little work it went in correctly. Highly recommend that you watch the install video on the Express Water website. Water tastes excellent. So far so good.",

Drilling out a granite counter is \"easy\" but also mistakes are forever so I would hire a pro. Fast water flow, seems to meet all specs.

As for the taste, I would let the system fill up overnight and then run the water dispenser for 10- 20 minutes to flush out the initial sediments and then use the water. Now that it's in, everyone in the family is drinking more water and it tastes as good as the bottled Alkaline waters.",

I recommend spending a little extra on the 100 gallon per day model as it will produce water at a respectable rate even if you run the accumulator tank empty.
