Instead you have to disassemble, put back in the box, and return to Amazon and wait for another bike. And hopefully the derrailure on that one isn't defective. Rather than deal with hassle, had to buy another derrailure for $30 which tech was kind enough to install. This is an inherent product fail. Class action anyone?",

It road a little off so I took it to a local bike shop to find out I did okay putting it together but I had a defective derailer. It cost me 75 mor dollars to do a fix that will allow for riding but eliminates one of my gears. I had called about a return but that was so complicated it was more convenient to do this fix. After working with the bike shop I realize why you should not buy a bike unsean and tested online just to save a few bucks.",
