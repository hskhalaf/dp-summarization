They could have easily overcome this by creating gear grooves on the rotor and the bowl. Anyway, hope they'll add this in the future.

One thing I am worried about - There is a quite loud 'popping' noise coming from the gears inside base. It does this even with no canister in place. Still turns OK but wondering about longevity.
