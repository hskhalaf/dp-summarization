    "description": "Style:32GB\n\nLive the moment - Don\u2019t let running out of storage keep you from capturing that perfect moment. The Kingston Bolt features a Lightning connector on one end and a Type A USB on the other end. This allows for the easy transfer or photos and videos from your Apple device.\niPhone and iPad Compatible - The Bolt is an easy way to extend storage space to your iPhone or iPad. Some think of it as an iPhone Flash Drive, iPhone Storage, or iPhone Memory expansion.\nApple MFi Certified - Guaranteed to work with all Apple devices with iOS 9.0+ and Lightning Connector including iPhone X / 8 / 8 Plus / 7 / 7 Plus / 6s / 6s Plus / 6 / 6 Plus / 5s / 5c / 5 / iPad Pro / iPad Air / iPad mini / iPod touch\nEasy to use - Simply plug it in, and download the Bolt app from the App Store**, and then back up your camera roll. The Bolt will make storing your iPhone or iPad photos and videos stress-free. With the Bolt you can take photos and videos directly to the device instead of using your iPhone or iPad storage. The camera feature can record video in 720p, 1080p, or 4K. Pictures are saved directly to the device when plugged in and the app is used. The camera feature of the Bolt app is so similar to the existing iPhone and iPad you won\u2019t feel the need to learn how to use a whole new feature.\nSecure \u2013 The Kingston Bolt also features an app security feature. This allows a user to set a password or touch ID in order to access the app with their Bolt, protecting against unauthorized use on their iPhone or iPad.\nPortable \u2013 The Bolt makes extra storage for iPhone or iPad accessible at any time with the included key ring accessory.

The Bolt comes in 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB capacity. With the Kingston Bolt you are instantly upgrading your iPhone or iPad Storage capacity and giving you extra room to take more photos and videos with your Apple device. \nWarranty and Support \u2013 The Bolt comes with a 2 year warranty and backed by Kingston\u2019s renowned technical support.
