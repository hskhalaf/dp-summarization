My old fans had sticker: 120Volts 0.6Amps. So they cut cost on the new fans put a motor in that is less than half as powerful! I purchased the next model up, Honeywell HT908, which gets me much better airflow(its sticker read 120Volts 0.5Amps). The only other fan to compete with the HT908 is the AmazonBasics fan which lists a power consumption of 55Watts. Since the HT908 uses 60Watts(120 * 0.5) you should expect it to be pushing more air. In general more Amps(and consequently Watts) means more airflow.",

I had to move it to the carpeted floor to reduce the effect of this noise, which in turn reduces the effectiveness of the fan. Inexpensive fans like this will always do this, I think.

The plastic material of construction does not feels sturdy at all. It's like Honeywell contracted Wish to manufacture their new model. I'm surprised about how bad the performance is in this model.

What I don't like about it is the SPEED SELECTOR knob. You always have to go through level III, then Level II and finally to Level I, to get to the lowest speed. I would have preferred that it goes in the opposite sequence, i.e starting at the lowest speed and then going higher [see photograph]",

Well, I also have the same problem. I contacted Honeywell and they advised me to contact Kaz. We will see what happens. Lesson: just spend a little more and get a better quality fan.",

It does get a little bit loud when at max, but as I said, I usually use it at level 1 because it is sufficient. It does take about a minute to ramp up and get to full speed, but other than that, it is perfect!",

An adjustable fan head is fully capable of pivoting and reaching a 90\u00b0 angle that can be used for direct cooling or circulating the air. Maximum air distribution is achieved via the inclusion of an Aerodynamic Turbo Design. This fan's small size and efficient output opens a wealth of installation options in the home, office or dorm setting.
