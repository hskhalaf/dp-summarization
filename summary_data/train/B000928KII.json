I thought I'd want the bigger one when using the f/2.8 glass: Nope. Don't need it. This \"little\" strap does great even with some real weight on it. I think I'll only break out that big one if I'm shooting the 70-200 f/2.8 on a body with a grip. But, if I did that, I'd be on a monopod. Hmm... I'm not sure there's a reason for me to ever use the bigger strap!",

(Compared to 51in on a standard Nikon strap) After you fasten it properly to your camera, it leaves you with maybe 25in. Which is barely enough to put your head through. If you are wearing a jacket, you can forget about wearing it over your shoulder, unless you want it to rub on your underarms. That sucks, because I like that pad a lot.I just stopped using that strap and went to a different brand until I can come up with some way to extend it.",

I cut off the ends and sewed on a strap with op tech quick release \"snaps\" which I also have attached to the camera. Thus, I can place camera on tripod and release from it. It works well for me and the strap doesn't yell \"expensive camera\". Delivery was quick with no problems.",
