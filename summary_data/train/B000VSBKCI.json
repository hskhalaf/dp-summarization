      "text": "First I want to rate it 10 out of 10, it took 2 weeks less than expected to arrive and it was very priceworthy. However, the controller is a darker blue than in the preview, and the start/select, joysticks, d-pad, bumpers & triggers are all black, it's nicer than in the picture and it has a nice feel to the each button and works well and seems more sensitive which is a plus for me. I recommend picking up this controller as soon as possible. -Kyle (OO)",
