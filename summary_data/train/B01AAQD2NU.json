I do have a few stubborn cracks that were very deep and to a point of bleeding, so I'm not surprised they are taking a little extra time to go away. I give it another week with the Pedi and believe my feet will be crack free. I very happy that I took a chance on this product.",

It has an automatic safety shutoff that stops the rotation of the buffing stone whenever it encounters any kind of pressure. So you can't press it into your foot and really buff. You can only hold it very gently against your skin with NO pressure. With no pressure, the buffing is significantly less effective than if you just rubbed a regular foot file back and forth on your heel. This thing is completely useless and I threw it in the trash after one use. You'll get 100x better results from any $2 foot file. Save your money.",

I just ordered a couple of roller refills, but I don't even need them yet. The one that came with it is working fine and we've been using it several times a week for a couple of months.",

So you never know when you go to use it whether the battery was charged..... or not. More times than not it seems like it was not charged. And now it will not charge at all and I have two unopened packs of rollers. So it lasted through 5 rollers and now it is dead. DO NOT BUY!!!! Substandard product!",

Since the rechargeable battery is not replaceable, this item is now ready for the garbage heap. For $40.00, I think you should be able to get more than 16 months out of a product, so I will definitely not buy this again.",
