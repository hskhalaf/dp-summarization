First game; filled it up and rolled it to the car. It leaked from the top lid as soon as it's tilted in any direction. And not just a few drops - epic leaking. Brought it to the game; left puddles of water in care even tho strapped in. Left a trail of water from car to sideline. It only won't leak if its filled up halfway, which is like a 2.5 Gal water cooler! Returned immediately.",

It keeps food and drinks colder than any cooler we have had. In the heat of this summer, with temperatures in the 95-99 range, it keep our drinks cold for 48 hours. Amazingly, the ice keeps thing freezing cold. It is so easy to roll around. When empty it can be picked up with one hand. I have encouraged my children and grand-children to buy one for the beach and camping. Well worth having. PEACE and enjoy the day. Margaret Bell-Berman",
