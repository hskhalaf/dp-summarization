I've never been able to print a descent quality print from this printer, the prints are blurry, color is all wrong and there are horizontal lines on the images.

The software included with the new drivers for Vista is just horrible, and offers no control over the printer. My problems, like those of some other reviewers, include: paper jams, bad print quality, inability to match printer to monitor. None of this happened before with XP. I could solve this, I guess, by creating a dual boot-- but that's just more trouble, and I have no guarantee that it would work. I guess I'll start shopping again, but now for an HP.

The HP Photosmart 8750 produces 9-ink color prints and provides color management controls and remarkable printer flexibility to produce realistic color and true black-and-white photos that are true to your vision.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer The ultimate HP 9-ink photo printer designed for the professional, fine art, portrait andserious amateur photographer who wants finished, professional-quality photos up to 13 by 19 inches to sell, exhibit, or admire for generations.1 Photos can last up to 100 years when displayed under glass2 or over 200 years in a photo album.3 The HP Photosmart 8750 produces 9-ink color prints and provides color management controls and remarkable printer flexibility to produce realistic color and true black-and-white photos that are true to your vision.\n\n Features: \n\n * Print photos with rich color, fine detail, and accurate skin tones in 9-ink color with HP Vivera Inks. \n * Get black-and-white photos with pure grays, true neutral grays, deep blacks, high contrast, and smooth transitions. \n * The extended color palette includes enhanced blue hues for more realistic skies and landscapes. \n * HP's 9-ink extended color palette reproduces the rich, realistic colors you envision. \n * Quickly print accurate on-the-spot proofs for your own reference or to share with clients. \n * Printer controls easily let you apply Photoshop color management tools for true customized prints. \n * Expand your options\u2014HP color management tools produce rich colors compatible with Adobe RGB and sRGB. \n * Print matte or glossy borderless photos up to 13 by 19 inches using multi-size trays. \n * No more waiting to get the photos from the lab! Print professional photos right in your own studio. \n * Take advantage of all standard media sizes\u2014from passport, frames, and panorama to gallery-size up to 13 by 19 inches\u2014with or without borders. \n * Customized orders\u2014print on different paper types and sizes using multi- size tray and media sensor. \n * Print black documents at up to 19 ppm.

The Blue Photo cartridge contains specially formulated HP Vivera Inks in light cyan, blue, and light magenta. The new blue ink is designed to peak in chroma (colorfulness) at a lightness higher than the lightness of the blue produced in printers that combine cyan and magenta inks. \n\n The true blue ink used by the HP Photosmart 8750 allows the printer gamut to more closely match the sRGB color space. The blue ink is also brighter than the blue created from blending cyan and magenta inks. Outdoor photography enthusiasts will be especially impressed with the vivid blues in their landscapes, seascapes, and sports photos. While the new blue ink enhances blue tones on any paper, the best results are obtained on HP Premium and Premium Plus photo papers. \n\n \n\n 8-ink versus 9-ink. Coordinates represent sRGB values of yellow (255,255,0), red (255,0,0), magenta (255,0,255), blue (0,0,255), cyan (0,255,255), and green (0,255,0) printed on HP Premium Plus Photo Paper using default driver settings. \n\n Black and White Prints: True to Your Vision\nIn the spirit of Ansel Adams' renowned Zone System for optimizing exposure, HP has defined a \"Digital Zone\" for demonstrating print values (from black to white) for inkjet prints. The Digital Zone divides the dynamic range (DR) of an imaging system into 11 evenly spaced grayscale blocks or zones. The zones represent specific densities, from maximum density (D- max)-the blackest black that an imaging system can produce-to minimum density (D-min)-the whitest white (the paper base). The middle of the scale, Zone V, represents the middle gray tones of the inkjet print. \n\n \n\n \n\nProfessional, Long Lasting Color and Black-and-White Photos\nWith rich color, fine detail, and accurate skin tones, this versatile printer is ideal for producing portraits, landscapes and other photo assignments. Professional printer controls, an extended color palette, and tools that work seamlessly with Adobe Photoshop make it easy to produce consistent results that are true to your vision. Built-in Ethernet allows printer sharing for small networks, including mixed environments of Macintosh and PCs, plus wireless printing via a wireless router.
