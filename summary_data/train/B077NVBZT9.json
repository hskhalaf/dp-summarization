They\u2019re deeply pigmented and easy to apply. A little goes a long way. I do hate the scent, though, as it\u2019s very saccharine and a little nauseating. I also keep dropping this palette for some reason, like I can\u2019t get a good grip on it, and the shadows are very fragile so you can lose half of the palette in one good fall. But it\u2019s such a useful palette that I couldn\u2019t stand to be without it, so I purchased another.",
