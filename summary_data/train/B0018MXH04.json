The thing I don't like is the 3/8\" line, which really restricts the water flow compared to my old 1/4\" line, but most of the ones I looked at on Amazon seem to now have the 3/8\" lines.",

You'll also need to replace the really cheapo valve on the thing with a \"Supply Stop Extender Tee\" that's 3/8\" x 3/8\" x 1/4\". Yeah it costs a few more bucks, but it may save you a flood later. The inlet on the water tap is a nice narrow threaded metal tube. It saves having to use a hole punch should you be missing that extra hole. A drill bit should work just fine.

My long-time plumber installed the filers, checked that the water flow direction was correct and the filters were installed correctly. He finally said that that's the way it is. It's only for drinking water so it's not critical, but why design something that cannot even match a much less expensive approach?",

In addition to reducing chlorine taste and odor, the WP-2's specially formulated filter also removes lead, parasitic cysts, and VOCs (volatile organic chemicals) and other contaminants from your water. Perfect for houses and apartments, the WP-2 can be installed in a matter of minutes.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Watts Premier WP-2 LCV Water Filtration Device features two-stage filtration to ensure you'll get cleaner, healthier drinking water straight from the tap. In addition to reducing chlorine taste and odor, the WP-2's specially formulated filter also removes lead, parasitic cysts, and VOCs (volatile organic chemicals) and other contaminants from your water. Perfect for houses and apartments, the WP-2 can be installed in a matter of minutes.\n\n\n\nOther Products\nYou May Want to Consider:All-in-One Water Test Kit\n\nStandard Faucet with Air Gap, Brushed Stainless SteelWater Filtration Booster Pump Kit\n\nTwo-stage filtration removes VOCs to give you cleaner water straight from the tap.\n\nDuring the lifecycle of a single filter, you can save up to 16,000 plastic bottles from being deposited in landfills. Two-Stage Filtration Removes Contaminants\nThe Watts WP-2 filters drinking water in two stages. Once the system is connected, water from the tap passes through a five-micron sediment filter, followed by a heavy-duty one-micron carbon block filter that reduces lead, parasytic cysts, and chemicals. This specially formulated filtration process is capable of reducing cryptosporidia, giardia, entamoeba, and toxoplasma, as well as a long list of chemicals--from herbicides and pesticides to disinfection byproducts and gas additives.Cleaner Water Straight from the Tap\nIt is estimated that VOCs (volatile organic chemicals) are present in one-fifth of the nation's water supplies. These contaminants can enter ground water from a variety of sources, including herbicide and pesticide runoff, gasoline or oil spills, leaking underground fuel tanks, disinfection byproducts, septic system cleaners, and chemicals used in the dry cleaning industry.\n\nThe WP-2 keeps you safe from these and other chemicals with its two-stage filtration, so you can turn on the tap with the assurance that you're getting cleaner, healthier drinking water.\n\nThe Importance of Drinking Clean Water\nWater is critical to proper food digestion, kidney health, brain function, blood health, joint functionality, and more. It's important to make sure that the water you drink is devoid of contaminants. Thankfully, using a Watts water filtration device will ensure consistent quality for all of your drinking and cooking needs. In fact, when you use Watts' high-quality certified water treatment devices and filters, your water will be free of chlorine taste and odors, particles, and many other contaminants that can be detrimental to your health.\n\n*Please refer to the Performance Data Sheet for the complete list of claims for which this system is certified.\n\n\nNot only is the WP-2 filter a healthy choice for you, but it's also a healthy choice for the environment. This filter helps you minimize the harmful environmental consequences of buying bottled water. Incredibly, if a mere ten percent of North America's bottled water intake were reduced by switching to home-filtered water in reusable containers, we could eliminate:\n\n\n\n * 133,000 trucks driving an average of 500 miles--saving nearly 12 million gallons of diesel fuel\n * Over 100 million pounds of greenhouse gasses--equal to taking 1,100 cars off the road annually\n * 213 million pounds of PET--equal to 1.5 million barrels of crude oil or improving the PET recycling rate by 10%\n\n\n\nDepending upon which Watts water-filtration product you use, you can prevent up to 16,000 half-liter bottles from being deposited in landfills--all in the time it takes to use and replace a single filter.The Watts Premier WP-2 LCV Water Filtration Device is backed by a three-year limited warranty. \n\nWhat's in the Box\nWP-2 LVC unit with mounting bracket (complete with filters), standard faucet assembly, parts bag, and manual.\n\n\n\n\nCompare Water Filtration DevicesCT-1WP-2 BVCWP-2 LCVUF-3UV-RRONum. of Filtration Stages122335ReducesSedimentChlorineBacteriaVirusesCystsLeadChemicalsArsenic, Nitrates,\nChrome, TDS,\nPerchlorate, TurbidityDimensions (L x W x H)6 x 6 x 1414 x 6 x 1614 x 6 x 169 x 3.5 x 146 x 4 x 1617 x 17 x 6Replacement Filters5-Mic Carbon BlockPurifier Filter Pack560088560039560017Annual Filter Pack\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Watts 500313 2-Stage Undercounter Lead, Cyst & VOC Reducing Drinking Water System is a two stage filtration system that is NSF Certified for the reduction of lead, parasitic cysts as well as a long list of VOCs including herbicides, pesticides, insecticides and more.\n\nSee more",
