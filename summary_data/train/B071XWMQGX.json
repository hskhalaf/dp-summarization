      "text": "Great sound but the design leaves a little to be desired. The battery is a big lump. It's not heavy but it feels off center just a little so it feels weird. Lastly, the directions are just bad. Typically you don't need instructiins for earbuds but these use a series of beeps to communicate and I still haven't figured them out yet. I contacted the company but haven't heard back. But if you keep it simple you will figure it out. Most importantly the sound is awesome so I use them alot.",

The audio quality is excellent for bluetooth, and it is absolutely phenomenal for the price-point. There are some occasional hiccups in the bluetooth signal, but I have experienced that in any pair of bluetooth headphones with audio interference from other sources. The sound, however, is great, and that is why I bought them. I also must mention that the seller was great and seemed genuinely interested that I have a good customer experience. I highly recommend these headphones.",

Focal has an honest uncolored natural sound. As far as the Spark wireless go, the truth is I wasn\u2019t expecting much at this price point and the fact that these are Bluetooth wireless......These exceeded my expectations, for on the go, the sound is very good. I wanted something for vacation, without getting tangled up in wires. Sound, comfort, and convenience. The Focal Spark wireless is a winner!",

Connection issues only when my phone is in my pocket and I move too much. Feels sturdy enough for a daily use. Battery life is also good, the only problem being that it gives you a half battery reading when in reality you could have 20% left. I wanted to use these for running but the cable is too uncomfortable for it, even if you use the shirt clip included.",
