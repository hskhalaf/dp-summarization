It seriously smells like oranges and it's such a refreshing smell that was not overpowering and was actually enjoyable to put on! It left my skin feeling smooth, but not greasy! I have given a container to a friend as well when she was pregnant and she loved it! An entire container lasted me almost my entire pregnancy using it daily.",

I would definitely recommend this belly butter. The texture is like butter. It is a bit on the oily side but that is exactly what you want from belly butter. It doesn't stain clothes and smells amazing!. I will be ordering this for all of my pregnancies and maybe just to have around for an intense moisturizer.",
