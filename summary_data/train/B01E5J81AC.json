I bake eggs in it every week and even with olive oil or ghee brushed into the cups, trying to get the eggs out is a disaster now. And unfortunately the pretty teal finish is now coming off in some of the cups and I can see a bronze color underneath. Hopefully that finish isn't ending up in my eggs. That's the opposite of what I was looking for when I chose this item.",
