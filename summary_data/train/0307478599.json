A little tricky to follow, but I was very happy going through the beginning CDs, though it felt like CD 2 (beginning) just cut off randomly. Now when I got to the intermediate and Advanced, they just stopped teaching. They merely repeated words and phrases for 6 CDs straight. Its like they were making a product and gave up 1/3 of the way through it.",

But the problem for me was they could have a done a better job explaining things and I know it's common sense but if they were more clearer on things it would have made it better.",

I\u2019m pleased with this program and I\u2019m only on Disc no. 2. I would recommend to anyone who is just starting out or looking to brush up and get back to where you were w/Spanish.",

I would recommend this to anyone learning or wanting to brush up on their Spanish. There are other programs out there but this one it amazing.",

The price is a great investment! I would definitely recommend this product!",
