She has found that use a push broom like these helps to keep her secure feeling and upright. When her broom broke a while back, I was happy that I had an extra one that I could share with her and she is very happy with it.

The broom handles are metal and can screw into both sides of the brush to adjust for wear and the brush backs are made of basically recycled milk jugs, the same stuff as the artifical deck wood you can pick up at Lowes or Home Depot. The Cons: You will need to buy metal braces to support the handle and brush to avoid the brush cracking and breaking from serious/heavy duty use. But over all a great deal for six sturdy brooms.",
