This is a heavier bag as well but that's no downside for me as it's all about the comfort with this sleeper.",

Fine print: you also have to love extreme sports, couples therapy, teamwork puzzles, and the mission impossible movies because this giant cream puff was not made to be contained once released from its bag. We have tried rolling it, folding it, cramming it, and praying to get it back in its bag. A large black trash bag can hardly contain this comfortable beast. We've managed to get it done but after blood, sweat, tears, and a few swear words have escaped. Both the best and worst sleeping bag we have ever owned.",

Two people get in, and you could probably sleep on an ice cube. Colors are great. and construction is solid.",
