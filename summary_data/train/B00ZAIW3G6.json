The mat has plenty of give for both my knees and the alpaca\u2019s comfort. The hinged panels all are holding up well, the vinyl covering is durable enough to withstand the alpaca toenails digging in while we are putting them down or when the alpaca goes to get its footing and stand back up. We have hosed the mat off a few times - seems to be pretty well resistant to water absorption (along with resistant to alpaca pee, squirts and spit/drool). I highly recommend these mats!",

I was using old gymnastics mats before that were sort of sticky to prevent slipping during tumbling. These mats do not have that issue, I feel that I can move around easily. They are firm, and provide a good amount of cushion. They are pricey but I feel they are worth it! They fold up nicely and fit together great. Only \"bad\" thing is they attract ALL the hair. I have to clean them right before and after I use them, but it isn't too big of a deal :)",
