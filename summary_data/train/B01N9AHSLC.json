We expect to need this a lot as Rexes are accident prone. Balance is not their strong suit but more adventurous than any breed I've ever owned. A bad combination so I'm thrilled this works so well. It's stylish too although my Rex \"Nigel\" didn't think so. He wasn't mad- that's how he looks when he's talking to you. Lol",

Even though I got the right size (I know because I bought a second one because the first one I bought was too small) it came right off with my cats struggle. I mean its obvious that the cat is going to try to take it off, and it should have crossed the mind of the person making it. We put it on my cat after getting her spayed and without much struggle, she took it right off.",
