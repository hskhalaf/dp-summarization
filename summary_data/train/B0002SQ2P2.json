After so many PC builds, these speakers remain and continue to impress. For a 2.1 setup, the sound is amazing. The bass is loud. A controller knob allows you to power on the system, adjust the volume, as well as adjusting the bass. A headphone jack is conveniently located there as well. Logitech makes high quality product and this is one of them! If you find this review helpful, please click 'helpful' button at the end of this product review. Thanks!",

I used it for a television rather than a functionally limited speaker bar. The Z-2300 was far superior to the built-in television speakers and provided lower bass than my much more expensive (non-THX) stereo speakers. I have owned two THX-certified sound systems and they've both been exceptionally good.",

The bass is solid and does its job. Overall there is just nothing to complain about. Worth every penny, and I'll never feel like I have to shop for PC speakers again.",

The manual volume/control is a little on the \"big\" side (about palm size), which is what we wanted. FYI~ there is a newer model for these speakers: the Z623.

I really like the ability to power of the system form the control puck where as with the Kilpsch I had to either leave it on...which I did (for over 4 years) or use the switch on the back of the sub.

One suggestion though try to put the subwoofer far as possible from your pc especially if you are going to listen to loud music (that much vibrations can't be good for your hard drives). Two minor detail bothered me a little. First the headset plug on the remote disables the speakers when the headset is plugged in. This forces you to plug and unplug the headsets everytime you use them. Also the cables are a little short giving you less choices in where to put the subwoofer. But overall the power and quality of the sound makes this item an amazing buy.",

For those who don't like that particular sound, it's easy to adjust the bass down--there's a bass knob right on the desktop control, so it's easy to reach. I bought my first set of these speakers for the office and they were so great that I bought a second set for home. They are easy to install, they don't take up very much room, and the output is superb. After about two years, I haven't had a single problem with them, and I highly recommend them.",

I now feel there is no need to ever own a stereo. I'm hearing things in my music I never knew was there. The separation of instruments and the feel of the bass is incredible! I'm not a technical person as far as audio equipment goes, but these have to be the best deal around. I had a simple question about placement, because I expected it to be more complicated; they answered my e-mail on Sunday of July 4th weekend. 10/07: I just bought another one.",

My downstairs PC has somewhat better sound but it's connected to a full size stereo. I'm not sure how to rate this, for the price it would be five stars but compared to other packages available at higher price, we'll say 3+. More expensive systems have higher volume levels but most people will find the Z-2300 to be loud enough.",

You can seriously damage your hearing with these speakers but if you don't want to do that the mid level volume is excellent. you lose the 5.1 true but gain so much in performance you'll forget about 5.1.

Glorious, even when turned down with the headphones on still sounds good. I've had these for five years now and the only annoyance is that the headphone jack is a little twitchy and sound cuts in and out unless you position the plug just right, and don't move. But after five years thats not too bad.",

The sound is clear and crisp and the bass is unbelievable, whether you are listening to hard rock, jazz, or country. I love the volume and bass hand controls. Some people take the black speaker covers off, but I think it sounds great either way, so I left them on. I'm very happy...best purchase I've made all year!!! :)",

I've been practically using it as a foot rest; it's that big. The desktop speakers are small and the sound control is very convenient and easy-to-use. I'm pretty impressed!",

Also, the cord on the volume/bass control is not very long. Other than that, I could not be more pleased.",

They look great and I love the remote volume control with its balance knob. I've just finished downloading a couple of Christmas albums and they sound way better than expected. Yes, the subwoofer is pretty bulky, but it fits under my desk without any hassle or compromise in sound quality. Good buy for the money.",

From the fat bass thumps in your favorite rock anthem to the creepy hallway steps in your favorite horror film, you'll hear details you never knew were there. Add to that an impressive 200 watts of RMS power and you've got everything you need to rock your entertainment world.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nLogitech Z-2300 2.1 Speaker System \nHear your movies, music and games for the first time. \n\nGreat sound. It's all in the details. This powerful speaker system brings them out in high-clarity THX-certified sound. From the fat bass thumps in your favorite rock anthem to the creepy hallway steps in your favorite horror film, you'll hear details you never knew were there. Add to that an impressive 200 watts of RMS power and you've got everything you need to rock your entertainment world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n\n\n\nGenuine THX-certified audio quality\nOnce you hear these speakers, you'll know why they're among the few that have earned the THX seal of approval. THX certification is the ultimate mark of audio quality and your assurance of a studio-quality listening experience.\n\n\n\n\n200 watts of bold, powerful sound\nHear and feel the music with more than enough power to rock the room. Go ahead and turn it up. The speakers are built to deliver clear, detailed, distortion-free sound\u2014even at window-rattling volume. \n\n\n\nPhase-plug drivers for more accurate sound reproduction\nFrom the soaring high note in a guitar solo to the loud burst of jet engines in an action movie, Logitech Phase Plug drivers make sure you don't miss a sound. A cone-shaped aluminum Phase Plug at the center of the driver helps to accurately reproduce high- and mid-range frequencies with less coloration than standard drivers. And because the Phase Plug acts as a heat sink, the driver is better able to preserve dynamic range. So you hear the quiet of a whisper and the loud, full force of an explosion. The Phase Plug even acts as a reflector, creating a much wider sweet spot of mid to high frequencies compared to conventional speaker designs. The bottom line? The true sonic signature of your movies, music and games comes through loud and clear. \n\n\n\nLong-throw subwoofer for rich, room-filling bass\nIntensify your movie, music and gaming experience with distortion-free bass that goes extra deep. The powerful 8-inch, 120 watt driver reproduces the wide range of low frequencies that deliver room-shaking rumbles and rich, tight bass notes. And with Logitech's flared side port, the port noise that can occur with subwoofers is eliminated. \n\nIt's big, bold bass without the distractions. \n\n\n\n\nSoundTouch\u2122 remote for easy control\nYou have complete control over your listening experience with this sleek wired remote. Control master volume, subwoofer level and power. There's even a headphone jack for private listening.\n\n\nAudio adapter for quick device connections\nThe system comes complete with a handy adapter that lets you easily connect the speakers directly to your game console, DVD player or CD player.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBROWSE FOR MORE LOGITECH PRODUCTS \nEnhance your listening experience with great Logitech products.\n\nLogitech Speaker System Z523 \nSpeakers with 360-degree sound help project audio evenly in all directions, so you get a great listening experience throughout the room.\n\nUltimate Ears SuperFi 4 Noise-Isolating Earphones\nFeaturing the same speaker technology and sound signatures used in our higher-end products, these compact earphones deliver detailed bass with crisp and clean mids and highs.\n\nUltimate Ears SuperFi 5 Noise-Isolating Earphones \nHoused in a sleek, liquid silver body, the top-fire speaker produces a detailed and full soundstage\u2014ideal for listening to a broad range of music genres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nPackage Contents Speakers: 2 satellites, 1 subwoofer Cables included: Power cord, Color coded audio cables SoundTouch\u2122 wired remote control Video game console adapter User's manual 2 year limited warranty",
