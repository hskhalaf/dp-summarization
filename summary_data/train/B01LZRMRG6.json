My initial impression was great - the leash is very comfortable on the ankle, looks great, and feels secure when riding. However, after using for approximately 10 sessions, the leash snapped on a small wave (i.e. minimal force). The puzzling aspect is that it snapped in the middle of the leash which is presumably the strongest part of a leash. You definitely get what you pay for at this price point.",

This leash is a great replacement. Velcro sticks way better than the regular leash and I already ordered another one for back up. The real test will be after I\u2019ve used it for a while but as of now, I love it.",

With the south swells picking up in Hawaii this July, I managed to have two of these leashes snap, resulting in me going for a long swim.

The leash is long enough, the cuff stays attached securely, and the design of the cuff allows the leash to move around without impact the surfer too much. As long as you don't dry out the leash while it is wrapped tightly around the board, the leash does not tangle in the water. This has been a great and reasonably priced purchase for my surf repetorie.",
