I must say I am quite impressed with the quality and it is comfortable to sit on.

It stunk when I opened it from the plastic and even after 3.5 months, it still reeks. It smells sort of like mildew or a chemical odor. I've tried febreeze, lysol, room scents, spray scents- you name it! Nothing works for more than a few hours. Would I purchase again? Based on the smell (which could potentially be an environmental hazard, especially in a child room) NO. But if you have a constantly cold and can't smell anything? Then I probably would.",

I got it early than promised no problems with instructions for setting it up no smell. Just sitting on it I could feel the difference. Every one who remembers the old mattress has noticed a comfort increase of 100%. Very nice upgrade and if you want more cushion there is also an 8''. Good price great upgrade.",

It did \"off-gas\" for a few hours but it was not terrible at all. More than a good deal for us.",

It's assumed that factory new items smell like the place they were made. But if you're concerned, it goes away withing a couple days. I would definitely recommend this mattress.",

Also, instead tuffeting the mattress with buttons or thread they used these plastic things that are large versions of the plastic things used to attach tags to clothing. Those have caught on the cover and pricked it in several places and they keep sticking me. I will be buying a foam mattress pad to help with both of these issues.",
