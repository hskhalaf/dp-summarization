I have been using it for only two weeks and I can see my fine lines on my forehead melting away. They are barely noticeable now, so I cannot wait to see how my skin looks in another two weeks. I never expected such quick results. That makes me VERY happy. If anyone asks me, I will tell them just how good Olay Regenerist Regenerating Face Serum is. I am always happy when claims made by a product prove to be true.",
