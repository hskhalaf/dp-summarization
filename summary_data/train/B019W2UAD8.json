This cover not only provided zero dust protection but actually destroyed my car\u2019s paint job by essentially rubbing all the dust into the car\u2019s surface with each bit of movement from the wind. The car\u2019s originally-flawless paint job is now covered in tiny scratches that will need to be polished out professionally. NOT an extra expense that I was expecting with using this piece of trash cover. DO NOT BUY, especially if your car is brand new and black.",

Another user posted a picture of his car being soaked under this cover which is accurate. Water soaks right through the cover and with water comes the dust. When the weather dries out, you basically have a soaked car underneath and this cover promotes mold, algae, and dust on the paint. It fits my 1999 Miata pretty well and is very budget friendly compared to other covers, so I am giving it 2 stars instead of one. Basically, this cover is more cheap chinese junk. It is more trouble than it is worth to return it.",

One thing is that it appears the supplier/manufacturer vacuums the folded cover to shrink the bundle down for boxing. I guess that the material cannot be treated first with non-wrinkle chemicals as it has a billion of them when unfolded, just looks tacky. You can't wash it as it has a paper base I think.
