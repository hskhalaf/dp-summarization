Don't know what's so special about it. You have to use Toshiba's USB cable or a USB that says its compatible with the Encore WT8. 2. Don't let the battery die. Charging is ridiculous. It takes 3 to 4 days to get back up to 100%. Don't plan on buying another Toshiba tablet again. Had no such issues with my Asus tablet.",

Finally, you'll need a micro USB to USB adapter to really use Office (keyboard/mouse) and move that recovery partition.

I however, one complain about this.. every time it comes from sleep my Wi-Fi goes limited connection, it doesn't connect automatically. So I have to disconnect and reconnect to my Wi-Fi to gain internet access. I have updated to the latest driver updates but still the same problem. Other than that this tablet could have been perfect and could have given a 5 stars!",

OK these things happen, went to the amazon site went through the process of trying to return it & the adaptor I had bought with it, got to the stage of putting the details in & continuing, to get a message the quantities needed to be entered, the quantities of the items were included in the description, so went round the circle several time, ???? unable to email amazon, or chat to them. Several hours wasted, one very annoyed customer",
