I just put a women's light day mini pad in the bloomers and that works like a charm. I washed and dried them numerous times with very little shrinkage. These are superior other brands. I know because I purchased the other brands first. Very durable. Highly recommend. A++.",

I would recommend to the manufacturer to increase the size of the diaper overall, and to improve the waist fitting of the diaper so as to not require the unit to be so tight on the animal. I'm sure they would counter by saying it might leak as a result. In my case, since it's mission was not for urine, the tighter fit led to leakage around the tail hole.",

I got this to force him to hold it until he's let out. He's peed himself a time or two and this absorbed it. However, he is able to defecate through the tail opening, so, I actually had to narrow it somewhat. I think it's helping him learn where it's ok to go because even when he's out of the diaper we're having less problems.",

I even tried modifying regular baby diapers by cutting out a tail hole. That was cheaper, but they still fell off. This diaper wrap is fantastic. Don't bother getting the liners as they are simply inexpensive feminene pads which you can buy anywhere. I recommend the kind meant for nights because they are thicker. Overall, this diaper wrap stays on, looks nice and my dog doesn't mind wearing it. I think the denim color looks quite good with my dog's black hair (much better than a white disposable diaper!).",

      "text": "There is only a small piece of velcro on the straps. Our lab is fit and has a nice waist so when we secure the diaper, the straps connect a couple inches up on the body of the diaper leaving nothing to hold for first couple inches in place. Due to this condition, the bottom couple of inches on both sides slide back and you end up continually pulling them back up. I don't think they would fall off but an extra couple of inches on the straps would help a lot.",

I will have to keep looking for something that will stay up.",
