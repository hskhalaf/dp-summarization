Well, I went back and bought a WAY cheap one during summer so we do not suffocate in our slumber. I ordered this very very loud Duvet cover from amazon (I don\u2019t do patterns- hate floral etc. Less is more) Today I had the privilege of installing my marshmallow comforter that is like a cloud, and put the loud cover on it! And I love the duvet and want it in black too! Soft and perf. And now I\u2019m exhausted and going to sleep",

My comforter also slides inside so I secured it with safety pins at each button at the top (see pic) On the plus side, the color is vibrant and it adds charm to our bedroom. My hubby also noticed that this cover provides more warmth than our regular comforter alone. For the price, I got what I paid for and I'm a happy camper.",

However, this set and the bed sheet set were slightly different shades of gray--this one was slightly lighter than the sheet set. Not a deal-breaker by any means, but be forewarned that the two together will not be a perfectly matched set. It might be wiser to go with a plain sheet set instead to avoid the slightly clashing color difference.",

While we do like the material and pattern of this set, the dimensions of the duvet are wonky and there is a lot of excess material that ends up on one edge that makes it difficult to neatly make the bed. This aspect got progressively annoying as time went by. Probably would not purchase again in King, though I can't speak to other sizes. May 2016: This is a great set - I also bought the sheets that go with it. The colors are vibrant and the material soft. Wonderfully lightweight for the warmer months.

      "text": "SO SOFT!!! I washed it as soon as it came. The fold lines came out but it still has a little wrinkling. However, we LOVE it! The duvet fit perfectly with a little room so it wasn't super tight. We buttoned the buttons \"inside-out\" like it came to keep the duvet inside. The duvet itself does fall to the end if our kids are moving it and after we wake up, but my husband is going to insert grommets on each end of the duvet and the duvet cover and we'll tie ribbons on the ends to keep the two pieces together. I'm extremely pleased with the set and even ordered an extra set of sheets from this company.",

      "text": "So I\u2019m pleased I guess for what it\u2019s worth, I was initially disappointed but that was my fault as I didn\u2019t know what a duvet cover was, I just assumed it was a fancy name for a cover. So when I ordered 2 and it came in this small box I was like how the heck can 2 king size comforters fit in that box. I soon found out what a duvet was... a cover for a cover.. pretty stupid if you ask me, it\u2019s like a pillow case for your cover... I ended up putting my queen comforter in it... it keeps me pretty warm surprisingly, the color is vibrant and the material seems sturdy.",

The picture was taken right from the package! It\u2019s a nice navy blue navy not a black navy. :) I Will be ordering more. I filled it with our current summer comforter. This king seems big enough to accommodate a thicker \u201cwinter\u201d comforter. Using my thin comforter left plenty of room 4- to 6 inches on both sides. Hope this helps. Great find!",
