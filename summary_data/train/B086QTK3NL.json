No issue at all 2, the picture says 1080p, more like 720, and that's at a push. 3, colours are blown all over the place with a high tiny of red/pink and i can't find any way to control it. Now, please note, I have only received this item today and will endeavour to find a solution at which point I will update this review but offhand, these are the facts. With everybodwanting webcams due to the madness out there I think we need to cautious what we pay for.",

After researching more its only got a 2MP sensor, NO WONDER! for \u00a340 its ridiculous. Hard to find webcams at the moment, sure but id wait and save the money for ANYTHING else. Rather wait and get a C920 which has a 15MP sensor, twice the price yes but 7.5x better quality! Also, the 'attachment' for sitting above your screen is terrible and doesnt actually work..

However, the picture quality was very poor and laggy and in low light was even worse. I know the current times mean such devices now leave companies open to hike the prices up, but \u00a350 for this cheaply made, poorly performing webcam is a disgrace. I don't know what it cost in January, but \u00a320-\u00a325 seems a fair price point to me. My solution, use my phone as a webcam.",

      "text": "I needed a webcam since we went into lockdown for zoom and Skype calls. I wanted something simple to set up, I own a couple of Wansview cameras which I have been impressed with so this was an obvious choice. The webcam arrived the next day and just requires you to plug the usb in. You can clip it on your tv or laptop. The quality and clarity of the picture was very good compared to that of my laptop camera. I found the inbuilt microphone reduces background sound which is useful. There are a few cheaper cameras but this is is definitely a good camera for the price.",

But the quality was really poor to the point it is unusable. Doesn't even catch my mouth move when talking and the picture quality was awfull. The sound was poor too. So unfortunately I cannot use it so I feel I need to return it.",

It looks smart and has a decent cable length, so I can use it in various locations. The instructions are very brief and packaging simple, but thankfully it just plugs in and works.",
