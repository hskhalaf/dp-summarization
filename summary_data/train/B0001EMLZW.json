We sent the first one back because of a crappy screen that decorates itself with lcd lines with the slightest pressure. Heck, the screen looked broken. Second one did the same thing. We'd go with HP is she could use THAT one on her tests. Apparently this is a common complaint for this item. Read the two star reviews. We'd send the second back too if my daughter didn't HAVE to have this brand. Geez. These people are making a very crappy thing for figuring out formulas that are so important.",

This calculator consistently misses numbers, especially when i type with two hands. Buttons are hard to press. After 2.5 months of use, #9 is barely responsive, have to press it several times to get it displayed. I used Citizen scientific calculators before signing up for CFA, they are way higher quality and easier to use. Shame on TI.",

Also, it's a little better build quality than its counterpart. My only complaint is that you have to be very intentional with your keystrokes, you have to make sure you've fully depressed the key. However, you could argue that this helps prevent miss keying something. All in all it's a great financial calculator that's easy to learn and use.

I have to watch each button press carefully and check to make sure it registered (having used this calculator for over a decade, it is very embarrassing to make mistakes in front of 60 students). It is so bad, I use it as my calculator of last resort. I use the base model, then the one on my phone, and only if both are unavailable do I use the professional.",

It has all the functionalities of the BA II Plus with a few extra functionalities including the calculation of: Net Future Value (NFV), Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR), Modified Duration, Payback, and Discount Payback. There are two other general differences from the BA II Plus. 1. The buttons are smaller and feel firmer to press. 2. The order in which you plug in certain keys to calculate various functions are different from the BA II Plus.",

There's a \"cheat sheet\" card that comes with it that's very useful, but I find it difficult to put in the case with the calculator and don't feel the case really protects it. TI used to put a hard slide cover on their calculators and I wish they had done that with this one as well.",

There is a lower model that comes with a hard case that has the exact same button locations and functionality, but it is cheaper. So I would really recommend that rather than this model. The only reason you would need this version is if you need to perform calculations in front of clients so its a nicer and more professional looking device. I hope this review helps.",

It doesn't register rapid key entries all the time so you have to really watch your inputs.
