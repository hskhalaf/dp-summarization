That would about end me needing a hero gopro for any vlogging the 1440 resolution is just not with todays standard. And 2nd I hope we get some slow motion in 360! Thats hard to believe that it is not in the software with the camera. The max is bare really with features compared to the hero 8. But If you want a fantastic camera and a really easy to edit this is a no brainers",
