      "title": "Awesome, versatile tripod, with a Bluetooth remote!",
      "text": "I ordered this tripod because I was using an older flexible tripod that was just not holding my phone well anymore. I also wanted something that was high quality so when this arrived, I was really pleased. The rubber coating on the legs holds on REALLY well. The flexibility of the legs allows it to hold on to many different surfaces without slipping. The thing I like the most is that you can manipulate the legs so much that getting a nice level shot is easy on even the most uneven of surfaces. That's all great, but then you also get a Bluetooth remote... sweet bonus!",

We broke it by accident and contacted Qualmond to replace the broken part! Instead of sending the broken part they replaced the whole thing. We are very happy with this product and especially the company Qualmond! Thank You!",
