      "verdict": "With its slick metal body, the HTC One Mini 2 is among the most luxurious compact phones around. HTC, however, has given it a set of specs that put it more alongside the dirt-cheap Moto G than the One M8. This is definitely not the flagship One M8 in a more compact form. If style is of the utmost importance, it's worth checking out, but the Moto G is much better value.",

        "The HTC One Mini 2 is one of the best looking compact phones around, thanks to its gorgeous metal body",

In the past I had a standard HTC m8 but it was too big for my little hands so I decided to wait until mini version arrives to USA . Meanwhile I had an iPhone but even though the elegance of IOS I have always preferred Android and I am here. I have to tell I was sceptical about buying an unlocked phone from Amazon but until now I don't have any complaints about phone, it works perfectly with my at&t carrier service.",

I created playlists while the phone was connected to my computer that don't show up when I go to play music on the phone. That's the only issue I have with it, otherwise, I love this phone.
