The straps are comfortable and well adjusting and I love that it has a belt strap and a cord to cinch the top opening closed. Shoe size fits great, too. Great purchase.",

No leaks yet, pretty sure if you walks through some thorn bushes the material would tear. My downsides would be the water pressure crushes the boot down on your foot and the boots are very thin which leads to uncomfortable bumps into rocks and trees while fishing rivers. Also a bigger pocket on the inside is needed for a small tackle box, pliers and what not. These are good for quick fishing, I wouldn\u2019t want to be in them all day. For the price it\u2019s a great product.",

The fit of the body was spot on, and I appreciated the adjustable straps and belt to make the waders more comfortable for my height, however the boots ran about a half size to a size large. The boots have a very flexible, soft sole compared to regular knee waders, so depending on preference this could be a positive or negative. The one downside was having to decide between a larger size to accommodate my waist/thigh area for better movement, or a smaller size to make the boots more fitted to my feet.",

Boot fit is really good. My old waders my feet slid around in the boots. Not like that in the TideWe waders. Good grip while in the water too. The straps are durable and comfortable on the shoulders. All in all these are excellent waders. The price point is spot on!! I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a great pair of waders at a very fair price.",

The quality seems very middle of the road. No part of the construction stood out as a problem and I did not have any trouble with leaks on my first use but I am concerned about their longevity. For short term use, however, these are great.",

I stayed dry with but my brother's pair had a small leak. I retuned the 1 pair with no problem. They were happy to replace them. I think it was a fluke that the 1 pair had a leak because my pair worked real good. They seem well made and are reasonably priced.",
