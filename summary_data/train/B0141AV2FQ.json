But this stuff is super concentrated and is very strong if you're sniffing it right out the bottle. When diluted properly however, it smells just like fresh oranges. I use it in the bathroom, on the counter tops and on the floors. Has been great so far and will last a long time! If someone is coming over I do a quick wipe down of my hard surfaces and it makes the whole house smell great.",

We have an infestation each fall and ladybugs can't stand the smell of orange oil. It's a safe way to repel the bugs and not harm such a beneficial insect. My shopping experience was fast and easy and I will be ordering again soon. My friends have been very impressed with the many uses your Orange Oil Concentrate has. Great product!",

After several days of daily spraying the cats were gone. Have to periodically refresh so they will stay away.

Regardless, I love the smell of oranges and this smells great! No bad chemical smell. Follow the instructions on the bottle, this stuff is strong.",

I looked at poison, but have pets and grandkids, and like the lizards and frogs, and wanted something I could be a little selective with, and chose to use orange oil. It seems to be working. Every day I am treating a few more ant hills, and I am seeing a reduction in their numbers.",

Since I read that rodents don't like things like peppermint because it masks the scent of their predators, I decided to try the orange oil. It soaks into the wood, is a nice change from the mint, and seems to be working.",

Spraying around the edge of the porch helps keep snakes from crawling under the porch. Putting a bit on a soft rag and wiping the interior of the car gets rid of unpleasant doggie or fast food odors. So many more uses without all the heavy chemicals.",
