I ordered white sheets in twin, queen and king and they all had black lint on them AND they are very thin, not the silky softness that the past orders were. One set had black dirt (like machine grease) along a edge. The other set had a huge thread flaw (thick and discolored) running down the middle. Last year I recommended these sheets to everyone. The sheets are no longer the same that I received in 2018. Poor quality and dirty.",

      "text": "Have to admit, wasn't expecting a lot with such a low price. Was very pleasantly surprised. Sheets washed up very nicely. Retained dark navy blue color. Very soft. Brand new, so can't really comment on staining or durability. A nice feature I haven't seen elsewhere was on the pillowcases. They are sewn so as to tuck in the pillow, keep it in place instead of just an open sleeve. Something I wouldn't have requested, but really like. Took off one star (very picky) for a corner that tends to creep up (mattress is very thick) despite the elastic around the bottom sheet. Would have a expected to pay double, or more, for this quality.",

My one little complaint is they only made it about a year before getting little holes ,thread pulls and stretched out beyond repairt.

      "text": "I purchased the Utopia Bedding Sheet set and was not sure what to expect since I bought them online and was not able to touch and feel them first. I was very pleasantly surprised! The sheets are soft, wrinkle resistant, and they make the task of making the bed a breeze. I do not iron my sheets, and you could not tell that I don't with these. I would definitely purchase these again, however I think it will take a while before these wear out. The sheets we purchased were for deep pockets, so they seem a little loose. If you want a tight fit, this may be an issue for you. It isn't for me.",

As normal, I washed everything before putting it on, but it didn't help. The other issue I have is that the pillow cases are too short - our normal-sized pillows keep popping out of their cases, especially during the night! There's supposed to be a fold-in flap to prevent this, but it's way too ineffective to be of any use. The sheets themselves are nonetheless comfortable, they just look terrible. Not sure what to do; maybe I'll get invited to a Toga party...",
