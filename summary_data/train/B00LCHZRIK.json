      "text": "Best Zelda Game in the series! Amazing concept art for the Zelda franchise, easy to work controls. It is very open to do what you want, and for a dedicated Zelda fan this was my favorite thing about this game. Story isn't long but there is so much to do to help you finish the story right if you are into that. I can not imagine a better uniting story of some of my favorite races and tribes from the previous games. I loved that there was reference to the older games such as music, extras, and obviously characters from past games. This was a very refreshing Legend of Zelda!",

      "text": "I only have two complaints about this game. The first is the frame rate. How does a game with cel shading get such horrible frame rate drops? The answer: rendering unnecessary particle effects in places that would look just fine without them. The second is that some things are extremely underwhelming. For instance, you can invest tens of thousands of rupees into buying and decorating a house; but it's so far out of the way just to get to, and the only things it has to offer is a free bed and nine weapon mounts (three for each type; melee, bow, and shield).",

The offerings so far on Wii and Wii U have been fun and innovative, but this is the real deal if you're looking for an awesome Zelda experience. I haven't played video games in a few years, but this game has reignited my passion for nintendo and zelda. You won't be disappointed. It offers plenty for gamers of all skill levels, and some of the challenges take hours alone to solve. I can't wait to finish all 120 shrines!",

Sure, it has flaws like any other game such as a lackluster story and the Divine Beasts being puzzle boxes instead of real dungeons, but still an excellent addition to the series. Love the open world exploration and the concept of the shrines and am one of those that think breakable weapons was a good thing although Nintendo could have handled the concept better than just a warning your current weapon is about to break. Also was annoyed they pushed the game back to be a Switch launch title at the time because I had already pre-ordered months before that happened. But all that aside excellent game, one well worth owning. 9.5/10",

The graphics, tone, sense of wonder, emotion, and exploration is intensely gratifying. Is it perfect? No, it has a scope issue (in that there's long periods where nothing of note happens), and disappointing boss fights and lack of classic Zelda gadgets, but it makes up for it with the sense of liberation it gives you as the player. This game does what old school games did all the time ... it puts you into the shoes of the hero, and lets your imagination fill in the blanks.",

Yet Nintendo managed to make it feel not repetitive, the environment, quests, monsters, etc. are very varied, and there's plenty of side-quests to discover and things to do. One negative side perhaps is the tutorial/intro area which you can't leave for a while until you've done some quests, it feels a bit boring and detached from the rest of the game. It's well worth getting over this initial lump tho to get to the \"main\" world.",

The game itself is wonderful. An open world where you can explore freely. Do whatever missions and quest you want to do in any order. Tons and Tons of secrets and hidden puzzles and easter eggs to locate.",

The dlc is great, but it should be included with the $60. 4. There is NO WAY to 100% without the Wii u gamepad. 5. There isn't a very reliable way to collect all korok seeds, without having to use or buy a guide. I give the game a solid 9.5/10. The gameplay is sooooo good!!!!!!",

I'd recommend buying the DLC for this, its 20$ but its worth it in my opinion",
