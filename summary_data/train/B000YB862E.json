I have 2 video tripods, and even tho they are professional grade, the legs are so long that they wobble a little bit. The dolly ads structural stability. It's easy to put together, easy to put away, fits perfectly in its bag. It seems sturdy. If anything happens, I will update this review. I never throw or bit up my equipment. I try to be as gentle as I am with my cameras. This my fourth Ravelli product and so far I am very happy everything.",

These guys really should have considered using soft rubber wheels instead of hard plastic ones\u2014duh\u2014videographers aren't always filming on perfectly smooth, level ground :/ Oh, and like that shopping cart at the grocery store that seems to go wherever it wants, this dolly kind of does it every so often. If you are shooting on smooth floors and you have some time to make certain the wheels are perfectly aligned before you start your camera move, it's not a bad rig.",

It has a button release in the arm and would not stay connected. I did like it. Substantial rubber wheels that gave my camera a smooth ride for tracking shots etc. Locks down on each wheel, good equipment for the price. Had to duct tape the arm on to the hub and not rely on it as a main dolly. I did mention this in a post. Customer service has sent a new one and looking forward to working with this equipment, appreciate the follow through! Thank you!",

In addition, the latency of the remote connections essentially ignores any small bumps so this is not an issue for my application. The dolly is very light and stable and has allowed me to focus on my presentations without worrying about dragging the tripod around. Highly recommended!",

Moving one direction it works fine and looks smooth for me. If there is any shake, it can be easily softened with a stabilize effect. But any slight change in movement causes the wheels to flip and it affects the footage greatly.",

      "text": "I don't do movies, so I can't really judge whether this would be stable enough. I do still photography and this dolly works just fine to move an loaded tripod around. Loaded with camera and all, and also a pair of sandbags to ensure its stability, although I am very confident with it. Essentially when shooting in the studio and needing to have the camera on tripod, this is very handy. Only caveat: if you use a tripod with independent legs, you want to set their length so that they are all at a known, locked angle otherwise the center column may not be vertical. Not a problem for me.",

Like other reviewers have said... don't try to stand on it! the weight at the corners where the tripod mounts will take a considerable amount of weight though. I was disappointed in the spread though. My tripod was barely half open. I would have preferred another 12\" to the diameter. Still, it does hold the tripod up but it is slightly tippy if a wheel catches on something so I suggest you use weight bags on your tripod. The wheels roll smoothly and the wheel locks are the best I have ever seen! Since I know the price of wheels, just the wheels alone are worth the price.",

They catch on the sliding tripod bases and make it difficult to adjust sometimes, but this is easily managed. Great on smooth ground, footage will show every bump, but works better with a heavier tripod. Could benefit from larger casters, but current caster locks are very strong and reliable. Definitely worth the price, the right conditions could wield some great shots.",

But if you're shooting live events and just want to move your camera around without it shaking and looking terrible, this is by far the best option.",

    "description": "The Ravelli ATD Tripod Dolly is designed to allow rolling movement of your tripod or light stand from one location to another without lifting. It uses large rubber surfaced wheels. The 3\u201d wheels are lockable with step function locking. On each leg of the dolly are sliding adjustable foot locks for your tripod or stand. The dolly is collapsible and has a carry handle and a carry bag. The legs disassemble into two sections for shorter storage if desired. Each dolly leg is 16\u201d long allowing for a maximum diameter spread of 36\u201d.\n\nThe larger rubber wheels with ball bearings do allow for relatively smooth rolling motion. However, this may not be sufficient for truly zero jitter video. Actual results will vary based on the smoothness of the ground surface and the presence of any dirt or debris.\n\nIf you are looking for ultra smooth video, possibly better options would be a mounted glider/slider on the top of the tripod or a floor mounted track system.",
