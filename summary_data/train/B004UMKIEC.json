DO YOUR RESEARCH - there are better foods out there that do not cause these issues, and they can be found on Amazon.",

I eased them into this one from the food they were on and I have had no problems at all. They love it. Normal stools and they're both healthy. I have seen a lot of people say to mix it with Wysong and give them a variety but I haven't done that yet. Mine both drink plenty of water as well. If anything negative comes of this product, I will update it immediately. So far, so good. Update: they still love it and are healthy 3 year olds!",

It seems each food has its draw backs. I feed this, Wynsong Epigen-90 and Evo ferret combined. That way they don't get too much of a bad thing, get a variety of healthy foods, and if they discontinue one there are still two others my guys are accustomed to. (Ferret foods seemed to get discontinue all the time, it has already happened to us more than once). Overall I recommend this food as part of a ferret's diet, but not the only part.",

Zupreem did the trick. All of her fur is back, and her coat looks fabulous. She is even more spunky than before (if that is possible !!!) She loves this food and doesn't waste any of it. Apparently my kitties love it, too....they are always sliding their paws into her house and stealing little bits for themselves !!!",
