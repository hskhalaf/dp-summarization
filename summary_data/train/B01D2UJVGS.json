I used it to help ease up some of the knots and tension I carry in my shoulders and neck. Now my husband didn\u2019t enjoy it but he doesn\u2019t enjoy massages. Me on the other hand I love deep tissue massage. I\u2019m very impressed. I think for forty bucks it\u2019s well worth the shot. And if you don\u2019t like it just regift it. I mean forty dollars is cheaper than one massage. I think this thing will save me money and help my tension headaches. Treat yo self.",

They apparently care a great deal about their reputation, and after reading my review of my first massager (which broke after the return window had closed), Naipo reached out to me to send me a replacement. I was pretty much blown away. That said, the new unit is great and truly, these massagers are awesome-- since my original purchase, I bought two more, one for my mother and one for my sister, they love theirs as well. Anyhow, I can't say enough nice things about how Naipo took care of me, unsolicited no less, and their product is truly first rate.",

It causer her a lot of back and neck pain with lots of \"knots\" in her muscles. I got this to help since I have sever arthritis in my hands and it hurts to massage her neck more than a few minutes. She used this Christmas night and it felt really good, until about 10 minutes in when her arms, shoulders and neck started hurting. She's still in pain 2 days later and probably will have to return this for a refund.",

The good news is that this thing feels awesome, like someone is actually working out the kinks with their hands. You slip your arms through the loops and can move it up and down from your neck to your lower back, pulling into your back for added pressure depending on how deep you want the massage. It's incredible! I carry so much stress and tension in my neck and shoulders and this thing breathes life back into my tense muscles. It does come with a car cord, which would work as a passenger, not the driver.",

The mesh is abrasive, so you'll need to have some clothing between you and the massager. The motors are strong enough when used on your shoulders, but stall when you massage your back by leaning back on the device with a chair behind it.

      "text": "After reading the great reviews and after trying various products to help with my fibromyalgia pain over the years, I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, the massage is not deep enough, and the motor stops after about 2-3 minutes of massage. It takes time to stop, turn off, back on, wait about 10 minutes... and then it starts again, only to shut off in a few minutes. Poor product, not deep pressure, and stops working after a few minutes of use. I will be returning for sure.",

When I try to turn it on now, it'll light up and turn back off. I already emailed the company and have yet to hear back yet. Just makes me super sad because I loved this massager and now it no longer works after a day. UPDATE: Since I emailed the company, I received a working and functional product. Customer service is so easy to work with and are super nice. Thank you so much for helping me out and getting me a working product. This massager rocks!",

This thing is a godsend. I use it far more than I would imagine the average person does, and it\u2019s consistently helpful. The controls are simple \u2014 you control the pressure by hand placement. I use it while working at the computer, while watching tv, and sometimes even in bed. You can use it for other areas of the body - it seems good on lower back and legs, too \u2014 but it\u2019s optimal on shoulders and neck.",

I can take this massage to my work office as I am sitting in my office chair. It is also lightweight. Easy to carry anywhere, and easy to use. The price is affordable too.

I pulled a muscle a week ago and even after a visit to my usual masseur it still hurt. I spent two mornings targeting the stiff area with the Naipo Massager, and it provided almost immediate results.

The kneading parts are also pretty hard so if I pull a little much it goes from soothing to painful real quick.
