And no matter how healthy I've tried to be (quitting some trigger food and drinks, eating plenty of greens, exercising consistently), I've always experienced some of the unpleasant symptoms: chest pains, palpitations, and the anxiety that stems from these. HOWEVER. After some time of taking CoQ10, I have not had all the unpleasantness happen again. I FEEL BETTER. This has never happened before with a supplement, there is always some degree of uncertainty as to whether they would actually make any difference. I hope this helps you as much as it seems to help me. And of course, always keep consulting your cardiologist regularly.",

No more waking in the middle of the night. That was a few years back and I eventually stopped with the statin but continued taking Qunol. A while back I ran out and didn't replace it. My cramps started again, every night. Now I won't go without it and take it everyday. In fact I have 4 more backup bottles so I don't run out. Love this product.",
