Best features: Long battery life, 2 line spool instead of 1, low vs hi speed, cut a path of long grass/weeds like a hot knife thru butter. Only things that would make it even better: Ability to adjust the length of the trimmer and the ability for the head to turn to use as an edger",

I let a string get real short, and it slipped inside the cutter head. Won't make that mistake again, but not looking forward to changing line. WD40 in the right place might have helped. The 6Ah and 7.5Ah batteries are great. 4Ah gives me less than half the run time of either.",

Amazing battery life on low and I only need high for the super thick and tall grass or the berries (more shrub than weeds). Love how quiet it is and how easy it is to maneuver. Wish it had a shoulder strap but will likely repurpose the one off my Stihl now that I will use it so infrequently.",

That head is not compatible with my weedeater. I had the local dewalt dealer look at it also. Maybe the design has changed. An old dewalt part number of DWO1DT995 was given to me as a quickfeed head, however dewalt is no longer making that.",
