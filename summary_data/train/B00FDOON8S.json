      "text": "I have cooked with charcoal grills and propane grills, with Weber products and non-Weber products. I am currently living in an area where 'open-flame' grills are not permitted, so decided to see how a Weber's electric grill would work. It is GREAT! Follow the directions to let it warm up for 20 minutes before cooking and you will be good to go. Meat chars very well, tastes great. One outstanding quality of the grill is that it is more consistent in terms of heat produced than a flamed grill, so you can get your timing down literally to the minute for many things you grill repeatedly. Terrific product.",

Well I have purchased several; as gifts, for home, for camp, for camper...etc. FANTASTIC!! I did install a temperature gauge on all of them as this is a very nice feature and needed (in my opinion) when cooking chicken, pork, fish, shrimp or steak. Have no idea why this is not a standard feature but an easy fix. Great no having to worry about charcoal or gas.",

The only assembly required is lining up the top with the bottom and inserting two cotter pins. In addition the handle must be screwed in place. I followed somebody's else's review abd screwed in the handle first. Made life a little bit easier.",

The unit functions otherwise as intended. If you are intending to buy the accompanying stand, you should be aware that it DOES NOT have any shelves, which limits its functionality.

      "text": "If you want the ease of an electric grill or are not allowed to have an open flame where you live, this grill is great. I drilled a hole in the lid and installed a thermometer so I can see the temperature while cooking, which reduces having to lift the lid to check on your food (which will increase cooking time). I was able to fit twelve 1/3 lbs burgers on the grill at one time and cook them in 15 minutes (not including the 20 minute preheat). Not the cheapest electric grill but you get what you pay for. I am happy with purchase.",

This is better than my last Weber and I have been extremely happy with it.",

The drip pans were also easy to clean, but only needed cleaned about every four meals. I highly recommend this grill.",

The variable temperature control allows wide latitude and gives the user many options for the specific requirements of the food being cooked. No, it doesn't give the \"smoky\" flavor of a charcoal grill, but in an environment that bans charcoal because of the smoke and propane because of the storage hazards, this is a superior alternative.",

It cooks well, no flare-ups, easy to get well seared, rare steak, and super easy to clean. I especially like that the liner is removable for cleaning. Everyone who has food from this grill can't believe that it's electric. One of the best, useable products I've purchased in years. You will not regret buying it.",

My one complaint was that it doesn't have a built in thermometer; however, to solve that issue I purchased an oven one that works fine.",

The grill has the same great performance and sleek styling, but adds new aesthetics that are both functional and fun, including larger grip handle and control knobs, ergonomic side handles, sturdy front and rear cradles plus the familiar Weber Q logo branded in the lid. The Weber Q 2400 Electric grill raises the bar on flavor expectations and performance of an electric grill. Sear burgers, steaks and chops; grill chicken, fish, vegetables and fruit on the porcelain-enameled cast-iron grates. You'll be amazed at the authentic grilled taste of foods cooked on this electric grill. The Weber Q 2400 grill is fully featured, yet space-saving and portable - just the ticket for grillers living in condos or any residence where restrictions govern gas and charcoal grill usage. May be used with the 2014 Weber Q Portable Cart model #6557 and Q Cart model #6525. Weber Q 2400 is for outdoor use only.",
