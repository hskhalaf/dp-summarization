      "text": "Really, these work just fine for hanging solar lanterns! I love that the heights if the hooks are adjustable because I have some raised areas in my garden that just wouldn't look right with tall lights. You're given two, threaded sections and the top section that is the hook and the bottom one that is the ground stake consisting of two long prongs. For the all hook, use both threaded sections and for shorter hangers, a she only one threaded section. Will these hold a 10lb. Hanging plant? No. It's not made for that application. Will it hold a lantern garden light and stand up to weather? Yes! Plenty sturdy! Buying more!",

The hooks are small, and good for small items, not bigger flower baskets. The package had 4 hooks in it, which was good, because some of the sections would not screw in straight or all the way, resulting in a crook in the pole. I'm only using 2 hooks and was able to get enough sections to have 2 nice, straight poles. For what I was looking for, these hooks work well, and I'm pleased. The price was good, and the service was very good, arriving as predicted.",

I didn't have that problem previously when I had simple stakes that had a single shaft.",
