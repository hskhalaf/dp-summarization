I love that there are multiple light settings, that it's so portable and lightweight. It was THE hit of the holidays and I put them into everyone's stockings!",

It has a clamp clip to hold it in place. I've used it to facetime my parents when I'm showing them their grand daughter. I've also used it to do unboxing videos of plants which I'm really into for instagram. The goose neck holds the light and phone in place, so you can position them in any angle. The only thing is you do need a USB power source. I wish it was rechargeable. I have to plug it into my laptop or use a power bank.",
