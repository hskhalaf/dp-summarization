I chalked it up to him being allergic to something in food and tried all kinds of grain free, boutique foods. He did okay on some but his stool output was insane and he was skin and bones. Some gave him diarrhea. I\u2019m not sure what made me try this but I\u2019m SO GLAD I found it. Our GSP looks incredible. He is muscular and has filled out so nicely. His coat is nice, he has firm, small stools consistently and he hasn\u2019t had one problem with his skin since starting this food.",

I have two Australian Cattle Dogs (Blue Heelers) that need every ounce of protein and fat to fuel their non-stop activities. This is the highest protein fat blend at 32/25 I've found. I'm blown away at how well this food does what it claims. With Prime is comes out to $43 for a 40 lb bag.. You cannot beat that unless you get cheap store brand food. I have a feeling I'm going to be sticking with this food for a LONG time. My heelers Maverick and Apollo thank you!",

My moms dog goes crazy for a couple pieces so maybe my dogs are just extra picky. Excellent quality food for a highly active dog! I\u2019ve felt like the puppy has developed excellent muscle tone and for a miniature dachshund can easily maintain an 8 minute mile pace for a 5 mile run, then go chase birds around the yard for several more hours.",
