It took shape easily while just squeezing it in my hand. The molds are easy to use, just keep packing the sand in really tight, then gently tap on the mold to release. I will suggest that if this is for more than 1 child, that more sand is probably preferable. It was fun for the children as much as the adults. The sand is easy to clean up if it breaks off from the rest. Comes with a bag to store the sand in.",

      "text": "As a former preschool teacher I have a lot of experience with kinetic sand. This SPACE SAND is so much better. It really holds the small details of the molds and the kids I work with love it! Great toy for getting children to play together. The mini-pool that holds the sand kept it nice and contained, but even when it gets on the floor, it is super easy to clean up. I will definitely be buying more Space Sand in the future and recommend it to anyone who works with kids or has children/grandchildren.",

We are able to mold it but is isn't much fun to cut and play with since we were expecting it to be pliable. It is okay but I suspect that we will end up ordering a better quality sand therefore essentially wasting our money on this kit. Of course, the tools are re-usable so we received some value from the purchase (maybe a few dollars worth?).",

Because it actually stays together when you mold it unlike say kinetic sand, after you mold it, it starts to fall over, so if you actually want to make a castle you can\u2019t. But with this you can. It will stay in place for like 20 min or more! It\u2019s great. Also one big thing that I really wish this company would do is sell separate sand. I HATE having to buy a new kit every time my sons needs sand. Also I would like to fill his sand box with it but can\u2019t with so little. Please think of selling separate sand!",

However we opened it today and set everything up and dumped the space sand only to be disappointed with it. The sand was hard and really crumbly. I'm not sure what was wrong with it but the consistency of the sand was not right. It sticked onto their clothing and was all over my floor. It was an absolute mess. It wasnt smooth to work with it didn't give us that wow factor we were expecting. I will be asking for a refund.",
