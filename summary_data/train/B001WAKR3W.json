Done everything I could think of but this is a no go. I am contacting Razer for warranty service and seeing what they can do, be cautious.",

It's light and incredibly responsive but having to keep in on a leash is nowhere worth the hefty price tag. You can easily match the performance with other corded mice at half the price. The cord plugs nicely into the base unit, but it's a serious hassle to get it to seat in the mouse properly, and removing it? Forget about it. Not made for human hands.",
