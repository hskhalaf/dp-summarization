      "text": "I have bought about 5 of these over several years. The pump is essential to create the foam. On nearly every bottle, the pump starts to stick in the down position just weeks after starting the bottle. This means that I have to pull the pump up every time before using it. What a pain. A couple of the pumps simply broke from being pulled up so many times. Giovanni needs to fix their pumps. In fairness to the quality of the mousse, it's good. It is medium hold and works well for me. So I don't give up on this product in utter frustration, I poured the mousse into an empty foaming hand sanitizer container. THAT pump never fails.",

I just wrote a review for the \"D-Tox\" soap as well and am going to try some Giovanni hairspray next. It's hard to believe that natural products can work so well and be so cost-effective! No more settling for toxic mainstream products for me. Much gratitude to Giovanni, Amazon and the Amazon community.",

    "description": "Giovanni Mousse Air-Turbo Charged Hair Styling Foam adds volume, texture, and body to any hair style. This styling foam builds hair to amazing heights with amazing stay-power.\n\nGiovanni was the first full-range, salon-inspired hair-care brand in natural product stores, and today is the #1 selling Hair Care line in the United States Natural Products Industry. But before there was a brand, there was a pioneer. Arthur Guidotti had a vision and a love for all things hair. He began developing his passion as a hairstylist in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. \n\nHe worked for a time with hairstylist icon Gene Shacove and was good friends with \u201cthe father of hair color,\u201d Al Lapin. By the 1960s, Arthur was maturing his talents and decided to open his own salon, called On Sunset. The salon was a bustling site, on the famous Sunset Strip, and a hit with many Hollywood celebrities, including Lucille Ball. \n\nSince 1979 the Giovanni Rule of Balance has been our commitment to make each product as pure and as natural as possible without sacrificing exceptional product performance.\n\nGiovanni is committed to creating only the highest-performance formulations, wrapped in aesthetically beautiful packaging and marketed with extraordinary visuals and graphics.",
