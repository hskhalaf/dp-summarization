Having said that if you haven't actually held it in your hands and you only have pictures to go by it's likely you'll think this is better quality than it is, as I did. It is SUPER CHEAP quality! It seems like something you'd get with tickets from your kids favorite family dining arcade. I'm frankly rather surprised that Sticky Bumps allowed their name to be put on this! I have already wasted more time than this thing is worth, ordering it, walking to the hub to pick it up, and now reviewing it. You've been warned!",

The comb is not robust like some of the ones that come with the surf shorts but it works. It is strong enough to ruffle the wax so I can surf without putting more wax and I actually removed the entire wax job from 2 of my boards recently with it. It did the job just fine.",

Great in a pinch though and I actually kind of like the comb, but the other review was right. The combs that came with my Leash and board shorts are much more robust.",
