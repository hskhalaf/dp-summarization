It is comparable to french fries that you send back because they have a hint of warm but aren't at all hot. I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't inconsequential \"is this thing on?\" heat. I even called the mfg and they confirmed that was it's design. I would rather it actually feel warmer and soothing than those silly red lights that do nothing. If you just want a massager great if you are hoping for soothing heat in addition look elsewhere.",
