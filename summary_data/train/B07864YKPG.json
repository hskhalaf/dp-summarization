I have gone to the product web site two or three times to order one and they never have one. Have submitted every time to be put on a notice list when they are available. It has already been a month and half and I have not received notice yet. This is however a good starter machine for those just getting in on juicing.",

It becomes a bit messy if the juice doesnt flow properly through the \"funnel hole.\" On arrival, noticed the red plastic bin was cracked but nothing major. This product did juice the fruits good however still a lot of plup. Recommend a fine strainer to catch large particles.",

      "text": "It's an average centrifugal juicer. Honestly I like the Jack lalanne juicer that I had before because the grinding wheel was wider and it was offset from the center of your fruit or vegetables. In other words the cutting wheel is wider offset from setter. This juicer it is center of the vegetable that you're trying to juice. It works fine on the outer edges but in the center it doesn't do anything. If it's offset a bit it does much better at grinding and juicing your veggies and fruits.",
