Check online for prices. I got mine though Lonestar trade. I am in NY got the in 3 days. Give them a try. Happy trails!!!!",

Often the arch support is either too narrow and makes your foot feel jammed into the shoe, or it offers too much support and ends up making your feet hurt something fierce. This particular shoe has great support and cushion for the constant jarring of jogging/running",
