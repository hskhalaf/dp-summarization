I have it pushing a single 12 inch Pioneer Champion Series sub (2 ohm DVC in series for a total 4 ohms) in a ported box. It is not even at half gain and pushes that speaker to its limit. The quality of the sound is great too. The amp is small, which is a good thing. 1 Con: the terminals. You insert the bare wire and then tighten the screw. No matter how hard you tighten, the larger power and ground wires can slip out. They will need secured close to the amp so they cannot be pulled out.",

Using the hi-level inputs also doubles as the \"remote turn on\" wire so that was a great help for someone who is new to installing this kind of thing. It works perfectly fine and I'm very happy with the purchase. I only added this amp and sub to my sound system, the rest was factory equipment. After turning down the bass from all other speakers it improved the sound of all other speakers as well. Was pleasantly surprised.",

But I have to turn the knob and turn the music down so as not to trudge up suspicion. But other than that just a great amp. One other thing is that my 4 gauge cable had to be snipped down to fit in the connectors. I still love it though! And the price is great for an amp like this.",

      "text": "A very powerful amp. I'm using it with two double coil Pioneer Champion Series 12\", 400W RMS each, and this amp makes some serious noise. It is very small and nice looking, I was surprised to find this much power for a small and low priced amp so I'm satisfied. The only thing I hate from this amp is that when I turn off the car, I can hear a click sound when it shuts off, it is very annoying.",

      "text": "I bought this amp because it could go as low as 1 ohm. I hooked it up to a new 12\" JL Audio 2 ohm W3 in a sealed box and it sounds amazing. If I didn't know better I would think I had 3 subs in the trunk. I usually have to turn down the bass level on the deck because it get too loud. I love that at the level I play my music, that I never have to worry about pushing the amp or sub too hard. Great amp for a single sub application.",
