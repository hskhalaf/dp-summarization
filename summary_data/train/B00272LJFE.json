The belt is really sad I have to say as the buckle part it cheap vinyl that bends when tied and doesn't hold its shape. A plastic buckle would have made a huge difference in quality on that. I don't see this costume lasting for many many wears or anything but for a few times to wear it it's not bad.",

Contras: * The belt looks cheap and it will probably end up all twisted and in bad shape after sitting down. * The pants can use some suspenders because they don't have any kind of lace to fit in place I would recommend this with my eyes closed!",

Pretty easy to fix, however, as you can do without the boots/use the headband as a belt/lose the wrist bands. Overall I am very happy with the purchase. There is a small issue of the fake leather smelling like fish. It is not very noticeable if you spray with febreeze or wear cologne but its a little odd. Comes with fake boots, pants, belt, shirt, wrist bands, and headband. Eye patch and sword are not included in the actual costume.",

      "text": "Not bad for a improvised, last minute Halloween costume. It's comfortable, the polyester fabric is thin and breathable. The boots were kind of hard to put on and as for the belt, I just didn't wear it and took one of my regular large buckle belts. It runs kind of large though, you might want to order a size down. Well worth the price.",

Good costume for the price, add in some makeup and some jewelry and you will be fine.",

I typically wear a large in women's but I like things to fit loosely and as this certainly runs big, even with hips, this costume was forgiving! For the price, you can't beat it!! I was in the league of better costumes at work and many of those people had spent six to seven times (or more) than what I did. Coupled with a hook, hat and some eyeliner, I made a very convincing Captain Hook. The only thing cheesy was the belt which was cheap and looked lousy as I do have hips. I just took it off and went without it. :0) awesome awesome costume.",

I chose this for an adult party I was attending and it was a hit. I highly recommend this product to everyone and I am sure you will not be disappointed:)",
