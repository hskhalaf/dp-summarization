The grip pads are also helpful when walking around on the tile floors. They wash well but I have found that after a few wearings they stretch out and start slipping off. I have to keep puling them up. I am pleased with these but wish they did not stretch out so easily. Unsure if I would buy them again.",

Not a time to be slipping\u2019n\u2019sliding on slick\u2019n\u2019wicked flooring. So I bought 4 more pair. This time in just two colors, hoping they wouldn\u2019t run away so quickly.

      "text": "The look and feel of the sock was nice. They were \"sticky\" when they needed to be on the mats, however, they were larger than expected. I wear anywhere between a 7-8 size shoe and the sock slipped around on my foot and the sticky part usually ended up on the side of my foot instead of at the bottom. They did get a little more snug after washing them in really hot water but then stretched out again by the end of the exercise session. I ended up giving them away to someone with a larger foot.",
