Heavy duty construction ...just be mindful of the silicon o-rings on the needles they can tend to fall off easily. My injection recipe is - 2 cups chicken broth - 1/2 stick butter - fresh marjoram/parsley/sage/rosemary finely chopped - ground pepper - about a tbs Yardbird rub Simmer in pot then inject....mix all same ingredients in a butter paste and rub outside.....this has been a hit every year. Of course it's smoked in my Traeger using Apple wood pellets which adds a lot to the flavor but you can definitely taste the difference the injection makes",

I would buy again without problem. It comes in a nice package that can be used to store it when not in use as well.",

It is well made and very sturdy. I especially like the large needle that is designed to inject small pieces of garlic, jalapenos, etc.",

The needles have nice wide diameters that have yet to clog. You need to unscrew the top/plunger assembly and needle from the barrel and put them all in a tall tumbler and clean it with very hot water to remove all the injectate. Just putting the pieces in a dishwasher won't guarantee internal cleanliness. I keep it assembled with all my other stainless steel bar paraphernalia. Great item. Great conversation piece. Great accessory for Halloween.",

Seems like a really well made product that will last for years. I am already trying to think of some new ideas for it.",

Because of the size of the bore of the needle you can get a thicker marinade in. Not to terrible to clean. suck up some hot soapy water a few times and rinse.",
