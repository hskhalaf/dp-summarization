      "text": "I bought this USB drive back in 2012 for around $120. It's almost 2019 now, and it's still the best USB drive I've owned. I finally got around to running a speed test (after all these years) and was surprised that it actually had read/write speeds that were the same! ~179/175 MB/s!!! Of course, you get what you pay for, it's not cheap by any means. The performance is amazing, and the construction is solid and sturdy. I've used this drive to transfer anything from large work folders, my movies, my library of music, for the past 6 years, and it's never let me down or failed on me.",

      "text": "I'm very happy with this Lexar drive which I bought because of its reputation for being one of the fastest and most reliable USB 3.0 Flash drives. It performs superbly. At first though, I had a lot of trouble opening and closing the slide-out connector. On closer inspection I realized that it has a safety feature and you have to press down a little in order to push the slide. Now I know, it is easy to work. Also, it comes formatted FAT-32 and Master Boot Record partition so, if you use a Mac, I recommend using DiskUtility to erase the partition and set it up as HFS (journaled) GUID.",

If you can afford it get it!, The quality of built is very good too. Pros: - Damn Fast - Well built and elegant - Excellent packaging Cons: - Costly - Slider to hide the connector could be better",

I was pleasantly surprised by the sturdy metal shell that the USB retracts into; fit is snug and sturdy, though I haven't put it through much abuse yet. I wasn't impressed by the string that came with it, unless I did it wrong, it requires you to bend open a small ring and loop your USB around. There are easier and more sturdy ways, but this is a minor gripe.",

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\nSkyrocket4.0 out of 5 stars The FASTEST USB 3.0 on Amazon - Super quick and solidly builtReviewed in the United States on May 9, 2013Verified Purchase I was in the market for a USB 3.0 thumb drive. What I quickly found out is that all thumb drives are NOT created equal. After reading around I was zeroing in on three drives. What made me choose the Lexar was the read / write comparisons found here: [...] (Amazon - This link is very helpful for people in the market, please do not remove)\n\nWhen the Lexar arrived, I was very pleased!\n\nPros:\n* Really Really FAST - \"Mind blowing fast\" on real world file transfers on USB 3.0 both on my 13\" MacBook Pro Retina & Alienware X51. Mine scored higher then the test shown on cnet and WhoRatesIt\n* Great build quality - Aluminum back, solid retractable switch and I love how they turn the arrow into a read / write LED. Feels well built in your hand\n* Mae in the USA - I was amazed when I saw that this was made in the US; said it right on the case.\n\nCons:\n* Size (Width & Height) - This item is wide and tall. If you have a Uni-body Aluminium MacBook Pro where the two USB are side by side, you will have an issue using the second port. You might have a clearance issue on an Ultrabook.\n\nWhen I started my search I was really looking for a tiny USB flash drive like the SanDisk Cruzer Fit with USB 3.0. Unfortunately there does not seem to be any small USB 3.0 drives on the market that hit these speeds.Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Russel5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speeds!Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2018Verified Purchase I bought this USB drive back in 2012 for around $120. It's almost 2019 now, and it's still the best USB drive I've owned. I finally got around to running a speed test (after all these years) and was surprised that it actually had read/write speeds that were the same! ~179/175 MB/s!!! Of course, you get what you pay for, it's not cheap by any means. The performance is amazing, and the construction is solid and sturdy. I've used this drive to transfer anything from large work folders, my movies, my library of music, for the past 6 years, and it's never let me down or failed on me.Read more Helpful Comment Report abuse Jeremy S5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Flash DriveReviewed in the United States on August 29, 2012Verified Purchase As more and more of my computers start supporting USB 3.0 I felt it was time to replace my smaller USB 2.0 Flash drives with a single larger, faster one. I put of getting one to see what Sandisk would release but I balked and the prices Sandisk wanted for their drives. Instead, based on its reviews I chose this one. After receiving it I ran a few performance tests on both USB 2.0 ports and USB 3.0 ports. All testing was done using Crystal Disk Mark with 5 runs of 1000MB each\n\nUSB 2.0 Ports\nSandisk Cruzer 8GB (My older usb 2.0 drive)\nRead 19.45 MB/s\nWrite 4.75 MB/s\n\nLexar JumbDrive Triton\nRead 34.81 MB/s\nWrite 30.50 MB/s\n\nAs you can tell this drive offers a significant improvement even on computers without USB 3.0 ports.\n\nUSB 3.0 Ports\nLexar JumbDrive Triton\nRead 179.3 MB/s\nWrite 151.2 MB/s\n\nIt was a bit shocking how fast files transferred over USB 3.0 after being so used to slow drives and slow ports.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent speeds\n+ Attractive appearance\n+ Good solid feel\n\nCons:\n- Price?\n\nYes, this drive is more expensive per GB that others you can find but in this case I think that the adage \"You get what you pay for\" really does hold true.Read more Helpful Comment Report abuse Freddy The Frog TOP 1000 REVIEWER 5.0 out of 5 stars Fast, Fierce, Flawless... solid buildReviewed in the United States on August 15, 2012Verified Purchase I carry jump drives often for presentations and also for transferring large files (often more than 28 gigs) from one computer to another.\n\nAs my studio computers all have the blue-USB 3 connections, it only makes sense to fully exploit that capability with the fastest jump drive available.\n\nExample... transferring a 28 gig file batch was taking circa 26 minutes to load with USB-2, Using this Lexar USB 3.0, that time was under 6 minutes...\n\nEver go to give a presentation with all of your excellent work on a jump drive and then having to stand around making small talk while it loads on someone elses system?\nIf they have USB 3.0 capability and you have this jump drive, it's a load-and-go experience with video and transitions flowing seemlessly to the screen without hesitation.\n\nEven though this jumpdrive is rated at a 32 GB capacity, I can't load a full 31 GB file (not enough space)... so, I'm back today, ordering the largest version they offer.\n\nIf work flow is important and you often work under time constraints as I do... this is really the only choice for solid construction, plug and play capability and blinding fast speeds.\nOther presentors will stand around suffering from JumpDrive Envy as they witness the performance of this tiny miracle.\n\nI use it to transfer files from one computer to another for image editing and temporary storage of large files.\n\nThere isn't anything quicker you can buy, so I say go with this one if quality and speed are your top priority.\n\nThe markings on the drive are white against a shiny black background... can read the size of the drive clearly even in low light situations so you know you have the correct size (if you carry several)...\n\nIf you routinely give power point presentations in HD or need to stream Multi-Media with the convenience of pocket carry, this is it. Get One and have time for coffee....Read more Helpful Comment Report abuse Matthew T.5.0 out of 5 stars fast as lightning, worth it if you can still find oneReviewed in the United States on June 7, 2014Verified Purchase Had one of these in 16GB size for years, managed to find this 32GB still new in box and jumped on it. The 32GB size is in itself nothing special. What is special about this drive aside from it being USB 3.0 is the fact that Lexar used SLC flash chips in the Triton series. Most other USB flash drives offered today use MLC or TLC flash chips, which allow higher capacities but are slower and wear out sooner than SLC chips do. So when you see this Triton drive in 32GB at nearly the same asking price as some other 64GB drive, that is because the 64GB drive is using the lower grade MLC or TCL chips. SLC chips have, on average, a 10x longer lifespan than MLC chips. You're paying more because this drive will last longer.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States TOP INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS \nHomer5.0 out of 5 stars Blindingly fastReviewed in the United Kingdom on October 12, 2012Verified Purchase Speed tests are highly dependent upon the chipset, but on my AMD Fusion-based USB3 ports I achieved 95MB/s, which is way off the claimed 155MB/s, but still extremely fast compared to my other flash drives, most of which top out at around 8MB/s. YMMV.\n\nDefinitely recommended.Read more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

I am very happy with it, too bad SLC NAND Flash is used less and less in favor of TLC NAND Flash.Read more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.
