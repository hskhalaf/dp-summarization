Super easy to set up and use, excellent Wi-Fi that one can TURN OFF when not needed, and unbeknownst to us, only because there is no mention of this feature in the Amazon description of this router, the Medialink AC1200 has a VPN included too. So if you are turned off because this router does not show a VPN feature - it's included, Amazon just doesn't have it listed.",

I went online and researched best moderately priced WiFi boxes and this got good ratings. Right out of the box ,I had it up and running within 10 minutes. Seamless....works fine a few days later, no issues. Satisfied customer. As internet speeds increase and we use data more, it seems three years old renders most electronics obsolete, so this was much needed anyway.",

Granted, I live in a small single level home, but I can walk over to the house across the street and still maintain a good connection. Product arrived in perfect condition and on time.

Every router I've ever owned has done this reliably. If you don't care about that kind of stuff then this router is ok. If you do, then coupled with anaemic user interface, I'd give it 3 stars.",
