I can't get past the cool feeling in my mouth after eating Swerve, but I found this stuff and it's a game changer. To me, it tastes more like real sugar, and you have to use much less than Swerve, plus there's no \"cooling\" aftertaste with this as there is with Swerve. I now can bake and sometimes my family doesn't even notice it's low carb/no sugar. My 2 year old even likes a lot of my baking. I'm buying more!",

      "text": "I initially loved this product and thought Stevia was a great alternative to sugar. However, I've recently been having trouble with head aches and I figured out it's because the #1 ingredient in this is Erythritol. Erythritol (organic or not) has absolutely no known functions for the human body and the reason why it doesn\u2019t provide calories to its consumer is because the body actually can\u2019t break it down. Think twice before you purchase this it is NOT 100% pure stevia! I've been battling migraines for a week now and just figured out it's because I put this in my tea every day. Stay away if you care about your health and look up the side effects.",

      "text": "I've been using SweetLeaf stevia drops, for my coffee, which worked to satisfy my need for sweetness in my coffee, but always left a bit of an after taste. With Pyure, I don't notice any after taste. It's not an exact flavor replacement, but it's close enough, and takes half the scoops. Since I'm currently on the Keto diet, and can't use regular sugar, this is definitely the answer for sweetening my coffee",
