I guess they need to move their current inventory and are looking for more suckers. Oh well.",

Battery doesn't last that long when charged and has to be plugged in a USB port to charge. A huge hassle. 2. Screen contrast is awfull. If you have any vision issues at all this screen will be almost impossible to see. The buttons are fairly easy to use and the sound is good. But with the other problems I would skip this model and find one a little more user friendly. I still like Sansa just not this one.",

The ScanDisk Sansa c250 does anything that the lower-end iPod does and much more. The Sansa is user-friendly and sounds great, just like an iPod. However, try as you might, you won't find an iPod for the price of the Sansa with an FM radio, a user-replacable battery (the iPod must be sent back to Apple), the ability to record voice and an expandable memory with the addition of a memory card. For the money you can't go wrong with the Sansa c250.",

The only drawbacks are, you have to hook it up to the computer in order to charge it or delete songs. You can only have one playlist at a time. In order to hook it up to anything other than a computer, you'll need to buy a different cable. But overall I love my SanDisk Sansa MP3 player.",

The other issue I have it even the lowest volume setting is too loud, especially for a child. I guess in hind site I should have loved her more and purchased the Nano.",
