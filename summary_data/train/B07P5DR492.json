Now I'm more than capable of just using it as is to do the job needed, but seriously if this made it past not only a machine but a person with eyes (I mean hell a person with 1 eye)could have seen this was faulty. Thankfully I have an air chuck already that this tire inflation gun is just for show anyways. Don't order this for the tire inflation device, the hose though worth it. But BOOOOOOOOO just BOOOOOOOOO.",
