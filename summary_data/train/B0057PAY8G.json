Once I figured where to click to save a webpage to Pocket (the ... icon in the top right of any Silk page, and then the \"Send to\" option), it's quick and easy to save pages. Gives a cleaner read than the Silk's Reading View which often saves ads as well and doesn't deal well with sites using frames and popups, as well as making stuff available to other devices. Works offline, too, though obviously the Kindle with the app open needs to be connected to the internet for long enough to download new pages, which took a few seconds to do.",

Before you read this offline you need to contact to the internet to get the c content you saved, which makes sense. But what doesn't make sense is connecting to the internet again for the same content you checked would be available offline before you disconnected the WiFi. Defeats the point of reading offline if you need to go online to reload it. Apart from that flaw it looks good, just what you might like to read offline material if it worked.",

      "text": "Even though I got this on FAOTD, I would still have paid the $2.99 for this. This app is great. I have the additional plug-ins installed in Firefox and Chrome so that I can tag something with RIL and read it on any of my computers or on my phone. This is a very convenient app to have installed on your Android phone especially if you like to start reading something on your PC then take it with you to finish up on your phone will commuting home or something. I have used the send to email feature and it worked without any issues as expected. I love this app.",

I also find it a good reference for showing someone an item that is interesting to both of us, and it's really been useful for saving recipes or instructions for making craft items. Some content, such as articles on Facebook for example, may not be saved in their entirety, but there is usually a link to help find it again. I use this app a lot, and have never had a problem with it. Love it!",

I am guessing that other apps work the same and save either the link or whole article. I just came across Pocket and it worked. I have not been able to organize in files what I save. The filter is by most recent. As I add articles, the list grows longer and more confusing. But for what it does, it works great. We are traveling to Europe and are not sure we will have WiFi all the time. I am using a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".",
