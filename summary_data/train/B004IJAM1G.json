Fits a bag, can be hung and has the fork end. All great. The screw connectors are plastic and were loose almost every use. I would tighten and move over. Well, this one time I tighten it with ONE HAND, I like flicked my wrist to get it back in place and it snapped off. It was the pole for the bucket so I can't hang it up anymore which is the most annoying part. I will be duct tapping all joints which I suggest from the start.",

Even easy to store as there is a bracket on the main handle to attach the rake when you are done for the day. I looped a plastic bag full of empty plastic bags over the handle when storing and keep my gardening gloves in there too.",

The problem is that the sections are continually coming loose (unscrewing), which means that while you're trying to scoop up waste, you're also trying to keep the thing together. When the sections start unscrewing, the scoop section and the container section spin around and occasionally fall off, spilling the contents back onto the ground. Dealing with this is a constant battle. They need to incorporate a simple click-lock mechanism on the end of each section. That would eliminate the problem and make this device about a thousand times more useful.",
