It was manufactured in 2009 and might have been sitting for a while with the previous owner. The LCD screen has some small spots and light areas. I am able to use it but wanted to use it as a gift, which I can not do now. The pictures come out great but if this were a first camera for someone, they might have an issue.",

Excellent pictures on full auto, plenty of scope if you need to add some manual options, good videos even with decent sound. Some cool unexpected features like exposure bracketing for HDR (High Dynamic Range)picture construction sequences. Fast startup, fast focus, lots of options relatively light on the batteries. I got this as a spare camera to my Fuji SLR and my wife's Lumix, after a vacation using all 3 cameras, the Kodak ones were turning out consistently superior so it quickly became our main camera!",

      "text": "The Kodak Easy Share Z915 is an excellent camera, especially for those amateurs out there with a desire to start taking better photos. The focus on the camera is really good for objects close up, and the camera takes remarkable motion shots outside in natural light. However indoors, under unnatural light, motion produces undesirable blur. Also, another negative is that the camera eats up batteries. A little bonus, however, is that the camera can take videos with sound. The sound of the videos is of good quality; it does not have a tinny or bottle sound. All in all, the Easy Share Z915 is a splendid camera for a beginner who hopes to improve his/her photographic skills!",

Although I've owned a Kodak Easy Share camera before, this one seems to have a win or lose outcome with the pictures it produces. Some pictures come out supersharp while others are washed out, blurry and all out too dark to see. Also seems to produce red eye in just about every picture. Some are correctable while a lot of others simply turn the red into bright yellow. Totally unacceptable! Next time, I'll spend the extra $ and purchase a Nikon or Canon.",

Everybody who sees my photos raves about how crisp and clear they are, even when zoomed way in, using the optical zoom. However, I don't care for the additional digital zoom - it makes the pics look very grainy - so I use it as little as possible. I bought my first one a few months ago for less than $120, a real bargain at the time, and just bought my second for less than $90. An amazing bargain.",

But otherwise a great little camera...now that Kodak \"easyshare\" software is another story. I uninstalled that 2 days after loading it. Derek",

Just a good overall camera and the user interface is about the best out there.",
