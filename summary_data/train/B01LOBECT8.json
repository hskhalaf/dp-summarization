I am writing the review now, because I just used it for a motorcycle ride on an unusually cool (60 deg.) July morning. My leather would be too warm, and this jacket was perfect. What makes is work is the fit, and the wrist and waist bands. It was the perfect weight, but also the perfect wind breaker. This is an extremely versatile jacket that looks great and wears well.",
