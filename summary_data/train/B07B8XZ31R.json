My granddaughter seems to love getting in her own play space, where the velcro tabs give her \"privacy\". Only complaint from my son was the assembly directions were a little vague. Still a great item. The owners of the comapny were also amazing. I messed up the order and they worked with me to solve all issues with great patience. A++",

I had some issues setting it up not cause it was hard but lack of sleep and lack of coffee will do that to you. It is very spacious! Both my daughter and I fit in it along with 10 stuffed animals, 5 pillows and a partridge in a pear tree. It\u2019s fun to play in or even sleep in. I have had a sleep deprived mom nap in there a few times. I am very happy with this purchase!",
