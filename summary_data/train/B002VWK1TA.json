Today I called the manufacture and asked about a replacement wheel. It would cost me about $97. The wheelchair is going to the dump tomorrow.",

The rented wheelchair was difficult to maneuver through a tight \"dog leg\" bedroom entry, and while strong, it was a struggle to lift into the SUV. I decided to chance the 18\" Blue Streak wheelchair, and both my wife and I are impressed. It's lighter, narrower, and easier to maneuver. The construction is good, and the features compare with more expensive chairs. Note that my wife is less than 140 lbs, and relatively thin. For a larger, heavier passenger, I would suggest a bigger, stronger, chair.",

It cant handle being ridden over pavement without permanently damaging the thing. I was at a convention and it decided that it was going to start pulling to the right. I checked it out and couldnt find a problem. Then plastic just started breaking off everywhere. It was a horrible situation. By the time I found my fiancee, my left hand was blistered and bruised and I passed out crying from all the exertion. Some plastic got stuck in the wheel. We could never find the problem!!",

      "text": "I purchased this wheelchair to allow me to transport my 86 year old mother safely when I take her to doctor's visits. I have been very disappointed with its functionality. Mechanically speaking it was almost impossible to close once you opened it. Finally I had to lubricate the left arm shaft to allow it to move up and down freely. Since I have only had to use it once I am not sure how well it will function long term. You would think that the manufacturer would confirm that the chair works properly before shipping it. I am being kind to give it a 2-star rating.",

I do notice that as I'm pushing it (I purchased it for my mother) that there is a little wiggling in the frame when going over bumps, but it doesn't necessarily feel unsteady. There is plenty of room for my mother (approx. 140lbs) as well as my three year old daughter. The ride is pretty smooth, and it doesn't feel like an olympic workout pushing it, even uphill. The fabric is easy to clean, and the little pouch on the back is a nice touch for keeping necessary supplies, such as kleenex, house keys, etc. Definitely worth investing in, the price wasn't exorbitantly high so it is a wise choice.",

Also, I had to replace the first arrival (Amazon was great about this). Due to a manufacturing defect, the hole for one of the wheel brakes had been drilled in the wrong place and was impossible to adjust. All is well with the replacement and we are happy wheelers!",
