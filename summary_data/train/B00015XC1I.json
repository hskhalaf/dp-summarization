This vitamin A comes from retinyl palmitate, the mildest retinol, and beta-carotene. I have noticed softer and smoother skin. Note, vitamin A and its derivatives, even topically, are know tetragens. I do not recommend for any women pregnant or that could become pregnant. I think any person who could become pregnant to get their vitamin A from food sources. With any supplement, please check with your doctor before using. Other than pregnant women, I recommend this product for overall health and skin health.",
