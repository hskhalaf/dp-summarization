      "text": "I have had so many floor lamps over the years and I've always been disappointed with their quality. Not only is this one attractive but it has great lighting for reading and the two small lamps can easily be adjusted so it can change the mood in the room. With all three lights on, it's almost better than a ceiling light. Some of the reviews for this lamp mentioned the \"cheap looking\" plastic lamp shades but I don't find them looking cheap at all. In fact, they look like glass unless you're sitting next to the lamp and are scrutinizing them. It has a modern look but is also a transitional style that works well with my southwest decor.",

The kicker is I have the light plugged into the wall switch, so it's always in the \"on\" position and the actual switch itself isn't being turned, so we can't figure out how or why the switch itself has gone bad.

I put some light oil on the outside of the screw element. Important that it was the outside because I didn't want to have oil on the electrical wire and possibly deteriorate it over time. After some doing, I got the two segments assembled, plus the rest of the lamp. It is a NICE lamp and works well.",

Also, the shades are a little short for most bulbs, which causes the light bulb to show outside of the shade. I do like that each light can be turned on independently of the others. I also have it placed between a desk and a reading chair, so that I have a light for each purpose. It is situated in my home office/study, and is a good fit for utilitarian furnishings.",
