One chunk on my toe was lost entirely and other parts cracked and began to peel away. Totally unacceptable and it was too late to return to Amazon. I moved up to the Durand series which is about $30 more expensive and has a solid sole/tread. They're more durable but not as comfortable. I think next set I'll try Merril or another brand.",

Boots have a nice, wide toe box, good lacing, reasonably water proof as I have submerged the boots close to the top in mud, and stitching has not come loose. I have two pair. One for hiking and the second I wear at work five days a week where they get a real workout and still comfortable at the end of the day. I really like these boots.",

I was also walking through a mowed pasture and got a 5\" twig through the sole in one of the soft spots and out the top, narrowly missing my foot. The problems are on opposite ends. I really like them, but they fall short on lasting and light protection. If they didn't have these issues, I would never buy a different boot.",

Have not really put them through the paces nor exposed to conditions requiring the waterproofing but I have no reason to believe they won't perform as expected. I considered many other brands and styles but so many others looked like winter boots vs a year-round boot that could be worn just about anywhere with a pair of jeans without looking ridiculous. Price was awesome at the time - paid about 30% less than I would have at local REI.",
