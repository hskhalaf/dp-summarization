That's all fine and good except this thing game to me folded 4 times, into 8 sections. The rubber just isn't meant to be folded this way, seriously. It might flatten over time, but these creases are just never going to be quite right and this packing/storage will make this thing deteriorate faster than it needs should. It smells like chemicals but not so overpowering that I can't tolerate it, but I guess that's to be expected. Still... those creases....",
