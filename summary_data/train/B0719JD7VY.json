I'm pretty savvy and understand directions well, but this thing has screw in places that can't be reached with a socket, which is what you need to tighten the bolts with no wrench, which one was not provided. The Kick stand doesn't go together well either. When you push the bolt through the top part and push out the holder casing, the bolt will no longer go in. So that feature is basically useless because we couldn't install it. For such an expensive machine from a high end manufacturer, these issues should not exist. Seriously, bolts behind a metal bar?

      "text": "Treadmill arrived after confusing delivery schedule and left damage to the walls as they brought into the house. Assembly techs were amazing, called ahead, arrived on time and assembled quickly. The Treadmill C700 however worked for three days and has no power day four. Called Nordic's customer service and they offered little customer service. Stuck only to a script offering only to order part 7-10 business days to receive and then the tech would need to schedule appt. Amazon has been amazing trying to offer support and run interference, however at the end of the day Nordic Track C 700 Treadmill sits. Business day #9 and no communication yet from Nordic Track, not off to a good start :(",

We contacted NordicTrack at that time and to date have not heard from them other than to say they received our email and will contact us. I contacted Amazon today and since we are out of the 90 day Amazon warranty period they can only try to help us get in touch with Nordic Track warranty services. We chose this unit because it has a small footprint and we wanted a simple basic unit for walking. The size works, but at this time, that's it!",

Yup the treadmill will not work until you have given them a credit card number.... no really.... before you can ever use it in the hopes you forget to cancel just so they can charge you $144 after your 1 month free trial is up. this is absurd! i do not recommend doing business with a company that would do something so scummy. 0 stars",
