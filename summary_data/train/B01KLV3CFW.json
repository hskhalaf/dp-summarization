However, for some reason they were more expensive here on Amazon then this version. After ordering one, I was very skeptical at first because I was not a big fan of the pocket at the bottom and thinking that the size seemed smaller than the 2.0 style. To my surprise, while this bag may not seem sleek when full, it has a larger capacity size than the previous model. Overall, I am very satisfied with this bag and would buy another one.",
