There is barely a scent which I love! Compared to the clean compact powder, I love the loose powder better. As always, Amazon ships quickly and safely. I don't like using higher end powders because CoverGirl gives very similar reults for a much better price. I would suggest getting a lighter color than what you use because it is a little darker than I expected but it's fine because it's the summer and I'm more tan.",
