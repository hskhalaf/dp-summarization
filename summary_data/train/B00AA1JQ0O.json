Completed install and went to fire up the compressor and the compressor does not run properly not pumping air into the tank. I am very dissapointed with this product. This was my second experience with this system and basically the same result where the tank was not being charged by the compressor. I wish the customer service and quality control was better with this system. I really like the design and appearance of this system with sleek design and compact unit. As of now I would not recommend this product to anyone.",

The only complaint I have about the kit is the length of air line it comes with...13'. That isn't near enough if you mount the compressor in the rear and the horns in the front.

      "text": "When I first opened the box everything was packaged well, the compressor legs were fine. Really the only thing i needed to install it was some 16ga.wire and connectors, everything else needed was there. On the package it says compressor shuts off at 108psi but it actually shuts off at 125 which is kinda nice. Its very very loud. Build quality seems up to par. Might want to think about superglueing or using poly loctite so the horns dont come unscrewed from the housing. Other than that seems like an awesome bang for buck. I love it especially for 200 compared to others.",
