I have had hernia surgery and I am now able to do exercises that I had been struggling to do. I am uncoordinated so it is taking me a while to get used to using something that moves with me.

You just need ceiling hooks, a chin up bar (we used to get started), or a nice tree to hang it on. I would recommend this seller and brand. Michael reached out to make sure everything was going well.

I am returning it for a arial silk yoga hammock, but I want to make it clear the product itself is well designed, made and sturdy. The fabric alone is why I wouldn't recommend this to someone unless they know 100% they have tolerance to stiff fabric.",
