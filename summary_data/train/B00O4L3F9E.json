Those tuners were very slow, finicky and difficult to get a clear reading on. This thing finds the note instantly and tells you exactly where you are in a split second. It also registers the B string on my 5-string bass just as well as the other strings without having to hit the harmonic at the twelfth fret. Very happy with it on initial use.

Otherwise, excellent tuner and much easier to use than a couple of other tuners I have used.",

The tuning is precise, and the batteries last a long time. I find it as accurate and adjustable as the Snark, which is a great tuner but invariably breaks within months because of the design flaw (it uses a ball-and-socket rotation, but the plastic holding the head to the ball joint is VERY weak). I would happily buy this again.",

      "text": "I bought this tuner for my oud. For years I\u2019ve been using older, disposable battery-operated clip-on tuners with varying accuracy and battery life. This one is very sensitive, and so much more accurate. I have only used it for the first time after the initial charge, so I can\u2019t speak for its battery life just yet, but in case I do run out of juice, I don\u2019t need to go looking for a battery anymore. I can just recharge via USB. The compact size makes it unbtrusive, and the display is bright and easy to read. I love this tuner.",

So mission accomplished, it worked very well.",

A couple of my guitars have custom headstocks that I modified and have very little area for the clip to grab onto but the KLIQ actually stays on them and doesn't fall off. The screen is so easy to see and read plus it has a few modes to choose from like chromatic, guitar, violin and bass guitar. I also like that the clamp has rubber in it to protect from slipping and/or scratching the headstock.",

Don't get me wrong, they are definitely on to something here. It just isn't there yet.",
