For little toddler hands that carry it around, this is frustrating when they just want to show you the funny face they made, but the pieces all fall out on the walk over to show it off!",

Otherwise, it is one set of ears, one pair of eyes, a nose and a hat. No room for creative play by having lots of pieces and even my 2 year old knows where eyes, ears, nose and mouth go. She put it together once. There is no reason to play it again. Definitely a waste of money.",
