There is not serial number for the part itself, only the unit. So I bought a new valve for $114 and unit still not working. Took unit to my local pool dealer. They cannot get to work either and gave up trying to get through to customer service. Returning the unit for avrefund. Will not deal with this company again.",

Then, finally, I decided to buy a new one. Exact same model. After only two years I have bearings falling apart because they are completely corroded. Most screws have signs of corrosion too. The odd thing is, that not all parts are corroded. It just seems that they had crappy batches of parts that are not made from stainless steel, as they should be in a chlorine environment. I still had spare parts from my old Polaris 360 and they look so much better after all those years!",

There is also an indication that it has been opened and worked on previously, as two lock washers were missing, but there were indentations in the plastic where they were once installed. It would appear Polaris sells their defective equipment on Amazon, or they have no quality control whatsoever. Either way, I am the owner of an underwater paper weight.

I always replaced the other brands with the 280 when they stop working. The Polaris 280 out-performed them all. You can buy fancier Polaris cleaners with more bells, horns and whistles but, for my money, the 280 is the most reliable, cost-effective and best working of them all.",
