The materials are good quality, it is well made, style is cute but the bottom line is, if you are looking for comfort, this is the shoe for you.",

The shoe has simple, clean lines with the flexibility of dark colored laces to better fit your foot. The dark metallic gray leather is trendy but still a neutral. My issue was with the \"Laser\" sole. The product description states the sole is rubber. In my experience usually rubber soles are quiet. However, I found walking around my house the sole was both noisy and too stiff. Perhaps a different insole/orthotic could help but at this price point I did not want to buy a new insole.",

The only problem was that it didn't look \"dressy\" enough for work (shoelaces and suede). I then went to Timberland Pro which I loved but evidently those shoes have been discontinued. Now in search of a replacement for my Timberland shoes and then I remembered Mephisto. I searched and found this shoe (yes, it has shoelaces but it's not suede.) I wore this pair on a 9-hour shift and had no problems with my feet hurting or anything. A real plus!",

The support is not as expected at all. I can't wear these for extended periods, not enough arch support and the sides give too much slack. My feet don't breathe well in these shoes either. I can get more support out of a FitFlop brand than these...",

My 6.5 size was true to form, and the width was perfect. Also, this shoe gives great arch support. This is my first pair of Mephisto shoes, and I will be ordering more styles in the future.

    "description": "Walking shoe with mephisto soft air technology.SIZING: Both feet should be measured, as most people have one foot which is larger than the other. It\u2019s also a good idea to measure your feet at the end of the day as they are usually slightly larger at that time\n\nDon't stress yourself! (At least while you're walking anyway.) The leather Laser lace-up from Mephisto is designed for simple, no-nonsense comfort and support, perfect for power commuting, dog walking and errand running. A removable insole adds extra cushioning and shock absorbtion, while the thick rubber bottom lends reliable traction even on slippery surfaces.\n\nMephisto makes some of the finest walking shoes on earth. Their comfort, support and durability are recognized wherever people are serious about walking. For more than three decades, Mephisto has been on the forefront of walking-shoe innovation. Mephisto\u2019s natural products are handmade of leather, latex, cork and rubber.\n\nSee more",
