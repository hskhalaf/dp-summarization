This rinsed off clean. Just ordered my second box. My husband and I both love this product! Second order arrived right on time. Love the fast easy service! For those saying it goes too fast I recommend don't let the water run over the bar. Wet your body and step out of the stream of water to suds up your body or washcloth. Remember coconut oil is solid at room temperature, but turns into a liquid at body temperature. Hot water speeds up that process.",

I like to put the bars out to let them harden up a bit, but this one's fragrance was overwhelming to me. I eventually had to put it in my garage because it was too much in any part of my living space! But after letting the bars harden in the garage, I like the soap a lot - and actually like the fragrance now that it's not so strong.",

It is a bar, but it's awesome. Skin feels great, don't need as much lotion on most areas. Leaves me refreshed and smooth. Plus does leave a clean soft smell. I also bought the lemongrass bars as well. I am interested in trying others since they have differing ingredients. But the made me a believer. Great stuff",

These bars are on the small side, but get a soap dish/mat and keep it away from the shower stream, they should last. I keep mine outside the shower, not sure how much that actually helps though.",
