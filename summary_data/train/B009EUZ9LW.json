The second time I tried sprinkling a small amount on both of my dogs\u2019 food, they both vomited and then were both constipated for 3-4 days. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, but I won\u2019t use this product on my dogs ever again. Very disappointing after reading all the great reviews.",

In lieu of going the full enzyme supplementation route, I decided to try these digestion aids. He has gained 11 pounds since we began adding this to his food. I suggest incubating the product in slightly-warmed pumpkin prior to adding to your dog's regular meal to ensure full absorption. A note about EPI: This condition can occur in other breeds, but most commonly in GSD's. If your dog is chronically underweight despite high-quality food, please consider asking your vet to test for the condition. (Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency). You can find out more about this condition at EPI4dogs dot com.",
