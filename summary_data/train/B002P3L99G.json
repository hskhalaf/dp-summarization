I've also seen a GREAT improvement on the size of my pores. This cleanser is easy to work on your face, there's no odor, no tingling or tightness. I highly recommend this product along with the moisturizer.",

I have frequent breakouts and have seen dermatologists that keep trying different medications. This product seemed to help. I've been using it for about 5 months. Make sure to give it some time to work so you can get the full effects from it (a couple of months). The price compared to stores is great as well.",
