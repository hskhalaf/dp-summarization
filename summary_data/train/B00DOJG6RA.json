The first month I used them, I just guessed when I should ovulate and I started testing and reading the strips myself which they are easy to read but was not successful the first month. The second month I started testing right after my period and downloaded the app that comes with the kit and it reads the strips for you and tells you when you peak. So the first month that I tested everyday and used the app, I conceived. Currently 6 weeks and couldn\u2019t be more excited. I highly recommend this kit and to use the app because it is extremely easy and helpful.",

The results were accurate, infact we ordered same kit for our second baby too, luckily we were able to conceive in the first month itself. I highly recommend this test kit for anyone who is planning to conceive. One suggestion is that try to run the tests in the morning when you wake up, because the hormones are concentrated and get a better and reliable results. If you drink plenty of water and test it then the line will be lighter.",

I like the app that comes with it too! My only complaint is the pregnancy tests. I got a very, very, very faint positive so I took another one. Also very faint positive. Both were taken with first pee of the day. At about 10:30 I took two from the store and they were clearly positive. Granted, I was only 7 DPO so maybe they\u2019re just not good for early detection. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase! It helps for sure!",
