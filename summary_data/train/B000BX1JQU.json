When I went to put the bits in the included tool holder, the holes in the holder are too small for the premium bits. Setup was a bit fussy, but once the mortise is defined, cutting is a breeze. At first, I was concerned about the wheels that hold the workpiece to the fence but they worked fine. The hold down is bothersome. Powermatic has room for improvement on this feature.",

There's not one thing I don't like about it, very smooth operation. It was aligned and ready to roll out of the box.

I love it and glad I spent the extra dough and won't have to worry about fiddling around with a lesser quality machine. If it's out of your price range you should save up a little more and buy this thing, bad to the bone.",

Upon delivery the plastic button was popped out and would not go back into its socket do to the location of the wires. I eventually got it half in... Also, I could not get the handle to sit anywhere but awkward. Probably could be adjusted in some way, but I could not figure it out. Besides the button, build quality is good. Also, probably from me not reading the description thoroughly, but this does not come with any bits like shown in the picture as I had thought. All in all, for the money I feel I could have gotten a better product.",

I hate looking at it and feel stupid for spending $400 for a pain in the neck paper weight, dust collector.",
