If you don't have a friend who can do this, however, I recommend you get a different broom",

Otherwise it causes the bristles to want to bend. Also the bristles to flare out with wear. Just like any other room. I like it that it's very narrow. And fairly lightweight. But not worse the money in the long run. Also, the broom comes into pieces with a rubber gasket of sorts where the two pieces go together. After a few months at peace became brittle and broke. My husband was able to reattach the pieces. Hoping I can find a replacement gasket. Very disappointing for the price.",

It's about 2/3 the width of a regular broom, so it requires more sweeping to cover the same amount of floor space. The bristles don't have any give, so you can't make them spread out to cover more space. It's actually a total pain in the neck to sweep with! But, it sure looks pretty! I regret spending $39.99, that's for sure!",
