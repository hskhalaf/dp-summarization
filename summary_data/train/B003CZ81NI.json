My only regret is that I did not purchase one of the larger sets that included 2 types of nippers. This set does not include nippers.",

I like that the cases come in different colors and textures so you can add a bit of personalizing to your grooming kit. It's put together really well and it's something that will last for a long time if you take care of it.",
