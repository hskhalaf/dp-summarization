Over the years of buying I can count how many useless tiny ones we have. Not so with these very evenly distributed",

These containers are sturdy and wash up great in the dishwasher. And there are so many in the set. In fact I shared some with a family member after seeing how many there really was. I definitely recommend them.",

I do recommend these bowls and lids. There were two broken bowls, which is understandable because of way they were shipped. Considering the value and price paid, I do not have a problem in reccommending them.",

When I need a smaller size, I have that option too. The lids fit tight and the stuff inside stays fresher longer",
