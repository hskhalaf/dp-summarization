I had this material for my cosleeper and loved it, so I was thrilled to find this for my pack and play, which my baby is sleeping in now (with an upgraded mattress).",

I will add one of those clips with the elastic straps to hold the middle tight because my grand-daughter likes to tug on things and I can see her being able to pull the sheet off if she wanted to. The added center strap will prevent that.",
