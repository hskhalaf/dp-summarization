My only complaint is that pressing the \"MAX\" button causes the decibel reading to spike into the 50's usually. This is a problem when the maximum sound level I want to test is below 50 dB. I believe this problem is caused by the microphone somehow picking up the noise or vibrations from the button as its being pressed. Sometimes I can fix this problem by simply pressing the \"MAX\" button slowly and gently.",

      "text": "I purchased this sound level meter to use with my patients at work. I have a more accurate (much more expensive) meter in another office, but just wanted something portable to use in conjunction with my voice therapy exercises to improve volume. This works great, as it gives visual feedback on vocal intensity and eliminates the need for me to keep reminding patients to be louder or softer (depending on the issue). Pros: -Affordable -Portable and good quality Cons: -Prone to picking up ambient noise -Not as accurate for short bursts of sound",
