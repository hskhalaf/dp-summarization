I cannot, though careful typing, enter a 16 letter password correctly more than 30% of the time. Worst of all, after just a few months of light use, the g key completely broke, no longer getting detected. Overall, not worth it.",

But if you need to reboot a damaged computer or input Mac commands, the Mac does not respond to all commands because the Sungwoo is designed for Windows computers. Maybe this is true only on some models of the Mac (e.g., older macs) but it is annoying, since one advantage of a wired keyboard is that it is active even if the computer is dying, whereas a BT keyboard might not be recognized by a dying computer.",

      "text": "The main advantage is the product's portability (hence, more than one star). Nonetheless, it's not very usable, as you have to hit the keys very hard to get the result on the screen. Also, be aware that sometimes some keys will stop working - the official way to fix this as recommended by the producer is is to roll it, grab by the thick part (where the cable is), and flap it around. It does solve the problem, but you still have to hit the keys very hard. It's OK if portability is what you seek... AND if you are not planning to write a book using it. :)",
