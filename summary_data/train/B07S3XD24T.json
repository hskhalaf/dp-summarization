Per another review where they did not load Windows on SSD drive - perhaps that was an error or maybe they changed because of that review - but my computer came with Windows loaded on the SSD drive - very quick loading. Computer arrived promptly and in very good shape. Have 2 monitors attached, no issues. Speed is great for what I'm using for - personal and work. At this point, extremely happy with this purchase. Will update later if I have any issues.",

I was informed that many of the Refurbished systems are actually NEW over manufactured machines sitting in a warehouse needing to be moved out at all cost. As long as Dell can move them out and recover their basic cost; and keep the staff busy (so not to lay anyone off) they are satisfied.",

To top things off, the network card failed, so back to Costco it went. This machine fits my workspace and replaces my previous Inspiron 3647, a slightly larger machine than this one, but one which had considerably slowed down over the years, in spite of refreshing it a few times. Having Windows, MS Office, and other critical apps on the SDD C:/ drive speeds up everything considerably, with my numerous Access databases on the 1TB HDD. Starts up cold in a matter of seconds, not minutes. Love it!",
