The shoes were lasting a few weeks, at most. As others have also reported, they would develop cracks in the heel, the upper would separate from the lower, the insole would press right through into the back of heel, warping the heel. The company sent me a replacement pair, those were defective before I ever put them on (the heel was separating). They sent another replacement. Those lasted a few months of occasional use, and now have the same problem. The company refuses to do anything more.",

I liked them so much that when it was time for some new black oxfords, I decided to buy the same shoe. That was a mistake. While they look and fit just as well as the old ones, the construction quality has obviously declined. Within the first couple months (outside the manufacturer warranty and Amazon return window, of course) the air cushions in both shoes have burst. Every step is accompanies by a loud rush of air from the soles. My older brown ones are still going strong. My advice: Steer clear unless they bring their quality back up.",

For the first pair, I started having issues with the heel of the shoe about five months after purchasing them - I wear these every day, so part of me expected erosion of the rubber heel, which eventually started letting water into the shoe itself on rainy days. I threw them out, and bought a second pair a month ago - and the heel, on the same right shoe, is completely coming apart from the rest of the shoe. For the price I spent on these, I would expect some level of quality - Dockers clearly doesn't know what the word means.",

It does not do this with my left foot and I have never had this issue before with any other shoe. Maybe this means the shoe is slightly too large for me. Otherwise I like the look and feel of the shoes; I just have to walk a little differently when wearing them in order to prevent this silly sound from occurring.",

I have always liked them and that's why I tried a second pair of these. Not again. They look really good, but they are never comfortable.

When it breaks completely I'll have a problem because the laces are unique for Dockers. It'll be hard finding a match. The upper part of the shoes is still in decent shape.
