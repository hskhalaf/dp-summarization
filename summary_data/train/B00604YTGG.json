As almost all the features and gives me a touch of buyer's remorse for first getting the Lumix G85 for almost 1000 when this is so similar in features and functions at almost 1 tenth the price as I bought an \"acceptable\" used one from Amazon Warehouse for $127. Only has 3 small nicks one side. The rest is immaculate. The only features I wish it had was the \"focus peaking\" and in body image stabilization my G85 has. But I guess neither was available back when this model was released. Still would greatly recommend to anyone.",

Both performed excellently. The built quality is very solid. The size is so small that I can carrying it in the pocket of my coat, even with a 25mm f1.4 lens on. When used, the camera grip seems a bit shallow and small. One has to be careful not dropping it. Another disadvantage is that one could accidentally trigger the display button (on the top right hand button) easily. Other than those, it is a fine camera of excellent quality. I would highly recommend it to anyone.",

JPGs are good, and I have raw files to play with. I am committed to the 4/3 equipment due to it's small size and capable performance. Panasonic is great.",

The camera is a bit too large to carry around in a purse but it is just the right size to carry around to special events or vacations. I'm not an expert at taking pictures. Now that I have this camera, I get a lot more good pictures than I got with a point and shoot. But, I also still get a lot of blurry ones, too. It's probably the operator, not the camera. I have my eye on a better zoom lens. I like the fact that lenses are interchangeable.",

Since I'm not a professional photographer, a camera like this is good enough and it has all different effects that I was looking for.

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX1 16 MP Micro 4/3 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD Touch Screen Body Only (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:Silver| Style:Body OnlyPanasonic Lumix DMC-GX1 16 MP Micr4/3 Compact System Camera with 3-Inch Touch-Screen LCD Body Only (Silver)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\nPanasonic Lumix DMC-GX1 16 MP Micro 4/3 Compact System Camera\n\nSuperb Image Quality and Performance Combined with a Premium Design\nPanasonic is pleased to announce the addition of the DMC-GX1 interchangeable lens system camera as part of the LUMIX G Micro System as part of the new premium mirror-less line up - DMC-GX1 featuring high image quality and stunning performance in both response and function.\n\nLUMIX G Micro System realizes high-quality photo images with real-to-life details through excellent resolution, image rendering and color reproduction. Taking full advantage of the 16.0-megapixel Live MOS sensor and Venus Engine, images to be shot in low-lit situations at max. 12800 high ISO sensitivity setting is stunningly clear with highly sharp resolution.\n\nPrecision Contrast AF system of LUMIX G Micro System gains even higher speed realizing approx. 0.09 second of Light Speed AF.* Consecutive shooting is also improved for 4.2 fps in 16.0-megapixel full resolution.\n\nThe DMC-GX1 records 1920 x 1080 full-HD video with stereo sound in AVCHD format which is superior in both compression efficiency and friendliness with AV equipment for playback. Advanced AF system including practical full-time AF and tracking AF is available in video recording so that every photographer can enjoy high quality video recording with minimum ease.\n\nAs a camera from the new premium line of LUMIX G Micro System, the external design of the camera has been developed with no compromising on grip, dial, coating - everything to detail. The hot shoe on the top lets you attach the optional tilt-shift Live View Finder (DMW-LVF2) of approx. 1.4x (approx. 0.7x**), 1,440,000-dot equivalent, 100% field of view. It is now compatible with UHS-I standard for the SDXC/SDHC Memory Card taking its advantage to extend performance.\n\nAvailable in silver and black, the DMC-GX1 offers luxurious comfort in shooting experience with a stunning performance and a host of functions, to be a great partner that is always in your sight, in your mind.\n\n* The time for focusing on the subject is measured with LUMIX G X VARIO PZ 14-42mm / F3.5-5.6 ASPH. / POWER O.I.S (H-PS14042) to move the lens position to \"2m\" from \"infinity\" position. The zoom position is in wide end. Panasonic measurement method\n\n** 35mm camera equivalent\n\nHigh Image Quality for an Interchangeable Lens System Camera \nLUMIX G Micro System realizes high-quality photo images with real-to-life details through excellent resolution, image rendering and color reproduction; high-grade lens and precision AF achieves high resolution, optimal balance of resolution and noise reduction achieves lifelike image rendering and high precision auto exposure and white balance with live light metering results in the faithful color reproduction.\n\nThe 16.0-megapixel Live MOS sensor plays a big role in high quality image rendering. With the dedicated circuit which reads out signals with minimum noise, the level of noise is significantly suppressed by more than 66%. Notably max. ISO 12800 is available with DMC-GX1. In shooting at high ISO setting, S/N value is improved by approx. 200% compared with the conventional 12.1-megapixel sensor. The sensor performance improves by 6db at ISO 3200 and max. 9db at ISO 6400, resulting in the dramatically flawless picture without noise.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the high-speed signal processing with its 3 CPUs, the image processor Venus Engine boasts its excellent performance with an adoption of noise reduction technology for even higher quality of image. By separating chromatic noise from luminance noise even more accurately by applying the optimal noise reduction to each, you can capture clear and beautiful images even when shooting at high ISO sensitivity levels. By preventing the color mixture which tended to occur around the edges, any chromatic noise, not only in the gradation part but also in the edge part, are described clearly. The engine also provides selective noise reduction to the outline part to let it have more naturally-balanced curve without deterioration of the resolution. In addition, the spot-type noise which can be often seen in the dark area of the picture taken in low light situation or color bleeding on high luminance area generated by the chromatic aberration. Details are kept by optimum synthesizing of the data which is processed with resolution-priority for edge part and NR-priority for smooth part of a picture*. The result is a picture with stunning clarity if shot in low-lit situations. Furthermore, optimization of the parameter contributes to the increase of resolution.\n\n\n\n* In a single shot at ISO3200 or higher. Not available with iA and iA Plus mode \n\nAdvanced AF System \nAll cameras of LUMIX G Micro System adopt Contrast AF for its focus system. The Phase-difference AF system is susceptible to mechanical margin of error. However, in Contrast AF system, focusing is controlled by the image sensor so that no mechanical margin of error occurs to achieve precise focusing. Compared with the Phase difference system AF, the Contrast AF boasts higher accuracy especially in shooting with bright lens with small F value. (e.g. the accuracy of Contrast AF is approx. 90% while Phase difference AF is approx. 60% at F1.4.) \n\n\n\nThe DMC-GX1 features the approx. 0.09 second of ultra high-speed Light Speed AF* which is achieved by reducing the detection time for focusing by the synchronization of the lens and the sensor at 120 fps. Not only the accuracy but also the speed excels by far than the high-end DSLRs with Phase difference AF with the advanced Contrast AF system in DMC-GX1. \n\n\n\nThe newly added focus mode AFF (AF Flexible) locks on the focus when shutter button is half-pressed, however, if the subject moves, the focusing is reset to get the best results. \n\n\n\nCombined with the Touch AF control, setting and focusing at the subject is incredibly easy and quick, never missing the spur-of-the-moment. Taking further advantage of Contrast AF, the DMC-GX1incorporates Full-area focusing which makes it possible to set focus on any point in the field of view. Frame composition is free and intuitive combining the touch-screen operation.\n\nThe touch-control system of DMC-GX1 immediately lets users to set focus to the subject by just touching it on the large, 460,000-dot wide-viewing angle LCD and you can even release the shutter. Once you lock on the subject by a touch, the camera tracks the subject with the AF tracking function even if it moves. Just a touch on the screen lets you select the part and the size of AF area with the 1-area AF. The 1-area AF in Face Detection even allows you to set finer focus on the eyes while capturing human face bright and clear. The Multi-area AF with 23 AF areas allows you to set a group of AF point according to the composition. In addition, Pinpoint AF function is incorporated in DMC-GX1 allowing more precise focus setting by further enlarging the focusing area. It assists, for example, setting focus right on the pupil in an eye.\n\nIn the MF assist mode, you can enlarge the part by just a touch to select 1x, 4x, 5x or 10x and smoothly move the part by dragging it on the screen. The 4x enlarged view is displayed on the framing screen making it possible to setting fine focus while composing the whole picture at the same time. * The time for focusing on the subject is measured with LUMIX G X VARIO PZ 14-42mm / F3.5-5.6 ASPH. / POWER O.I.S (H-PS14042) to move the lens position to \"2m\" from \"infinity\" position. The zoom position is in wide end. Panasonic measurement method\n\nEasy Manual Control with a Variety of Shooting Assist Functions \nDespite its outstanding compactness, the operation on DMC-GX1 is smooth and easy with optimum layout of control buttons and the mode dial, turn-and-press dial and dedicated function buttons. The function the user changes its setting can be assigned to the 2 external buttons and 2 menus in the software tab for direct reach. In addition, a total of 4 custom setting patterns can be memorized to the camera (1 on C1 for direct switch and 3 on C2).\n\nNow the DMC-GX1 comes with Level Gauge which lets the camera detect the horizontal/vertical angle of view with its internal level working with the acceleration sensor. Photos shot in a portrait aspect will be automatically displayed vertically whatever lens is used.\n\n\n\nThe newly incorporated One Push AE adjusts exposure with a single press of Fn (Function) button when it is over/under exposure. It is especially useful in shootin outdoor with open aperture or indoor with fast shutter speed. \n\n\n\nZoom operation can be controlled with touch control when the Power Zoom lens of LUMIX G Micro System is attached. Speed of zooming can be adjusted in 2 steps.\n\n\n\nEven though the DMC-GX1 pursued the ultimate compactness, Panasonic did not compromise in the equipment of camera such as built-in flash (GN7.6, ISO160).\n\nFinest Tuning in Every Part of the Camera \nAs a camera from the new premium GX line of LUMIX G Micro System, the external design of the camera has been developed with no compromising in every detail. The ergonomically designed grip fits the DMC-GX1's flat profile yet easy to hold. Its tactile feeling offers more comfort thanks to the casting material resin and elastomer. The mode dial is machined with finest tuning on its pitch of spin, form of plate and shininess. Characters are sharply printed by laser so that they are easy to see and they last long. The buttons on the back also have style in the coating, spin, stamp and color.\n\n1920 x 1080 Full-HD High Quality Video Recording \nLUMIX G Micro System is the camera that records not only high quality photo but also stunning video. The AVCHD format features almost twice the recording time in HD quality than the conventional Motion JPEG. A special, dedicated button on the top lets the user instantly start recording videos while shooting photos without any having to make any extra settings. Now the DMC-GX1 can record high-resolution full-HD videos 1920 x 1080 at 60i (NTSC) / 50i in AVCHD (Sensor output is 30p [NTSC])*. Image recording is more flexible fun with the DMC-GX1. In addition to the practical full-time AF, the Touch AF in video recording also lets users enjoy professional-like rack focusing. Just by pointing the subject, the focus is shifted to it and let it stand out to attract attention. \n\nThe Extra Tele Conversion function virtually extends the zoom range Max.4.8x without deterioration of image quality in smaller resolution.\n\nEven video beginners can record excellent video with the DMC-GX1 because the popular iA and iA Plus modes are also available in video recording. Optical Image Stabilizer (O.I.S.) helps prevent handshake when using high-powered zoom. AF Tracking locks on the subject with focus even it moves. Face Detection automatically detects a face in the frame and adjusts focus, exposure, contrast, and skin complexion on it, so it always turns out beautiful. The Intelligent D-range Control offers natural looking by optimizing the exposure for each part of an image, preventing blocked shadows and blown highlights and helping ensure that gradation and details are reproduced beautifully including the blue color of the sky. And Intelligent Scene Selector automatically switches between Portrait, Scenery, Close-up and Low Light modes according to the situation to optimize various parameters for higher visual quality.\n\nHigh quality sound can be recorded with Dolby\u00ae Digital Stereo Creator. A Wind Cut function is also available to block out most of the noise from background wind. The DMC-GX1 can take a photo while recording video by just pressing a shutter button. Also, photos can be cropped out from the video and the unwanted part of the video can be removed with a video divide function.\n\nVideos can be recorded in MP4 format to play it back directly on the PC or other portable electronic devices without a need of conversion.\n\n\u2022 Full HD (1920 x 1080) videos are output by the image sensor at 30p (NTSC), and recorded at 60i (NTSC). HD (1280 x 720) videos are output by the image sensor at 30p (NTSC), and recorded at 60p (NTSC).\n\u2022 Motion images can be recorded continuously for up to 29 min 59 sec in European PAL areas.\n\u2022 Continuous recording exceeding 4GB is not possible when recording MP4. Remaining time for continuous recording is displayed on the screen.\n\u2022 Use a card with SD Speed Class with \"Class 4\" or higher when recording motion pictures\n\u2022 SD Speed Class is the speed standard regarding continuous writing.\n\nOutstanding Performance in Power, Speed and Image Processing \nWith further optimization and rationalization in electric design, the DMC-GX1 excels in energy consumption and features approx. 11%* longer battery life than the DMC-G3 which complies with the same battery pack DMW-BLD10. The DMC-GX1 is now capable of 4.2 fps consecutive shooting in 16.0-megapixel full resolution with mechanical shutter. High speed burst shooting at 20 fps with electronic shutter is also selectable according to the shooting fast-moving subject and it is possible to select the best shot later**.\n\nThe Intelligent D-range Control offers even more natural looking by optimizing the exposure for each part of an image, preventing blocked shadows and blown highlights and helping ensure that gradation and details are reproduced beautifully including the blue color of the sky.\nDMC-GX1 compiles the Intelligent Resolution technology to perform the optimum signal processing depending on the part of a picture to give a whole image outstandingly natural clearness with fine details.\n\nCameras of LUMIX G Micro System are equipped with highly efficient Dust Reduction System. If dust or other foreign matter gets inside the camera when you're changing lenses, it could cling to the image sensor and show up as a spot in your photos.
