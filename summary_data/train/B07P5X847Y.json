I bought these specifically because of the price vs the quantity and that they are 1 gummy per dose. It\u2019s not a good value when you buy a bottle of 60, but have to take 2 per dose, etc. I was pleasantly surprised that they are very squishy and taste very good!",

      "text": "My daughter is a PA-C at an Urgent care clinic. My daughter recommended I try Elderberry for boosting the Immune system. I am all for keeping healthy especially during this tragic Covid19 outbreak. The bottle I\u2019d attractive and label easy to read. The gummies are very flavorful and I am much more likely to be compliant with a chewable vs a tablet. I only started taking them a few days ago so unable to share effectiveness.",

He used to get at least one cold in the winter that would last a week or more and he seems to get just the sniffles now, nothing major! I like that there's no bad stuff in there, a win win for us both!!",
