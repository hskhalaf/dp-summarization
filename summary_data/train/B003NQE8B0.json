The Hamilton was dirty, the whisk attachment was broken and the blender gets very hot in your hand like it is burning up. Unfortunately I did not open and inspect the Hamilton Blender until today and the return window has closed. I have never had an issue like this before from anything I have ever ordered from Amazon. They said the packing may be damaged and I didn't care about that. But I expected it to work! Very disappointed.",

I have yet to use the food processor but the blender and whisk have been fantastic - the whisk attachment does tend to shoot whatever you are using it for out of the bowl so make sure you use a bigger bowl than you normally would to help minimize the spillage. It gets the job done though! LOVE it and have recommended it to friends.",

The people who designed this should have at least tested it whether it is usable or not. Don't know how this got good reviews and nobody raised this issue.

      "text": "I replaced my 10 year old Hamilton with this one. It is loud, but very powerful. My first use the unit smoked a bit, but I think that was just residual stuff from the manufacturing process. I will update this rating if I experience issues. The blade bowl is larger than it looks in the picture. I don't suggest using it to chop ice, but it is good for herbs and stuff.",

So far I've used the \"musher\" attachment to make mashed potatoes and it sort of \"whipped\" them, the texture was very different from when I mush it with the hand musher, I loved it! The whisk seems real handy for making fast scrambled eggs, way smoother than doing it by hand. The motor on this one is strong. I am happy I chose this model!",
