It works well, very well, but the fact of the matter is if you're recording on a shoestring budget like I am, and cannot afford 500 dollar mixing boards and 30,000 dollar vacuum tube amps, just make the switch to digital recording. I recommend the ZOOM h5 or h6 (depending on budget and needs) since they offer multitrack recording AND multitrack INTERFACING WITH COMPATIBLE DIGITAL AUDIO WORKSTATIONS! It works great for me, using a mac and Adobe Audition. You cut down on a huge amount of noise and get full control over your audio.",

It does not come with an equalizer. I had to download the Peace Equalizer (you can find it on SourceForge). Together, they produce great sound!

The quality is basically studio quality but it just can't get up to 24-bit quality of recordings or listening, but come on. You can totally still have sick sounds and amazing sound quality for these things. If you're trying to start off with a cheap recording set up, buy this. And THEN once you have enough confidence to spend more on equipment, go for a more expensive DAC. But 16-Bit quality is still legit ladies and gentlemen, and this is coming from a person of quality.",

I thought so, then I connected the USB from the UCA202 to my laptop. Opened Audacity and when I recorded, I could see the waves, but no sound plays back. Please advise with detail. Thanks a bunch.",

I wanted to transfer records and tapes to my computer hard drive, without having the computer card interfere. This works great. If you want to use the internal sound card, this provides a separate headphone monitor source, without readjusting the recording volume. Very inexpensive, and quite small. If necesaary, a built-in preamp (for magnetic cartridge record transfer or mike pickup) would have been nice, but an outboard preamp will work fine. Line sources (VCR, cassette deck) are OK without any preamp. Finally, it is USB powered. No clunky power supply or wall wart required.",
