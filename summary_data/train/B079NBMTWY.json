No motion blur, no dark corners, and no \"rain effect\" when they pan the camera. Careful with the stand!

It's in the way, annoying, not useful at all, and needs to go. Second, the TV software is extremely glitchy. The screen goes black, it stops responding to its remote, it loses connection to the cable box, it loses connection to the Sonos Beam, it randomly turns itself off--and most issues the only solution is to pull the power plug. So far, Samsung support's only answer is factory reset, which of course does nothing useful.",

      "text": "Hi Shortly after receiving the television approximately 3 months of limited use, we have an issue with the hand held remote. The tv does not respond to commands except for the off and on switch. I tried closing and opening the tv, and finally removed batteries and re-installed new batteries. After numerous attempts I found that the remote is defective and only works if I remove the cover......very annoying!!!!!!",

All the 2019 models have \"legs\" which are wider apart than the piece of furniture that we were going to set it on. The TV has a typical great Samsung picture and audio.",

The tv has both wifi and ethernet connections and has lots of apps (we haven't tried) and lots of hdmi connections. The only thing I don't like is the stand because it sits in front of the tv so it forces you to have the tv recessed on shelf a bit. Not a big deal but we'd rather have the stand sit behind the tv.",

      "text": "Amazing TV for its money. Especially if you have a Samsung phone with Smart Things - the setup process is a breeze. Picture quality is unprecedented for this price (I got it for 599) Yes, there is a bunch of ads on the main screen, but if you spend most of your time paying games etc (using HDMI that is) that won't be a problem. Bad news is the package was open when I received it, and my TV arrived damaged (yes), with a corner of the back case trashed. Nothing a duct tape can't fix, but still sad. Thankfully the way the delivery guys handled it haven't affected the picture quality.",

The only thing I did not like is the remote , it's bare bones and takes some time to figure out how to use it but I'm ok with it now, it helps to watch the how-to video ! It was very easy, even for me , to assemble the tv stand and attach to the tv ! Highly recommend this tv !!!",

If you buy one, don't ever even touch the screen. I chose the Samsung because I had an older Samsung that is a great TV.
