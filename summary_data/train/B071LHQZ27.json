I thought it must be a dud and sent it back. I received a brand new one in its place. That one lasted for about 4 months and then the P key stopped working. The next day the S key stopped working. I believe a keyboard should be made to last longer than that. I wouldn't purchase another one of these.",

If you are like me and move the keyboard around like your lap, another desk so on the phone would fall out. Phone holder is a cut out in the metal - no bottom. This is not a bad thing just need to be aware. Wife does not move keyboard when she is using. At the price worth the effort. We are not gamers use for office, web etc.",

This keyboard stopped functioning yesterday March 10th 2019. I went to Walmart and bought a 40 dollar Logitech wireless keyboard mouse combo and I couldn't be happier.

This would be a 5-star product, except I've owned it two days and have had to unplug/plug it back in SIX times because it will randomly stop working (both lights AND key response). I work from my home computer and it's been frustrating to deal with this.",

So much for that waterproof claim. Also while cleaning it one of the feet broke cause it was too rigid to pull back out after folding.",
