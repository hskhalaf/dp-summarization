I ended up with a $110 bill and both Amazon and Max tool have done absolutely nothing to help me. very very very disappointed I've called multiple times and no one has helped me at all. I spent 700 dollars on a honda mower and then 110.00 dollars to repair a cable. not fair !!!",

This mower bags completely full, always; It NEVER clogs. Also, the HRX powers through deep grass dry or Wet! I'm 66 and have used most mowers on the market. They both start second pull cold first pull warm. The Snapper is Junk compared to the Honda HRX",

I followed the right process in the fall putting it to bed. The Honda authorized dealer says surging is bad gas and Honda won't cover it. It was new gas in the mower. Ultimately I'll fix it myself, but I've never had a problem like this before. I have multiple houses with multiple mowers and none of the others acted like this and they used the same gas. I expect more from Honda.. Kyle Provo UT",

I bought this one because it has the blade stop, bigger motor, plastic desk, and the hydro-static drive. It is not cheap, but you won't find a better mower. Honda makes great small engines as well as great mowers. (Snow blowers too, have had one for 20 years) I went with Royal Purple oil after doing some research. I plan to keep this mower until I am too old to cut my grass myself.",
