So tonight I figured maybe it was the batteries when it just wasn\u2019t working at all. I replaced the batteries (it\u2019s 4 C batteries, not 3 AAA as the listing suggests). Well it\u2019s dead. Nothing works at all. When it did work, my son loves the moving fish but as one poster wrote, the songs are NOT soothing and very loud even on the lowest setting. Hoping Amazon can help me return this piece of junk!!",

Recently, I bought a new one for her after the motor died, which was understandable due to its excessive use. I also bought the new version for our newborn. Both have the same flaw. The strap that attaches It the the crib/bed does not stay tight. They are always facing downwards and we are tightening them up more than once a day.

It has to be pointed directly at the sensor while you are in the room, which kind of defeats the point of having it if you don\u2019t want to wake your baby up (like if you want to turn the system back on from outside the room).",
