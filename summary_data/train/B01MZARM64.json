The colors and details are amazing and can't compare with anything else I've ever used. I also love the ability to crop heavily without any lost of detail. I've included a sample, but not sure if you'll see the detail I'm referring to. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone wanting the BEST image quality!",

The xf line was a bit too weak to invest on (even though I have with two cameras) given the small sensor size but this is such a wonderful surprise to all of us hobbyists. No wonder fuji has survived the demise of film, as apparently their management has proven its worth yet another time.",
