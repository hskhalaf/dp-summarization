It is wobbily and if you don't place anything other than a dinner plate (i.e coffee mug to glass jar) exactly in the middle of the glass plate the unbalanced action of the turntable could topple the mug or jar and spill its contents.

It operates at one of the lesser power levels, so takes longer to heat food and drink. However, it's inexpensive, easy to move around and takes up less counter space. Great for reheating individual portions, which is what we use it for.",
