Already set up UPS to come pick it back up this week for a return. Garbage product.",

The only downfall of this tent is the side walls. They must be staked down or else the wind will push it over. It seams like it is made of very solid material that will last well over a decade. I would also add that the bag it comes in is too big for it. But I have always been very good at packaging tents and sleeping bags into their original container.",

We had tons of room on the inside to play when we got poured on. The tent has been set up 3 times, all 3 times it has rained, and we have only gotten small amounts of water in the corners, but nothing that's unexpected. Ventilation is great and the switch at the door to turn on and off the fan and light is great too. I would definitely recommend this tent if you're looking for something large enough to hold your family with plenty of room for gear and sleeping arrangements.",

The fan is only useful on a still day with the rain fly removed, but we agree with others that the light and switch are a charming touch. My spouse didn't like the zipper design of the door, but I had no problem with it, and it makes sense to me for potential rain protection. So far this has been a good purchase.",

It certainly performed well for my family over six nights at 7,800 feet. It is noteworthy to mention the relatively high sides and center - I am 6' and never had to stoop, even at the edges. That was nice. I recommend this tent for anyone that is car-camping and needs/wants a lot of space.",

      "text": "This tent is awesome!! Only rained twice since sleeping in it so far, and no leaks yet! Set up is very easy, the built-in light and the fan are so great. The light is so much brighter than I expected, so at nighttime you will no longer need to use any flashlights to see around inside your tent. Love how many windows there are, and how big it is inside! Literally have no complaints about this tent. Would absolutely recommend to anyone!! Definitely worth the money!",

      "text": "We took this beach camping to Homer Spit, Alaska. It as our first time using the tent. We staked it well according to instructions, and placed it to minimize wind. The rain started pouring and the wind was howling. Three to four tents around us collapsed in on itself or blew down the beach. Ours held fast and stayed dry with no additional tarping. There was one tent similar to ours that had not been staked well or at all that did collapse in on itself. As with any tent it is imperative to take the time to stake and secure the rain fly appropriately.",
