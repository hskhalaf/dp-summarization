Like most products, this one has applications in which it excels and other for which it is inappropriate. It is not a heavy polishing compound (i.e. not very abrasive) so it will have limitations as to how fast it can abrade \"...30 years worth of old junk\"-- it is not intended for that. As far as cleaning and polishing chrome, it is about the best I have ever used. Apply, rub right away (before it dries), remove and buff.",

Work it into a buffing wheel or cone and buff away. This stuff works great and doesn't get slung off at high rotational speeds like automotive buffing compound. Flitz is a little more abrasive than this stuff. Auto buffing compound is less so. But Blue Magic provides a simple and effective means of cleaning metal and removing fine machining marks, et al, until you end up with a perfectly smooth surface. The only way to make it any shinier would be to use electro-polishing.",

I've used on other things not as precious, it is amazing.

Disappointed at the results I achieved after reading the reviews on this product. I am a fanatic and will happily buff for hours if needed, but this process with Blue Magic just seems futile. Hoped it would work faster and easier on sterling silver, but it did not. Going back and sticking with Mr. Metal Metal Polish.",
