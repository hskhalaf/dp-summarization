So far, the plastic collated nails seems to be reliable and the gun is working nicely. Better overall features than the Bosstitch, Th e only draw back is it requires more frequent re-loading since the plastic collated nails can't be densely packed like the wire ones. Amazon price was too good to pass up on this one.",

Ive dropped it several times from significant heights and its still running perfectly. My only complaint is that it does have trouble with the last nail somewhat frequently. I find it will hit it in but leave the head out about a half inch almost every time (tried a couple different types of nails). But if you don't use the last nail, or slide in another clip before you get to the last few its usually not a problem.",

In particular, you load the nails first, then pull the lever back, then allow it to slide forwardvalong the track behind the nails gently until it rests at the front of the cartridge. This is opposite of all the nailers I've had in the past.",

    "description": "The NR90AE(S1) framing nailer drives plastic collated nails from 2\" to 3-1/2\" in length and features Hitachi's next generation \"Industrial Design\".

The NR90AE(S1) weighs only 7.5 pounds, making it easy to use all day, while still providing the power of bulkier, heavier nailers. A selective actuation switch adds the convenience of being able to quickly change between bump or sequential fire and the tool-less depth of drive eliminates the need to adjust the pressure at the compressor. The simple two-step loading makes fastener replenishment quick and easy, reducing downtime. Includes Safety Glasses (875769). Air Pressure PSI: 70 \u2013 120, Air Consumption @ 100 PSI scfm .09, Applicable Nails Diameter in: .113 \u2013 .148, Length in: 2 \u2013 3-1/2, Nail Capacity: 64 (.131), Magazine Angle: 21 Degrees, Magazine Loading: Rear, Actuation: Selective, Depth Adjustment: Tool-less, Jam Clearing: Open Nose",
