With the nearest service center 150 miles away from our major city, $200 to look at it, etc. it's really ridiculous. Our basement looks like a Magnifica graveyard. We're done with them.",

Two friends who bought more expensive brands were envious of its capabilities (especially the frother and the no-tamping required). Easy to maintain. The hopper is perfect size (I don't see a problem with oily beans at all). We hardly use the decaf pass-through or the heated plate. I guess if I have to improve it, I'd install a larger water reservoir and also increase the size of the water catchment. Also found out our water is very low in mineral content, which means I won't have to de-calcify often.",

Took longer but we\u2019ve gotten better at it now that we know what keeps happening. . 10 minutes of cleaning every 5 or 6 cups and constantly wasted beans is DEFINITELY NOT worth it.

The machine seems like it is made of quality materials aside from the milk frother which is plastic and feels flimsy.

I use beans and my wife uses grounds; the coffees are equivalent to the local Italian bistro. Also, the user manual is detailed and easy to follow. There are several good videos on YouTube if you need further info to make up your mind.",

The machine makes espresso at a consistently ideal temperature because of its new stainless-steel double boiler, which provides excellent heat distribution, as well as its instant reheat function, which keeps the machine at an ideal temperature, no matter how long the interval between cups. \n\n \n\nIts space-saving, integrated quieter burr grinder automatically grinds beans and can be set to a specific grinding level, but the unit can also be used with ground coffee if preferred. Its 60-ounce removable water reservoir and 7-ounce bean container allow for conveniently filling the water tank and emptying coffee grounds. The unit's front panel offers easily accessible controls for the on/off switch and cappuccino system, as well as for adjusting the quantity of water and coffee to suit individual tastes, from long or short to weak or strong.  \n\nThe machine's patented cappuccino system rotates 180 degrees to allow for any size milk container, while its coffee spigot height can be adjusted to allow for all different cup sizes--from a classic espresso cup to a tall mug.

For added convenience the unit comes with a water-level indicator, an electronic steam and coffee thermostat, rinse and decalcification auto programs, and a removable drip tray for easy cleanup.  Brewing Unit: The \"Heart\" of Magnificent \n\n \n\nThe Magnifica features the smallest removable brewing system available on the market.

And, thanks to the removable boiler, cleaning the inside of the machine is easy. Even areas normally difficult to reach can be easily cleaned and without the use of harsh detergents. And because regular maintenance helps prolong the life of the machine, DeLonghi\u2019s reliability is second to none.Beans-to-Brew System\n\n One of the secrets to making a high-quality espresso is using freshly ground coffee beans. Because of the beans-to-brew system, the Magnifica offers you coffee that has a delicious aroma. The coffee is freshly ground and no traces are left in the machine. Magnifica is the only super-automatic machine that delivers the freshest results. \n\n \n\n Features\n\n \n\n * Compact and High Performance: Because DeLonghi\u2019s new patented boiler is so compact, the excellent heat distribution guarantees a perfect espresso at the ideal temperature every time. \n * Timeless Reliability: Thanks to the stainless-steel removable double boiler, the inside can be cleaned easily.
