Have a great texture, not too waxy, not overly colored/opaque, they feel light and not at all like lipstick. They even test great--not that you should eat them. I own these in five different colors and love all of them equally. I even went so far as to have work/desk tubes, purse tubes, and vanity tubes. I can't get enough.

      "text": "Nothing to totally rave about, but a very nice gloss with a sanitary application method. Plenty shiny. On the thin side, so it doesn't stay put or last quite as well as thicker glosses, but it's more balmy than sticky, which is nice. Fruity smell/taste. I don't love that but I don't really mind it either, because I'm assuming the aroma/flavor is from a natural source, not a chemical one. The pale pink shade I got is pretty. I was worried it would be too cool of a pink and would clash with my warm complexion, but it's a very sheer milky pink that reads almost clear, and would probably be universally flattering. Great price.",

It's similar to Bath & Body Works Mentha Lip Tints, without the mint flavor of course. Only con, as with lip gloss in general, is you have to reapply often to keep the color.",

All staying with essentially the same color too. The shine is a soft and pucker type of product that I absolutely love. It gives my lips a nice shine, a pop of color, and it moisturizes as well. I highly recommend all the products I've mentioned above. UPDATE: I'm not a fan of the artificial watermelon flavor though, minus 1 star for that.",
