I love PaperPro's staplers, with which you can staple a lot of pages with the light touch of one finger, and this punch is also very light and easy to use. My only complaint is that it punches the holes a bit too close to the edge of the paper: a little less than 1/4\" from the edge, whereas most punches are closer to 3/8\". For someone who is less of an office supply nerd than I am, it would be a perfect product.",

To empty it is pretty easy as well. just flip the opening up like you would on a tic-tac container and empty it out.",

Most hole punches I have to use a lot of arm muscle/force and can only punch holes in a few pieces at a time. This allows me to hole punch more paper at once and does not require as much effort. Occasionally, punch outs fall out of the bottom when it is overflowed. But, when emptied regularly, this is not an issue. The lock feature is extremely helpful for transporting back and forth in my teacher bag as needed. Next to an electric hole puncher, this is the best hole puncher I have ever used!",
