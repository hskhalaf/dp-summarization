My teens read & relax on it in the morning & after school like it\u2019s an extra living room. My husband put it together, simple enough, but took a few hours. All the parts were included. A package a clamps came in the following day, so we were so pumped! I\u2019m writing this review on it, drinking my coffee, listening to the birds :) This evening maybe a glass of wine \ud83c\udf77",

      "text": "After a lot of searching I decided on this outdoor sectional because of the reviews, the stick cushions, and the design. I was a little worried about the low height of the back of the sofa however after using it several times I realize it\u2019s extremely comfortable and I\u2019m glad it has the height it does. We have had it out and some pretty substantial rain and the cushions dried quite quickly which I was happy about! The cushions have ties that I haven\u2019t quite figured out where to tie them to yet. I\u2019m really happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this set.",

It took a couple hours. We sprayed it with ScotchGuard and purchased a cover for it as well. The set is comfortable. Yes, the back is low, but nobody in my family has had a problem with that. I spent a lot of time watching the kids swim, reading a book, and talking with others. We did have a couple issues, but once the company was aware, they quickly resolved them. I find this set comfortable, sturdy, and versatile.",

The downside though, is that it's not super comfortable. And the back cushions are really low. The other negative is that after it has been used for several months, the cushion start to squish and widen. As you can see in the photo, they no longer fit on the frame. Over all though, I still give it 4 stars because you can't beat the quality for the price.",

Unless you regularly assemble things, the first piece goes together a little slow, but you cruise after that because it's very logical. For the couch part, I would recommend buying medium size patio furniture clips to hold it together. I would have given comfort 5 stars except that the backs are a little low (still great for the money). I would definitely buy this again.",
