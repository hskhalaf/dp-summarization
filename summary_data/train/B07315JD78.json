On our first dive the max depth was 35 meters and it turned off within the first 10 minutes. I looked inside once back on the boat and the battery compartment was soaked. I tried drying it out and everything I could to make it work. I was not successful. We are traveling for a few months so I was not able to return it and was forced to throw it in the trash. Very upset, not only for the waste of money but to add trash to the environment because of false advertising.",

It's now in a box with the return shipping label attached going back to Amazon.",

If I had gone to a dive shop for a similar light, I would have expected to pay over 100.00. You won't be disappointed in this little guy.",

They are very bright, easy to mount on our equipment, and I've been using them for two years without a hitch. In fact, I'm writing this review because today I bought a fifth to add to my others, and I can't believe the negative reviews. The batteries on the cameras (generic 4K action cams) die well before the lights do. I unreservedly recommend these lights.",

Also included is a unique little plastic wrench to tighten the bolt and make sure that the included mount is nice and snug.",
