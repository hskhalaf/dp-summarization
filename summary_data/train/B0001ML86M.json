Performs quite well although navigating the on screen is a tad less intuitive than on the older model. It also takes a bit loinger to detect the disc type, perhaps essential to good playback. No 5.1 analog connections as I had before, just optical so until I can get the correct optical cable (didn't need this before) I cannot take advantage of the built-in DTS capabilities. Nevertheless, I can recommend this wholeheartedly! If you burn any of your own discs, this will keep you happy!",

    "title": "Sony DVP-NS575P/S Progressive Scan DVD Player, Silver",
    "description": "Color:SilverWatch your favorite movies on Sony\u2019s new DVP-NS575P/S DVD player. With Sony\u2019s Precision Cinema Progressive and new Precision Drive\u2122 2 systems, you\u2019ll get a picture that is more faithful to the source, video or film, and virtually free of errors that warped discs can produce. This DVD player also lets you listen to MP3 music with ease. Start enjoying DVDs and MP3s with your high-quality, affordable Sony DVD player today.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSony's amazingly affordable and feature-rich DVP-NS575P/B DVD player is everything a budget-savvy music and movie lover could ask for. The progressive-scan DVP-NS575P/B plays just about any disc out there--including DVD-Video, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, and DVD+RW--as well as spins your digital photos and MP3 files burned to CD-R/CD-RW discs. It will also play discs recorded in the DVD-VR format (which grants more flexible recording and editing options than do standard DVD-RW/+RW or DVD-RAM formats).\n\n\n\n\nSony's Precision Cinema Progressive (PCP) system \nuses specialized algorithms to detect image changes at\nthe pixel level, as opposed to the scan-line level, resulting \nin a picture more faithful to the film or video source. \n\n\nWhether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of \"someday,\" the DVP-NS575P/B stands ready to deliver the full potential of your DVDs through its Precision Cinema Progressive (PCP) output and 3:2 pulldown processing. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.\n\nOther DVD players detect image changes at the level of the scan-line level, while Sony's Precision Cinema Progressive (PCP) system detects them at the pixel level. The resulting picture is more faithful to the source, whether it's from film or video. That's because the player uses separate, optimized algorithms to handle the differing pixel behavior of each original format. It also uses separate algorithms to process the moving and still parts of an image, giving you sharp backgrounds and moving objects that are free from motion artifacts. \n\n \n\nDVD mastering introduces a common distortion when adjusting 24 frames-per-second movies to 30 fps video; 3:2 pulldown digitally corrects this distortion, removing the redundant information to display a film-frame-accurate picture. Composite- and S-video outputs bring compatibility with nearly any television. Further, the player offers block noise reduction (which suppresses vertical edge distortions for a smoother, more natural picture) and digital video enhancement (processing that improves the crisp contrast of picture detail while controlling unwanted artifacts like \"overshoot\" and \"ringing\"). \n\nBoth Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel surround-sound signals can also be routed through the player's coaxial digital-audio output for a simpler connection to a compatible AV receiver (but be aware that a digital-audio interconnect is not supplied).\n\nPrecision Drive 3 provides a mechanism for reading DVDs that are in less than perfect condition, eliminating errors in playback due to imperfect, scratched, or warped discs. Early generations of Precision Drive technology were only able to compensate for warped discs by moving the entire optical block, which took more time and limited the amount of correction possible. This newer system simplifies the process by moving just the lens (instead of the entire optical block) for faster and more accurate error correction.\n\nAs soon as you hook up the DVD player, a special Quick Setup screen appears ready to guide you through configuration, step by step, screen by screen. DVD resume memory kicks in whenever you stop a DVD. Later, when you come back to it, the player will pick up right where you left off before. The player holds resume points for up to six discs. Other playback features include 10-second instant replay, DVD/CD Text display (with applicable discs), custom parental control memory for 40 discs, instant search (which provides audible scanning akin to cue and review features on cassette decks), as well as Advanced SmoothScan and SmoothSlow Modes.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nDVD player, remote control, 2 AA batteries, a stereo analog audio/composite-video interconnect, a user's manual, and warranty information.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWatch your favorite movies on Sony's DVP-NS575P/S DVD player.
