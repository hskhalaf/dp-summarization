I\u2019ve spent a couple 8 hour days drilling into concrete ceilings with a hammer drill right next to my ear/head wearing these. They stay comfortable and the noise of the drill doesn\u2019t get to me. My only complaint is when you cram both pairs into the case it\u2019s a little difficult to get them back out- not enough of an annoyance to take a star away though.",

I've only owned these for a couple of weeks, but so far I'm very happy with their construction and function. I am a professional audio engineer and a hobby musician and am infamous for being a critical b***ard. The fit is excellent, at least as secure and well-sealed as my expensive plugs. While you'll experience a high frequency roll-off with music, it's not intolerable or un-listenable. It's just a fact that high frequencies are easier to block than low.",
