Knowing that they had a standard platter-style hard drive, I suggested this. Boy is she glad that I did!

There are other less expensive SATA SSDs that are quite good, but with both drives made by the same company, I can monitor the status of both drives from the same program (Samsung Magician).",

      "text": "This is the \"old style\" Samsung SSD (not the QVO). This is the reliable one, the newer (larger/cheaper) units do not have a good track record and, technologically speaking, are poorly designed. But those are cheap and, if you don't mind oats that have already been through the horse, go buy one. This one, however, does its job without complaints. In all the years I've been servicing computers, I've only seen one Samsung SSD of this design fail. If they keep making them, I'll keep buying them.",

      "text": "Upgraded my new 14 inch Asus Notebook with this and amazing. First of all, Samsung Magician said that it wouldn't be compatible....but after downloading migration software off of Samsung.com/samsungssd it said no compatibility issues. Microsoft Office Word went from nearly 2 minutes from clicking to operational to under 5 seconds. The $10 cord off Amazon worked perfectly.....and super easy. No need for me to spend the $20 plus on a kit. Highly recommend this even and I went from a terabyte to 500g.",

I tried free software off the internet and none of it worked for me; that is why it took all day, it takes time to transfer your information. I went to the Samsung website where you can download their software to clone the Samsung SSD drive; that worked well. My computer boots up and shuts down instantly, software runs faster and browsing the internet is also much faster.",
