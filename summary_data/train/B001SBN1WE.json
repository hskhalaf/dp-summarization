Coupled with an Okuma Magna Pro 30 with line counter (used power pro 30 lb test). Worked flawlessly trolling at 60 to 70 feet. Sturdy, yet sensitive enough. Caught fish on flies and spoons. Personally, though some swear by 8' rods, the 10' foot length gives you the extra couple of feet to bring fish to the boat with all of those contraptions on the line (diver, snubber, (a flasher), leader, bait). I'd recommend this rod, especially for the price.",

Rod is of high quality, and a perfect lead core line rod. Many people just use down rigger rods for lead core (including me), which work fine. Caught one fish on it on a slower day (guessing that luck had nothing to do with the rod, but nonetheless ...). This one seems to work just a hair nicer than typical downrigger rod, the engineering must have gone into it for that purpose (as opposed to just calling it one). For the price and quality, I'd recommend.",
