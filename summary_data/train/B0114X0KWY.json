Very cheaply made; nice to look at but not worth the money if you actually plan on using your fire pit. FYI--the screen cover before this one lasted me 2 years on the same fire pit!",

Keep in mind when you take off the screen the top part is hot so don't touch it w/your bare hands. It does the job. I did post a picture of also of the screen not laying flat, it pops up a bit on the corner, not sure if that is normal. Anyways this is why I cannot give this item 5 stars",
