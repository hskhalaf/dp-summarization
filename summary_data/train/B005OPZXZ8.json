We have been using it each night and hes almost fully rid of his bad pulling habits. But after only 5 uses part of the webbing snapped in half.. not at sewing junction either, but right in a middle spot of the cheap webbing. I highly recommend looking into a no pull style harness, maybe just look for one from another manufacture.",

I think this no pull, means no pulling for the dogs, all pulling on people. Fit great, no rashes, no rubbing, nice material and construction, but if your dog has a strong prey drive, this will not work.

A MUST BUY for anyone who has a large breed dog with high energy! Trust me when I say you'll be saving yourself a lot of stress and soreness by using this product! You AND your pup will be ALOT happier -- BUY THIS PRODUCT!!",

I\u2019m so happy to finally have found a no-pull harness that works really well to stop pulling, AND doesn\u2019t shift when he pulls off to the side! Others didn\u2019t stay in place despite being fitted snug enough. I bought the package that came with the double ended leash, and it worked very well. I\u2019m tempted to buy another one in a different color.",

Multiple attempts at leash training him(over the course of two years) were absolute disasters. He was a total spaz on the leash and would choke himself the whole time, all the while trying to drag me into traffic. The MINUTE we got this on him he completely stopped trying to dislocate my shoulder. He turned into a gentleman on his walks. I would have paid my weight in gold for this harness. I recommend spending the extra money for the training leash that comes with it.",

I got one for my female and while she didn't need a harness she too walks better with it on. Immediate difference. Clip it in the front for control when walking and on the back to keep them from lunging or jumping. Great product!!!!",

Using a double-ended leash allows you to connect to the front and back of the harness simultaneously for even more control.",
