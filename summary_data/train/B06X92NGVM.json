It's better to buy a flavored powder you won't mind the taste of rather than this grainy stuff that definitely changes the taste of things!",

This tasted so awful I had to dump out my smoothie; there was no covering up that terrible taste...maybe that's from the pea protein. I'm wondering if I can use the rest in the garden so that it's not a total waste, otherwise it's going in the trash.",
