      "text": "If you have an older spotting scope, don't despair. I have an old Swarovski AT80 Habicht spotting scope with long gray body and angled viewfinder. My scope is 4 inches wide at the widest point and 18 inches long at the maximum. I was hesitant to buy this ALPS sleeve because the specs said interior dimension was only 16 inches long. I thought it might fit because the interior diameter is 5 inches and the body is soft and flexible. My guess was correct. This fits by Swarovski AT80 comfortably and has much more padding than the original sleeve. This is a well made sleeve with excellent padding, straps, buckles, and closure. See photos.",

It fits but the scope is a little too long. There is a gap when closing the bag (see pictures). Don\u2019t think about putting the scope in with the neoprene cover on...too tight! The bag is from good quality and nice materials, worth the money and all stars. I will not return it as I like it, but I will give it to my wife who is skilled with her sewing machines and get it modified for better fit.",

I looked all around for an alternative case to the garbage swaro \"case\" and for the price this one works very well. Is it the best? Probably not, but it is the best $20 spotting scope case I have seen so far. Works well for putting the scope inside a day pack or overnight pack while hunting.",
