BURNS in the summer even with open windows. High 90s to 100s. Second; Thinking I would get used to the pistol grip was a mistake. I miss the ball grip all the time. (grew up on manual transmissions) Third; Did I mention it burns? Grievances aside it looks great and beside the burning it did nothing wrong to me. The reason for 3 stars is the feel. I just couldn't get into it.",
