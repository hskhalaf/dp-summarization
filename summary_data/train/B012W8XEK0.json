I was like \"what is this model? I've never read about this one\", so I googled \"Moto XT1564 Play\" and clicked the third link. It explains that this model (XT1564) is the same as the XT1565 model, aka Droid Maxx 2. Yes, I got the bloatware verizon-free version of the Droid Maxx 2... So the product is not the one as described in this page, PLEASE CORRECT THIS. I'll keep the phone because it's a good phone.",

Also in burst shot, the phone will not often than not freeze and cause some of the photos to be pixelated with colors that shouldn't be there and the bottom half of some of the pictures will be totally black. If I'm barely using the phone the battery will last most of the day but it really only lasts about 2 hours of continuous use.",

All of a sudden the screen began going nuts while in the middle of an important call and I had no control over it at all. After the phone did this a couple of times I took it to a dealer and they checked it out and said that the electronics and screen were fried. Had to purchase another phone immediately as I have elders that depend on my being available 24/7. Nice phone while it worked. D. Martin",
