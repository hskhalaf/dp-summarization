      "text": "The Canon EOS Rebel T6 is a great started DSLR, I've owned it for about a year and only have two complaints. First of all I wish the screen would flip out. It does not flip out or move at all but If you're fine with a fixed screen this is in my opinion is a great entry level DSLR. The only other problem I have with this camera is that there is no microphone jack. I bought the \"videomic go\" from Rode without thinking about it and when I went to put it on my camera I was super disappointed that there wasn't a mic jack. Other than those two minor inconveniences I love this camera!",
