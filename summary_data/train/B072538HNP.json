They fit lots of stuff, can be used as backpacks after the holiday and seemed plenty durable, although the 2- & 3-year-olds will probably test that better than I could. LOL I love that there's 10 different designs, so each kid got his/her own unique bag, thus avoiding fights about ownership. I also love that the back of each bag is blank, allowing me to personalize each bag if I'd wanted to and had the time. I'm definitely going to buy them again sometime soon. :)",
