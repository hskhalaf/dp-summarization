Can load a 10 g cal weight (read approx 10 g) then add the 2nd 10 g cal weight (reads approx 20 g +/- 1%). Take off the 2nd weight and 1st weight reads 9.5 g (?!). Add the 2nd weight back on reads (roughly 18 g). Massive drift when weighing 100-200 mg samples. Constantly need to tare (ie between every single sample).",

I kept the scale because it's a good price and it's very convenient for measuring small amounts after it's warmed up for a few minutes. Other scales have to have a minimum weight before they start measuring so if your okay with that stick with a 0.01g accurate scale.",
