Need to review and adjust posted speed limits (esp in rural areas), set curfews, multiple geofences and push notifications preferences (many options)...once this is done, the app is amazingly accurate. It has given us the piece of mind setting our teen out on the road; $19/month subscription fee is money well spent! If car is temporarily out of commission and teen is driving another....just remove and plug into new vehicle...back up and running. Great product....all 'pros' .....no 'cons' what so ever!",
