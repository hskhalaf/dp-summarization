Kohler has sent replacement parts for free under the lifetime warranty but it takes a couple of weeks for the parts to come. Regardless, having to submit five warranty claims in less than three years makes me regret buying this faucet. I pointed this out to Kohler on my last claim asking if they would refund my money. They chose not to respond to that part of my email. I will never buy a Kohler faucet again. I suggest you don't either.",

Are you kidding me, we're paying a plumber to fix the defective new unit?. The plumber said it's only Kohler units that he's occasionally run into this. So $200+ plumbers bill and have to return the unit to Amazon. Never again!!!",

Small drippy leak under the handle almost immediately after installation, causing our granite countertop to remain constantly wet. Within 18 months of installation, the stream pause button fell off. Then, several months later, the water hose developed a small hole under the sink, spraying all inside our cabinet, causing a huge mess. Koehler was very helpful to send a replacement faucet, however after installing the replacement, we discovered the spray nozzle buttons were defective and not working, wouldn't stay in either spray or stream mode, making a mess with every use. Contacted Koehler again today, and they are now sending an entirely different model faucet. Hopefully, third time is a charm.",

      "text": "Extremely pleased with this faucet and the price here on Amazon. I shopped around a lot before deciding on this fixture for my cast iron double sink. It's a perfect mix of form and function and brings a contemporary edge to my more classic kitchen. Best of all the price beat out all the other big box sellers. Installation was a breeze for my handy father in law, but without him I'd probably have hired a plumber. I have a standard faucet setup and this was a smooth fit with the cover plate. Highly recommend!",

The arch spray is stronger than previous faucet, but easy to adjust with water control lever. Only concern was the handle - had to place in front rather then side because the handle for the hot water hit the splash panel and therefore could not completely open. I wish the handle were mounted higher since I prefer the handle on the side. As such, I am giving the faucet a 4-star rating. Otherwise, a clean look and very functional faucet. I am ordering a second one in black for my vacation home.",
