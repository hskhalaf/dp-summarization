The chassis was surprisingly stiff for a budget laptop and the keyboard had acceptable feedback and feel. The screen quality isn't the best, but for a budget laptop, it is livable.",

That adds up to 8 I think. Snappy little computer. Got it for my 9 year old to do his zoom stuff for school. Thanks libs. Don't expect it to blow you out of the water, but more than capable at a price point that doesn't hurt. Highly recommend. This is my first anything but an HP laptop. So far, so good.",

Note that I just wanted a basic model to run with Linux, and it works great right out of the box (no wifi issues, recognizes backlit keyboard, every peripheral works).

If you've ever got a keychain bluetooth speaker as a RiteAid impulse buy for $8, you've gotten better sound than this computer. Ugh... is deleting all my already imputed info, then boxing it up, printing a label, and shipping it back worth the lack of speaker quality... Just maybe!!",
