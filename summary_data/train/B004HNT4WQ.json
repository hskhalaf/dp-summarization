Got this one for a work vehicle after seeing more broken window glass near my work than I'm comfortable with. Being familiar with the twin-hooks style, I can't go back to the 'standard' fork design. I really like that you don't need the key to extend it from the compact form, only to retract it from the 'locked' position. Less fumbling with keys is always preferred. As for function, these all work similarly - deterrence, not prevention. No model of steering wheel lock will deter a knowledgeable criminal with time. You just want to make it not worth the while for any opportunistic criminal.",
