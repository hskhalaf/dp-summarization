I wasn't even thinking that it would have a video on it for the first couple months, just was so focused on the pictures, then discovered it takes amazing quality video with sound as well, cannot say enough good things about this camera!",

Cons: Casing feels very much like cheap plastic, so it doesn't feel very sturdy. Missing a few features that I liked to use in my Coolpix 8100. And you have to manually pop up the flash - you can't set it to automatically pop it up if needed. Overall, a good camera for the price if you want to step up just a bit from the pocket-size point and shoots.",

I am still trying out different settings. I like the feel of this camera - its solid in my hand. The video works well. One thing - it gets cranky when you turn it on and don't have the lens cap off. It won't activate for a bit which can get awkward if folks are waiting for you to shoot.",
