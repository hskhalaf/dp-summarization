      "text": "Let's be clear that I love this product but I'm disappointed with how Elemis has doubled its price without thinking anyone would notice. I purchased the 1.7 ounce version six months ago for $65 and then the 3.4 ounce version for around $135 a couple months later. I find they currently aren't offering the larger version but have doubled the price on the 1.7 ounce. This is beyond price gouging. I suggest trying other products until Elemis realizes they can't double the price indiscriminately. A disappointing practice by a company that has excellent products.",

      "text": "Lately I\u2019ve tried to cut down on my skincare costs, but I\u2019ve come running back to Dior masques and Elemis creams. The best things about Elemis day-time that you can\u2019t find elsewhere are the absorption qualities, how lightweight and airy it feels on skin, and the fact that it never leaves a greasy residue. My face and de\u0301colletage drink it in, resulting in softer, toner skin. It\u2019s so much easier to wear a light layer of powder after since it isn\u2019t greasy and actually soaks in. Other, less expensive, creams always make my face shiny like an oil slick and crease my makeup on the few occasions I wear any. Glad I changed back.",
