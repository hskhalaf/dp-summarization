I needed new luggage for my trip this December so I'm glad I was able to snag this deal. So far it looks pretty durable, but yeah I don't think it's of the HIGHEST Samsonite quality. The locks and zippers are a nice plus, and the small one looks roomy despite its size. Hopefully it can withstand being lugged around the trains in Japan.",

It is just like when you go shop at an outlet. Companies more and more create less expensive products (sometimes worse quality, of course, but not always) to sell to outlets, big sales and for this set all I have to say is that it looks as good for the price. The wheels are my major concern but with the 10 yr warranty from Samsonite, I am expecting it to last at least a good amount of trips. I'm happy with the product so far.",

We opened the box and immediately knew they were not the same as other piece of Samsonite we had purchased. I could go into all the differences, but just know within minutes we had them boxed up again to send back. Save your money and don't be fooled.",

This product is made of materials that can lead to cancer ie the chemical that is not allowed for sale in California. If you have no problem with that, this is great find for the price ($125 for the set)",
