In this case with connections included not worth spending time to package again to send back! I have to admit I was a little harsh with the above review. PVC is stiffer than Rubber and I need to except that and I also knew that. Wynnsky does sell a very good quality rubber hose also. Didn't mean to trash the WYNNsky name. They are known for a number of quality products. They did contact me and offer a refund. Very Good Customer Service. Thanks WYNNsky",

It's disappointing that there isn't a fitting included so you can use the tire inflator on the blow gun attachment, you have to use the inflator directly on the hose. This leaves you with no way to regulate air flow and the only way to stop air flow is to remove it from the valve stem.",

I found Ace Hardware to have some nice quality stuff that made all the difference in my new air compressor. Save your money.",
