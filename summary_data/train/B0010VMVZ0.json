I decided to give this one a try and what I found out that you can only use small potatoes and the suction base would not stay well enough to hold the unit in place, unlike the old unit, whose suction base worked fine after 10 years. It was also very hard to get a potato through the blades. I returned the unit promplty.",

Don't expect too much from it, it is basically a toy.",

It is good gadget for kitchen. One star was taken away for pricing point.54$ for plastic?",

First, you need to cut all your potatoes into very small pieces in order to fit into the 3 inch long chamber. I was kind of hoping for a little longer fry length. Perhaps my expectations were too high based on the reviews. The blades bent under the stress of the first potato. I straightened them as much as possible and continued with MUCH smaller pieces. Finally, I ended up with a batch of 2 inch potatoes pieces. I'll now be searching for a cutter that boasts a better grade.",
