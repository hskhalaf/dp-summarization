      "verdict": "The New Balance 85 was considered an excellent walking shoe because of how comfortable it was when used for long on-foot travels. People generally liked its style, lightweight nature, and perfect fit. There were even claims that it helped relieve foot and back pains. However, its construction could be improved by lengthening the tongue for full instep coverage to prevent irritation. The fit and sizing were also points of displeasure, along with the eyelets that soon tore off, and the outsole that easily wore out and had insufficient traction. Though many raved about the footwear\u2019s style and comfort, the durability and construction issues left several consumers with no choice but to return it.",
      "pros": [
        "The majority claimed that the New Balance 85 was an extremely comfortable shoe for long walks",
        "The style and colorways of the trainer delighted many consumers",
        "The shoe fit perfectly, according to numerous owners",
        "Plenty of users liked its lightweight nature",
        "It did not need breaking in, as stated by several testers",
        "A handful of wearers said that it provided a stable platform for walking",
        "Some individuals claimed that using it relieved their foot and back issues",
        "The product was deemed reasonably priced by a few buyers",
        "Its ability to accommodate custom orthotics was also appreciated"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Numerous people complained that the tongue was short and constantly moved out of place, which caused the laces to irritate the instep",
        "The New Balance 85 was perceived to be smaller and narrower than expected",
        "A good number of commenters mentioned that it did not provide any arch support",
        "The insole was too thin and felt uncomfortable, which caused a good number of users to return the product",
        "The laces were also not long enough to be tied properly, remarked several reviewers",
        "There were also structural issues such as the webbed eyelets that quickly tore off, the ill-fitting insole that caused discomfort, and the mesh that developed a hole in just a few months of regular use",
        "A handful of individuals wished there were more color options to choose from",
        "Some consumers had issues with the outsole as it wore out quickly and lacked traction",
        "A few testers did not like the rocker-like design of the sole unit"

This one is super cute (gray/lime) but drops the ball in comfort. The description touts a memory foam sole. Beware this is a very thin piece of foam that smashes completely down to a rock hard foot bed upon standing. The shoe has no arch support either. This shoe isn't made of breathable material either. I can't imagine using this as a walking shoe which is what it is classified as. Pass this one up!",
