      "text": "The red power wire did not continuity check to the female component in the plug. I discovered this when the cd player would not power up. When I applied 12 v to the male pin on the unit, the cd would power up but I could not get the wiring harness to work. I attempted to fix it several ways but could not succeed in getting power to the female side of the plug. There is some damage where I tried to fix it but the wiring harness was defective on arrival. I spent 4 hours trying to get the plug to work so it was extremely frustrating",

P.S. I love this unit I just wish I could axis and set all the function's!!",
