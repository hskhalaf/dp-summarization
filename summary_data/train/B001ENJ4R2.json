The purpose was for her to be able to sleep with it and now she can\u2019t because of a choking hazard. Not at all what I thought I was going to recieve and I not a happy camper.",

It's well made, good quality, and has the original disney tag on the foot. The only thing I didn't really like was the way it was packaged when I received it. It literally just came in a plastic bag. Not a plastic grocery bag, but just a clear plastic bag that was tied with a knot. Not great presentation if you're thinking to send it directly to the recipient. I would get it sent to yourself first and put it in a gift bag if you care about packaging and presentation.",
