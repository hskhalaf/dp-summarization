Very performant fps-wise. Good price too. Tried all new games and FPS is always 60+ on top specs. I would def recommend to anyone who wants a decent performance for \u00a3329.",

When there's so many options out there for only slight difference improve, it was tough to decide (1660 ti, 2060 being two options). The zotac comes with a 3 year warranty which increases to 5 years if you register it online, which is much longer than the usual 2/3 years! Runs pretty mich every game at (or really close to) max (ultra) settings at 1440p, with it getting a little loud on the latest releases (but can't be heard over the game). Would recommend this card.",

All the games in my library are now up and running with no problems whatsoever, overclockable with the free msi afterburner software if required but mine runs fine as is, a good reasonably quiet and very stable card, the other thing is with its small dimensions its ideally suited for the smaller desktop tower PC.",
