      "text": "I've owned this camera for almost 4 years now, and I barely use it. Pictures taken with this camera are always blurry, even in direct sunlight. Low light pictures are blurry and pixelated. Taking a picture with the camera turned sideways to better frame a specific shot shows a lot of distortion from the wide angle lens. Video is usually okay, but has two major problems... First, the noise of zooming in and out is recorded very loudly. Second, the autofocus changes haphazardly, switching from foreground to background, sometimes following movement, and preferentially focusing on light sources.",

(No kidding) The video feature is really awesome, and I believe it is better than most of the \"cheap\" video camera out there. This one is totally worth the money. I highly recommend taking picture in the P mode with white balance set to flash. The only draw back is the flash may not get to the lower left corner, but it's rarely to see this happen. (you only see it in certain lighting condition).",

There is always a shadow in the lower left corner of the pictures (because of very short distance between flash and lens). 2. Pictures come rounded (probably because of wide angle). 3.

    "title": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX1/B 10MP \"Exmor R\" CMOS Digital Camera with 5x Optical Steady Shot Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch LCD (Black)",
    "description": "The WX1 can capture ten 10.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10fps with its mechanical shutter, helping to ensure that you capture the decisive moment. HD Movie mode lets you capture your memories in 720p high definition video. HD videos can be played back on your HDTV using component output cable (sold separately) or uploaded to Internet sharing sites to share with friends and family.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer \n\n Thanks to the back-illuminated \"Exmor R\" CMOS sensor and bright G-lens, the small and thin DSC-WX1 has stunning low-light performance, reducing grain by more than 50%, even without a flash. High speed burst captures 10fps without distortion and expansive Sweep Panorama shots are easy to achieve with press and sweep motion. \n\n\n\n\n\nSony DSC-WX1 Highlights \n\n10.2-megapixel Back-Illuminated \"Exmor R\" CMOS Sensor Producing Stunning Images in Low Light\nThe DSC-WX1 features a 10.2-megapixel \"Exmor R\" CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera\u2019s G lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain--2x better than traditional sensors of equivalent size and pixel count. In addition, the combined \"Exmor R\" CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 720p movie modes. \nCMOS vs. non-CMOS image sensor \nPremium f/2.4 G Lens\nDesigned and manufactured to the highest standards of optical performance, the Sony G Lens is optimized to perfectly complement the advanced image sensors and image processing technology in Sony\u2019s cameras. This f/2.4 aperture lens gathers twice as much light as typical compact camera lenses, allowing you to shoot indoors or in low light without flash and with less noise. G lenses are used in top of the line digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras and advanced pro-sumer HD Camcorders. \n\nCapture the whole picture with 24mm wide angle lens\nCapture more of the scene in landscape or group portraits with the 24mm wide angle lens. Wide angle is especially useful in small rooms, where you can\u2019t get far enough back from your subjects to capture them all. \n\n5x Optical Zoom\nCapture the action up close with the 5x optical zoom. Zoom in on kids on a soccer field or a jet skier on the lake, to see their expressions as they enjoy their sport. \n\n2.7-inch Clear Photo LCD Plus\nCompose and show off your images on the large 2.7-inch Clear Photo LCD Plus display (230K pixels). \n\nCompact design Measuring at just 3 9/16 x 2 1/16 x 2 5/32 inches, the DSC-WX1 is compact enough to slip into most any pocket or purse, so you can take it with you wherever you go. \n\nBIONZ image processor\nThe BIONZ image processor delivers the high resolution and fast performance you expect from a Sony digital camera. Fast processing enables Sweep Panorama Mode to create the image in seconds, clear images in low light settings, and layering one image over another to create a photo that looks just like what you see with your eyes. \n\nHandheld Twilight\nCapture cleaner and sharper night shots without using a tripod. When set to Handheld Twilight Mode, the WX1 captures six images in a fraction of a second with one press of the shutter, and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and low noise. With these modes, you can capture images in low light, without flash, beyond the capability of traditional cameras. \n\nAntiMotion Blur Mode\nCapture cleaner and sharper images, even when your subject is moving. When set in Anti-motion Blur Mode, the WX1 captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and help eliminate subject blur, beyond the capability of traditional cameras. \n\nHigh speed shooting\nThe DSC-WX1 can capture ten full 10.2-megapixel resolution images at up to 10 fps, so you capture the decisive moment such as the bat hitting the game winning homerun. In addition, the DSC-WX1 employs a mechanical shutter that helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects. \n\nHD Movie Mode (720p)\nCapture more of your memories in high definition (720p) video. Record HD movies in 720p high definition MPEG4 format for stunning large-screen home movie playback.5 Record up to 29 minutes (or up to 2 GB) per movie in 720p format. \n\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. \n\n\n\nSweep Panorama mode\nReach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama Mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and ultra-wide options, the camera can take panoramic shots of up to 256 degrees, which goes well beyond the limits of peripheral vision, even capturing areas somewhat behind you. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep. \nCapture breathtaking Panoramic shots \nHigh Sensitivity Mode (ISO 3200)\nHigh ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to seven ISO settings (Auto, 160, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. \n\nIntelligent Auto (iAuto) mode Unlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, and faces, and adjusts settings resulting in clearer images, faces with natural skin tone, and less blur. By incorporating advanced features such as Intelligent Scene Recognition, and Face Detection technology, iAuto mode lets you take advantage of the latest Sony Cyber-shot technology without leaving auto mode. Whether you\u2019re shooting expansive landscapes, capturing playground action, or taking pictures at a birthday party or wedding shower, iAuto mode will optimize your camera\u2019s settings to help ensure you come away with a great shot. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects eight different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Twilight using a tripod, Portrait, Landscape, and Macro. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep. \n\nIntelligent AF\nThanks to Intelligent AF technology, capture fleeting moments like a child\u2019s adorable expression with the ultra-quick AF which locks focus in as little as 0.3-sec. \n\nSmile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with the Smile Shutter feature when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\nFace Detection technology\nSony\u2019s improved Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. \n\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces. \n\nPet Mode\nPet-mode minimizes blur when shooting moving pets utilizing Motion Detection technology and automatically turns off the flash to reduce glowing pet eyes. AF illumination is also disabled so you can take more natural expressions avoiding startling your pets. \n\nDynamic Range Optimizer Standard and Plus\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to help recover shadows and highlights. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and optimizing each area individually. \n\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos.
