I would definitely suggest getting a table or something to lift the game a little higher off the ground. We put it on a wooden crate to create a more dramatic fall at the end of the game. We debated about purchasing the \"bonus blocks\" that are commonly purchased alongside this game. I feel like the wooden crate created enough height for the game and the extra blocks may have been a little much if we had purchased them. Especially due to the amount of small children that were playing the game.",
