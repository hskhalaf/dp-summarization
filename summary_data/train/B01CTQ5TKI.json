I sent it in again and it was repaired. 2 weeks later it came apart at the seam that connects it together. I sent it in again and they would not help me, they said it had physical damage and would not fix or replace it. I spent $96 on a head set that was broken 25% of the time and LG will not stand behind their product to replace it. VERY FRUSTRATING!",

That\u2019s what I had wanted between the prior all soft design and all hard design. Best of both!! Sound is great. Buttons and placement still intuitive and easy. Slimmer.

Maybe more bass if possible. Oh, and they HAD to be retractable! Love that feature. Anyway, plenty with more bass. But, the clarity of the mids and high have spoiled me. I love bass. But, now anything else sounds muddled. So, IMO this is as good as it gets for retractable earbuds. Be very careful because they are fragile. Update: in only a month. This one broke.

However, there was something very wrong with this headset: It had an EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY ...

I know LG can do much better products as opposed to this one that made me felt like if I was scammed with some sort of cheap imitation ... Fortunately, Amazon wa able to take care of the refund for me, but I believe I should still express my disappointment with this particular product quality",

Sometimes it hangs up in the process, other times it just stops working and the call switches to normal phone mode.

The restriction on the pulls of the ear buds are crazy. If you pull one side just know that it\u2019s going to slide right off your neck. It is a lot more restricted than my previous set. It\u2019s only been 2 months and the shielding on the ear bud wires are already stripping off! Very disappointing! This is my second pair of LG\u2019s Bluetooth. Never buying from them again!",

The automated voice just keeps saying, \"Say a command\" and when I ask it to call one of my contacts, it doesn't. That's the only problem with the headset bluetooth.",
