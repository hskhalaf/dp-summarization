They worked but when the skillet was hot, the scrubber seemed to melt every so slightly, and it was hard to get into the grooves on the griddle. The stainless steel cleaner solved both of these problems. It is simple to use -- a quick scouring and the pans are clean, and the grooves on the griddle are quickly cleaned out and the raised portions scrapped clean by the cleaner. I am delighted that I got it, and have ordered one to give to a relative who uses cast iron cookware.",

However, after a thorough cleaning with salt (as an abrasive), a coarse sponge in water, and a few finishing coats with flaxseed oil in the oven, the black residue no longer showed up. At the time of purchase, it was my first time using and getting acquainted with a cast iron pan, so it wasn't long before I needed this scrubber. VERY effective!",
