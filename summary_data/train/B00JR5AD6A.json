So, it's tiny. It's underpowered. The lid isn't 100% secure. It's overpriced. I'm seriously disappointed. Wally's world has a store brand one for half the cost that is serving me way better...",

I had to blend the ingredients in 2 parts and then mix together, due to some ingredients not being broken down/ processed i.e.. frozen strawberries and bananas. The cups/ smoothie containers were efficient, however if a lid or cover for the opening would be better for travel. Had to purchase a different smoothie/ blender due to the longer process in the morning of having to blend the ingredients in batches, then together.",
