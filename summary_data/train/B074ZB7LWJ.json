I also don't think the pink option offers anything different than spraying your face with water. The green one is much nicer and gives me a nice glow.

This stuff is great for me because it\u2019s quick to use in the morning. I just spray and go. It doesn\u2019t moisturize nearly as well as an actual face lotion, but it gets the job done when I\u2019d normally just go without. Both scents smell great and dry fairly quickly. It only takes a couple squirts for your entire face so I suspect the bottle will last quite a while.",
