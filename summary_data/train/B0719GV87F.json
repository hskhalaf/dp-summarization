      "text": "I bought this ball exclusively as a birthing ball. I used it at home to sit on while at the table or even just watching TV. I could sit longer without my lower back hurting, and in the 3rd trimester I would kneel on the floor and lay my head on the ball. This helped take the pressure of my back and also helps the baby fall into the right position for birth (from what I've read). When you do get it.. be ready for an arm workout as the pump is manual and takes a little while to pump up.. my husband and i took turns!",

I bought two, one for me size 65\" (I'm 5'4\") and one for my hubby size 75\" (he's 6'2\"), they are a great size and we use them as desk chairs, exercise equipment and fun rough housing toys to play with our kids with!!! I would recommend these SmarterLife balls to anyone who is looking for an environmentally friendly, extremely strong and quality product.",

Also, I was expecting the \"measuring tape\" to actually have numbers on it but it's basically just black tape. Not a huge deal but the picture on Amazon is misleading since it shows numbers. I'm sure the ball itself is great, but unfortunately I can't use it without an air pump.",

They personally sent me an email to know follow up on the order I made and how I felt about their product. That was so thoughtful of them. I am really impressed with the quality of this wonderful exercise ball and would highly highly highly recommend it to anyone. The shipping was quick and it arrived on time. That is very important to me. I am proud to give them 5 star and would love to give them more as they really exceeded my expectations.",

The new pump worked fine and i was quickly able to inflate the ball to the size specified by the tape measure. I haven't really used the ball yet, but it seems fine.",

Its tactile lines blend with the smooth, hypoallergenic surface to provide comfortable, non-slip contact with your skin without the sticky feel.",
