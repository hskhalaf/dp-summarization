This seat doesn't have a true lever/button to disconnect the seat from the base. When you do get it undone you have to tilt the seat so far forward that my son's head went flopping forward so hard I was scared we hurt him. There seems to be no padding whatsoever and the straps are difficult to adjust. You have to push a button on the back of the seat where the straps exit and pull each strap individually. Definitely would not reccomend this seat to anyone.",
