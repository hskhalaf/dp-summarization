This seems to be very professional, and there is no problem with the heavy-duty tripods. The wheels are made of metal and are durable. The best thing is that the wheels are almost silent and they also have a lock. I mean something that fixes the wheel like a brake. Once folded, it can be carried directly or loaded into a bag case. I highly recommend it.",

When I'm live streaming my shows I'm constantly moving camera and light equipment around and sometimes it takes time to adjust and effects my audience's patience. But with these I can slide the tripods on my hardwood floors, no scratches or squeaking with the rubber wheels. Legs can extend and spread to fit any tripod base, the screw in clamp keeps the feet in place. Push down locks on the wheels help to keep the dolly in place when I'm done moving it. I'm very satisfied with them and recommend them to any serious cammer!",

The dolly is fairly strong but not for heavy equipment. This could have been a 5-star if the locking mechanisms were not plastic - metal would really have impressed me. You may have to be a little (just a little) careful with the locking mechanism and it looks like it will last. Contrary to some other comments, the wheels are fine. You can't eliminate bumps if the floor not smooth - simple physics. BOTTOM LINE: It's worth it if you really need it.",
