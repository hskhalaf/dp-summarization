I do have to experiment with how they handle the Google assistant. The audio quality is at least stereo Hi-fi, and the earbuds paired easily with both my phone and laptop. Wireless charging and having a large backup power source for the phone are terrific features.",

You can change the size of the rubber bud so you shouldn't have a problem fitting your ears. So far this was worth the cost instead of paying $200 for higher AirPods. Great Job!",

Cant say about the waterproof function yet. If I'm cleaning around the house or something while using them I only wear one, because they absolutely are noise cancelling and I couldn't hear my kids otherwise. Definitely recommend. Editing my review. I've been using these headphones regularly, I'm impressed with the sound. However, now only one will connect at a time. I dont know why or what happened. I've reset them. Tried everything in the manual. I'm exchanging them for a new pair.",

The plug type pod gives really good passive noise reduction enabling you to hear your music even in noisy environments (including airplanes). As others have noted, from time to time the left pod will lose connection, albeit only very briefly and then it restores on its own. I\u2019m definitely not an audiophile, so I have no comment about the quality of the sound. Overall, 4 stars",

Because of the water resistance rating, I am not worried if water splashes on my ears. (To be clear: I do not swim in these. I am working out in chest-deep water). They pair immediately with my Android phone. I switched out the earbuds for one of the smaller sizes for a more comfortable fit. When I get home, I pop the entire case on my wireless charger. They also paired easily with my desktop computer. For the price, very pleased.",

Then I discovered that there is no volume control on the earbuds. I cannot control the volume from the TV for the earbuds.

So even though they are rated as IPX8 for being waterproof, they are not useful if you want to swim with them or us them in the shower",

They have proven to be waterproof, and secure when placed firmly in the ears. The charging case can charge the ear buds at least three times. I had to remove one star because the range is a bit limited, and the battery life on each charge is pretty low, at about 3 hours of playback. However, at this price point, the sound is comparable to ear buds at three times the cost, so the battery and range issues can be somewhat forgiven.",
