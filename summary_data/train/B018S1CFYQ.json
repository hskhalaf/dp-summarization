When being stored, it\u2019s hard to keep the faucet and pieces all together. I put it all in a gallon-size ziplock and taped it to the underside which seeks to work for now but a travel/carry bag would be awesome.",

Only problem was the first time out of the box to use today it was missing a screw for the drain. Hardware store closed so found a makeshift screw to place the drain. Would appreciate if seller could send us the right screw for the table drain.",

Not only does the table make cleaning fish and other game much less of a chore, it also allows you to keep everything organized and clean. I use this table several times a month at my house and even take it on the beach with me when surf fishing. I always clean it well and it has remained very durable. I would recommend not using the drain hose because it will clog easily. Instead I place a small bucket under the drain hole and that works well. Take care of it and it will make your life easier for years to come!",

And no, when you open the legs it doesn't help, it makes it worse as it is the corner where the legs attach. It is not possible to hand hand tighten with any sore of ease. Faucet would be better at middle edge of table where legs open and leave plenty of room to use both hands. The other features (thickness, ease, and weight) are okay, however ,the rating system does not include rating the facet or drain. which in itself is a red flag. Buy a table with the faucet in the center edge.",
