The Batman, Batwoman, and Omac characters are fun additions to his Lego collection, and I am sure his brothers will be attempting to use them too. The light up brick is a nice feature that makes the Brother Eye bot more sinister as the kids used their imaginations to battle. Omac's little shooting pieces were fun. One of the best parts is the bat plane. Overall great kit that can stand alone or enhance an existing collection.",
