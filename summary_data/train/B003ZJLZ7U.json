Unlike the cheaper swiveling grass shears I tried previously, the blades on these do not flop around - they're fixed, and they're much longer and sturdier. This makes all the difference in ease of use. I caught up with a couple months' worth of weeds in about a week, and now my neighbors aren't glaring at me anymore. I'm old and not that strong and they were easy to use, and so far maintenance has just been wiping off the blades when grass sticks to them.",

It is a bit heavy for an old person or a person with weaker arms. I will keep it for now as I do have use for it. Hopefully it will perform. A customer should not be making adjustments to a new tool.

I loved the old shears in spite of its design deficiencies, which had all been addressed by the time this model was designed. It's the perfect height, it works well, and it seems well designed and made. If there's a reason a similar one should cost twice as much, I can't imagine what it is.",
