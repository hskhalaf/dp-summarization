The LCD color display is fantastic (bright, easy to read, nice resolution). The device feels solid in your hand (does not feel cheap) and I like the rubber bumper which protects the unit from accidental drops. I feel this is a great value as compared to what you can find from Harbor Freight or Home Depot. Great value for the features this device contains. I am recommending this device for anyone in the market for a low cost OBD Scan Tool.",

Normally the cats themselves would be suspected, but were in reality working as they should in this case. Tightened up the bolts, cleared the code, and now it has been running over a thousand miles with no more code issues.",

It showed me that there was a pinpoint leak in the system. Not only that, I was able to reset the computer which neither garage was able to do.

Went on e-bay bought the part for $35. Removed two bolts on old valve, replaced with new one and presto all better!!! Saved my self $1000 dollars!!!! For gods sake just to keep your mechanic honest, even if you can't do the work yourself, never get taken again and invest $68 for piece of mind. WEEE NOW I CAN GO ON A LITTLE VACATION TO FLORIDA, AS I DRIVE BY MY MECAHNIC I'LL GIVE HIM THE FINGER!!",

      "text": "Autel is a great brand. At our shop we have Autels that cost several thousands of dollars. This scanner does pretty much everything that other scanners do that cost up to a thousand dollars. Autel is a great brand and a great bargain. I'd recommend this to any tech starting out or a Lanuch scanner if you can get a good price on one. Those two scanners will get you well beyond most scan tools as far as ability to access mode6 and get pins that other scanners will not. Especially on imports. Have used to great extent on a Skyline and several Mercedes.",

I know some auto parts places will check the OBD II codes for free and clear them (mine would not), however, my service center charges $80 to read the codes. So I ordered this to see the problem myself- sure enough- that was the issue. Cleared the codes myself and can now check the health of my 3 cars anytime I like. Very nice product and really, really easy to use.",

I tested this scanner already on three vehicles of mine and does exactly what it says it does. I am sure you can purchase a more high end one, but for this price its a good deal with a color screen, USB cable, CD software, instruction manual in only English and a nice carrying case to top it off. Its the little stuff that makes me write a review and this OBD scanner is worth it, looks durable too.",
