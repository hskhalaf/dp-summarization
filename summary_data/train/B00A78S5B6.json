It turns itself off automatically if it tips over or is on an unlevel surface. This is the little heater that could! It warms up his room nicely and we will be buying another for our bathroom.",

      "text": "I used this as a heater in my bathroom. I liked that it had the safety switch if it got knocked over and it put out a good amount of heat. About a week ago it started to have a burning smell and now it won\u2019t turn in at all. I bought it in September of this year. It barely lasted 3 months! The manufacturer warranty is a joke. I\u2019d have to pay $25 to send it in for repair. Since I paid less than $20 to buy it initially, that\u2019s not happening. Definitely disappointed.",
