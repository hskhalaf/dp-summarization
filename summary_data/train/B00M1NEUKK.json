They said if you leave it on, as the battery gets weaker and weaker it can damage the unit so it won't work Can you believe that!! What a piece of expensive junk, almost cost me $300.

      "text": "I bought this specifically for long frilghts; however, I used them every day at the office and at home. I can say that they are very comfortable headphones for long wear and that the sound is great. Additionally, the noise canceling feature works great. Nonetheless, they are headphones that didn't last over the year and considering how expensive they are I think that's completely unacceptable. I'm switching to Sony and see how that works out cause the worse part is, Bose's customer service sucks and they won't do anything about it.",

My only concern is what others have stated about the headphone build quality especially surrounding the ear cups. You can easily see that small wire that attaches each one, and with repeated use many people have complained about the loss of sound altogether. I ended up purchasing the additional warranty so hopefully that will cover any issue that may arise from it. I really hope they don't go bad like many others - because coupled with the AirMod Wireless Bluetooth Adapter, these things are right on par with the more expensive QC35's.",

Comfortable to wear for 5-6 hours. The one ANNOYING thing is the audio cable is not \"standard\". It's smaller. So, if anything ever happens to the cable (like gets left on the plane of cut somehow), you can't just pop down to the store and get a new one. NOBODY carries this size in a store. And, they cost more. I am really glad I bought these headphones.",

Also this is a known issue apparently that is in the reviews that I did not see prior to purchase. Better off purchasing something newer.",
