I'm a little worried about what the wires on top are painted with though because she likes to bite it. Also the thing can tip over pretty easily when she stands up and holds the wires. I know it's not meant to be used like that, but babies will do weird things. She's fallen backwards a few times already, but i think she's learned not to do it anymore.",

This hexagon shape had kept that from happening so far. Also, the quality is fantastic and the size is perfect! I'm so glad I took a chance on this one this time!",

Again, I must say that the craftsmanship on this is amazing. I only paid around $70 here on Amazon for this and I feel that it was worth every penny.

I will also monitor her closely with the magnetic pieces until she grows into this toy more. The overall construction is beautiful.

    "title": "EverEarth Garden Activity Cube. Wood Shape & Color Sorter, Bead Maze & Counting Baby Toy",
    "description": "The EverEarth Wooden Garden Activity Cube is a global best seller and is highly stimulating creative learning cube which has moving beads, maze, shape sorter, abacus, moving cogs, counting blocks one to ten and many more moving parts \u2013 no surface is left empty! Perfect to encourage socialising and sharing as friends can play too, to develop fine motor skills together. Made from high quality Beech and fully tested to European standards, this product is suitable for children age 18 Months +. It is also 100% FSC certified Beech and tested to EN71 standards so it is safe and durable for your child to play with.\n\nEDUCATIONAL FEATURES:\n\nTHINKING SKILLS - Figuring out how things work is one of the best parts of play. Simple challenges to more challenging ones can help in this area. Thinking Skills are mental processes we use to do things like: solve problems, make decisions, ask questions, construct plans, evaluate ideas, organise information and create objects.\n\nSHAPE RECOGNITION - Learning about the different shapes that exist not only broadens their knowledge of shapes but helps develop their fine motor skills as well as spacial recognition.\n\nPROBLEM SOLVING - Figuring out how things work are one of the best parts of play. Simple challenges to more challenging ones can help in this area.\n\nCOMMUNICATION SKILLS -By role-playing, and interacting with others through play, children can begin to develop their communication skills and start to understand social interaction in a better way.\n\nSOCIAL SKILLS -Feeling confident about yourself and being able to share your thoughts are essential to children\u2019s development. Play can naturally do that.\n\nCREATIVITY - Using their imagination and creativity can assist children to see the world in a new way. This helps them to become great thinkers.\n\nHAND TO EYE COORDINATION - Teaches grasping and holding skills which leads to success in school and beyond.\nSPORTS - Hand eye co-ordination can help your child to catch a ball and hit a ball with a bat.\nHANDWRITING - Visual-motor integration, which is a vital skill for handwriting, grows out of a good hand-eye co-ordination base. The eyes need to guide the hand in forming the letters and making sure they stay within the lines.\nREADING - Eye tracking skills, which are vital for reading, can be developed through games and activities used for hand eye coordination.\nPLAY AND LIFE SKILLS - Young children use this skill in learning to stack towers, build with bricks etc, and we even use hand eye coordination to tie shoelaces and frost cakes.\n\nEVEREARTH - THE STORY\n\nFor over 39 years, EverEarth has been a global leader in the design, supply and manufacture of inventive wooden toys and gifts.\nWe use this strength to promote environmental care and sustainability in all we do, so that our world will be vibrant and full of life, well into the future.
