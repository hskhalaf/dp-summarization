You can reach back and bounce the unit by hand while driving, but resulting dispersal of material is still sketchy.",

Item took a little bit to put together and perhaps the directions could use some clarification but the item was well packed, all the hardware well marked and this piece is well made. The 175# hopper is huge and you need to refill very little with this spreader. It is overall well constructed and is made more heavy duty than others I have seen. I used it only once but was well impressed. It sure beat pushing a Scot's spreader by hand over 2 acres!",

Then I added the agitator. Same result. I called Brinly for help and the tech suggested using some weed trimmer string in place of the agitator. This didn't work and in fact caused the spinner to lock and the little plastic gears in the transmission failed. I'm sure the product will work nicely with granular products. The unit seems pretty sturdy and held up just fine with the full 175 lbs. in the hopper. Unfortunately, I couldn't recommend this unit to spread any fine grained product.",

The best part of assembly was that the instructions would call for a part, and it was right there in the blister pack. Research indicates that the only anticipated problem is with the settings vibrating closed during use, but two home remedies have been suggested, as well. At this point it seems like a good investment.",
