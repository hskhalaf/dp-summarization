It contains a pouch with case for the Switch, a compartment to hold the dock or other large peripherals, a slot for the charger and another compartment to hold your Joy-Con grip or pro controller plus game case. The material appears to be quite durable but I won't know until I use it for longer than a week. I plan to travel a lot with this and will update my post if there are any long term issues. So far I am satisfied with this product.",

I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of this bag and the device case it includes. It is definitely something I can trust to protect the Switch and its gear. The structure inside is perfect for staying organized and carrying anything we might need, if we take it along on a trip. For now (short periods of time) I just use the small hard case the bag comes with and toss the switch in my purse. The hard case is so well-made. We definitely reccomend this bag for anyone looking for this style of carrying case.",

I am unsure why, but I thought that it would be a bit smaller, half it's size actually, it's the size of a laptop case, I was thinking more of a small purse. All in all, it's a pretty decent case, there's space for the dock, that was the main selling point for me. There is also a separate case for the switch console. Only downside is that it doesn't offer much space for anything else such as games ect, and with the size being bigger than I expected it should offer more room.",

The only thing I would recommend is to purchase a small portable case for your games as that's not included in the bag.",

It measures 6.5\"x5\"x2\". As small as the cartridge case is it doesn't fit ANYWHERE in this bag unless you leave something out. It's ok for a system but what will you play? I can't recommend it as a carry-all for your system. Look elsewhere.",

The bag is soft so be careful when carrying it it wouldn't hold well against a drop or banging into things.",
