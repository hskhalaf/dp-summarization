I tried them on and could hardly hear my kids yelling on Christmas morning... haha... these may get used around the house more than at the range! ;) F.y.i.

I really don't think they work for shooting clays, but they might be fine for other shooting sports. On the other hand their noise reduction is great, even when I wear my sunglasses (which admittedly have a very thin titanium frame - other shooting glasses might not work as well). As one would suspect, your ears will get very hot and sweaty compared to wearing just ear plugs.",

I've tried other very fancy and expensive earpro and both the comfort and fit didnt work for me. These are perfectly! I highly recommend this reliable and affordable product!!",

Companies like 3M will provide an Attenuation chart showing the rating of their hearing protection depending on the Hz. For example, a handgun will give about 1000 Hz of noise. Which will be different then shooting an AR rifle. Don't just base the hearing protection off what the company states. Buy from a company that will provide their testing results. With that said, I used these at an indoor shooting range (shooting a 9 mm handgun) and they did a goo job with additional foam ear plugs.",

One extra bit of customer service.... \"Dave\" from the company contacted me to ask how I like the product. He also explained the snugness is an important part of what gives these earmuffs their rating for 34db. These fold up and fit in my gun case, perfectly. I would, absolutely, recommend these to anyone to purchase. The price, the quality, and the extra customer service gives them MORE than a 5 star.... can we say 10?",

      "text": "Yes, these are tight, and yes these need to be stretched. That aside, these earmuffs will protect your ears in situations where you're exposed to continuous loud music or playing. Watch a Johan Segeborn video on You Tube, and you'll notice that he nearly always uses heavy-duty earmuffs while playing loud (or even not so loud) amps. However, if you need full-range, detailed perception at lower volumes -- if you need to hear conversation or if you're responsible for front-of-house mixes or something along those lines -- you might consider plugs that offer a bit less protection.",

I wore them for over an hour and had no discomfort. The company seems to be very quality orientated and cares about delivering a quality product. One's hearing is very important and once you lose it, it cannot be regained. Take care of your ears. I highly recommend these Ear Protectors.",

What a fabulous product and company, a pleasure to purchase from them. I would absolutely recommend this product. Very affordable, not huge, which is nice being a women, and a quality product.",
