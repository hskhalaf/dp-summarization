I built my own varmint guards out of 1 x 1 rabbit fence, and that is doing the trick. Otherwise, no complaints. Mine have taken a beating from raccoons, deer, and 70+ mph winds, and stood through it all. I would definitely recommend to anyone - just buy some rabbit wire and plan on building your own varmint guards before you ever put your new feeders out. That's kind of a pain which is why I only gave this product 3 stars.",

I have sent emails as well but no luck. I'm done and will not be purchasing any of their products again. I also have their wireless camera which is NOT up to snuff with other cameras on the market at the same price point. Very disappointed in a company I thought was an industry leader.",

I got it working by shaking it, I think there are a lot of cob pieces in this load. Need a stronger motor.",
