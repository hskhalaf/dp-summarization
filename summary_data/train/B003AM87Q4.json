I have a decent tripod so I decided to go for the 25x70. Attached picture shows the 4 moons, a bit fuzzier than it should be since I was holding my phone by hand. The 25x70 really needs to be used with a tripod. Also the Barska mount is very good, much better than the one included. If you already have a tripod, get an upgraded mount and you\u2019ll be happy with the 25x70.",

Instead of spending half the cost of a the unit to ship it and then HOPE they will repair it, I'm going to find a replacement from another company.",

Like others have said eye cups are too big and dont fit well over bridge of nose. I returned these. Pay attention to the more negative reviews.

I tried to extend the connection to the tripod adapter to have it somehow balanced (closer to the center of mass- see the 1inch spacer attached to the binoculars body and to adapter) - this helped a bit, but because of the design flaw described in (1) due to vibrations/instability sky watching at night was impossible.

This is probably a compromise by the manufacturer to provide a wider field of view, and, since most observing is done near the center, the out of focus edges are less of an issue.

      "text": "I searched and came across the good feedback on these. I liked the specs so decided to go with it. For the price, I'm very happy. They are light enough to hold which I love. I tried some binoculars my dad had and you cannot hold them because they were SO heavy. Also, it was very difficult to move his around because the tripod was also heavy. Getting back to these, I would buy again if I had to. I now live up and have a city view. This is why I purchased these. You can see things in the distance that you cannot see by eye...... It really is amazing.",

The magnification is certainly the strongest I have seen, but the binocular vision is off so that there are two images floating near each other. You can't really tell if the image is good or not. With the magnification as strong as it is, everything is very wiggly. You'll want a very heavy duty tripod for a still image. I'm seeking support from Celestron, so I'll edit the review if and when that process is complete.",
