I have some collectable hammered aluminum trays and bowls and cleaning them with this allows me to display them with pride. This was my second purchase. It lasts a long time and is good for any kind of stainless or aluminum. It cleans other stuff too. My stove top looks amazing after using it. It's some sort of heat proof black enamel paint. I'd get it again if I ran out.",

However, it does require some effort to remove them. But, for the trade off between a not very effective cleaner and some elbow grease that won't harm the surface and removes the burn on spills, there is no contest",
