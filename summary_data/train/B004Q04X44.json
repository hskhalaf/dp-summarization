Goes from just warm air all the way up to melt your skin off hot. I bought a soft nylon tool bag to put mine in, $8 here on Amazon. If your looking for a good heat gun at an extremely affordable price, this is the way to go. Definitely beats Dewalt, which is $100+.",

Only 2 things I don't love are the size (its larger than 80% of heat guns I've ever used) and the smell.

The wiring and plug are top quality and I have no doubt it will last a very long time. NOTE: It does not come with tips for the heat gun. It isn't supposed to either. There are tips to purchase if you need them for your specific task. The owners manual has part numbers for those if you wish. There are other brands of heat guns, but if you're looking for quality, this is a great one at a good price.",
