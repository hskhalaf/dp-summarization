I do miss the easier reverse button since this one is small and the 4th of 4 similar buttons on the front. I attached a clear raised rubber bottom on it just to keep from hitting the wrong button. Would have been nice to have a case but I'll order that later. For some fabrics it pays to either hold the threads behind for the 1st stitches but I'm getting more in the habit of using stitch swatches before and after. You'll be happy to have that automatic needle threader. Overall, very happy with this purchase.",

It worked great the first few times I used it... and then I've had nothing but problems! I keep getting loops on the back of my fabric and turning the tension dial changes nothing! I've done everything the book says to do to troubleshoot! I'm going to call Janome to see if there's anything else I can do, otherwise I'm returning the machine!!",

This one, I cannot even explain, what a pleasure it gives me when it glides with ease. So far I hemmed several moleskin trousers and jeans, made a cover for the piano, and did a lot of little tailoring. I did a research before I bought it and I agree this one is the best for one like me not an advanced more like a beginner in sewing.",

This machine has great features, it is perfect for the beginner, and continues to be just as perfect for the duration of ownership!",

While it's stitches and sounds are normal, the lock stitch makes holes in all thicknesses of fabric, the bobbin thread was a pia to pull up - not automatic, and it pulls/feeds to one side. I fought to keep fabric feeding straight. So sad about Janome, because I am also done with Brother machines. Neeeext!",
