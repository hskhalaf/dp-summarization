Being deployed can be tough on my skin and pores with the constant dust and sand. I normally have very dirty pores but it's gotten worse since being here. I went for a run in 110 degrees with 90% humidity and exfoliated right after. I immediately put the strip on, let it dry for 15 mins, and was astonished by how much came out. My nose has never felt this smooth. You can see my pictures and judge for yourself how well these worked. Get these, don't get biore.",

I followed the instructions but after putting the strip on my wet nose, I also patted it with wet fingers to increase the moisture and sticking power. After 10-15 mins this lil strip pulled out the gunk and it felt refreshing. I think the strips have a menthol or astringent additive because it felt awesome! I'd post a pic but I think lots of reviewers have shown what these awesome strips can do. Also there are so many in a package! This far surpasses biore and their \"sample\" pack. Will buy again once I get close to running out of these.",

Once it adheres it sticks well and when pulling off there is resistance (which is what you want) but it doesn't hurt to peel. I recommend peeling the strips straight (90\u00b0 angle) and slowly. The quantity to price ratio is awesome as well. My husband and I both can use these and get results. The biore strips would only get a little of my husband's black heads.",

Unfortunately, the smell of the strips is terrible & it doesn't really get stiff or take out that many blackheads. It seems to only get stiff & take out blackheads on the side of my nose only. I'm not impressed with this product at all and will go back to using the strips I get at CVS",
