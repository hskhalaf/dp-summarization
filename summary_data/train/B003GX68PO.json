Yesterday this happened to the medium weight and we were unable to locate the side disc cap in the pool so now I'm unable to use the dumbell. Very disappointed in this product.",

I decided to not use them during the class but stay afterwards for about 30 minutes and go through my routine. The only negative issue is they do hurt my hands if I don't take a few minutes between each exercise. But who would complain spending a few extra minutes in the pool.",
