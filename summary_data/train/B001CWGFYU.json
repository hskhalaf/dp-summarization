      "text": "I have used this for almost 7 years when they first came out. Palladio somehow pulled them put of the market, so I was delighted to find them in amazon. I will be buying more. It is like a sharpie for your lips, easy to apply, last long hours and the shade goes well with almost any nude lipcolor, glosses, or just by itself to add definition to the lips.",
