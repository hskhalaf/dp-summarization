Your chances of getting something that gets broken in transit isn't 0%, but from my positive experience with this board, I'd say go for it if you're in the same situation (reading reviews, getting nervous, not sure if you should get one at all)",

But as far as the board itself is beautiful. Great quality! I love the color! And it\u2019s very magnetic! Thank you for producing this. I just hate that the carriers were careless about it. I\u2019ll probably buy another one soon.",
