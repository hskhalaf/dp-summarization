I had to purchase a thicker pad & cover to use the board. Though I purchased a thicker pad & cover, the ironing board is now rusted (I use the steam setting for most ironing). Also, the latch that allows you to open & fold down the legs no longer works, so this board takes up a lot of space when I'm not using it! I would not purchase this again as I feel I wasted my money.",

The one mechanism is a little tricky to get used to at first and requires some strong pulling, but I don't have any qualms with the quality. The fabric does say \"assembled in Mexico of fabric made in the U.S.A,\" and there are no markings on the frame, nor was any packaging included to verify if it was made in the USA. However, the craftsmanship does seem top quality (definitely not from China), and given that Homz seems to pride themselves on being a US manufacturer, I tend to think that it was, I just can't verify for certain.",

      "text": "This is made of of sturdy, durable materials, is very stable, and the board is at an appropriate height for a small or tall person. Cloth material is thick and with enough grip to iron smoothly, without marks staying in your ironed clothes. Hold over 20 hangers easily on the side, and basket below below can hold a large amount of clothing. Folds easily and fits in any laundry closet (even a Boston laundry closet!).",
