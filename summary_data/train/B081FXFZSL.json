I do a lot of programming, game and web development, graphic design and video editing. Since getting one of this MacBook my productivity has skyrocketed. MacOS is so easy to work with and all apps are running so reliably. I regret not going for a 32GB model since I'm constantly running at 10GB RAM but even with that, I have never had an issue with slowness of running my apps. If you want a Mac at a good price a bit cheaper than the retail price, this reseller can deliver!",

Twice the cores that run at around the same clock speed in normal use, 4x the storage, twice the RAM, significantly better keyboard, noticeably better battery performance and all for less than \u00a31000 more. I use the machine as my main computer and dock it to two monitors most of the time and it works perfectly. Much better than having a full-size desktop and smaller MacBook. For a few hundred extra too, the i9 model seems to be a much better deal, and the improved graphics card can comfortably run most games.",
