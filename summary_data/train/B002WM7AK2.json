      "text": "Replacing a clock you have had for 20 years is ruff. We searched and shopped. We narrowed it down to a choice of 3. We decided on this clock for it's \"muted\" colors, the pendulum, and the price. Most other clocks were way over priced for the same wood and battery operation. This clock arrived yesterday and I unwrapped, added a battery, set the time and added the pendulum all myself, without any instructions included. EASY! Hung the clock and it's working like a charm. It has an ever so quiet and nice tick, it looks fantastic in the living room and seems to be keeping time wonderfully. I'm very pleased with my choice and the $ spent. Yay Me!",

I heard of some elements that radiates and can cause cancer; i don't know if this chemical is one of these elements, we need explanations!",
