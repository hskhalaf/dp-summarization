I was just wearing a t-shirt while I tried it on and it was slightly on the large side....BUT if i had a thick long sleeve shirt on like in the winter, I could still wear it and have a perfect fit! So, im quite happy with it! I will edit this review as I wear it and use it. Another thing, its on the heavy side...probably because its made from good thick material... Maybe as heavy as a thick winter coat! So, you want light and feel the heat or a bit heavy and still be handle the toaster?",
