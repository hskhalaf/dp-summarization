On several occasions, I have accidentally redialed a phone number by hitting other buttons when trying to turn off the headset. This may be just an issue for me, but I never had that same problem with other headsets. The answer/end call button is to sensitive. It is to easily depressed by unintentional contact. Having said all of that, the headset does work decently for the price. If you need a Bluetooth headset to use in an average environment that is not to noisy, it will do fine.",

Used many hours before it needs re-charging. I love the spoken warning that the battery is about to run out. Fast re-charging with iPhone charger. Have not determined how far from the phone it should be, before it disconnects. Good for multi-tasking. Using headset while phone is being charged at the same time. Cannot be used and charged at the same time (? per instruction). Needs hook to keep in place on ear. Having trouble without the hook, falls out easily. Afraid might lose it without the hook. Highly recommend this, considering the price.",
