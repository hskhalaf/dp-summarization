Regardless of the oddity of being told to buy these by a dog possessing a voice mildly reminiscent of Boris Karloff, Lonnie Dog really enjoys them.

I'm guessing the manufacturers aren't really picky about the state of the livers they use. Or maybe all liver looks like that. I think they are icky but the dogs have a very different opinion. At least they are not messy. I will probably buy them again.",

I love the product but am VERY DISAPPOINTED with this last bag! I know they must use different sources but this last source will ruin their reputation. I will try one last bag and if it is as poor as the last one that will be it!",

Most pieces are also easy to break into smaller bits although once in a while you get these monster thick ones. The only downside is they'll stink up your coat pocket! They are very aromatic.",
