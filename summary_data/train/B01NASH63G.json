I also love the cute prints on the diapers. These diapers are very absorbent and they do not contain that funky gel that other diapers do when wet. I will mention, the panda print diapers seem to run smaller than all other prints....",

And, they frequently, ironically, have spots where they are not connected to the next wipe. It's feast or famine. Frustrating. I will not be buying them again based completely on that.

I love that I don\u2019t have to double up, it wipes my baby bottom clean and it smells great. The quality is a 10/10!! Thank you The Honest Company!!!!!!",

      "text": "I have several Honest products I love, but I couldn\u2019t hate these wipes more. I\u2019ve never cursed so much changing diapers! The texture of the wipe means when you pull one out, they stick to each other and you get a chain of 2, or 3, or 4, and they won\u2019t.let.go.of.each.other so you have to shake and flap them around until they fly all over the room, all while trying to keep your baby from peeing or pooping on you. They aren\u2019t wet enough, so they dry out super fast and I\u2019ve thrown SO many away. SO disappointed and SO glad that my normal favorite brand is back in stock!!",
