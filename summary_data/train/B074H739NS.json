In the pictures, we have a 16\" diameter round of cedar that it split with ease. The only time it got bound up was when we had a knot right where it was splitting, and all we had to do was flip the log around, and it had no issue. We have split 2 cords or so with it already... it makes life so easy! The stand is a back saver too. Love it!",

Even when splitting by hand I've always let my wood age for at least 6 months before splitting. As long as you understand what your getting this is a great tool for the price.

      "text": "With the help of a friend, I split around 5 face cords of oak with this splitter. This tool is amazing for the price. It is a little awkward to move around if you use the included stand. We tried it both with and without the stand. Without the stand it is much more stable and easier to move around on a dirt surface. With the stand, it is much easier on your back but more top heavy. If mine stopped working the next time I used it, I would buy another one exactly like it. I can't believe it survived everything I threw at it.",

Great value, been using it for about a month now, worked great even on tough oak logs",

      "text": "Electric log splitter arrived in two days; what a world we live in. Splitter is an absolute warrior. Assembly of the stand was quick and easy, plugged in with a 12/3 drop cord and I was splitting. Going through a 12\u2019 dump bed of very knotty oak on day 1 and the machine never hesitated. The power is amazing and tore through many gnarly pieces of oak. I can\u2019t believe how great a machine this is for under $300. Great job WEN! Go get one, you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

I was looking for a quiet, easy to use log splitter and decided to take the plunge with this WEN unit. I'm glad I did. It was easy to set up and works perfectly. Unlike some, it has sturdy legs to bring it up to a useable height. I would definately reccomend it to anyone who wants a well made unit. No fuss with gas and the noise associated with it. It won't make you a logger but at 80 years old I'm beyond that.",

    "description": "Remember when you had 13,000 pounds of log-cracking pressure all in the palm of your hands? Quickly transform logs into firewood with the WEN 6.5-Ton Electric Log-Splitter with Stand. This unit features a powerful 15-amp 2.5 horsepower motor to make easy work of logs up to 10 inches in diameter and 20.5 inches in length. Install the included stand to elevate the cradle 34 inches off of the floor or assemble the wheels directly to the body of the log splitter for a low-profile design that sits directly on the ground. Forget the hassles and expenses that come with gasoline-powered alternatives. An electric log splitter means you will never have to worry about cold starts or clogged carburetors again. With a 20-second cycle time, a 14.75-inch cylinder stroke, a 16-square-inch push plate, and a 5-inch wedge, you\u2019ll be able to take on even the hardest of woods. Two-handed operation maximizes user safety while the fume-free design eliminates carbon monoxide and other toxic emissions. Easily transport your splitter from the shed to the forest with the onboard pull handle and the two never-flat 5.5-inch wheels. And, because it\u2019s a WEN product, your log splitter comes backed by a two-year warranty, a nationwide network of skilled service technicians and a friendly customer help line. Remember when you had enough firewood to keep your family warm all winter? Remember WEN.",
