I got the one with the canopy just because it is great to be able to have some shade if needed. The canopy does act as a sail so be aware and be prepared. I kept it out over night for 2 nights, by 3rd day it needed some more air as to be expected. Can not speak for customer service cuz haven\u2019t had to use them. I went with intex brand bcs I have a couple of their air mattresses and have really liked them.",

There is also netting where the bench seating is so you don't have to worry about falling in the water, it is the best!",

Once christened (HMS Floaty McFloatface) and launched, we anchored it in shallow water and left it floating for 2.5 days in windy conditions; the sunshade stayed put. Advertised capacity is 6, but it comfortably accommodates 9 people without losing pressure. Be advised: even after using the inflator in reverse mode to evacuate all the air, it isn't possible to compress the float enough to fit it back into the box, so save yourself the time/effort and use a garbage bag or something.",

      "text": "The raft is sturdy and can hold 5-6 people comfortably. Check the box before fully opening it for all the parts. It came with the attachment for the canopy but no canopy was in the box and neither was the anchor pouch. It is hard to put back in the box once it is fully opened. So you\u2019ll need a large area to store it once you\u2019re done using it. Also it is heavy to move around it takes at least 2 adults to move/carry the raft. I would not recommend this for a beach. Unless you have a portable air compressor. It took 1hr to inflate using a regular electric air compressor.",
