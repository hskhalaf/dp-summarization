They have the exact same weight range in the exact same increments as the bowflex but you save $200! They're also very sturdy which could be an improvement over the bowflex also (I'd read complaints about plastic parts breaking on those). The only disadvantage is that it does take a little longer to switch weights, but not enough to throw off my 30 minute lifting routine, and especially worth it considering the cost savings. I read some helpful reviews that convinced me to buy these and I hope this review does the same for someone else!",

Beside those small details, it's a A+ in my books.",

Star screw sometimes loosens up if you are into intense dumbell movements . Not a great problem. Overall 4/5 considering the pros & cons. Great budget dumbells.",

      "text": "These are great for your home fitness area. I couldn't justify buying a whole set of dumbbells when I go to the gym regularly anyway. This is a great compromise and the weights are easy to change. I also bought a small weight rack to make storing and changing the weights even easier. The quality is great and I would recommend them to anyone who doesn't have the space or money for an entire set of dumbbells.",
