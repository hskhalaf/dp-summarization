It can be converted into a coffee table as well, but my kids like the printed side better. The only issue we have is when a child is sitting close to the table, and the drawer is being opened/closed, the feet can get scratched by the sides or get stuck in the space underneath the drawer. My boys learned quickly to not keep their feet too close to or under the table. Other than that, its fantastic!",

Typical fiber board construction with a few paint blemishes. The frame all just snaps together, which makes it difficult to pick up and move once assembled. We figure on using our furniture sliders for future movement. Otherwise, I think the kids will love it. It looks very engaging for them and decently built for the price I paid.",

The flow of the track is great and really well designed. Pushing the trains in either direction takes you through the whole course. It is a pretty big table, not that this is a con in any way but there are some sections my four year old has to stretch to reach so if considering for a younger child it might be something to keep in mind.
