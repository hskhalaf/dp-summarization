Just a little weird not being able to see a screen or number for volume. U see a couple of blinks instead indicating when you\u2019ve reached max or min. Volume. Something anybody could get used to really just because the touch buttons look so sleak. Overall for the size and the mobility of the subwoofer this is a good buy for a starter home entertainment setup",

The soundbar produced hardly anything better than the built in speakers of our 55\u201d Samsung and the subwoofer was only noticeable when the volume was way up, almost in an unpleasantly loud setting. On the positive side, set up was a breeze, which was great, because it went back into the box for return.",

The sound bar is also small, but it delivers a crisp sound (it even has a button that enhances voice clarity). You cannot compare this to the sound delivered by a larger sub woofer and sound bar, so don't even try. But for those who lack the space to accomodate a large sub woofer coupled with a large side bar, or for those who refuse to pay much more for other systems this is a great option.",

I purchased this because both the soundbar and sub-woofer would fit in the TV cabinet. Although the size works for us, the sound doesn't. Honestly, it's barely better than the TV's built in speakers. And the sub-woofer? I kept putting my hand on top of the speaker to see if it was on because I couldn't hear any base coming from it. This is really not worth the money!",

Only complaint is no indicator for volume level, and that is a limitation of using the TOS link which does not carry a video signal. Overall happy with it and would recommend it for a simple setup. Maybe Sony could add a led indicator to show the level, but not a deal breaker.",
