      "text": "I purchased this as a way to cuddle kittens. I work at an animal rescue shelter and the kittens are constantly wanting to be held but I can't always do that when there is work to be done. I used this wrap, folding it in half creating a pouch to put the kitten in, and then wrapping the kitten to my chest. Worked perfectly. The material for the wrap is a little on the thick side so making a knot to secure it was a bit difficult so knocking off one star for that but otherwise, totally satisfied with this purchase.",

I'll be buying a different one that's wider so that I don't have to hold my baby with my arm the whole time I wear him/her.",

The grey is thicker and warmer. The black had rounded ends while the grey doesn\u2019t. All in all, great product. What caught my eye about this particular wrap was the logo; cute and simple. I\u2019ve been able to wear the black comfortably even when my daughter isn\u2019t in it whereas I have not been able to do that with the grey\u2014the grey just feels bulky. I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d and about 189 pounds (2 mos. pp). Have plenty of extra fabric with both colors.",

I tried wrapping super tight, making the knot higher, nothing helps. On top of that it\u2019s very thick. It\u2019s just spring time here and my baby and I are soaked from a short walk in the sun. Just ok; but I wouldn\u2019t have bought it if I knew it will be like this",

But then desperate times encouraged me to use it again, and I'm so glad I did!! I was able to calm a fussy baby after walking around for 30 seconds, and then I could finally get a few things done around the house!! My advice to any new mom is to get the Cuddlebug, and try it out a few times before giving up on it! It does get easier to tie after a few uses, and the baby will absolutely love it, even it she may not at first :)",
