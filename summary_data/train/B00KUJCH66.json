BEWARE: I have purchased four of these mats from Grillaholics and have been very pleased. The current 'buy it now\" defaults to a Chinese counterfeit product that is made of unsafe material and of low quality. They have hijacked Grillaholics link. You will have to choose \"other sellers\" rather than the buy it now due to Amazon's defaulting to the lower priced fakes. If you purchased one from Ankeres, I highly suggest you return it as it is unsafe. This is what the fake buy now looks like: \"Sold by Ankeres and Fulfilled by Amazon. Gift-wrap available. \"",

Their attitude is if these don't last very long, they themselves will buy more of them because they work so well. And, the grill 'marks' really do show on the meat as well.",

Some juices can still run down into the grill over the edges; but it is still much less clean-up than a fully exposed grill. Lastly, when I bought them I didn't know you are not supposed to use metal utensils ... so had to get a silicon spatula. That being said, this is still such an improvement over a naked grill ...

I put the dirty sheet (after it cooled down of course) on the top rack of the dishwasher. Unfortunately I learned the hard way that I can\u2019t have anything else on the top rack. Most of the items had greasy black flakes on them and I ended up needing to hand wash the sheet anyway.

Haven't tried using the dishwasher to clean them yet but, certainly a handy option. Be careful not to use abrasive scrubbers, will pull off the teflon like finish. I have not had a problem with the but it appears it wouldn't take much to damage them if you scrubbed too hard. Glad I purchased them!",

We used Avocado Oil to grill, or used Olive Oil. Our choice, depended on the grilling temperature. We added Rosemary Salt or Celery Salt, and fresh ground pepper, the Salmon, we marinated first.

I use a gas grill which may be part of the issue. The chicken cooked but came out shiny, the mat had bits stuck to it that took quite a bit of scrubbing to remove.

There is no negative effect on taste. I do think that it's not fair for them to advertise this for steaks and burgers. Burgers require high heat, as steaks do during searing, and this material is not designed for those temperatures (which the seller/manufacturer admits). I use it for medium heat foods like shrimp and it works flawlessly.",

Will update at the end of summer to let you know how it performed. Thanks.",

Easy clean up in the sink. Best part is no cleaning of the grill with metal brushes. Doctors are warning against it due to people ingesting bristle particles and perforating their throats/guts. So glad I bought these!",

The only positive is they help keep the grill clean. Definitely wouldn't recommend them. Not nearly as good as the first that I got as a gift (don't recall brand).",
