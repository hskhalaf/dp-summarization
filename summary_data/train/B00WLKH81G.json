      "text": "Stopped working after 2 uses in 2 weeks. Remember the Polar chest-straps that were one nice piece of rugged plastic with the sensor built-in? This is NOT one of them. The wrist unit suddenly receives no heartbeat info from the chest-strap. Changed the chest-strap battery - still NG. 2 weeks, no abuse, no water on either unit - nothing. Will return. Probably will get something else. Totally disappointing. Update: Returned via Kohl's on 1/21. As of 1/28, Amazon hasn't seen it, and Kohl's can't tell me how to track it. Kohl's says it's still in a trailer on their dock, waiting for a truck. Very frustrating. Will not return anything via Kohl's again.",
