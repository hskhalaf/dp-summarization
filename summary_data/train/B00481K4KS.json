The other thing that I like is that when graphing multiple functions, they are drawn in different colors so I can compare them to each other... very nice. 8/4/2018 - I've had this calculator for two years now and it is still my favorite. I've used it through two calculus classes and it has been great. The latest firmware update gave it some 3D capability which was cool.",

It does conversions (like time, mass, energy, etc.) and also easily input programs either yourself or via computer, regardless this is an absolute life saver and highly recommend over any TI product on the market.

      "text": "Excellent calculator, I am an engineering major. I am entering my senior year at university and can say with absolute certainty that this calculator has improved my GPA. I am able to save formulas into this calculator if I am having trouble memorizing them. Some of my professors say that graphing calculators are not allowed, but have not given me trouble for using this (so long as I am quiet about it). If need be, you can put this into test mode in order to limit its capabilities, and any teacher/professor should be satisfied by this, as you cannot simply switch back and forth.",

      "title": "Powerful learning tool",
      "text": "I bought this for my 10th son for use in HS Algebra. What an amazing tool. It allows the student to get instant feedback via the graphing feature on changes to mathematical equations. For the student it helps them to understand what an equation means visually with the graphing feature. The ability to graph multiple equations at once allows for better understanding of what some simple changes to slope, y intercept of other components of an equation can do. The \"calculator\" is on the pricey side so only buy it if you intend to use its functionality.",

      "title": "Great Display",
      "text": "Considering my vision is not as good as it used to be, the color display really helps reading the numbers, graphs, etc. Even though the programming capability is limited, the other functions (e.g., spreadsheet, lists) work well; although, they are also limited, such as the lack of standard deviation in the spreadsheet. Overall, however, I use this calculator more than the numerous others (mostly HP) that I own because of the display visibility.",
