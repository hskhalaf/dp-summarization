I\u2019ll never have to drink bitter coffee that was hot brewed then chilled. Coarse grind definitely works the best. I leave it on a shelf in the refrigerator. If you want a jolt of caffeine, try it with little or no dilution. If you like it a bit weaker, dilute to your liking. I would highly recommend this item to cold coffee lovers. Simple to clean.",
