It helps you get the gun right in the shoulder pocket, a good cheek weld, and stays in place if you shoot it right. Oddly enough, if you shoot at a weird angle it makes the thing start to fall off so it helped me ensure I was shooting the gun correctly. I did 350 7.5 shot shells, 60 slug shells, and 100 buck shells over 4 days with no bruising, no tenderness. I recommend this product!",

Took the stock measurements, it was just a hair under the maximum length for the small size so that's what I bought and it fit like a glove.

The stock is very rigid and therefore transfers that recoil into the edges of the stock (hollow) and into your shoulder. Added this and it helps (adding weight will too, such as a scope).

But if you work up a load, or just do some supported shooting on a bench, the recoil has nowhere to go but right into your shoulder (regardless of your technique.) This pad really helps. It fits the stock and butt plate really well, and doesn't look half bad. It will help extend your shooting day, help reduce recoil induced flinch.

      "text": "I purchased this recoil pad to put on a Swiss K-31 7.5x55mm rifle I had glass-bedded and free-floated in a Boyd's Custom Stock. This made a huge difference versus the original military surplus stock with a metal pad, and a big difference versus the plastic plate on my custom stock. I used a \"small\" size, but a medium size would probably be a fine fit as well, as the small is almost too small. What can I say? No modification needed, it looks great, installs easier than anything else, and it absorbs a good portion of the punishing recoil. I was concerned it wouldn't fit around the cheek riser, but that wasn't a problem.",

Medium fit my Winchester Model 70 perfectly; I had previously purchased a large, but it was definitely too big.",

I docked a star because, if you'll notice the top of the pad there is a slight angled cut on it? For whatever reason the material there is a harder rubber or plastic, not soft like the other parts of the pad. This means if you try to lean your rifle in a corner on a wood floor (or similar hard smooth flooring), the bottom will slide out. Not a big deal for me but annoying enough to get my attention.",

This thing worked wonders. Great technology and design. Worth it! The only downsides are the extra length and that it does shift between shots a little. It's also pretty gripy, so for someone not practiced on it, they may catch/snag their shirt. But these are small tradeoffs to have a gun that you can shoot rather than one you can't shoot or shoot badly because of fear of or actual pain.",
