Not only does it not have assemble instructions it also doesn't have any advice on placement location for the d hooks, as in pull forward or rearward etc. It took me a long time to realize that I don't need to use the d ring to attach the ratchet strap that came with my order. Geez this would have been helpful, you guys built a great product then dropped the ball by omitting the instructions for your ratchet straps.",

It appeared to be the best product for the job and it came at a reasonable price break. I transported my Harley Road King 1800 miles and the bike never moved at all during the entire trip. It literally takes only a couple of minutes to lock down the bike for transport and unlock when your ready to ride. When you consider the cost of a high end touring motorcycle these days you want to insure that they are safely secured during transport. I highly recommend this product.",
