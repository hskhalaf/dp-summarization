      "text": "Great camera. Being raised on 35mm cameras, I was afraid that this one would be too automatic and not allow enough control. I have to admit, after taking hundreds of pictures with this, it hasn't bothered me at all. Great optics, nice natural color rendition, and good features. I've taken macros of spiders filling the frame, and even hand held super long shots of both the super moon and the blood moon that were exposed almost perfectly. Clear crater outlines around the rim of the moon. Impressive. Love that 30x zoom.",

I was surprised at it size, smaller than I had expected. Compared to a smart phone..this is way better, no comparison really. However, it's still just a point and shoot camera..I do like taking nature photographs and having a camera with a good zoom is nice to have. (not worrying about carrying around a bunch of expenses lenses a definite plus in my book). However, I don't think I'll be happy until I step up to a DSLR.",

We purchased this camera because we had a baby on the way and wanted to make sure we could get quality photos without spending an arm and a leg for a professional to take them. We are very pleased with this purchase. We have made canvas prints from the photos as well and they are flawless. We have been able to stage and capture wonderful photos, I can't say enough about this camera. We have used the video only a handful of times, but the quality on those works as well. I would say, always pack extra batteries and extra memory card, just in case!!",

This one has lots of settings that are easy to toggle between and the pictures are very nice--especially compared to the cell phone pictures that everyone else has. I do appreciate the heft of the camera sometimes, but I guess my only complaint is that because it takes AA batteries it makes it kind of heavy. It's definitely something I have to plan around when I bring it somewhere. It takes very nice video too.",

I have a Canon DSLR and it is great for serious photography but heavy to carry around to have the flexibility of telephoto and normal pictures, and the cost of the wide angle lens is pretty high (>$400). This camera takes great pictures and has lots of presets, as well as some nice special effects such as slow motion video. And compared to my DSLR is a lot lighter to carry to achieve comparable results. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good all around camera at a very reasonable price.",

It can record movies, and the file plays readily on the computer without any conversion or special software. Just plug the camera into the computer and open windows explorer to find the files in the camera. What doesn't it have? 1. The lens is not threaded for a filter. I like to add a UV or skylight filter for the sole purpose that in an accident I prefer the cheap filter to scratch instead of the lens. 2. No viewfinder. One watches the LCD display instead. I also like that it a standard tripod can screw into the bottom of this camera.",

The focal length allows for well-focused close shots as well as distant images. It's light and easy to hold. Downloading images to Picasa or another application is as easy as connecting a USB cable or inserting the memory card in your reader. It takes standard AA batteries. In summery, it's an easy to use camera that doesn't require an advanced degree in photography. But if you have one you'll likely enjoy using it, too.",

Not sure if I need to reread the manual of if these are flaws of this particular model. Also, this one takes AA batteries instead of the rechargeable camera batteries.

The 30x zoom works great and there's no comparison to the small pocket sized cameras. Keep in mind that this is not a \"pocket\" camera.

Speaking of settings, the camera options and picture-taking options are well laid-out and numerous. The high-speed and low-speed burst options are so useful to have in basically any situation. I personally almost always have them on since the images process so quickly anyway. They are especially useful for subjects such as birds or insects.

I would suggest this for folks that know cameras a bit. For the beginning user, I would highly suggest reading the manual through. (It is clear and easy to read and find the info you are after.) All in all, a great camera and at a better price point than others in its category.",

      "text": "Bought as a present for my 12 year old daughter who wanted a digital camera that would take videos. Almost bought her a Go-Pro but they don't record sound nor include the LCD viewfinder! This camera is 'all that and a bag of chips' as someone once told me. The red ones are hard to come by, and more expensive, but make it all that more special.",

The LCD should allow tilt and fold Being a novice, I don't mind not having manual mode. It takes good pictures with very little effort.",

Built-in flash memory is useful for emergency situations, but only good for a handful of pictures - these days it shouldn't be a problem to increase the built-in flash memory to store at least 50 pictures, probably would only cost $2 more in production. Not ideal in fast-paced environments - there's quite a significant lag when trying to take a shot. But I knew that already as it has been stated in several reviews. Overall a great digital camera for beginners.",
