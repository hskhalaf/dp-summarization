We are terribly disappointed because up until the last couple of days our family has really enjoyed this product. We have had many fun family games with this gift that Santa brought. We certainly expected more than two months of use out of something we paid almost $200 for 60 days ago.",

This dart board is however built by Escalade Sports, which is selling their product under the \"Arachnid\" name. After approximately 20-30 uses, half of the board no longer registers a dart (or finger push). In calling Escalade Sports, their recommendation was to simply buy a new $200 CricketPro 800. They didn't have an explanation in terms of how or why this happens. Seems like an expensive option to do every few years. I'm currently on the hunt for a better quality dart board and will update this post with alternatives. My advice: stay away from Escalade/Arachnid!",
