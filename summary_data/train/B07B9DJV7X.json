One of the prongs -- the most crucial one as it is over the four charging points -- is flimsy. Mine broke in less than a month. I've noticed on other sites that this is a common problem. Until a new charger is developed, I would NOT recommend this watch, as the watch is useless without the charger.",

I don't doubt its accuracy to the green, but most greens present a challenge of choosing between two clubs on approach -- so it's not as helpful by simply giving you the middle-of-the-green distance.",
