They used to produce a product that was unsurpassed, evidently that's no longer the case.",

In fact there is no bucket made by Rubbermaid that will fit their own Commercial mops. Pretty pathetic, I say. If you don't expect to use it as a Commercial line mop bucket, it's well made, sturdy and has a decent handle. Be careful when the two sides have different amounts of liquid in them though--it gets unbalanced easily.",

The size is wide and deep enough to allow my flat head mop and my window washing implement to fit nicely. I highly recommend this bucket for commercial as well as residential use.",
