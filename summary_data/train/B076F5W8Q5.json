Just a single button for turning on and on and another button for changing the channel. I think a lot of your success with this unit will depend on your setup. I recommend that you keep within line of sight and don't go through any walls. Also, you should have a decent mixer or amp as the gain on this is not incredibly loud. I use this mic mostly for when I am in a single room and need to record audio while walking about in that room.",

I was very disappointed that this was not compatible with iPhones. In spite of what people say, the sound quality of this mic is horrible. I spent a little more thinking I was getting better quality, however I am terribly disappointed. I would not recommend this mic for professional work. I'm sure it would work okay for professional speaking, but I do not recommend this for recording. I could have spent less money for a mic that was more versatile, and better sound quality.",

Improvements I highly recommend but,overall it\u2019s not that bad of a microphone to use. (NOTICE) You don't have to triple-click the top button to reset unit back to factory status in most case.

I really wanted to use the Lavalier mic because it's unobtrusive. Unfortunately, unless I hold the mic directly in front of my mouth it simply cannot pick up my voice. I wanted to try other Lavalier mics but the connectors aren't compatible. Even the headset mic works only marginally and picks up breathing as much as my voice. For the price, the rest of the system seems reasonably well designed. For my purposes it was a big disappointment. I'll be returning the unit soon.",

I don't think mine came with the head mounting option shown in the photo, but I would not have used it anyway. There is a noticeable sound (hum or hiss) from the wireless carrier wave, especially during silence and a t higher volumes.

Changing frequency might help. Having played around with it and got experience, I now give it 3 stars. It can be useful, but if I can, I will use a wired mic instead.",

The microphone is very sensitive so if you use it to record video some sound editing will be needed but it is not a big deal. I love this because if you are interviewing someone as long as they are 3 or 4 feet away their audio will be loud and clear as if they are actually wearing the mic. I have used this upto 30 feet away and never encountered a problem, as my use case doesn't require anymore distance from the receiver I can't say what the max distance would effectively be. Great product for my use case of video recording.",

(Coming from a videographer's perspective) If you don't have any audio gear whatsoever, and you are looking to expand your setup without breaking the bank, this is definitely a great buy. The only reason that I give the microphone 4/5 is that there were some minor things such as the receiver not having a hot shoe mount to mount it onto the camera, so the receiver would just be dangling off the camera. Also, there is no way to monitor the audio while you are recording. Minor things that don't take away from the great price of the lav mic!",

I needed to turn the mic around on my very first use and it broke. I have it zip tied but its sad that is so cheap. I have not tried the headset. The wireless part has worked well though. Just note its not hoing to be durable.",

It held up very well and it did the job amazing. I cant complain to be honest. So if you are in the market for a wireless lav microphone and are on a budget this is the Microphone for you. The only negative thing is the receiver feels kinda cheap but it holds up very well.",

Overall, for a 35 dollar mic system, with all that you get I am impressed with how it performed.",

However if your were to hold the lav mic closely it sounds good. I will have to do more tests. Really wish it was an omni directional mic so you know you will have good audio 99% of the time.",

I like how the transmitter fits snug and doesn't feel like it's gonna fall even when i'm moving around. Sound quality is great even at a good distance, although it gets a little choppy the further you are. Connecting to IPhone is a little tricky since you'll need the camera app closed before plugging in the mic. Plugging it in while the app is open will lead to failure in recording good quality audio. Overall, it's perfect for those who are just starting out on Youtube and want a budget mic for their videos.",
