They're really comfortable to be out in the woods all day. My feet stayed dry and warm. I had enough room to wear heavy socks in them but they were also comfortable with regular socks. It hasn't been that cold so I haven't worn them in any kind of extreme temps. Great boots overall though",

I ordered up 1/2 a size to an 8.5 and they fit snugly -there is no room to add a toe warmer if needed, or a second pair of socks. I am going to try the size 9 to see which is better. I will review again after I have had a chance to field test them this winter for warmth and dryness.",

I tried to exchange these for a size 9, but Amazon was very unhelpful. They also keep rejecting my reviews of this product. Let's see if they delete this one as well.",

Spending time outside has been no problem. The feet stay warm and cozy. However, as with most all commercial boot insoles, do yourself a favor and buy some good insoles. It makes a world of difference in your hiking/walking experience.",

Like the other pair, they seem instantly comfortable and break-in seems like it will not be difficult. A size 9 shoe weighs just under 700g, presumably due to the Thinsulate insulation (the other one is 600g). I think these would be great if I lived in an area that gets snow and ice, as they warmed up right away. I'm so tempted to keep both pairs!",

With my high arch, my arch was tired at the end of the day, because they are a little tight across the top.... even when I loosened the shoestrings to max looseness. I do not regret purchasing these boots.... and look forward to winter already.",
