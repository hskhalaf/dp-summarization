Also purchased a warm heating mat for under the cage and only use the night heating lamp, the white light seems to be harsh on the gecko's eyes. Amazon has great hiding cave rocks we bought and put in the cage as well and the gecko loves it especially when he is shedding with a very soft moist paper towel on the floor of the cave. This was a great buy.",

It\u2019s saying my tortoises enclosure is 50\u00b0 which is impossible because my house is 72\u00b0 and she\u2019s got a heat lamp.
