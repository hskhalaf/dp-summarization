      "text": "Love this wireless mouse & keyboard set. I had it originally at a previous job and when I set out on my own, I had to get the same one for my new home office. It is completely silent - no annoying typing noises!!! The keys are almost flat to the keyboard, similar to a laptop keyboard. The footer kickstands give just the right amount of lift for typing comfortably. The mouse is one of the larger computer mice I've used (I have small hands, lol), but it fits comfortably had a solid-feeling weight to it that I really enjoy. It makes for very smooth movements. Couldn't recommend this set enough. :)",

I checked to see if something was under the key, but could shake anything loose. I must just have a bad one, but it was so cheap Im not going to bother replacing it, or sending it back. Just switched back to my previous wired keyboard.",

After about 9 months, the USB dongle begins to fail and randomly disconnects and re-connects to my laptop. I've had 3 of the 4 I've owned fail, (just put #4 into service today). Used them on 3 different computers so I know it's not a computer issue. They are low cost, so I keep a spare new one on hand and will keep returning them for replacement every time they fail. Not a bad deal really, a free new keyboard and mouse every 9 months! Maybe MS should do better on their quality though....",

Only criticism I have is the hard time opening the battery well on the keyboard. I haven't found a way to do it easily. Apparently, it should pop off with some pressure, but it took a knife edge to break it loose for me.",

It's so quiet and typing feels pretty good on it. It's ergonomic enough for me and the mouse that came with it is pretty good as well. I'm using a different mouse instead though, but I wouldn't mind using this mouse if I need a backup. Plus, for this price, I don't think you can go wrong. I really like it.",
