After a month or so in this humidity (no A/C) mold visibly exploded all over the books (hundreds of them). After treatment and careful drying, the books looked much better and, best of all, no new mold growth. This stuff really works if you have the right application for it. I suspect some people disappointed with this product confuse mold with mildew/\"black mold\". Not sure how it would handle that or if anything even can.",

So far I have sprayed it evenly all over every surface, scrubbed all the tiles, grout and every nook s nd cranny. Directions say let it dry and it should help prevent future growth. 1. It doesn't smell like anything. Literally. No fumes. Big plus. 2. Mold and mildew come off easily after just a few seconds to few minutes of sitting with this stuff on. 3. As it dries I haven't noticed any film, residue, or stickiness. I'll update this review after I have a chance to see how well it prevents future mold & mildew.",

I got about 95% of the mildew removed. I had to do 2-3 times on some trouble spots. Majority of the mildew was removed by simply spraying on and wiping off after a few seconds. The more trouble spots I let sit for 10+ seconds and do a little heavier wiping. Overall great product, I am hoping that I can clean the seats with this in the fall to prevent the mildew buildup from happening in the first place.",
