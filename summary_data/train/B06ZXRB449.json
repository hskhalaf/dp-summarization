The automated response says that Panasonic will confirm my registration by email. That was 6 weeks ago - no email, no response. I tried repeatedly via email and online chat to find out what was going on with the registration. Nothing! No one will give a straight answer; no one will confirm registration; everyone says to email or online chat with someone else. Pure runaround. Panasonic support is the worst I have ever encountered for photography and/or electronic equipment - and that's saying a lot.",

We used the camera, a lot, but did not abuse it. Customer service was extremely difficult to talk too, taking 4 days to return my call they claimed would be returned in 1-2 days. When they did call it was 5 minutes before the office closed for the day, and making it again impossible to talk to a person. I strongly suggest not buying anything from Panasonic.",

If you use your camera like mine, a little work horse, this cheap plastic, almost crudely put together camera is not for you. I sure wish they'd go back to the sleek, well built design of the past.",

The only thing I would caution, is to note that the articulating screen is for taking selfies, not really helpful if you are looking for an angled screen for taking photos above a crowd, for instance. I spent a lot of time reading online reviews for this and other cameras and would recommend the same for anyone buying this camera. I take photos primarily on vacation and for eBay and find this much more convenient than my DSLR.",

The transfer of the data from the phone to the camera is difficult and easy to forget. Liked the built-in geotagging of previous Lumix models. The large battery has a good life but you should buy a spare.",

Also, most auto functions use multi focus points, but rarely select the center, where most of my attention usually lies.

All my low-light shots came out blurry, which was a huge bummer to realize only after leaving the temples where I was relying on this camera for all my pics. I may need to go a bit more high-end on the point and shoot spectrum to get the results I am looking for.",

I expected it to be quite similar to an earlier version of Lumix that I have, and like a lot, however this one is considerably larger and heavier. Evidently the electronic view finder and other new features added more bulk and weight \u2014 a trade off I was not willing to make with my travel camera.",
