Changing his chair to a recliner helped somewhat, but when I bought him this pillow it changed everything. His sores cleared up within a few days and he had physical relief almost instantly. He loves this pillow and I would highly recommend it. Also the company contacted me making sure I was happy with everything which is very refreshing.",

When you program and design for a living the time gets away from you hence why I needed a better cushion to handle those longer sitting times. Anyways this is the best pillow I've ever bought and I can say that it does offer tailbone pain relief for hours. Best cushion ever!",

For the first time in decades I'm getting relief for my sciatic pain - along with stretching exercises. My only suggestion and reason for the 4 stars (instead of 5) is that the donut is still very visible thru the cover, I would suggest the manufacturer to make the donut in a dark color or the fabric thicker - I seat in an open space at the office and you can see it - but I don't care :)",
