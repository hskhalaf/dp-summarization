      "text": "All in all disappointed in the utility of this unit. Does fine with what you can dump into the top, but in order to feed anything into the branch chute, it has to be trimmed of any/all protrusions, and if the branch is very far off perfectly straight you cannot get it in. A three inch branch that has a hardly noticeable bend will not go through. Maybe something is wrong with my trees, because I don't have many that sprout straight branches. I spent more time lopping branches to get them to feed through than I did chipping. In hind sight I would have spent more on a unit that would gobble up whatever you stuffed into it.",

      "text": "After one season, I am still impressed with this chipper. It starts on the first pull on a cold engine. Takes a few more pulls when it's warm, which seems backwards to me. It chews up branches and brush with ease. There are a few drawbacks. The top hopper requires either very loose items (like leaves) or for you to only feed long, thin branches. If the branches are tangled, good luck. Be careful with roots or knots - one clogged the machine and it took me almost an hour to dislodge. The machine lives up to its advertising, so I am well pleased.",

Not much, but enough to know it's tough enough to handle. One problem is the velocity that the chips and shreds are spit out. You really need to use the bag!
