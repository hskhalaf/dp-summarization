I called customer service and they were absolutely useless. Turns out that even though the blender says dish washer safe you can only put it on the top shelf which doesn't make sense because it's too big to fit on any standard dishwashers top shelf. Apparently a piece on the jug melted off in the dishwasher. Needless to say I am never buying one of their products again.",

We had been looking for a high power blender for awhile and I couldn't settle on one because i didn't want to spend so much and end up with something that let me down, but finally took the jump and got this one and I'm so glad i did! We've made plenty of smoothies and it handles the ice without a problem. I've also used it to make Graham cracker crusts for cheesecakes and it does a great job at making everything a consistent size and texture. It's still loud, but it's no louder than most blenders.",

      "text": "So far so good! Great for smoothies. Having the blades along a shaft from bottom to top of pitcher seems to result in faster more efficient action when compared to models with blades only at the bottom. The pitcher is fairly large so if you only want to do one serving at a time you might consider similar models that include the option of individual serving containers. I prefer this size to make a full batch and keep second or third servings for another day or two without any apparent loss of freshness. You do need to be careful in handling the blade shaft especially when washing by hand or reassembling - the blades are very sharp.",

      "text": "I had high hopes for this blender given the 4.5 star average review, but I'm very confused as to how this blender has maintained that rating. 1) After only a few uses (less than 10), the bottom of the pitcher cracked resulting in liquid leaking through the bottom and all over the base of the blender and my countertop. 2) It does not blend smoothies well. Add any kind of greens and it comes out grainy with tiny bits of spinach/kale/etc. 3) It is VERY loud compared to other blenders I've used (nutribullet & vitamix specifically). Would not recommend this blender. Vitamix is well worth the investment for a high-quality powerful blender.",

Cleaning up is a breeze as the blade easily slips out to clean. it has a nice compact size but it is quite tall.",

Easy to clean in the dishwasher, although I dislike that the blade doesn't disassemble into smaller parts.
