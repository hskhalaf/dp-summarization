I have also had issues with the strap. If I wear it where just comfortably sits over my eyes it falls off pretty easily, then if I wear it tighter I can feel the tension across my face which isn't the most comfortable. The blue cooling is fun and feels nice, but the straps aren't the greatest either",

One contained a longer strap with an adjustable band, and the other came with two smaller bands, but not adjustable. Will be returning the products.",

Although it would probably decrease the cooling properties, it might be nice if the cooling pad was chambered, I have to squish it around to get the gel evenly distributed every night. Its also a bit small, lots of light leaking in near my nose.",
