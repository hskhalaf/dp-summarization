      "text": "*** Update 101517*** It stopped working recently and Linksys replaced it under warranty. I like having the 8 ports for wired connection for other devices. Great device. This thing is overkill for a reason. Handles all traffic on my network. Almost everything now has wifi. I watched two 4k movies back to back with no issues. Also, having 8 ports, is a plus where I can add things like a printer, TV, etc to free up wifi. Will see how it performs down the road. So far very happy with performance.",
