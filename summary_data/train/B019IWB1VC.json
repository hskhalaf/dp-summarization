I had new laminate flooring put down in 2 bedrooms and when I received the estimate there was a charge of $80.00 for taking the furniture out and putting it back in after the job was done. OH NO SAYS I. These little dears saved me $80.00 by allowing me to empty both rooms by just pushing or pulling furniture around, especially after the new floors were installed without any scrapes or scratches. Also, I left 4 of them under the feet of the bed. they look a little funny but I can now move the bed around without scratching the floor. All in all, very happy with purchase.",

We just had a huge rummage sale at the church and I put these sliders under the couches and furniture that needed to be moved.

I left them on the couches where our youth \"rearrange\" the rooms every week to protect the carpet. I will definitely use them again next years' sale. Our carpet is a low pile, commercial grade. Not sure how they would work on a deep pile carpet.",

A word of caution though, the black foamy bits that you set the furniture on tend to slide out of the cup, and the plastic cup also tends to bow and misshape from the weight of the furniture. Be prepared to order extras or get more every time you move. That being said, while they last they are absolutely an improvement over moving things by hand, in some cases making it so it is possible to move things that were too heavy to move before.",
