I'm sure we'll be using this server for many more parties in the future. Suggestions: be gentle when screwing and unscrewing the legs and spacers so you don't strip the threaded areas in the plexiglass. Wash with a gentle cloth and blot dry so you don't scratch the plexiglass.",

As you can see the donuts and cupcakes are regular size not \"mini\" size and I stil feel like the picture didn't do justice. After washing them they are still crystal clear and don't look cheap.

The stand was elegant with all of our cute little blue and white cupcakes. I wish I had taken a picture! After the party, I did take the trays apart and wrapped them in plastic, placed them in the boxes they were sent in, and then the cute fabric bags that hold the boxes. These are extremely easy to store. I will use these serving pieces for many parties to come!",

You have to be careful not to tighten down too hard on the screws as the acrylic posts might have rough edges that may mark up the shelf when disassembling. I noticed a small scratch on one shelf because of this, but it in no way detracts from the overall look because the scratch is underneath the post. I like the small carry bag that is included to keep all the pieces together. Overall, I would highly recommend this product as a perfect way to display cupcakes or small desserts!",

I do wish the screws went in just a smidge further, but no harm no foul. Love that it is clear so that it is easy to decorate and little twinkle lights beneath look awesome.",
