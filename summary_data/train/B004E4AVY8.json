We had four of the EXACT same Coleman 6-person instant tents set up and mine was the only one that leaked. I assume the factory missed the waterproofing step.

Coleman or somebody should check the product before shipping it. Since the tent is so heavy, the people handling it during shipping probably drop it or something.",

(For us it rained moderately only for an hour.) We even purchased the rainfly that goes with the tent. The rain fly basically covers the top part of the tent. The sides are still very much exposed. The set up is really quick and convenient. And the price was good. That's why I would give 2 out of 5.",

Needless to say that I am returning this tent and getting another pole style tent.",

Zips up well, and can easily store all your gear if you're one or two bodies with a queen sized air mattress. With the added rain fly (sold separately), works well for drizzly weather.

It fits a large queen air mattress with room to spare, Id say it would sleep a family of 4-5 comfortably. Overall happy with the purchase and product",

This is because the \"built in rainfly\" does not let moisture escape and the only effective way to vent the tent is to have the windows zipped open which negates privacy when sleeping in a campground with other people.
