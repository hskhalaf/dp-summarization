There actually seemed to be more moisture ( literally dripping wet ) on the inside of the cover than the outside. This is in January / California so humidity obviously not the culprit. No puddling or pooling on the outside as there is multiple points of support.......I cant even honestly explain how disappointed I am in this product. Even my wife was mystified at how wet this was.....took it off and returning.",

Maybe it just needs to stretch out, IDK, but it was fairly easy to put on by myself. Had to make adjustments as the straps didn't exactly reach down to the trailer the way the directions said to use them, so I tied them to the tarp and clipped them down on the trailer around the trailer beam. It works. Just wish it was a little longer. This is a 16' boat and I measured everything prior to ordering and ordered the one suggested in the description. Other than that, it's bright and works pretty good.",

      "text": "PROS: - Inexpensive. CONS: - My Pacific Blue color is starting to fade after 2 months of minimal sun exposure (Ohio). - There is no venting, so mold builds up rather quickly. It\u2019s confusing because the mater seems to be somewhat permiable. To help with the mold, I recently purchased a couple Boat-Vent-3s. We\u2019ll see how that works. CONCLUSION: - Boat covers are like hot tub covers- you get what you pay for. Whatever cost level you buy, expect to pay around 100 bucks a year. A good quality boat (or hot tub) cover is around $300+. I expect to have to replace this in a year.",

Overall fits better than the last one I had with the same measurements. Almost perfect fit it is. For an affordable cover, not custom I can not complain. Product deserves 5 stars.

Carpet was soaked and bildge was full of water. Bummer. Will try to change to support poles and see if the water doesnt permeate through. Quality of stitching, fit and elastic are great otherwise.
