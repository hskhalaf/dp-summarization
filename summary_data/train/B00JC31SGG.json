You will not be able to control it from your phone or cast anything to it anymore, rendering as useful as a receiver from the 80's. I bought it as a media room receiver and a year later I can't control it from the media room. Changing the volume, source, etc. is no longer available. From Sony: With the update to ver.5.2, Music Center will no longer be compatible with STR-DN850/STR-DN1050/ICF-CS20BT/XDR-DS21BT. Some features may not be supported by certain devices.",

The WiFi works although it already existed in my Blu-Ray player, and 5. I was hoping for outstanding audio performance - and I GOT IT!!! My initial impression of the unit is that it is OUTSTANDING!!!

At that point, if I unplug and reconnect the HDMI cable, it starts working again for a short while but then continues to go in and out sporadically.

Besides the hardware issues, the sound quality and performance of the receiver itself is fantastic. The ability to properly set itself up with the included microphone made setup easy and fast and can be run multiple times if your setup ever changes.",

Tv shows and movies sound clearer and more ambient sounds can be heard from street scenes or sci-fi movies. I paired our iPad to the receiver with no problem and I was impressed with the range of the bluetooth before I started getting distortion.

Featuring 4k resolution pass-through, high-res audio compatibility, 6 HD inputs and a new intuitive graphical interface, this receiver brings out the best in your music, Blu-ray movies, games and more.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\n7.2 CH 4K WI-FI NETWORK A/V RECEIVER\nStream crisp, powerful audio with built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Airplay. With 7.2 channels and 150 watts of power, it\u2019s legendary Sony sound that really connects. Featuring 4k resolution pass-through, high-res audio compatibility, 6 HD inputs and a new intuitive graphical interface, this receiver brings out the best in your music, Blu-ray movies, games and more.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nTHE HEART OF YOUR SYSTEM.\nStream crisp, powerful audio with built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Airplay. With 7.2 channels and 150 watts of power, it\u2019s legendary Sony sound that really connects. Featuring 4K resolution pass-through, high-res audio compatibility, 6 HD inputs and a new intuitive graphical interface, this receiver brings out the best in your music, Blu-ray movies, games and more.\n\nBUILT FOR SOUND.\nBorrowing construction and circuitry design cues from our ES line, it all begins with a rigid chassis based on the legendary frame and beam concept. To this structure, we then mount the various components: a high capacity power transformer, custom heat sink, and other specially selected audio-grade components that together add up to class-leading sound quality. For purists, Pure Direct mode preserves signal clarity and detail by switching off unnecessary signal processing circuitry to provide the cleanest possible signal path with minimized electronic interference.\n\nSWEET SOUND.\nNot only powerful, to deliver impressive multi-channel sound performance. (145W x 7 @ 6 ohms, 1 kHz, 0.9% THD), the STR-DN850 features the best audio technology from both Sony Music and Sony Pictures and can even support Hi-Resolution audio playback (bit rates up to 192k/24-bit WAV/FLAC). Added amplifier functionality allows for configuration flexibility including: speakers A or B, speakers A and B, in addition to Bi-Amp should the scenario call for it.\n\nWI-FI BUILT-IN1\nWirelessly connect to your home network and via the integrated DLNA support access music stored on: your computer, network storage device, or even your smartphone. Via built-in music service support13, you can access and enjoy music streaming at its very best-the latest from Pandora, Spotify, Music Unlimited, and tunein. Also AirPlay compatible, you can easily stream your music and music apps from your iPhone/iPod/ iPad or iTunes.\n\nCONNECT IT ALL WITH BLUETOOTH1\nThe STR-DN850 receiver effortlessly streams music from your smartphone or tablet so nothing is out of reach. Now anyone can be the DJ-no wires, no problem. Bluetooth streaming can even wake the receiver from standby mode to get the party started. Built-in AAC and aptX codec support avoids signal quality loss when streaming music wirelessly.\n\nWELL CONNECTED.\nEnjoy versatile HD connectivity with five HDMI inputs (up to 4K capable) and connect a Sony PlayStation entertainment system, Blu-ray Disc player, or any other HDMI-capable devices2. Via an MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) certified HDMI cable, you can even plug-in your smartphone and share favorite personal video clips, music, and more on the big screen complete with big sound3. The front-mounted USB input even allows for easy connectivity and charging with compatible devices1.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nADVANCED ON-SCREEN DISPLAY.\nClass-leading performance demands a powerful user experience. Via an advanced on-screen user interface, the STR-DN850 affords comprehensive system control, settings adjustment, input selection, and the like with seamless visual confirmation on your TV screen.\n\nHD DIGITAL CINEMA SOUND.\nOptimize receiver settings to mimic movie theater sound characteristics. Front Height mode enables vocal height and 3D effects for improved effects positioning and added depth. Imagine as a helicopter descends from above and lands right in front of you \u2013 you\u2019ll hear the change in height as the effect unfolds on-screen.\n\nEASY SETUP, OPTIMIZED USE...\nProper system setup and optimization shouldn\u2019t be an ordeal. Easy Setup using the simplified remote in comjunction with an intuitive, on-screen interface, leverages the power of Digital Cinema Auto Calibration (D.C.A.C.) and a supplied microphone to optimize settings based upon room charachteristics and speaker distance and placement.\n\nHANDY REMOTE CONTROL.\nEasily and intuitively control the receiver via SongPal and your Bluetooth-enabled smartphone. Simply download the free SongPal app from iTunes or Google Play Store, install it on your smart device and take control of your receiver and your favorite movie and music content, including receiver settings, media metadata, and more \u2013 all through one app.\n\n1Wireless connectivity requires an 802.11 home network (802.11n recommended).2Broadband speed of at least 2.5 Mbps recommended (10 Mbps for HD).
