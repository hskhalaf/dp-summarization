They are loaded with all your essential amino acids so I figured it has to be almost if not better than protein powder! I have been using the hemp seeds for a little over a week daily now, and I love them. I feel full to the point that when lunch comes, I sometimes only eat because I know I need to and not because I am hungry. They kind of have a slight nutty taste to them but it is not overpowering at all.",
