As a matter of fact, I am enjoying working my way through the levels too. Some are more challenging than others. I like that my son can play on his own or we can sit side-by-side and try to get them individually while spending time together. Neither he nor I are get bored with this game! I recommend it to anyone who wants to teach principles of coding without using electronics, and to anyone who loves solving puzzles (might be a tad easy for an adult experienced in puzzle-solving though).",

It ramps up in difficulty very smoothly- and my 6 year old was able to play it no problem. So that's my only recommendation to thinkfun if they ever create a 2.0 version of this game- please make the plastic pieces a bit narrower so that the gameplay area isn't obstructed. :)",

This game was it. At first, reading the instructions, I thought, \"This is way to complicated for him to follow\". But once we started, he got very interested and involved. I also have a 7 and an 11 year old boys, and they too were very interested in the game. When my wife came home, the boys were excited to show her, and she played it and could not stop. Well, well, well worth the $20. PLUS: It's educational!",
