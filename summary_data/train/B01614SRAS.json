Two of the pods just didn't want to sprout. Tried again. No luck. The lettuce that grew, grew quickly. It was nice to have fresh lettuce! The only reason I may not buy this again is that the lettuce is pretty fragile for salads. It doesn't get that strength needed to hold up to salad dressings and toppings. It was quite wilty. The convenience of having it there was fantastic. I may experiment with different types of lettuce to choose a heartier one.",

It's an issue easily fixed by wetting the top of the seed pod a couple times, and, due to the quick nature of sprouting, it's a situation quickly realized.",

Of the 9 pods received only five germinated, and one of those plants was stunted and stopped growing shortly after getting the true leaves. I always clean my aerogarden bounty between plantings, used newly bought nutrient solution and used the correct settings on my aerogarden. So with optimal conditions less than half the plants made it. Of the plants that made it, I had two varieties of lettuce that grew to maturity and they were pleasant and fun to harvest. Just wish there was enough from this kit for a proper salad.",

And, I begrudge taking the time to go through the calling and waiting. Why can't they send six that grow?",

My excitement went downhill after that though because the quality of the lettuce produced was very low. They appear \"fully grown\" but they are flimsy and soft. The size of the heads is very thin despite the height. They also reached the top of the light bar so the leaves were damaged. I was waiting to harvest until they filled out but that never came and I am just left with scorched, flimsy lettuce heads. Will not be purchasing again.",
