And I've yet to be able to get the 4.0 update (stuck on gingerbread), but that's not a deal breaker for me. I am disappointed that none of my cloud services are compatible, Amazon Music, Dropbox, etc.; again not a real deal breaker. Pro's 1. FM radio 2. Sounds great 3. Feels good in the hand 4. Good battery life Cons 1. Some apps are not compatible 2. Can't update?",

It plays video and music without a problem. 16GB is big enough, I ripped my father's favorite albums (around 30 CDs). Not sure how many formats it plays but at least it plays wmv and mp3.",

When the volume is turned all the way up it still sounds low. Now that my 90days is up on this almost $300 item now amazon is telling me there is nothing they can do since the 90day warranty has ran out. All I want is a replacement were the volume goes up loud when turned up. Pissed!!!",

Another plus is that this runs on Android, so you have access to all of the apps, games, music apps, etc. Some nice features: Touch screen, clear HD screen Interactive lyrics Music settings Design, very light Only thing I am disappointed with is the battery life. It lasts 20+ hours if wifi is off, however if it is on, it will last about half of the time, maybe shorter about 8 hours. I highly recommend this!",
