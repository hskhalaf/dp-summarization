      "text": "Without questions the best shoe I might have ever purchased! I needed a good flexible walking shoe for a trip but I've in the past had the similar problem of buying a new shoe and with out time to break in would cause more pain then comfort. ECCO Jack Slip Sneaker proved me wrong. I bought the show a week before my trip and pretty much spend the the week on my trip walking an average 5 miles a day. Shoe was soft, flexible, comfortable, and amazing. It was if the shoe was already broken in for me without the pre-break-in. As with all my previous ECCO shoes I am new life time customer!",
