I have 3 small dogs now. 1 dog is 12.5 lbs, 1 is 14 lbs and 1 is 20 lbs, so I got the 1 for \"up to 25 lbs.\" One look at this toy and I'm afraid to give it to the dogs for fear that my 20 lb dog will swallow it whole and choke. If you have a dog anywhere near the max weight suggested on the package, please buy the next size up.",
