So far he likes it, it's comfortable so will update in a few months regarding the soles etc...the first shoe sole came off in about a year and had to be replaced so will see how long this one last ( he's a mechanic works 6 days a week). I would recommend these to anyone who wants a strong lasting work shoe. PS. The pics were taken after day 2 of being worn however the package came undisturbed and the shoes were new",

He had worn the original Caterillar work boots for as long as he could remember and was very nervous about trying a new style (his former one was discontinued). But he put these on as soon as he got them, and was amazed at how much lighter these were then their predecessor, and how comfortable right off (many boots take time to break in).",

However, one month in, and it feels as if the cushion on the bottom of my foot has already been worn down and I can feel the sole putting pressure on my arch. Also, the stitching on the heel inside the shoe tore off, which means that it is going to be a quick decline to the entire inside of the shoe becoming unstitched. Buyer beware this is not a high quality shoe",

He does not like steel toes so it becomes difficult to get a high quality commercial grade boot without spending hundreds of dollars. This is the answer, we highly recommend them.",
