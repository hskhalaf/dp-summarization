Due to poor signal from my antenna, I put it back into the box to try again after I installed an exterior antenna. This weekend I hooked it up to my new antenna and it worked great--for a day. This morning there was no audio. I tried the mute button, volume control, turning the unit off and on, and unplugging and replugging all connections. No luck. A different make and model converter box work fine, so I guess this one was a lemon.",

It also turns itself off if the TV's been on too long. Not sure this is an overheating safeguard but it is annoying. Also when there's a signal interruption the station audio 'spazzes' so you have to change channels to get it to stop. I also don't like the fact that the remote doesn't have a recall button so you can go back to the previous channel. If my TV continues to need another converter box I wouldn't buy it again.",
