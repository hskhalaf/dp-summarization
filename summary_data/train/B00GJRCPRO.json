      "title": "Skip the Ghost-S",
      "text": "The camera has so much potential, but falls short. First camera had yellowish blotches in the video. As though the sensor was dirty. Returned and replaced. Second camera has exposure stepping issues, and cannot be used for snow sports. The picture flickers from dark to bright like a slight strobe effect. Love the remote, don't mind the menus, but my primary use is skiing and it just is not usable. Have been told they are working on a software fix for the past 8 months. Sorry, but I cannot recommend this action cam.",
