(petite & thin) child, as they said....these are adjustable! The knee pads do tend to slide down a little after a lot of skating so just be aware of that and have your child pull them back up. These are a definite must, took a couple of good hits, did their job, and are still solid.",

I ended up paying more for the two I purchased because I was hoping to get a mermaid for my daughter. I'm super bugged that JBM International chose to be dishonest with what they are selling. I could have saved $6 total and paid the standard $9.99 for an LOL doll at the store and taken my chances. I HATE being lied to.",
