      "text": "They're pretty good. They do fit and feel more solid than regular earbuds, but I got the version with the in-line mic, which is a large and relatively heavy attachment to the cord. The in-line mic part makes the cord on that side heavy, and it bounces when running or jumping which causes a noise and pulls on the earbud on that side. I have done high intensity workouts with these (like burpies, squat jumps etc) and they stay in. But I've also done runs where they keep moving and I have to keep pushing them in. So at least for me, they have been better than \"non-sport\" earbuds, but are certainly not perfect.",

Over time the wires started to show near the ends, but they always lasted a long time for me. Never had one or the other side stop working, which says a lot because on my runs the ear buds were exposed to moisture. If you need a good working out headphone I recommend these. They do have some noise cancelling but not completely. For safety it gives you just enough to hear your surroundings but can turn up the volume to help block out sound.",

No bass, washed out mids, and tinny treble.

I have zero issues with them falling out or coming loose when I run. The sound quality is great too - good, solid bass and decent mids and highs. I waited to write this review until after I had these headphones for a few months. The quality is great and I don't have any complaints. My boyfriend even sent them through the washer in a pocket of one of my jackets and after letting them dry, they worked just as well as they always have. Great investment!",

However, if you sweat at all, I'm not sure these will stand the test of any time.",

The circular, flexible wheel that holds them in place works great, better than Apple, Samsung, YurBudz, and several others I have tried. I actually have to pull my earlobe up to let them loose. And the tips allow you to hear more or less of the outside world depending size and how hard you shove them in your ear. My only gripe is the mic gets caught on the collars of some shirts and actually restricts your movement. The sleeve holding the mic should be more streamlined and less squared so it doesn't catch on things.",
