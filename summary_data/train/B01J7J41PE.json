      "text": "I love this new MagniPros Ultra bright LED Handheld Magnifying glass. It is just the right weight when you hold it. It is lighter than others that I have owned before. It is very comfortable as the handle is made to fit your hand perfectly. Yes, it is an Ultra bright light, but not too bright to put a glare on the paper,,..just right! It has an off and on button that is very easy to work. I picked this size because it is not too large and yet you can see so much. New version is excellent. You won't be disappointed.",

My wife has vision problems and she is absolutely overjoyed with your product. The addition of the LEDs makes it so much easier to look at fine print she is trying to read. Prior to receiving this product, she would have to shine a portable light through a hand-held magnifier and try to hold both steady to read fine print. She is delighted with your product and so am I. You have satisfied the rule \"If Mama's happy, everybody's happy!\" Thank you so much for this very helpful tool! Ken Lundeen",

The highest magnification lens at the base of the handle was sometimes indispensible in helping me confidently distinguish a smudged \"5\" from a \"6\" in 6-point font or other close calls. The AAA batteries have not noticeably dimmed after several weeks and 100 uses per hour. When they do go, they'll be easy to replace. I'm getting one for home. When a couple of times I dropped the magnifier a half meter, the batteries door and batteries popped out. Easily fixed with a rubber band.",

Original batteries I installed are still running strong. Just ordered a second one to have upstairs by my computer, mostly for reading fine print instructions related to computer stuff. I highly recommend this product, especially for older folks like me who need a little help. :) And I can't complain about the price either, which seems very reasonable to me. ($10).",

I worked as a graphic designer for 40years and now realized that designers do not care about the universally readable letters size but they do care about only their designing matters. Anyway, this product is incredible helpful and useful for any occasions and locations. LED light is quite new for us. It is great idea! And also we received very nice comment from the seller. We strongly recommend this product for anybody. Y.",
