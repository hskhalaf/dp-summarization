The piece at the front that allows the water to drain came off this morning and won't go back on because it's plastic. The whole thing is made of plastic. I would not purchase this again.",

The sides don't always lock in place which is annoying. The final straw was today when I opened the rack and the dish part that lifts off broke so now it will not be able to hold items securely.

Dishes go in a rack at the back, or the rack can be flattened or removed. There are three separate openings along either side of the rear portion for utensils, or they may be removed if you need the additional unobstruted space. Excess water can drain through a pluggable opening at the front. Only suggestion I have is that the rear could be set a little higher than the front to promote a natural flow of the water while the dishes are draining.",

      "text": "Impractical/Unrealistic design for daily use. A fold away design was not why we purchased it, it appeared to be well designed from the photos and description, but when it arrived it was a bit flimsy due to the fold away sides, that once folded blocked the space inside the rack thus taking away from the actual drip dry area. This was sent back the same day, it looks kinda cool, but for daily use it is bulky when both sides are folded out, and restricted of even one side is folded in to save room or just attempt to fit next to or behind your sink area. Too bad b/c we had higher hopes for it",

I thought; it's was odd; however, after I realize its no air circulation like a regular wire dish rack. Therefore the dishes sit there damp. I hope I dosen't get moldy.

Not the end of the world, but I wish the drain was just 1/2 an inch longer.
