The color of the light is good too. Im very pleased so far. Seems durable. I plan on keeping it in its storage when not in use and hope to get plenty of use out of it.",

      "text": "So happy to have these lights for my visually impaired husband. The lights arrived quickly! Much to my surprise, they came packaged in a nice little plastic box with foam padding to store the lights in when not in use. The magnet is super strong, and the light is bright. The product was smaller than I anticipated, but that actually works to my advantage! I\u2019ll update if I have any issues with the lights in the future.",

      "text": "These grill lights are great! They come in a hard protective case with foam lining and are individually packed in bubble wrap bags. It's nice that they come with AAA batteries, so you can start using them immediately without searching for batteries. The magnets are truly very strong and the lights are bright. I use them on the side of my grill and magnetically attach them the the side area of my grill near the temp dials. The lights are heat resistant and I haven't encountered any issues with the heat from the grill at all. They are extremely bright lights and let me grill at night and clearly see my food. An excellent product and well worth the money!",

These were a great improvement over the centered overhead light that originally came with my grill. PROS: Excellent range of motion, sleek design, included storage case. CONS: The only drawback I encountered was the magnet base didn't work with the stainless steel end tables on my grill. So not even a design flaw of this product, just something to consider if you have a stainless grill as well. Fortunately, as long as you don't extend the light directly out, the base was heavy enough to keep the light upright.",
