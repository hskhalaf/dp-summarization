The hanging strap is adjustable so you can customize the length. Overall its made from a decent material, although I wouldn't say its heavy duty. Several pockets and dividers so you can keep things separated and organized, yet handy, and you can easily take it off and go--use it as a tote if desired. Not exactly inexpensive or overly spendy, I think it was a fair price for the item. Only downside for me was a cheapy zipper just above the mesh pockets, but it wasn't a deal breaker.",
