They help organize the ingredients so you don't forget something (which I have done on occasion). Laying everything out before you start cooking is actually a time saver and helps taking the stress out of cooking and making it more fun. These bowls are durable and I absolutely love that they are made in La France. These are a great investment. Purchased several different sets and love them all. Bon Appe\u0301tit!",

They're replacing plastic - you know that party type - that I'd used for years but am replacing all plastic in my kitchen. Duralex may be more expensive than other glass bowls, but are thermal shock resistant and hold up well without chipping or easily breaking. They stack well so they don't take up a lot of space. Will be buying more Duralex items - am really pleased with this purchase.",

They also stack quite nicely, minimizing their footprint when storage space is tight.",

Luckily, Amazon had good customer service. I also liked that the bowls were made in France--not China. I'm a slight snob about those things.",

    "description": "Founded in 1929, Duralex has been manufacturing glassware and tabletop products in la chapelle-saint-mesmin, a city in the heart of France. Since 1939, when Duralex invented the glass tempering process, the name Duralex has been associated with resilient glassware, thanks to their proprietary tempering process. The original tempered (toughened) picardie glasses are still in production in France and are known as the \u201coriginal french tumblers.\u201d The picardie glass is the perfect weight: functional yet stylish and feels extremely comfortable in the hand. They are equally suitable for cold or hot drinks, conveniently stackable, impact and chip resistant, microwave and dishwasher safe. With the help of continuous investments and commitment to quality, Duralex has reached a level of excellence that makes its products recognized throughout the world. Duralex is and will always remain a true french manufacturer of glassware and tabletop products, and is the only glass manufacturer that makes 100-percent of their products in France. Cleaning :Wash before use. Soak the dish in soapy water for 20 minutes. Do not use metallic sponges, pads, powders or abrasives.To remove hard water stains, try vinegar. If this doesn't work, we suggest trying a hard water product called LemiShine which can be found at the local grocery store. Then trying soaking your glassware in LemiShine and warm water.",
