      "text": "Decent alloy softball bat. Definitely doesn't have the same pop as a LXT. Daughter is on a 12u fastpitch select team and this is her cold weather game bat and artificial softball (dimpled) batting practice bat. This review is for the 31\" -13 bat. I don't think there is a better alloy based fastpitch softball bat, if there is I would like to know. FYI composite bats should not be used in weather below 60F or hitting artificial pitching machine BP balls. Grip is very nice, 2 piece construction helps reduce barrel buzz. This is our second Bustos bat, the first was a 29\" and she outgrew it.",

She swung the bat and told me it felt heavy I told her it was an ounce lighter. I decided to weigh her old bat and the bustos her old easton was 17.2 oz when I weighed the bustos I was surprised to find it was 18 oz when it was advertised to be 16oz so its actually a drop 11 not 13. I will be returning the bat",
