This is the first one I've ever used that can make a proper smoothie and mixed drink that isnt commercial grade at a cost of hundreds of dollars. It is easy to clean and even my 11 year old didn't have any problems removing and replacing the blade for cleaning. Much quieter than the Oster I was using before.",

It's very attractively designed, and the parts all seem to be of top drawer quality. The blades are stainless steel. It has push-button controls on the front panel that are clear and easy to understand. The mixing container comes off easily for pouring and cleaning, and the entire unit stores easily. What more could you ask for?",

Makes smoothies easily. The controls on the front are convenient. The pulse function works with whichever speed you are using, which is a nice feature. We haven't tried everything with this blender yet, but it seems capable of doing any blending job we would use it for. We have experienced none of the problems reported by some reviewers.

Sure, it blends things alright--but it also leaks out the bottom at least 75-80% of the time, even when I've taken pains to make sure the base is screwed on tightly. No end to the frustration of cleaning up the mess from my kids' morning smoothies. I just bought a Ninja to replace it.",
