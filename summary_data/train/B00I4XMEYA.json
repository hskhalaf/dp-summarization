Cons - It is impossible to remove your credit card billing data from the account via the web without having to call the service personally. This is a very unfortunate requirement because it means they will charge your card if you are unable to contact them for whatever reason, indefinitely. Cannot recommend such a poor policy which they claim is for security. The top shopping and internet bank sites do not have such a policy, so why does Ooma?",

I contacted OOMA and their support team over-nighted a replacement and that worked out of the box. Thanks OOMA. This isn't the first time that I've gotten old none working products from Amazon.",

It works very well, better than the old Comcast phone service - which when my comcast voicemail inbox filled up (once every 3-4 months) they provided no warning but just stopped recording phone messages. Four stars rather than 5 because it occasionally requires rebooting - I'm guessing but I think probably about once every 3 months the lights just start flashing, I just pull the power cable out and put it back and everything works. With respect to comparisons to other phone service reliability it's probably about the same.",

The red light would blink and the phone had a constant busy signal. The online customer service told me to reboot it, and to call back the next day when the reboot didn't work. The live customer service told me to reboot it. That's all they could do. Then they fought with me another 10 minutes when I wanted to cancel my service that was less than 24 hours old because the phone line never worked. I decided to keep my working landline instead after this disaster.",
