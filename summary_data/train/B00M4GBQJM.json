I recommend the Fosmon DURA S Flexible Protective Skin Slim Fit Case for LG G Vista. I bought the clear one. It protects yet is still very thin and has a great rubbery grip feel. I recommend doing the firmware update to VS88011B if you purchase this phone. Just hook up the micro USB cable to your computer, load the software from the phone and follow the prompts. This is a fantastic large phone. Buy it, you'll like it!",

I was happy to hear when there were no issues activating it at Verizon. It came in great condition. It has a big screen and no dings or scratches. It had no SIM card which cost $20 and a $40 activation fee because it was a 3rd line on our existing account. I will be buying again.",

I hate having to go into att and haggle over a phone and walmart will no longer let you turn on a togo phone and see if you like it before purchasing and returning it is a hassle. This seemed to be a chance i could afford to take. My only \"true\" issue is the camera is awful. But the rest of the phone is decent and itll work for what I need it to. Which is to be a phone.",

I like the big screen. What I have the biggest problem with is the amount of space. You can maybe put 8 apps on this phone before you're out of space. And since this doesn't have jellybean you can't use your SD card for much of anything. Way too small. You have to delete apps off and reinstall others over and over again.
