After six months and the second battery change it just quit altogether, wouldn't sync or power up. I will look into a more comprehensive device for the future.",

Having a battery that you change instead of a rechargeable device is also much more convenient. The only thing I would change is the app - in Android, anyway, the sync is pretty unreliable. It can take 3-4 tries sometimes to sync. Sometimes it syncs the first go, others it takes a few tries. Not sure why this happens.",

It's in a bar graph formation and doesn't convey the information in a clean, simple way. My biggest complaint is that the sport band pulls your hair. The snap inevitably catches multiple hairs when I reach back to put my hair in a ponytail. I think it may have been designed with only short hair in mind. Last, sometimes it's so hard to get it to respond-- I'm talking 10-15 taps. It's very picky about how you tap it. At times I've thought the battery was dead because it just wouldn't respond.",

      "text": "Pros of the Misfit Shine - 1. No need for daily/weekly charging as batteries last up to 4 months 2. Able to track swimming 3. Aesthetically pleasing 4. Simple with minimal frills Cons - 1. Syncing to the iPhone is not very reliable and some times takes me a few attempts 2. Hard to read time Overall - I like it and has been wearing it daily for about a year now. Being a swimmer, this suits my needs. However, there are opportunities to improve the app and syncing.",

      "text": "It works great. I've had a fitbit, Jawbone UP, UP24, Withings Pulse O2 previously. I still use the UP24 as my silent alarm, but I wear the Shine all the time. It tracks cycling (I bike to work), swim strokes (I go swimming 2-3 times a week) and does a great job of tracking my steps. I will say it does step tracking with a higher accuracy than any of my previous trackers, although I find it is most accurate when worn on my ankle (I clip it to my sock). I've had zero issues with it popping out, on both the sport band I use for swimming or the regular clip I use most of the time.",

Having a waterproof fitness tracker that does not require weekly charging was the main reason for selecting Misfit and I am glad I did. It is lightweight and sleek that I don't even notice I am wearing it compared to other brands I have tried. Simple and efficient, I never take it off. Fitbit had a few design flaws and I was having to charge it daily towards the end of its few month lifespan, Shine has been great even when I had my unit replaced for a battery drain.",

Why would you send an opened used product when the listing says new?",
