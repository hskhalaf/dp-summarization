      "text": "This is a great basic machine. It has all the stiches I will need. Easy to set up and thread. A perfect machine for anyone who needs a good machine! I didn't want the computerized machines and this is perfect for me. It comes with a set of needles and a few presser feet. Does not come with a walking foot, which I was hoping it would. It's a low shank machine with snap on presser feet---so finding feet that fit should not be a problem. I like the vertical bobbin too. I don't like the cheap plastic of some machines. It does everything I was hoping for!",

It should be a simple adjustment but no live person could be reached at the Janome call number. I bought another Janome at an independent dealer where my questions will be answered directly. I would rate the Janome help a Minus star.",

I didn't care for the darning foot included in the 15 piece set; however, I was able to find another generic low shank foot at a local fabric store that works well so far.",

I just need a light, portable machine which is easy to sit down and get going. The fabric feed glides smoothly and the bobbin wider is straight forward. Really a nice machine for a casual sewer.",
