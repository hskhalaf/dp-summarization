I wish it came in something other than hot pink and baby blue (candy apple red or midnight blue would be nice), but eh; nothing to ding it for, especially at this price. Now it'd be nice if the filter basket on the Rok I bought along with this tamper also measured 49mm like it says in its description. Alas, it's ~50.1mm.
