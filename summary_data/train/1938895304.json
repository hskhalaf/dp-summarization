By opening my eyes and showing me just how simple (I said simple, not easy) weight loss is if you put in the work and practice some willpower. Using the methods in this book, i was able to lose 109 lbs and as of today have maintained this body for 2 years now. At the age of 41 mind you. My outlook on life has changed DRASTICALLY over these 2 years and a large part of it is due to this book. Thank you, Mike. From the bottom of my heart! I wish you much success in the future.",

Then goes on to giving you a in depth description of each dictionary word that we may have heard in the fitness realm.

I've tweaked the diet half a dozen times. In spite of this, I am noticeably stronger and have lost five inches from my waist measurement (from 40 to 35). I've tried a lot of programs over the past decade, this is the first time I've made real progress without getting injured. I plan to continue. Have the Kindle version.",

      "text": "Really, almost a science based guide to 'body hacking'. The exact ways you can change your body how you like without illicit substances or ineffectively long workouts. Mike backs everything up with an extensive bibliography, he does the research so you don't have to. And his writing and communication style are really easy to like. Backed up by almost real time communication on his website if you have any questions or concerns. I've used other \"training\" guides, and some are great, but this one really consolidates, simplifies, and codifies a simple, clear and robust approach to strength and conditioning training. You can have the body you want, at any age.",
