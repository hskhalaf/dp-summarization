The 950 phone takes great photographs, the memory increase also helps everything run much smoother. I was sorry to see Microsoft get out of the phone business. I understand the economics. But just the fact that I don't get a lot of junk popups on my phone such as what Android phones get. Means a great deal to me. It helps a lot when you're in a business mode that you don't need to see a bunch of garbage pop up on your phone.",
