      "text": "We bought this bench a year ago and were pleased with it at the time. It was the right size, the right color, and it comfortably fits my three young kids. Everything was great until a few months later. I started to notice that every time I wiped the bench off after my kids ate, the paper towel would come away brown. At first I thought the bench was just dirty, but as the months went by, the bench's color got lighter and lighter. A bit of the finish comes right off every time I clean it. Now the bench is not the right color at all and I am back on the market for a new bench.",

I will be purchasing another for the other side of the table, I like it that much. It was packaged very well and arrived with only some minor hair line scratches that are almost not noticeable. Fast shipping as well. Satisfied!!!",

My only complaint was with the shipping. I waited 3 weeks for the bench and when it didn't come, Amazon did a great job of contacting the seller and sending a new one. I was more annoyed I had to wait another 2 weeks to receive my bench.",
