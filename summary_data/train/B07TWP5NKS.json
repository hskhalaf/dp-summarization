It's slightly larger and thicker than a DVD case. It doesn't stain either! My kiddo has had quite a few messy diapers, but you'd never be able to tell after wiping the pad down. The quality is great as well. There has been no fraying or issues of any kind. I love the size of this pad and definitely recommend it!",

This is a large pad so you can get YEARS worth of uses out of it. Use it on the bed, on the couch, or even on the floor. Any flat supported surface will work. Easy to wipe clean (if there's a mess).

But we just fold it in half first rather than thirds and it's perfectly fine, just leaves a little extra slack on the strap around but doesn't cause any problems.",

I have another changing pad that came with my diaper bag that was a little lore padded than this one. The only reason I needed a new one was because my baby is getting very long and the usual changing pads are not long enough That being said - it is compact and slim when folded and overall not baddies",
