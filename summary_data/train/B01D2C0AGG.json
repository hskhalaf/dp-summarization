It would be better if it were an inch or so wider to accommodate larger onions. Using this does create more waste (about 1/2 an inch of whatever slicing is mangled by the pusher/slicing guard. NEVER cut without it. Even so, it's fast and easy once you get the hang of it.",

I've tried several other brands of mandoline, and they were just to complicated + didn't do the job. This one was perfect, easy and felt safe. I easily adjusted the thickness for beautiful slices of potatoes, zucchini and onion. Packaged great, comes with 3 other blades. Very happy with this mandoline. The hand guard works great too.",

      "title": "Sauerkraut Slicer",
      "text": "The Benriner jumbo slicer is well made. The slicer will slice cabbage ultra thin for sauerkraut or slaw. Unfortunately, the blade can be hard to adjust. After turning the adjustment knob you must push the guide plate down to adjust the thickness. Turning the knob to decrease the thickness is difficult and the plate needs to be pushed from the backside. It took several tries to get the thickness I wanted. Once adjusted the Benriner is a joy to use. The Benriner has a notch that fit well over my large 11\" diameter stainless bowl to hold it in place while slicing.",

      "text": "It really is a great mandoline in almost every way. Super easy to use and clean, super sharp, just great. My two complaints: 1. the max thickness seems to be about 1/8\" or maybe a little more. it doesn't seem to make it all the way to 1/4\" and certainly not beyond, which is a bummer as sometimes i need thicker slices. 2. there's no way to know for sure how thick it is. i've tried measuring, but it's really not that easy. i'd love for it to have some way of indicating the thickness of it's setting, that would be great. otherwise, highly recommended.",

While it did have an adjustment, the thickest setting meant that the base becomes unstable, and the adjustable part pops up after each slice. So it was a no go for our apple slicing. Perhaps its just really meant for thin slices. Apples though did not slice easily.",

The points don't hold harder vegetables, so the vegetable just falls off. If you try to shred vegetables without the holder, you will shred your fingers. Since you have to take it apart to clean it properly, it really isn't any easier to clean than the food processor. Total waste of money.",
