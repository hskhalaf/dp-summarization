I'm a small in most women's apparel, but I needed a medium in these. So, they fit more like Junior sizes than women's. Super comfy--barely notice they're there. These are also the mesh ones, not the neoprene-like ones. I can't stand the neoprene ones because they don't have enough staying power for curves. These are great for stay-put undies. I will be buying these until the day I die.",

The tights are awesome otherwise, so I went on the hunt for a pair of undies to wear with them. These fit perfectly, didn't ride up or over or under, and were so light I didn't notice I was wearing them. Now, my tights are very form-fitting and I only ran three miles...but without them I can tell you three miles were torture so, this was money well spent. Highly recommend.",
