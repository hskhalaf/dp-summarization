Pros: chest strap very versatile pack - roll-top is SUPER handy to have, Front velcro holds my bike lock in place water bottle pocket (never owning a pack without one) Solid comfort level Con: Not the greatest materials (Made in China) - a couple seams are ripping, water bottle meshing ripped early on, on one side the waterproof backing is crumbling off. (personal con: The outer velcro attracts everything, endless fuzzes caught in there, and has ruined multiple sweaters/scarves)",

      "text": "The backpack works as expected. It's not too heavy, but it is heavier than your typical Jansport basic backpack. It also seems fairly secure and there's an unzippable area in the back so you can easily access your laptop or either items without having to undo the front flap. The loops are cool looking, and help in giving a place to put carabiners and locks. I wish it had one more beverage pocket on the other side and for whatever reason it oftentimes feels too small on the inside even though I know it can hold more items (i.e., there's not that much stretch or give when cramming stuff).",

It had gotten tossed due to getting something nasty spilled inside, and she liked it enough to request another. I contemplated a Herschel or a Fjallraven backpack until she (not so subtly) sent me a link with the backpack she wanted, on some sort of Black Friday sale. Done! Some of the reasons she loves it: the all black color; the straps; enormous amount of space inside; and the size is ideal (smaller backpacks can make someone who isn\u2019t petite look like a giant, and one that\u2019s too big would be too heavy).",

      "text": "This is my second Timbuk2 bag, wanted something to alternate with my classic messenger. This bag is super deep, plenty of space for pretty much anything you need. Perfect laptop slot accessible from the back, tablet slot, internal pockets - everything you need from a great daypack. Buy it, you won't regret it. Timbuk2 bags are made of high-quality material and the craftsmanship shows.",

      "text": "By far the best backpack I have ever owned. The construction is solid and the aesthetic is bold and minimalist. Moreover, the bag expands vertically to carry a full load when needed and folds for a more compact look when carrying everyday items. The weight distribution which is enhanced by the sternum strap makes what you're carrying feel lighter than it is. Strongly recommended.",
