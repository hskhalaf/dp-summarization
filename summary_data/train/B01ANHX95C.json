I checked the wiriing, insulation on all the wires, but everything was intact. I put back the old motion detector light which still works (but is about 300 watts!). They responded promptly, on a Saturday and Sunday even, and offered to send a replacement and return shipping label. Hopefully I got a rare defective unit and the new one will be in line with the majority near-5 star experience. I can say that the customer service has been top-notch so far.",

The installation was simple, and replaced the existing standard light over my garage door. The adjustments for the motion sensor were simple enough to follow. My favorite comment from the neighbors (since we were seeing a larger string of car theft activity in our neighborhood) was \"Finally, something that's brighter than the street lights!\" It's power, completely fills all the voids the neighbors' cameras miss from low night vision distance issues, and makes everything crystal clear on screens. Anything more powerful and you're probably covering something more than a 2-car garage.",

We got 1 decent rain and one of the fixtures is half filled with water. So much for being made for wet conditions. I'm reaching out to the selling for a resolution.

Is there an application where you might undo those? Maybe. But for your average homeowner (read: limited electrical experience) I had no plans of messing with it.
