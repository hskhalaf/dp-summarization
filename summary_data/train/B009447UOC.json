I used the 21mm a bunch of times taking wheels off my truck however I went to do some suspension work this past weekend and realized that I had 3 15mm sized sockets that are labelled \"14mm, 15mm, 16mm\" so I had to go out and buy a set of deep sockets from sears... sucks this would have been a really nice set if it wasn't defective. EDIT - Emailed Tekton and they said they would send me a replacement socket for the ones I was missing. I'll update when I get them.",

I can't speak for other manufactures, however this particular set stands out. The TEKTON has Fatigue Strength 750 MPa and 110 x 103 psi. 750 MPa = 108778 psi. They are Quenched and Tempered 6150 Chromium-Vanadium Steel. Approximately from the Internet. NOT exactly. So, please use some reasoning! You are most likely NOT going to break these Impact Sockets at all. All in all I very much endorse TEKTON products made in USA. The finest products in the Industry. And you got it here on Amazon.

This set does not skip a size from lowest (10mm) to highest (24mm). Easy to read etching of the socket size is on the side of each socket. The blow molded case makes for a quality made, organized set that I'll use again and again.",

If you want tools you can abuse without thinking about it, spend the money and get Snap-Ons. If you want high quality tools that are affordable, you need to respect them.

The biggest difference between the two sets was that the Craftsman set was missing a couple sizes, a common practice with socket sets of all brands. I went with the complete Tekton set and I'm glad I did. The first size I needed was an 18mm socket to install the bolt on a harmonic balancer. This set has the 18, the other does not. So you might say that the missing sizes are rarely used BUT, if that's the size you need for a particular job, 'rarely used' doesn't help get the bolt off.",

    "title": "TEKTON 1/2 Inch Drive Deep 6-Point Impact Socket Set, 15-Piece (10-24 mm) | 4883",
    "description": "Style:Impact socket set\n\nBuilt for use with impact tools, these TEKTON 1/2 in. drive deep impact sockets effortlessly break free rusty suspension and exhaust bolts, quickly remove stuck lug nuts, and loosen crank bolts with ease. TEKTON impact sockets efficiently transfer torque from impact wrench to fastener, loosening the most stubborn nuts and bolts. Made from high-strength chrome vanadium steel, our impact sockets are more resistant to drive end round out than standard impact sockets, resulting in a longer useable life. TEKTON impact sockets meet or exceed ANSI performance standards. The high-torque, 6-point socket grips the broad, flat sides of nuts and bolts, not just the corners, so there's no need to worry about stripping fastener head or damaging socket. An extra-deep broach enables you to access the entire length of fasteners. Even in low light, the high-contrast, permanent laser etched size markings are easy-to-read. The customized red TEKTON case can be stored in a tool chest or carried to your job site. Molded size markings keeps set organized and identifies any missing sockets.\n\nSet Includes:\n\n * (15) 1/2 in. drive deepwell 6-point sockets (metric): 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 mm\n * (1) storage case\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nCovering a continuous range from 10 to 24mm, the 6-point TEKTON 4883 1/2 in. Drive Deep Chrome Vanadium Sockets are built for use with impact wrenches to loosen the most stubborn fasteners without stripping them.",
