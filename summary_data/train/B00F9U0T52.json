I bought this held for my mom about a year ago and pretty quickly the top warped, it stopped whistling, and the inside bottom is coming off in little chips that I'm glad I noticed. Who knows how long she's been drinking tiny little chips she couldn't yet see. I have no idea because it looks like it's been doing for a while. This is infuriating. All I wanted was to get her a little kettle for coffee. I guess you can't go for the cheaper option or you'll be poisoned.",

The lid comes off, the inside is easily cleaned, and the handle doesn't get hot when heating water. If you're not looking for a pretty kettle with neat designs and features, this one should definitely meet your needs.",
