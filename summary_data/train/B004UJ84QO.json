Within a week I noticed my skin is much softer and I feel more comfortable in my own skin. A bonus, I have a really tight jaw usually and I have noticed that has subsided as well! I can't wait to see what else it helps with as I am only a week in. I do wish these were vegetarian capsules though. I hope they switch to Vcaps at some point.",
