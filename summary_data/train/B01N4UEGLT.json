It definitely neutralizes and deodorizes, but the smell itself doesn't last long. I wouldn't be able to use it as a room scent as it only lasts for about 5 min and then it's like it was never there. Just wish it lasted longer. I would still buy this in the future because it does do what it says it does.",
