There is only one thing that annoys the ocd in me. The word \"Himself\" and \"Herself\" show the letter \"e\" above the letter \"l\" as if they ran out of room in the design. I've eyed these mugs on Amazon for several years. When the quantity got low - I bit the bullet and bought them. Actually I bought 2 of each; one of each to use, and another set for when (hopefully never) something happens to the first set.",
