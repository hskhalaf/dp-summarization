The main bar is 48 watts , the subwoofer 18 ... There are no real mid range speakers. They are 2 small dome speakers per side plus a tweeter. No audio controls whatsoever. no bass,mid,treble or equalizer. I expected more from a company like Yamaha. Main goal is to listen to music coming from airplay source. I am not using this for voice or tv . Nobody seems to make a good stereo network player anymore ..",

No real downside. I wish the bar were a bit less deep, so it could go under my TV without sticking out, but I would keep the depth rather than losing the sound quality.

Sometimes it sees the server, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it can communicate with the server, sometimes it can. Junk. And it's the only reason this might be worth $450.00. On sound quality, I replaced it with a $180 Polk sound bar that sounds better. Enough said. Special note: The sub is weird. It's there, it adds bass. But there's a weird delay I've never heard with any other wireless subwoofer setup. It's almost like you're listening to a second system on a just-long-enough delay to throw everything off.",
