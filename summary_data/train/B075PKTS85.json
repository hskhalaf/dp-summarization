      "text": "This is my second one of these vacuums. My first one (maroon one) would tend to flip over easily, but the purple one has larger wheels and does not seem to have that problem. I prefer a bagged vacuum over baggless. Much easier to just throw out the bag rather than emptying and cleaning it. The bags aren\u2019t very expensive and last a very long time. Their customer service is great too. I thought mine was missing the crevice tool so I called and they sent one right away. However, unlike the maroon one, the crevice tool was actually underneath the vacuum. Very lightweight, very powerful, and expensive. Great little vacuum cleaner.",

It comes with 3 different heads (the regular for floor, skinnier for tight spots and one with brush on it. I use the brush end on window sills, cabinet doors, base boards and so on. I have a two story house and I have no issues using this on the stairs. If you are thinking about this -just buy it!",

That's a plus on rugs. It picks up things the Dyson wouldn't. I hate to rag on Dyson, but for $60, this vacuum cleaner is head and shoulders above it. The only problem I had is that the handle will come off while you're vacuuming if it's not in there really tight.",

I had to tape it on with electrical tape. Not something I expect to have to do on a new item. I can't rate stairs or carpet because I don't have either.",

For this price point, the suction power is terrific but everything else offsets it as serious negatives, and ceasing operating altogether in just a few weeks kills it for me ... would not recommend that anyone purchase this Bissell unit. It did \"Zing\" me for $57.",
