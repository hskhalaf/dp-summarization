We went through 2 bottles of Co2 trying to figure out a very simple issue. The tech said that many people throw these away as they don't appear to have an opening and act like plugs, BUT with pressure the opening that you can't see will work. We are out $65 plus time and frustration trying to fix an issue (leaking lines and couplers) that could have very easily been avoided if the directions made reference to the part I referenced previously.",

I first discovered this as a fountain of brown ale came blasting out from between the coupler and the tightening nut when I connected the first keg. The following evening, I went to pull the tap and nothing came out...turns out my gas tank had emptied overnight...this is because the check valves used in the gas line are also terrible and made of that same material. If you get this kegerator, I recommend buying replacement check valves and washer. Don't even bother using the default ones, it should only cost you a couple bucks.",

The C02 tank and regulator looked to be very good quality on the other hand.

I am not a huge drinker, and really love the ability to pour small amounts at a time while at the same time having a steady supply from the two taps to satisfy any groups that come over. The prodoct is very high quality and shipping was great. Its VERY heavy in the box, so if you have to move it up stairs, or even just up the drive way you will want help. Once assembled, its easy to move on its built in wheels",

The customer service department was also great to deal with as they credited us for the difference in price and also sent out a deluxe keg line cleaning kit. While i wish we had the stainless steel, it is not a deal breaker at all, as we plan to install it in a build in bar in a year or two.",
