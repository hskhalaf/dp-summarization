I will not purchase it again, as I am familiar with how destructive and invasive pantry moths are. Very disappointed in this decline in quality from a premium product.",

So I switched back permanently & everyone gets the proplan shredded blend that best suits their dietary needs (puppy, senior, adult, or small breed). And they\u2019re all healthy with great coats, nice teeth, high (so high!) energy. And it\u2019s moderately priced so I don\u2019t have to starve myself to feed my dogs (but I totally would if I had to!).",

This is the only food she goes head down into her bowl for, and licks the bowl when it's empty. Why this is significant: my dog is the least food-motivated dog I've ever known. She has no interest in food. It is not unusual for her to go 24-36 hours without eating. This food changed that pattern! She LOVES it!",

It also gives their coat a healthy shine.",
