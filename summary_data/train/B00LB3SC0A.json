I have an email out to the seller to see what's going on, will update this review accordingly. Update: Heard back from USA Commerce, they say the product is the same quality as what I bought last year. I completely disagree, I had both of them open in my garden yesterday and there is an obvious difference between the two. I'm returning it, will find another solution.",

Will definitely buy when needed again; it seems sturdy enough to take off and on as the weather demands and will likely last more than one season. I do recommend rocks or bricks to hold the fabric down, if you clip or pin it it may tear and not last as long.",

    "description": "Size:83\"X50'Stronger grade to last longer. Provides up to 4\u00ba +F frost protection for valuable, frost-sensitive perennials and sensitive vegetables. Agribon floating row covers have all the qualities of other brands, while being more affordable and with seams double-bonded for ultra-strength. These floating rowcovers increase yields, prolong seasons, reduce soil erosion, protect against frost, speed up germination, minimize wind damage, conserve soil moisture, deter insects and birds and protect against extreme temperatures. High quality spun-bonded polypropylene cover is light enough (0.55 oz./sq.yd.) to be laid directly over plants without hoops or frames but strong enough to withstand light to moderate wind and other stress. No need to remove it during the season because it is porous to water and air and has 85% light transmittance. It provides up to 4\u00b0F of frost protection, warms the soil and is a good pest barrier. It also conserves water by reducing evaporation. It is similar to other rowcovers but generally longer lasting. UV stabilizers increase expected field life to 2 to 3 seasons.",
