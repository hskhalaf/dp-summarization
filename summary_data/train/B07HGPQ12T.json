It\u2019s going to be a major job removing them :( Other than that issue, great chairs. If I had known about the labels, I probably would have chosen something else just to save the work and time of removing labels., even if it cost more.",

This Amazon brand is also almost exactly the same as a more expensive brand that is offered, but about half the price! If we need more chairs, we'll definitely order these again.",
