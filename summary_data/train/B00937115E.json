One of them (changing color balance) removed about 20% of it, but that's entirely unacceptable. I returned this and bought an ASUS touchscreen monitor for less money (a bit smaller though), and it's perfect in all the ways. The one good thing I can say about this monitor (if you're lucky enough that yours would actually work without strobe-light pixelation) is the stand. The stand is the best I've ever seen, but that's simply not enough as I don't LOOK at the stand! : P",

Touch is accurate and worked out of the box. Biggest con: the power/menu buttons are also touch-based and sometimes react when you do not intend. Its easy enough to stay away from that screen edge, so not a deal breaker. What I'd like to see in a future version: Physical buttons on the back. Separate 12V/24V power supply, thinner/lighter. It would have been extremely handy to be able to power this off DC instead of AC in my application (off grid automation).",

The only complaint I have is the monitor control buttons are also capacitive and, aside from the power one, don't light up.
