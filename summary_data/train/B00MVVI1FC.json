There was only a slight scratches on the film that covers the appliance. Removed the film and scratches were gone. Works like a charm but does have a clicking sound once in awhile I'm assuming when the compressor kicks in. Overall it's a great buy, very happy.",

Stuff slips out from the shelves also and the bottom compartment is small also. It's completely silent which is great bc I keep it in my room.

What stinks is my office cleaning crew had already taken our the box, so I would have to buy another box (sturdy) to return the fridge. Another thing I didn't like was it looks like it was already used by someone else. If I had the box I would probably have returned. Wouldn't by again.",

When I do, it's big enough to fit one fairly large TV dinner. I don't like it sitting on the floor, so I bought a small table that sits about 10 inches off the floor. The fridge rests on top of it.",

      "text": "This is an ok fridge. Good size for work, I use mine for lunch and storing breast milk when I pump at work. The little freezer is a good size for a small ice pack like what comes with a Medela pump cooler, however the door to the freezer is flimsy and doesn't seal well. My freezer is all frosted over in a thick layer after only owning a couple months. For the price I guess it'll do.",
