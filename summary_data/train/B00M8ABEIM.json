I am using this as my only drive with windows 7, an antivirus and 2 games on it. The usage is at 67 GB of 223 GB. As long as you are not downloading a lot of music or trying to download movies on the machine this should be big enough for you to use it as your only drive. If you do download those things buy a cheap Hard Drive to put those things on and this is still a great choice for your OS",

Full hard drive virus scanning and indexing are just a few minutes and seconds respectively. I'm planning on getting another one for my other laptop soon. The battery life on my laptop has improved, not by much, but has improved. This hard drive does the job for me.",
