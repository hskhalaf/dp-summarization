The problem with most malodorous footwear, I have come to understand, is that they are worn too often without enough time in-between wearings to \"dry out,\" or to let the bacteria inside them die away. This spray helps with that issue by thoroughly deodorizing the shoe or boot from toe to heel. The price isn't bad for what your get, either. No complaints.",

      "text": "We have previously used some DrScholls shoe spray, but this is so much easier to use. The design really gets the full shoe easily, no problems spraying at all angles. You literally push the canister into the shoe and the pressure from the bottom of your shoe sets it to spray front and back. Genius design! Super helpful and easy to use for elderly and disabled folks too!",

      "text": "I was expecting that this would have a better smell. However, it does smell better than shoes. Very easy to use just push it in the shoes and the spray is in the shoe. The smell lasts for a long time at least for 12 + hours. I would definitely recommend using it after some time of taking off the shoes otherwise the smell gets mixed up and it smells worse. I like the fact of how the spray is designed and can spray a lot of shoes. I definitely would ask the creator to manufacture with different smells.",

Perfect for boots. Just place the KIWI into the shoe or boot and push down. Nothing awkward about trying to get the spray in the right direction. Only press down when you have the KIWI in the shoe! A preset amount is easily dispensed into the shoe. Could not be easier and the scent is very nice.",

Insert into shoe, squirt. I don't know what the longevity of it is going to be yet, but it seems effective on my tennis shoes so far. And this design is nice, definitely the EASIEST application I've ever seen for a shoe deodorant product.",

I was expecting a conventional sprayer that you just pointed into the shoes and sprayed but that is not how this KIWI deodorizer is made. It is actually better than a conventional sprayer because almost all of the spray will be inside the show. Just turn the nozzle to expose the spray heads, put the bigger opening toward the front of the shoe and push down. Now your shoe will smell nice for quite awhile.",

The lid is just a half a turn and press down inside the shoe and it sprays a generous spray of deodorizer spay inside the shoe. The spray neutralizes the smell inside the shoes leaving them smelling fresh and clean. When not in use, just give the head a half a turn and it puts the spray in a safety position.",
