      "text": "As someone with two decades in the sport of BMX, both freestyle and racing, but nearly 10 years off the track. I finally got the urge to get back onto the track. Searching around the current offerings on the market I wasn't too excited to find there was a large gap between the cheapy-cheapy & higher end completes. With some research under my belt I settled on the Title Elite XL. For the money, it's a great bike. The parts seem quality, but the frame stands out as super nice. I've upgraded a lot of parts since I purchased, but the foundation of the frame still feels solid and much like a higher quality frame.",

I put a Thomson Elite seat post on it as the original is super short and useless. Took it to the track and I had the only one there, lots of the cheaper blue ones though. Tires are rated at 100psi which is rather amazing, and it feels fast with that pressure. Overall it\u2019s a good deal. It would\u2019ve been nice to piece a bike together but I would\u2019ve spent double this amount.",

Poor customer service, it took 6 tries to reach anyone at Mongoose and they required multiple pictures, multiple emails to deny any warranty coverage. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE LOSER BIKES!",

Then after a full race set up this bike is in the 19lb rang, I could not be happier! Been on her most of the season and no issues! You can pay a lot more for the same quality but why!

Literally the ONLY adjustment we made was the saddle stem height. Basic stuff. The quality really shows through in the frame, it feels high end and while we might upgrade other parts throughout the years the frame is here to stay. This bike is being used for freestyle BMX, and onto the track! It\u2019s the perfect blend between a high-end BMX bike and a more affordable option.",
