Right out of the box the finish has started peeling and flaking off like it has an extreme case DANDRUFF. So far there is a big one inch flake of chrome missing from the bar. There are little specs of chrome from this bar on the rubber floor mats in my home gym. Not to happy about that.",

It arrived just shy of a week late, the box was completely trashed, half of it was missing like it fell out of the truck and nobody had an explanation. Came with scuffs and only one side was bubble wrapped. The product itself is good. Heavy, good thick welds, knurling is almost TOO aggressive. To the point where too much weight will tear up your hands, but I'd rather have something to wear down than something that feels like it's been heavily used already. Don't leave it in the sun if you work out outside, the knurling chewing your skin up won't feel too good when you're touching something searing hot.",

I would suggest better packaging. However, the hex bar is okay and exactly what hubby wanted so all is good. This item is heavy so be prepared.",

No complaints . However........ The only downside of this it the sleeve length. Depending on how much you load and plate size, With 9 inch the bar can only hold so much. This is only a problem on the size of your plates or if you want to really load the bar up. Most trap bars are 17 inch. Still worth the purchase just important to know for future lifts.",

So far I have used it for dead lifts and it is excellent, very solid and plenty of room inside. The price I paid was jacked up higher than normal as Amazon was taking advantage of the pandemic to milk more profit from customers so not super pleased about that, but overall it's a good purchase.",
