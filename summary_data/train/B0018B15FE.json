I love that the product goes back to the basics of what makes good soap, that it is without scent, and that a little bit of product goes a long way. So far, with a family of two, one 2.64lb bag lasted us about 9 months of 1-2 loads per week. With a baby on the way, I anticipate that we will go through a bag more quickly, but I intend to continue using this for all our laundry needs, the baby's included. I trust this brand and would highly recommend it to others.",

Great for cloth diapers as well, don't forget vinegar for the rinse cycle and you're golden!",
