The box it comes in--however--is a nightmare to get open. It is apparently meant to be able to ship and not get damaged--and it seems to do that. They did not however-EVER want you to cut and open it! So-if you already have enough box issues--this may not be one you want to tackle.",

I like a bigger roll because they last longer and the select-a-size comes in handy when you just need a napkin or to wipe a little one's face. I find them to be very similar to Bounty or Brawny. Thick, strong, no lint left behind. Perfect for windows and glass cleaning. The price is certainly right and the quality is there. Bonus - they're delivered to your door! Cant go wrong there! Try the Presto! brand out.",

We use them as napkins at casual dinners, clean up around the house, pet messes, kid messes, etc. I also like to use them for nail polish removal (cotton balls tend to leave strings to catch in your nail polish). They are tough and hold up well when scrubbing things.",
