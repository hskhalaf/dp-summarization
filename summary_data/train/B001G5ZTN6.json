Reading other reviews attesting to poor picture quality, dust motes/orbs, etc, made me a little nervous about my choice - since working with the product the negatives have thus far proven to be unfounded. If a person wants better pics.... get an SLR. I'm satisfied, the camera does what I want, easily, quickly and with excellent results.",

All in a package smaller than a deck of cards. Wide range (28-112) on zoom is major plus. Very easy to transfer images to computer. I've had the camera for less than a month. If anything goes sideways, I'll report back. One spec item you might want to look carefully at is picture quality at various ISO settings. Many point & shoot's picture quality fall off after ISO 200. That is pretty low. Per Consumer Reports, the 880 goes to ISO 400.",

I think that the image stabilization may have worked a little better on my 870, but it is hard to tell. I like the rotary wheel for selecting menu items - saves countless button pushes. The main reason I bought this model was for the W I D E angle lens - absolutely necessary for travel photos, and this one performs very well. Great work, Canon - but we should have had a black version.",

This is a fine camera, except that it suffers from excessive noise (even at 80 and 100 ISO) for it to be fully useful. The 10MP is of limited value, as most of the pixels are smeared by the aggressive noise reduction. Bumping down to lower MP levels does not alleviate the problem. Could be a good camera to use in full sunlight or outdoor shots, but not for anything indoors. While one can't expect any point-and-shoot to have the sensitivity of a DSLR, my old Canon SD1000 pocket cam performs better than the SD880 in this regard.",

I absolutely recommend this camera to people like me who use it for everyday pictures, going out dancing and impromptu photo shoots!",

When there's no smoke, you can see the the flash sparks brighter than before. I did a search on Google and many share the same problem. So buyers beware!!",

I did not have this problem with the 5MP model, except in low light conditions. I cannot figure it out. At least two-thirds of the pictures I take now are blurry. Either there's something wrong with my camera or this model really is not very good.",

    "description": "Color:SilverIt\u2019s so easy to capture the magic of every moment when SD880 IS Digital ELPH comes along for the ride. There\u2019s a terrific sense of creative options for your photographic sense with a wide range of shooting modes and a wide-angle 28mm lens--all because your camera sees the world without limits. Of course, it\u2019s a stylish point of view from a camera that merges up-to-the-moment performance with the art of impeccable design.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n It\u2019s so easy to capture the magic of every moment when SD880 IS Digital ELPH comes along for the ride. There\u2019s a terrific sense of creative options for your photographic sense with a wide range of shooting modes and a wide-angle 28mm lens--all because your camera sees the world without limits. Of course, it\u2019s a stylish point of view from a camera that merges up-to-the-moment performance with the art of impeccable design. \n\nPowerShot SD880IS Highlights \n\n\n\nSlick 10.0-megapixel camera expands the Digital ELPH line to allow greater creative freedom\nWith the PowerShot SD880 IS Digital ELPH camera\u2019s 10.0 megapixels of imaging power, you\u2019ve got a passport to unsurpassed image quality and versatility. Go ahead, enlarge pictures bigger than ever before without worrying about the image quality. And look forward to much more creative flexibility when you\u2019re cropping and printing. The SD880 IS Digital ELPH may be ultra-slim and sculpture-sleek, but its focus is on the power of visual impact. \n\n4x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer plus a 28mm wide-angle lens\nWhen it\u2019s time to take a closer look, the PowerShot SD880 IS Digital ELPH features a 4x Optical Zoom and advanced Optical Image Stabilizer, greatly minimizing camera shake and maximizing the brilliance of every detail. And Canon\u2019s precision 28mm wide-angle lens lets you capture more in every frame, so everyone fits in a family gathering shot. \n\nLarge high-quality 3.0-inch PureColor LCD II\nThe PowerShot SD880 IS Digital ELPH gives you a large 3.0-inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. Canon\u2019s PureColor LCD II offers spectacular color, resolution and contrast even when viewed at an angle. The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch-resistant, antireflective coating. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light--a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. \n\nNew DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves Face Detection, adds Servo AF, Face Detection Self-Timer and Intelligent Contrast Correction \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\nCanon\u2019s proprietary DIGIC Image Processors have long set its cameras apart from the competition, and the new DIGIC 4 sets the bar even higher. Faster, more accurate noise reduction delivers better image quality, even at high ISO speeds. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA new Face Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, and specify Face Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection now tracks moving subjects in a much larger range, and the new Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway -- allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Also, Face Detection and Motion Detection are markedly improved. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the new i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot SD880 IS Digital ELPH can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) The Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The SD880 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the SD880 IS Digital ELPH features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\nA wide range of shooting modes to capture anything\nNow you\u2019re free to concentrate on what really counts--your subject. All you have to do is turn to the setting that best matches the scene you\u2019re viewing through the lens. The PowerShot SD880 IS Digital ELPH does the rest. It chooses the perfect exposure, aperture and flash. You\u2019ve got Special Scenes Modes to handle a wide range of common shooting situations--effortlessly. \n\nWith 19 Shooting Modes including 16 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading\nThe PowerShot SD880 IS Digital ELPH's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD880 IS Digital ELPH to a Canon PIXMA Photo Printer or SELPHY Compact Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). Print your own ID photos in up to 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * PowerShot SD880IS Digital ELPH body \n * Wrist Strap WS-DC7 \n * SD Memory Card SDC-32M \n * Battery Pack NB-5L \n * Battery Charger CB-2LX \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400 \n * Interface Cable IFC-400PCU (USB) \n * Solution Disk",
