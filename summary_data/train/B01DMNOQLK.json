The main selling point was that it comes with a pole for installation. The last thing I wanted to do was to order a separate item that wouldn't work. In terms of quality- no more choppiness or cutting in/out. Quality is just like cable and the best of all is that it is FREE!",

One of the wing nuts provided was the wrong size and there were two missing washers. The support post mounting hardware was totally inadequate. Two very small lag bolts, you need four, were provided to mount the antenna support along with four small expansion bolts. The expansion bolts could only be used for masonry ??? Mounting bolts (4) need to be 1/4 inch with washers. There was also absolutely no paperwork about installation, suggested cable type or signal strength testers.",

This antenna is a real bargain at this price and even it it doesn't last, I could but 15 of them for the price of my previous antenna!",

      "text": "I am 63 miles from the Philadelphia stations, I have it pointed at them but do not receive any of them. I am receiving other stations up to 27 miles away (from the rear of the antenna), but even with an amplifier connected I do not receive the ones that are 63 miles away. Also, this antenna was removed from the box and re-packaged before it was sent to me, and there were no instruction included with it...I put it together based on the pictures on the box. I will be looking for a replacement if I can't get it to tune into the stations that should be within range.",

With another 5-10 towers 55 miles away and being on the second floor of my house, I have determined that this antenna doesn't work. I have given 2 stars because it is easy to put together. However it spans like 5 feet so it isn't much of an indoor antenna unless you want to dress it up as a vulture and hang it on your wall ominously watching you.",
