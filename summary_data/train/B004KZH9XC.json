Notice that it's more decorative than functional in terms of making relaxing sounds because you obviously have to stroke the chimes for sounds. So, if you want constant relaxing sounds (and don't want to sit around all day striking chimes, though, nothing's wrong with that), the wind chime will better suit you. The metal chimes in mine do not line up as neatly as the one pictured on Amazon. Mine also came with a string broken, so one of the chimes fell off, so I had to return it.",

I bought this for my wife as a gift, because she loved my musical chimes, which have long gone away, but this is a poor substitute for that musical sound. It looks nice sitting around, though.",

WOODSTOCK THE ORIGINAL MUSICALLY TUNED CHIME. Tuned to beautiful melodies and scales from around the world and available in a wide range of styles, songs and sizes, you can choose the Woodstock Chime that speaks to your soul. HOW IT ALL BEGAN. Garry and his wife Diane founded Woodstock Percussion, in 1979 and it remains a family-owned business in New York's Hudson Valley. Grammy award-winning musician Garry Kvistad created the first Woodstock Chime from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. As a professional musician and instrument designer, he was fascinated by the Scales of Olympos, a 7th century pentatonic scale that can't be played on a modern piano. Garry had the idea to cut and tune the lawn chair chime tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympos was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our bestselling wind chimes.",
