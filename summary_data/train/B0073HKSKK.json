It sits low to the ground but I don't hate it at all, it's very comfortable. I can't wait to enjoy it throughout the spring and summer.",

      "text": "Great outdoor sectional sofa set. I like that you can change the layout, we currently use it in an L shape. It was well packaged in 3 large heavy boxes, no real assembly required, take it out of the box and set it up. I used scotch-guard on the cushions which seems to help deflect the water, but I recommend covering up the sofa or storing the cushions when it rains. Overall we love the set and would recommend it to anyone.",
