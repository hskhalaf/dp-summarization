      "text": "I love my 24oz Tervis Frosty Brew Tumbler! I drink a lot of carbonated water and the bubbles in the water make the translucent wrap on this tumbler look even more realistic! I also use glass straws and was pleased that my 9\u201dx10mm glass straws fit perfectly through the opening in the lid. I\u2019ve added two photos to show the translucency and how well the top accommodates my straw. The ice looks a bit strange because of how the wrap is colored but the bubbles from the carbonated water sticking to my straw also adds to the look of having a frosty brew without the hangover \ud83d\ude01.",

      "text": "Looks very realistic. Typical Tervis quality and attention to detail. Definitely needs the clear travel lid, but it does NOT come with the lid, contrary to what the item title/description says. All you get is the Tumbler. The lids are readily available at many stores for $4 or direct from Tervis. The frosted/clear lid looks best, but a white lid would be fine too. I tried a yellow lid and it looked bad. Add a Tervis handle and you have a great Oktoberfest beer mug.",

The color is very pale to see thru and doesn't look real, and the suds line wasn't put in the glass evenly so it is on an angle. I didn't exchange it cause I figured a replacement would be the same too pale color.",
