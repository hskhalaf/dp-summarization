Using SysInternals process monitor showed that 50% of the CPU was being chewed up by Hardware Interrupts, and the rest by deferred procedure calls. So something was very wrong. It may be because there were 2 wireless routers within range, one a LinkSys and the other the NetGear both oeprating on Channel 11. Whatever the reason, it was unusable.",

    "description": "NETGEAR's WPN511 RangeMax Wireless PC Card, when used with the WPN824 Wireless Router, delivers up to 1000% the coverage and speed of 802.11g. New antenna technology has increased range beyond what was ever possible with previous generation Wi-Fi adapters. Keep your network private with WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access). Setup is quick and easy with the Smart Wizard install assistant. With the RangeMax Wireless Network, you have the longest range of any wireless device on the market today - up to 10 times the wireless coverage of 802.11g. So you'll have a sizzling-fast, consistent connection in every room of your house and beyond. Range Matters: RangeMax adjusts to the interference and physical barriers in your home, and delivers up to 500,000 square feet of coverage - 1000% more than 802.11g. And you don't need to throw away your old wireless devices; RangeMax is 100% compatible with your existing 802.11b/g products and will boost their range and speed by up to 50%. Power Under the Hood: RangeMax is an advanced Smart MIMO (Multi-In, Multi-Out) technology that uses seven internal antennas. RangeMax constantly surveys your home environment for physical barriers and interference and adjusts the wireless signal to compensate for these performance blockers. For example, if you carry your laptop from the family room to the bedroom, RangeMax automatically senses the change and selects from over 100 possible antenna configurations to deliver you the fastest, clearest connection! Simple, Safe, Secure: NETGEAR's SmartWizard makes the set-up easy and hassle-free. SmartWizard automatically detects your ISP's network settings, then walks you through each step of the installation process. It's like having your own computer technician, right by your side. NETGEAR also ensures that every computer user in your home network is protected from intruders by using: a double firewall, WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), and WPA-PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access, Pre-Shared Key) Security.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAmazon.com Product Description The NETGEAR WPN511 RangeMax Wireless PC Card makes it simple for you to provide wireless internet access to your notebook computer, letting you surf the web, check email, and chat online without the need for cables. It is up to ten times faster and has up to ten times more coverage than Wireless-G for a speedy network that won't get bogged down when you you stream music and videos or make internet phone calls. \n\n \n\nEasy Setup\nThe WPN511 is a PC Card and requires a Pentium class PC with an available 32-bit CardBus slot for installation. It supports Windows Vista and is also compatible with Windows XP, 2000, 98SE, and Me. Setup is as simple as inserting the card into the slot and installing the included software. A built-in antenna helps you receive a strong signal for the fastest possible speeds.  Fast and Secure\nThe NETGEAR WPN511 supports the 802.11g protocol standard but is able to provide better performance thanks to Smart MIMO technology that incorporates intelligent internal antennas into the router. The router automatically senses interference from devices such as microwaves and cordless phones, and adjusts accordingly. The upshot is speeds up to 108 Mbps with a longer range and a lack of \"dead zones\" in your home. The adapter is also backwards compatible with 802.11b networks so you don't have to worry about not getting a connection at specific hotspots; the WPN511 will automatically detect the network and allow you to connect to it at the highest speed possible. \n\n The PC card supports 40/64-bit and 128-bit WEP encryption as well as WPA-PSK for security so you don't have to worry about anyone eavesdropping on your emails or stealing your passwords. The included software makes managing different WEP passwords a breeze as you can set up different profiles for each location you frequent, saving yourself the trouble of having to type in encryption keys each time you connect to a hotspot you've already used. \n\n The NETGEAR WPN511 Wireless-G PC Card is backed by a 1-year warranty. \n\n What's in the Box\nWPN511 RangeMax Wireless PC Card, setup CD, installation guide, and warranty/support information card. \n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nAs a 21st-century consumer, your desktop computer is an integral part of your life. But does your home computing environment work for you? Even if you already have a wireless network, you've probably found \"dead spots\" in your home where your Internet connection fades in and out, or drops off completely.\n\nNow, say good-bye to those dead spots -- and say hello to the freedom to work (and play) absolutely anywhere in your home! \n\n\nWhat is MIMO\n\nMIMO wireless refers to the use of multiple antennas at both ends of a radio link, and is emerging as an important technology to enhance wireless performance. MIMO has evolved (and is still evolving), since its early beginning in 1993, with contributions from hundreds of researchers around the world. Some aspects of MIMO have already entered wireless standards, and many more standards efforts are ongoing.\n\n The multiple antennas at each end of a MIMO link can be used in different modes such as transmit-receive diversity, beamforming, antenna subset selection and spatial multiplexing. Each of these modes further has several internal options. Which mode or option actually maximizes performance depends on the channel condition, SNR and QoS requirements, among other factors. For example spatial multiplexing can perform poorer than transmit-receive diversity under certain scenarios. Different aspects of MIMO will find their unique niches in the plethora of products now entering the market.\n\n\n\nSee more",
