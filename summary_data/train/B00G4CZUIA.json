I needed gloves that look attractive and will keep me warm when hopping from the car to the mall or for a walk outside on a 40\u00b0 day. I know some people have said these gloves aren't warm enough for those things. I think that depends on what you're accustomed to. They work perfectly for me. They look very nice. I bought a medium, and that pair was really too long and too big. I have long, thin fingers. The small fit perfectly. I will order another pair.",

Taking it from a 3 Star to a 1 Star. Initially I said the touchscreen feature works about 30%, I was guessing. I\u2019ve paid better attention and it works about 10% or less.

Air flows through them a little, I think to help them breathe but then it doesn\u2019t make them good to use on cold days.

I have trouble getting the device to recognize input from my thumb, though my index finger is reliable. Overall this product is a good reliable and durable glove that is good at keeping you warm, protecting you from the wind, and keeping you in touch with your devices.

      "text": "I bought these glove to replace my favorite (lost) Head gloves, which are no longer available. I never expected to love these new gloves so much! They're incredibly warm and cozy inside. The palms have a rubberized covering which facilitates driving or picking up things, and the finger tips allow me to use my smartphone. The more I wear them the more I appreciate how perfect they are. I also love the pink trim, but that's just me.",
