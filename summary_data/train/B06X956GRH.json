Still, they went together well and don't scratch the floor, and are sturdy as hell. My husbear and I are not small men, and they haven't made any alarming noises or buckled at all. This is on top of how gorgeous they are. Very Hannibal-esque, and in fact the husbear picked them based on another Fannibal reviewer (who has since disappeared?). They make our black kitchen look that much more gothic, like a modern Addams vibe. Love it.",

You can lean back in the chair...think of a bounce but not a full on rocking. You can also add a small flat cushion if that is required for a guest. Assembly was very easy and quick to put together. The vendors packaging was amazing and arrived as promised. Once again thanks to Amazon for offering such a great product!!!",
