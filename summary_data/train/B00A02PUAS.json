I was nervous about the 1 & 2 star reviews saying the ball deflates easily after 2 days. I've had this inflated over 11 days now with the kids using it daily and there's no loss of pressure, glow, or durability issues. It glows bright red and the kids all loved it ! they played for over 4 hours that night non stop. I definitely recommend this and the glow football by the same company.",

I got this as a gift for my son 6 months ago and the battery is just now beginning to dim. I got it to prolong playtime after school with daylight savings time cutting playtime short after school. Now he can play longer to get his exercise and burn off school stresses. The kids rush out after homework and join in. Even the teen aged boys down the street come down to kick the ball around. I am ordering a new battery for Summer! Great purchase-no second thoughts.",

It does light up very nicely and the girls love it. They got outdoor soccer nets for Christmas and I thought this ball would be great as they play late in the day. They can't wait to put it to use.",

The team practiced well past sun down to make the most of practice as the days grew shorter. Need glow pinnies for next season if someone makes them.

The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5-star review is that it's not truly a soccer ball. It's more like those rubbery volley balls I remember from highschool. So, it sort of grips to your shoe unlike a soccer ball, it's not slippery so it can trip you if you're trying to do tricks or roll your foot over the top of it. Other than that, it's great and seems very sturdy and capable of taking the solid impact of adult kicks.",

From reading the other reviews, I can see where some people might think it's hard, but it has to be to protect the light and battery pack inside. It feels like a tough rubber, but extremely kick-able as long as you're not unloading full blast on the ball. If you're ripping big shots one right after another, you might have sore feet. If you just play the game, and make awesome passes.....IN THE DARK!!!!!.....and take normal shots, then it's lots of fun, especially since you're playing AT NIGHT!!!!!!!
