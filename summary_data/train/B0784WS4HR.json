Product is not quality made, the only reason I'm giving this 1 star instead of zero is their customer service is very quick to respond and helpful. But good customer service doesn't absolve shoddy product design or manufacturing. Do not buy this unless you like a good looking, non-functional paperweight.",

Shocked myself a couple times and WOO might substitute that for my morning coffee. this\u2019ll get ya fired up both mentally/ physically/ and with literal flames. Would buy again but hopefully I won\u2019t need too",

No more burns/potential accidents. Love it!",
