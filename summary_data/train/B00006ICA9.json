If you're looking for that kind of security then this item is not for you, buy a safe instead.

When it arrived, the manufacturer's sleeve said \"Fire retardant to 750 F\" We told customer service, and they said the manufacturer would send us another. They did but it was also retardant to 750. We decided to keep it, and customer service generously offered a discount of 50%. We were very pleased with Amazon's reps, who were courteous and helpful. But the manufacturer needs to get its act together, and at the very least change the specs on the offering page.",
