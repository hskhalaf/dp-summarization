We ended up putting up one of those suction cup screens that he would rip off or would fall off if we ever rolled the windows down. This fixes all the annoyances of those other shades.",

They are quick to put up and take down, there is no fussing with folding it up because of the pleats, and they are small and light weight enough to move between cars without any fuss. These are made with light weight fabric stitched along the edges with magnets within the top boarder attach it to the edge of the metal car frame. There is also a magnet at the bottom of one side to prevent the curtain from getting sucked out as you close the door, this is a very well thought out and designed curtain!",

This shade fits perfectly, my little one loves the feeling of the breeze when you roll the window down, and the best part is no matter what he isn't squinting because the sun is beaming through his window. Definitely a good buy",

You can feel the difference in heat on your face when sitting with and without this shade. I was skeptical, but for the price it's pretty great. I currently have 2 of these and am happy with the purchases.",
