I wasted that much money on brand new Schweser books (printed of course) and their horrendous online course videos. Everyone has it drilled into them that Schweser is the standard, but as I look at the Analyst Notes website that she's talking about, I realize how stupid I was. These notes are better than Schweser, which is almost as much material as the CFA books themselves, just dumbed down. Oh well, lesson learned for when I hopefully start studying for L2.",
