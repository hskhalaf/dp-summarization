I kind of want to take a star away because the description says the weight capacity is 300 lbs., which is one of the main reasons why I picked them. When they arrived, the weight capacity says 250 lbs. That is a big difference! But they are very nice, good quality and an awesome price. Over all I'm still pretty pleased.",
