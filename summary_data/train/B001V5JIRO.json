I can\u2019t stress enough how poor quality this is. 2 things happened within 15 minutes of playing this thing. 1) reed got stuck (\u2018e\u2019 on right hand) 2) upon trying to loosen and tighten screw around thumb grip, the screw and mount cane completely out of the concertina!!! Also extremely hard to even get a grip on in the first place. The sound is OK, but not really even close to an intermediate concertina. Do not buy this! You\u2019re probably better off with a cheaper one.",

The bellows are a tad stiff, but after 3 hard days of pounding away at the thing it's getting easier to work with. The lower notes are not very responsive (par for the course, esp. for the money) and the 5th button on the left hand accidental row has a rattle on the push, but it'll do just fine for any beginner or somebody wanting to move from a smaller instrument to a 30-key on a budget. TL;DR: Works great for what it is: a starter concertina.",
