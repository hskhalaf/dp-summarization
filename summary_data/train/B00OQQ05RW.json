However, all the rest have dried out one by one over course of the last month, we just discovered two more this morning during school that have dried out. The caps seem to have changed, they don't fit on tightly like ones I've used in the past, and presumably contribute to the drying out.

Just make sure to keep the Caps snug and when you think you've either pushed in a chisel tip get a pair of needle-nose pliers to pull them out gently and if you think the ink is getting low just flip the marker upside down with cap on for about 2 days and you'll be fine. Meaning these are awesome markers and can last you a year depending on your usage",

At this rate, 2 packs will last me years! Many classroom supplies I like to purchase at Dollar tree to save $$, but not markers. The cheap dollar store markers fade out too quick. It's worth getting these expo markers, especially when on sale. Highly recommended",

The only negative: The red markers do not erase as well as the other colors. The reds leave a pink shadow on our metal whiteboards that are built into our cubicles.",

I waited about 30 days or so to use them so now it's too late to return them.",
