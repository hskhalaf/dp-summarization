But not worth the sacrifice in noise isolation due to the open porting. If I could do it all over again, I'd buy the 215s again, save $100, have the same audio quality (maybe even better bass response), and better noise isolation.",

Coming from the legendary Ultimate Ears Triplefi 10, UE 900s (both of which are triple drivers and above), the sensational Sennheiser HD 600 (the daddy of all headphones imo.), these are surprisingly excellent and true to the music. Anyone with a somewhat audiophile mentality who loves great instrument separation will instantly fall in love with these. Don't let the single drivers fool you. These have crisp highs and great punchy bass. I am already a fan after a week (using with my Asstell & Kern Jr. DAP.). So make sure your source is good or else you won't do justice to these).",

Takes a bit of effort to get them on - especially for my hands that are no longer young, let's say. Removing them also is enough of a pain that I find I'm reluctant to pop them out to have a conversation. The upside, though, is that they stay in my ears when I walk or get on/off transit during commute. Expensive but a very good product.",

Consequently, I am constantly moving them around to improve their clarity, bass, and expansion of treble, mid range, and bass. I have yet to achieve this, so the resulting sound is repressed and canny. The SE 315's also distort at higher volumes and lose overall sound quality. This sucks for me as I bought them primarily to use when I practice and prepare for a gig on my drums. You also can't change out the end pieces for improved ear fit without tearing them up.",
