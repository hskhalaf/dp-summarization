Otherwise they will be so eager to use it, start bumbling their way through it, doing experiments out of order because they don't have the ingredients, and they will just end up confused and disappointed.",

An adult is definitely needed for this set I\u2019d say for anyone under 14, but it was a great opportunity to connect and learn and work together.",

In addition, it calls for you to have on hand things that the average person would not have (mineral and distilled water, denatured alcohol (even after googling this I'm not sure what it is or where to buy it).

Once I had a chance to review the contents the rule became no solo experiments and I am now his mandatory lab partner. Very cool real lab type protocols to follow - great prep for science classes with lab & also teaches the importance of following directions (or your experiment will fail).",

      "text": "I say it's okay...because we're a pretty science minded family and really haven't used it much. Pulled it out a couple of times...just wasn't super interesting for my then 8 year old...nor my then 41 year old husband. Still...when I look at how much use most Christmas gifts get...this got its 3 uses...so not awful. My kid's now 10...so maybe I'll pull it out and see if it sparks any interest. Of course my husband is now 43...so probably no more sparking of interest there.",
