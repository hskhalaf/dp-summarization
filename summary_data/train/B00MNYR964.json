Its beginner-friendly construction and anti-odor properties also receive praise from the climbing community.\u00a0On the other hand, some feel dismayed with the shoe\u2019s traction on outdoor rock surfaces. All in all, the Butora Endeavor may be an amazing option because of its characteristics, especially for those who plan to use it indoors.",

      "text": "Very good beginner/gym shoes. I wear a loose-fitting 10.5 4E US in sneakers (asics) and sized up to 11 as per the manufacturer recommendation for a tight but comfortable fit. They're a little loose in the heel but that hasn't affected my climbing so far. Seriously, consider sizing up - a 10.5 or smaller would be pretty tight for me. At < $100 they're a great value as long as they don't suck, and they definitely don't. Haven't tried them on rock yet, but they seem precise and reasonably-but-not-super sensitive on plastic.",

I have a narrow foot and the biggest issue I was having was that most shoes are loose on the sides even when my toes are in pain. These are snug all the way around. My toes are curled, sides are tight, and they are comfortable. Initial climbs I had issues with how slick the bottoms were, but that lasted about 1 afternoon climbing. The next time it was super sticky and no issues at all.",

The originally had a slight curve to at least flat for longer routes. After a few session, they started to point upwards. This causes issues with smaller toe holds, slipping. Butora is a difficult company to work with. I won\u2019t be purchasing any of their products anymore.",

The shoes themselves are a slightly tighter fit than I expected. I wish I got a half-size larger than what I did. In addition, it's only been 2 months since I've started climbing in these and the front rubber is already being chipped away. I'm an indoors gym climber at the V4-ish level, so I'm not pulling any crazy moves. It surprises me to see how much the shoes have worn out after just two months.",

Lining made of eco-friendly hemp, synthetic fibre and natural leather, which fits perfectly, prevents rubbing and avoids bad smell. The tongue of the climbing shoe is split in two parts: the inner part, made of a highly breathable mesh fabric, and the outer part, made of Poron (R) and more stuffed, to absorb the pressure of Velcro straps. Thanks to the closure that is strengthened with three strips in order to improve the shoe fit, plus the 3D sole, ENDEAVOR will help you reach farther than you ever imagined. Available in wide shape.
