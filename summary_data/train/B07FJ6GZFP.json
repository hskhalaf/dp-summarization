The serrated finish on the griping portion of the pliers is very good and changes serration pattern at the point providing a sure grip when unhooking fish.

      "text": "This is a fantastic set of pliers. They are very ergonomic and lightweight. They seem very high quality. Everything is placed well on the pliers, especially the fishing line cutters. You could easily spend much more on a set of fishing pliers and not get as many features. I love the split ring tool. I also love that they have holes to hold you fishing hook to allow you to tighten your knots easier. I have not had a chance to see how rust resistant they are yet, but will update the review over the next year. Overall for the price, I am very impressed with the quality and amount of features you receive with these fishing pliers.",

These pliers are for so much more than hook retrieval: they have a split ring \"tooth\" to prevent one from breaking off their nails on opening split rings, another little tooth so you quit crimping your split shot with those beautiful teeth, and a variety of hook holes to help you tighten your knots. And they're kinda pretty. Thanks KastKing\u2014I'm your new Queen.",

To my surprise the grip is a hard rubber meaning that in wet, cold conditions these pliers work great. Who has time to clean your hands when you need pliers in a hurry. I have a young boy I am teaching to fish so fishing from the bank is a problem. My hands are usually covered in slime, holding the fish, avoiding tree branches, layered in live bait guts...you get the point. These are one hand operational and tethered to your body however needed. Spring loaded, split ring tip and always attached. Most important accessory when fishing!",

Ok, that's it for the negative. Everything else is great. I bought these pliers because of the line cutter. It looks like it's in a weird spot, but it's SO much easier to position and use than the traditional back-of-the-jaws location. I didn't think the split-ring beak was going to be that useful... that lasted until I had to change the treble hook on a dive bait. I'm sold on the idea now. As for the rest of the features, it's everything I would expect from a quality set of pliers.",

I got orange to match my bag color and the lanyard connects right to the bag. I've already used them successfully ocean fishing, they replace a cheaper pair of pliers that I had previously purchased. Really, all the KastKing gear is top notch from what I can tell (and I've purchased the Lunker Bag and the 3600 and 3700 boxes as well as braided line).",

      "Corrosion Resistant Stainless Steel \u2013 The KastKing Cutthroat pliers are made from corrosion resistant 420 stainless steel and coated with a tough Teflon coating for added protection. Our stainless steel pliers are 46% harder than aluminum pliers and nearly 3 times the bending strength of aluminum pliers. Designed for long term performance, these pliers are ideal for both freshwater and harsh saltwater environments.",
      "Tungsten Carbide Cutters \u2013 Super hard tungsten carbide cutters slice though mono, fluorocarbon, or braid with ease. Side mounted anvil cutters for easy access, these cutters allow you to cut your tag end as close to the knot as you desire without any obstructions and the raised surface behind the blade ensures your line will always be in the cutting zone.",
      "Multi-Function Jaws \u2013 Grab and remove any fish hook with the serrated jaws or take advantage of the crimping slots to secure a split shot weight or build a steel leader. To cinch down a knot quickly and safely, insert your hook into one of the holes in the jaws and pull on your hook to create a tight knot. Available in both a straight nose and a Split ring nose design.",
      "Rubber Handle \u2013 The ergonomic textured rubber handle provides comfort and control. A thin grip profile and the spring loaded jaws allow for easy one hand use without worrying about the pliers slipping out of your hands.",
      "Sheath/Lanyard Included \u2013 Includes a custom molded sheath with belt clip to ensure your investment is protected from normal wear and tear. Clip on to your belt or the waistband of your shorts, to make sure you have quick access when a fish is on the line and the coiled lanyard will ensure your pliers don\u2019t fall overboard!"
