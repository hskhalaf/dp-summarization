      "text": "Really nice unit. Replaced another fold out unit and this one really sounds a lot nicer. It looks sleek and it runs smooth without any issues. The software is good, but as with all these systems there is only a minimal amount of customization. The settings are quite extensive which is great to have.",

However, the installation recommendations should advise anyone installing on an early 2000's Suburban, Tahoe or Silverado that the gear shifter will be in the way when the shifter is in park. Beware. Also it is a touchscreen on a flip up unit, so be gentle when using the touchscreen features.",

    "title": "Pioneer AVH-210EX Double DIN Bluetooth in-Dash DVD/CD/AM/FM/Digital Media Car Stereo Receiver with Xtremevision HD Backup Camera",
    "description": "The receiver is an entry-level in-dash multimedia a/v receiver designed to improve in-vehicle entertainment and connectivity with your smartphone. Enjoy features such as built-in Bluetooth AVRCP 1.6 for hands-free calling and audio streaming. Audio/video playback from USB and DVD sources and safety features such as back up camera ready and much more. Stay safe and obey local hands-free laws with built-in Bluetooth (HFP). Easily pair a Bluetooth enabled phone to the receiver without having to go through complicated settings. When a registered Bluetooth device is near the receiver, the auto connection function automatically pairs the two units. From wireless audio streaming (A2DP), hands-free calling, and simple pairing, to audio control and artist, album, and song search (AVRCP 1.6 profile*), Bluetooth wireless technology has made life in the vehicle much more convenient. Users of Android devices running operating system 4.0 or later can connect and listen to music stored on their device to the receiver without the need for an app. The process is made possible using Media Transfer Protocol (MTP). MTP allows the receiver to recognize the Android smartphone as a music storage device. Users can now access music via USB stored on an Android device and operate basic operations like FF, REW, Play, Pause, Random Play, and Repeat. Metadata information such as track, artist, and album name can be displayed. Pioneer's receiver is ready to roll with direct connectivity to your iPod or iPhone for music. Song, artist, time and album information are beautifully displayed on the 6.2\" touchscreen. A USB connection provides direct digital signal transfer from the device for clean, clear sound while providing 1 amp of current to keep your iPod/iPhone charged. Back-up camera input enables you to add a reverse (rear facing) camera that can assist with rear visibility, towing, or parking. Select from among five colors (blue/red/amber/green/violet) for the display and 112 different colors to match unit illumination to your vehicle's interior lighting. Also choose from several background images to suit your mood.",
