Now I can't hardly get them to come out of their room as they are too enamored with the tunnel. Great toy for my little meows!",

My cat isn't that big but after weeks of it sitting here, she still won't venture more than her upper half into it. It's really more appropriate for kittens than full grown cats.",

Two of the kittens have emerged to play with other toys, but Mike the cat never goes far from the tunnel and has brought his other toys (little furry mice) inside. Product was easy to assemble (took one second), cats love it, it's of excellent quality. Cats are so finicky about food and toys, you never know what they'll like, but they loved this.",

It is more expensive but definitely worth the price if you don't want something super cheap looking. The inside has a crinkle to it, which yes adds some noise (though I think they all have this anyway), but can add to the play time because they react to the noise.",

(scroll down for a better picture of what it looks like) My cat loves it when we toss a small toy into the hole then she does the wiggle,wiggle,wiggle before darting in to retrieve it.

She was hesitant at first but after putting a little catnip inside, this thing is like her new home. It\u2019s nice that you can buy multiple and put them together as well! We might have to do that in the future. It is quite loud when it\u2019s moved around. It sounds like plastic grocery bags kind of, so at night it gets a little annoying. But otherwise this thing is great! 5 stars all around!",

So I can't fully connect the tunnels together which was my favorite feature of this product. I have emailed the company to let them know but haven't heard back from them.

Both of my cats were able to fit through (A low crawl). The diameter, in my opinion makes it a little difficult for a cat to stand and walk through. The construction seems sturdy enough and I had no problems attaching the tunnels to the hideaway boxes. Thank you.",
