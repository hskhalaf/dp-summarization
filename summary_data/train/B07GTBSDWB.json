I haven't stayed in a long time and when I put the skates on didn't realize the lack of balance was due to wrong fit. These skates are really fast and you are relatively high in them being 100mm tri-skates. My number 1 advice is NOT TO SIZE UP!!! The soft boot doesn't give you too much support if you make a sizing mistake like I did. If you're new or coming back to skating after years of not skating I wouldn't recommend these skates... more for intermediate and advanced.",

I've skated about 35 miles since I got them in the mail on Tuesday, and yah, that's my biggest beef with them. Not too confident in the back break either.",
