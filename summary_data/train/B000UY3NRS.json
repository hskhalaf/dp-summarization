I don't use the built-in digicam memory card features, but they don't interfere. Since HP consumables are pricey, I've used Costco's (thinner) 4x6 photo paper with no problems so far. For the money, I'm astonished with this unit so I don't mind giving HP a few extra bucks for the ink. The included software has more bells & whistles than I would prefer, but it gets the job done. All in all, I'm pleased.",

It does indeed do duplex-printing and is rather fast. It is designed for small ink cartridges, so it runs out of ink relatively fast; however, you can purchase extra large ink cartridges for this printer, which makes it an exceptional buy. Supposedly, it has many other features as well (printing on CD, label making, etc.), but I do use those functions.",
