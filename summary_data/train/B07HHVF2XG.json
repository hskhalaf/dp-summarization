      "text": "If you can find this for $50 or less, it is absolutely worth it. While there are some games that are basically unplayable because of the emulation, like Tekken 3 running at 50hz, all the single player games are great to revisit at that price. Controllers are extremely well made, the console itself looks great, and it has a developing homebrew scene adding even more value to this device. An excellent purchase for Sony fans or people looking for a fun homebrew project to tinker with.",

Some drawbacks, the controllers not having vibration, and unable to use other third party controllers to combat that, and while having a USB stick plugged in, can't be on two player games Overall very impressed and a good buy at 50 bucks",

It fits perfectly on a small shelf. And im getting the 65gb drive to get 101 games installed. I didnt know i could do that with this station. But i am so excited and i am not disappointed at all.",

Most of these games are unplayable because the either a poor emulator or inadequate hardware. So far only Final Fantasy VII is playable and still rather poorly. Now I see the price dropped from $100 to $60 which is about the correct market value of this system.",
