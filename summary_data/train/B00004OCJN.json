Unfortunately, I didn't realize that the cover the cutter came in can be used for storing the pizza cutter. The cover is a protector of the blade. I kind of ripped off the packaging and had to tape it all back together to use the cover as a protector. So keep that in mind if you choose to buy this pizza cutter!.",

It had a plastic edge that after many years of use--it became dull so I needed a new one and this Oxo one was very highly rated so I thought I would give it a try. I have many Oxo products that I am very happy with--this just isn't one of them.",

In terms of performance, the blade is sharp, and it is bigger. The blade is made from stainless steel attached to a non-stainless steel neck/holder (this being just polished or chromed steel). I would have preferred the neck to also be made of SS. Handle is comfortable but not ergonomic. Having a blade guard would be another nice add-on. I host pizza parties where we serve between 4 and 12 full size 16\" pizzas .",

No regrets, my only annoyance is cleaning it, since its a wheel, I usually hold the wheel and clean it with a rag or wipe, since the wheel will get dirty from the Pizza with Cheese and tomatoe sauce, but its great for what it is",

It rolls easily and with the sharpness of the wheels blade it'll cut through just about any kind of pizza you want it to. The grip (like on all of the OXO Good Grip items) is excellent, and it is made to last. High quality construction, great blade, and grate grip, and great price. What else can I say. I would recommend it to anyone.",

    "title": "OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel 4-Inch Pizza Wheel and Cutter",
    "description": "Slice through mushrooms, pepperoni, and extra cheese with ease with the OXO Good Grips 4-inch Pizza Wheel. Its sharp stainless steel blade cuts through crunchy crust, and is large enough to accommodate Sicilian and thick-crust pizzas. A die cast zinc thumb guard keeps fingers away from the blade for added safety, and the large, soft handle absorbs pressure.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nYou can rely on this wheel to make a complete cut through your pizza pie on the first run, thanks to its beveled stainless-steel blade. It works equally well with other pie doughs, and you can use without fear of cutting yourself, thanks to its built-in thumb guard.\n\nThe Good Grips line features durable, nonslip, flexible handles on every product. Ergonomically designed to fit the palm comfortably, the pressure-absorbing, processed rubber handle puts less tension on the hands, while still providing an outstanding grip. Made from the same material as dishwasher gaskets, the handles are slip-proof, wet or dry, as well as dishwasher-safe. Good Grips products are moderately priced and have won the Tylenol/Arthritis Foundation Design Award. --Laurie Notaro",
