      "text": "All of our residential cookwares failed the \"induction ready\" test. Not a single cookware in our house was induction ready when tried on the new NuWave Gold that I ordered and received from Amazon last week. So I decided to order and try this \"Calphalon Contemporary Stainless Steel 8-Quart..\". This is amazing,not just induction ready but seems built for it purposely (water boiled in no time). It is also well built, sturdy, right sized, low height (for stew, etc, just like we wanted it). I am surprised by the quality of the material, a bit thick and heavy. but responsive to induction cooktop that we own (NuWave 30242 PIC Gold).",
