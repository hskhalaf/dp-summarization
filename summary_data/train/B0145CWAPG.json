    "description": "Bring home your PURRfect friend with Zoomer Kitty Bella. She's the sweetest interactive pet who loves to play, pounce and purr just like a real Kitty. Using True Vision Technology, she actually sees and follows your movements. As you play, her eyes will change color letting you know exactly how she's feeling. Bella has touch sensors in her head, ears and cheeks and loves when you pet her. She'll nuzzle in and even respond with affectionate purrs that you can actually feel. After you've discovered Kitty's softer side in Cuddle Mode, get ready for some fun in Play Mode. Bella sings, dances and performs secret tricks. You can tease her with her interactive Kitty Toy and watch her go cat-nip crazy. But don't forget to give her attention or Kitty will wander off and go on her own adventures. Zoomer Kitty is curious, cuddly and loves to perform tricks. Adopt the Kitty that's full of life with Zoomer Kitty Bella, your PURRfect friend.",
