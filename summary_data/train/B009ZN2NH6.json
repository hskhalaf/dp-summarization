I was increadibly pleased to see the cpu idling at 70\u00b0c. Given that the stock cooler had been idling at 45\u00b0c just a few hours earlier, I decided to contact corsair. After about a half hour of trouble shooting, the rep said it probably has a bad pump. Oh boy. So I got to take the whole thing back apart and re-install everything. I just went to Fry's and bought a Noctua fan. Much better. Idle temp is now at 35\u00b0c, full load hits 45.",

We all know stock coolers are crap, and this gives me peace at mind when my CPU is under heavy load. I've never had it go above 70 degrees C with this cooler installed, even with stress tests. As for volume, I put it on the top vents of my case. It's not completely silent, but it's certainly quieter than air cooled systems because it doesn't have to work as hard. My only complaint is that the Corsair Link software is kinda buggy and forgets the LED color I choose upon restart. This is annoying with a color-coded build.",

I got good advice and instructions on the numerous YouTube instructional videos. I had also purchased the Thermaltake CLW0216 and NZXT X312 Cooling Systems. The NZXT didn't fit the CPU properly and the Thermoltake was just too difficult to install. This Corsair was REALLY easy to install. The power connections are simple and straightforward.

I'm sure its there, but with my roommates' pc's and the noise from all the games going I cannot hear this unit at all. Didn't give it 5 stars because I reserve the 5th for durability and I've only had the product for 3 weeks",

Must buy, only make sure your case allows for top mounded 2x120mm fans as it is a sealed system that stays in the case. The software that actually controls the unit's speeds and LED color needs some work but it by no means hinders the operation of the cooler.",

      "title": "Awesome and Reliable Liquid Cooler",
      "text": "After 1 year: Still love it! The liquid cooling is excellent and it keeps my i5-4690k at 25 to 27 degrees idle and 47 to 51 degrees during intensive use. I replaced the fans with the quiet edition corsair fans and it works perfectly as my computer is completely silent when it is idle, browsing the net, watching shows etc.. The white light emitted from the LED indicator looks very clean and is often the first thing an average person compliments when they see my computer. My gamer friends obviously notice the glowing GTX on my 780 first but it goes to show how nice the liquid cooling looks inside my Obsidian 350D",
