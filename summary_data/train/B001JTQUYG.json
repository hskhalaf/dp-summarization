      "title": "Works great for Apple TV (2nd Gen) and PS3",
      "text": "Inexpensive HDMI switch works well to automatically share single HDMI port on TV between Sony PS3 and Apple TV (2nd gen). Note that Apple TV keeps HDMI port active even while in standby. So to support auto-switching make sure ATV is assigned to higher numbered port (lower priority) on HDMI switch. Plugging PS3 into port 1 and Apple TV into port 2 will support auto switching, since PS3 (port 1) overrides ATV (port 2) when the PS3 powers up, and relinquishes control back to the ATV when PS3 powers down.",

It's small enough where I can put it out of sight behind the TV. I like the fact that there's no additional power supply needed as I didn't have another outlet available. There is a blue light that comes from the unit which I found distracting with the lights out, so I just covered it up with a small piece of black electrical tape.",

My TV unfortunately only has two HDMI inputs, so I needed a switch to support my new Kindle Fire TV. Since the Fire TV, like an Apple TV, is always \"active\" on the HDMI port, you just need to plug those kind of devices in a higher numbered port than something like an Xbox that comes and goes. This lets the auto-switching work without needing the remote or the selector button on the box. Anyway - it's inexpensive, it works exactly as I needed it to work, super pleased with my purchase.",

The inputs are on the opposite side from the output, so you can't set this on top of a DVD player, table top, etc and manually switch inputs using the button on the box itself. You must hide the box and the cables that are sticking out of both sides behind something. At least the IR extension is quite long and can be used to switch the inputs effectively.",

After reading the reviews, I quickly ordered it for him. After arriving, he installed it himself (he's only 10 yrs old) and, viola! the switch automatically picks up the signal and turns on either the Xbox,PS3 or the TV.

      "text": "Great unit. Automatically switches inputs from cable box to dvd player, just turn on dvd player and it automatically selects this as input. Turn off the dvd player and it goes back to cable box. No more manually removing and installing cables on back of tv. I was always afraid of damaging the ports on back of the tv. I do not use the included remote, not needed. My wife is very happy as she can switch between units without waiting for me to switch the cables manually. The unit is capable of 3 inputs to 1 tv. I use the cable box, dvd/vcr player and laptop as inputs and it works GREAT and the price is EXCELLENT?",

You can manually switch the source if you have a component that does not power off each time you want to switch the source to the tv. Great product, at a great price. Recommended!",

It goes through batteries like crazy -- within 1 week of installing a brand-new battery, the battery will be dead and the remote will stop working. This is with minimal use. Replacing the battery restores it to functionality for another week. This is a deal-breaker, and unfortunately, I'm past the return period for this switcher.

I switched out my DVD player to a Sony (DVP-SR510H) that does turn off its output, so now I can switch between it ant the Roku by turning the DVD player on and off.",

The fact that it came with the remote was a big seller since it meant not having to get off my lazy rear end when switching between sources. After setup, I found that the switch will automatically select the source it receives a signal from - which means you really don't even need the remote. The remote is useful, however, if you want to switch between sources when more than one of the signals is coming through.",
