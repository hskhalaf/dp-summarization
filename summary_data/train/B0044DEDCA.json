I downloaded and installed the newest Sound Blaster Windows 10 driver package for this unit and it has worked perfectly. Ended my audio problems completely, I now have 5.1 audio on all programs, from Plex Media Player to amazon.com video via Firefox and Chrome. Whole install took about 10 minutes and that included tweaking audio settings in my programs. Completely problem free installation and best $65.00 I have spent on audio for my Media Center computer ever.",

The thump/crack happens twice on every boot of Windows. I've had to subtract 2 stars for the startling noises it make on every boot. The Sound Blaster otherwise works well.",

Passing audio from the TV to the receiver just gave me stereo over HDMI (that's a hardware issue it seems). I have 7.1 and I'm playing in stereo... that just won't do. Hooked up this bad boy with a fiber cable and bam, 5.1/7.1 games and movies. Where did that shot come from? Behind me! Sweet. Being USB-powered, there's only 1 cable to deal with when connecting/disconnecting it. It's light enough that you can easily attach it to a laptop with some velcro/hook-n-loop tape. Grab the latest drivers from their site; the ones on the CD are out of date.",

      "text": "It works out of the box plugged into a windows 8.1 computer which is nice, but I couldn't do any channel testing on the individual speakers as if they were plugged into an internal card. It came with a driver/app disc, but I have no cd slot, so I attempted to download the software from Creative's site. Creative must be on a 56k connection because it took almost 2 hours to download a couple hundred megabytes. That was painful, and then when I installed the drivers the usb audio card kept connecting and disconnecting quickly. It was unusable until I uninstalled the drivers.",

I never realized just how bad the sound card was in my laptop. Sound recordings from YouTube and other sources just sparkle. Easy to install (about 10min) and I was up and running.
