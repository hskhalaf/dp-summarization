Or not enough glue in the first place? Anyway, some super-glue and it was new again. The performance of this rod is very good! When setting the hook, I tend to snatch quite hard and swift. Caught many fish so far and the rod is holding up fine. It is not stiff at all, yet not too limber. No issues. 5 star easily.",

I think they updated the fuji o-rings because there's a little tag that said so (which I didn't get on my first rod). All in all, it works really well and it's super smooth. The first rod that I got was a baitcasting rod, but decided to go for perigee for my spinning setup. Real fun to use and the box that came with it is top notch. Really protects the rod with the included packaging foam and all. Really pleased",

It has features and qualities of rods that cost twice as much if they had other brand names on them. My only concern was that the rod is a two-piece rod, but I watched the KastKing Youtube video where they caught several big smallies with this exact rod and that put my mind at ease. If you want a good quality rod that won't bust your budget or have your wife mad at you for spending too much on fishing, this is a good rod to buy.",

The only thing that I can complain about is the split grip. I wish Kastking gave me the option to get this rod in a full grip. There is nothing wrong with the split grip, I am sure plenty of folks love it, but I prefer a full grip.",
