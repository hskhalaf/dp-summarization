She has tried and absolutely loves them ALL... as does her best dog buddy. I have just ordered more and expect to be a steady customer going forward as I am formally adopting my foster pup tomorrow.

For $5 more I usually buy a 12 pack of bully sticks from costco that are the length of my forearm. My dog is a heavy chewer and I think each of these pieces lasted him maybe 5 minutes.
