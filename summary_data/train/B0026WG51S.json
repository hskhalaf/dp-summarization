Bette than any bungee cord system. It comes with plastic/rubber bumpers, and also a dtair mechanism that look like fan belts made into tank treads. It's small lip makes it inadequate for small loads and it's really for large, heavy, and rigid items like fridges, stoves,water heaters, cast iron bath tubs. You want this for stairs!!!",

This thing is big, and the typical mail carrier is unable to deliver this into their vehicles. We had to go to the post office to pick this up. It would be more appropriate to ship with a parcel carrier, like UPS. But past that, this dolly is great and worth every penny! Buy it and save your back; and that of your friends and family, for your next move, or install of a large appliance. You won't regret it.",

These features allow one person to handle many appliances single handedly, although for large refrigerators or moving up and down stairs two people would be the best arrangement. Only caveats are the retaining strap has a steel buckle which could mar surfaces if not careful. And the wheels are a hard plastic type material. A softer dense wheel, or rubber tires would seem to make this roll better over concrete surfaces, but otherwise this dolly met all our expectaions.",
