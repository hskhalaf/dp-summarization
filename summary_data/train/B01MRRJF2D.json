Does leave some water spots as most steamers do. But as the manual says just wait a few moments and then continue use which worked for me. READ THE USER MANUAL!!!

      "text": "when it works it works fine. ample steam and working time. only issue and its a significant issue is the power button doesn't always work and I'm not sure why it is intermittent but obviously if it doesn't power up its just a paper weight. fortunately sitting in a hotel room affords a lot of idle time and I just kept pushing the button and eventually it would work. still considering sending it back for a refund not an exchange.",

The unit gets quite hot but there is no steam, even after about 4 minutes of holding the button down and listening to the clicking. I was pleased to find this model because of the automatic shutoff feature. Now I'm past the return window so I'm irritated.",
