Silent operation is not what I bought it for, and it's not on that long, anyway. It is absolutely superb as a grain mill and for the money, it simply cannot be beat!

When I learned I am gluten-intolerant, I decided to get a new mill and start fresh. The K-tec mill is now labeled \"Blend-tec\" and I was disappointed with its functioning. It seemed much noisier than my old mill, took MUCH longer to grind rice, and seemed to heat up more. Even though the bowl was firmly attached, flour blew out over the counter and floor. Maybe there was just a blockage of some sort; the cup that was supposed to catch extra flour remained empty. Hopefully this was just a defective machine; I plan to return it.",
