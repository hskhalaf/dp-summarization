The sliding focus ring doesn't work great for video, seems to be a delay in the electronic focusing mechanism. Overall I love this lens and haven't found any better 12mm on mft. Have tried a manual exposure 12mm (slr magic), but wasn't quit happy with the sharpness or the flaring, but it's the only lens that comes close to the Oly.",

Be aware that there is some minor vignetting (darkening of corners) when used wide open at F2.0. This is not uncommon in a lot of lenses. Close down your aperture a bit to get rid of this. I usually try and shoot around F6.3 to reach my own personal sweet spot for this lens. I rarely need/desire the shallow depth of field you get at F2.0.",
