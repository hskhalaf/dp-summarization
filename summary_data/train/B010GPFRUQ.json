What I did to hang mine safely without causing damage to the walls: I purchased 12\"x12\" Medium Weight Chipboard sheets and used 3M spray adhesive to stick the foam to the board. Then, I used 1 4lb rated velcro command strip (per each panel) and put it on the wall. It's holding fairly well, and because it's a velcro command strip, you can make slight adjustments as needed.",

      "text": "I purchased this foam exclusively for aesthetics in my office. The foam is decent quality for the price. However, some foam pieces do have larger holes and imperfections from manufacturing and also the tips of the blue foam have a greenish tinge to them (possibly from heat or the manufacturing process). I haven\u2019t tested the acoustic capabilities of the foam, but for my purposes, the sound reduction is negligible. Overall a decent product to add some color to a room!",

The biggest difference in my office has been getting a carpet and a couch. I read that if you can blow air through a fabric/substance, it probably won't block sound very well. Not sure that's a good measurement, but these don't really pass that test! These are just cheap foam, definitely not designed for acoustic dampening in my opinion.",

It does look nice. I can't fairly rate the sound absorption as I am using other soundproofing in conjunction with this order.",

Needless to say, sound absorption became a priority for me as I tried to adjust to this prison-like living space. I purchased around 24 squares total of this foam for my small bedroom and found that some minor noises like opening drawers and footsteps escaped less from the room than before. However, I would strongly suggest purchasing enough to cover every surface if moderate sound reduction is your goal. The foam is very soft, lightweight, and somewhat dense. It is easy to stick on my concrete walls with double sided mounting tape.",
