I'm going to keep up with it (some of the exercises I'm so not ready for yet! ) because I think it will help my sciatica and I really think it's going to be preventative medicine as I get older.",

I only gave it 3 stars because I feel like it DOES try to enforce you to hold those shoulders back, but there is other elements that goes into posture that obviously this does not affect.

This one was comparable to some others with twice the price tag, so I was concerned the quality may be a little below par. However, I could not be more wrong as the quality is great. Very sturdy, and provides more support than anticipated actually. Comfortable too. The extra padding included really helps. Also a helpful hint...DO NOT fall asleep while wearing this. I did accidentally, and woke with up to both of my arms being completly numb lol. I don't think it did any damage, but it was pretty scary waking up like that.",

Instead ofBeing heavy duty and not allowing your muscles to learn the right position it helps your muscles with muscle memory and helps them learn the correct posture. Also the manufacturers keep in contact to ask how it is working for the individual and ask if there\u2019s anything they could do to make things better. Just of them keeping in touch and making sure I was satisfied was an amazing thing. They even offered to send me a different size if the one I ordered was too big or small.",

      "text": "I have chronic shoulder / neck pain from poor posture, plus lower back pain from piriformis syndrome. I have been to physical therapy and it was moderately well controlled. That is until I'm stuck working at home! This brace provides critical core support so that shoulders can be aligned as they should be. It also comes with a great little booklet. It will take a few days for your back to adjust. I was sore for a day or two, but that's because my muscles were engaged in a different way. I find it works best right on the skin, but it's also good over an undershirt.",

I did cut the back portion off from the belt and now enjoy the belt quite a bit. Just get a good waist back support belt.",
