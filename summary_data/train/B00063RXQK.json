I wasn't thrilled about buying, maintaining, and storing multiple cast iron pans (12\", 14\", 16\" skillets and/or various Dutch pots), so this wok is the catch all for anything that doesn't fit in the 10.25\" skillet, and it works as awesome as the lodge cast iron skillet.

Both features allow quick heating especially if you want to try Chinese style of cooking. It\u2019s spacious so I\u2019ll never have to worry about stirring out ingredients.

The benefits of cast iron include being able to cook at medium-high stove top settings rather than high -- energy saving and better control of the cooking. The Lodge seasoning meant non-stick cooking from the start. The wok is easy to clean and maintain, The glass cover fits perfectly.

      "text": "Bought this wok for my husband as he loves to do stir fries. Every other wok he has ever used ends up warped from the high heat, food sticks and hard to clean. This wok takes the high heat and as long as you follow directions on taking care of cast iron and season after each use it just gets better every time you use it. I think this wok will outlast both of us and will be passed down thru the family. Because it is cast iron it is heavy and I would recommend buying the Lodge handgrips to go with it as the handles do get hot.",

I've also used it for a variety of curries and even some deep fat frying. Pretty easy to clean, just heat and use some hot water. Just season with a little oil each time it's used once it's been clean, and it's pretty non-stick unless you are using sweet sauces or maybe shrimp. Only downside is it's definitely a little heavy -- i've cracked a sink with a heavy wok in the past so be careful. Overall, highly recommended, get's used at least once or twice a week for us.",

The rust doesn't ruin it and can be cleaned, but it can also be prevented by properly cleaning, drying and seasoning it with oil. I bought a chain mail scrubber to clean the wok. Never clean it with soap. With proper care this wok will last a lifetime.",
