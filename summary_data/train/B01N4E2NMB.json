It will act like it wants to play disks but constantly skips or stops all together when the disk has nothing wrong with it! Super annoying, I\u2019ve had this for less than 3 months and already had to buy a new one. Don\u2019t waste your money.",

I saw another review about the remote control being small. Yes it is, but you figure it out and actually being small is nice since it weighs little and is not a big clumsy unit.",

The one thing i do find odd is the timer on the front of the unit. It only goes up to 60 mins and then starts counting up from zero again. Whats up with that???

The buttons are so small and the writing is clear so I literally have to use a flashlight to read it. Im 30!!!!!!!

Using a HDMI cable for the connection to the TV, I found the setup to be easy using the instructions found in the user manual. As others have said, I found the remote buttons to be very small. This is why I gave it 4 stars. I tested the player for picture and sound quality and found both were very good. Because of this, I would recommend this player as a good buy.",
