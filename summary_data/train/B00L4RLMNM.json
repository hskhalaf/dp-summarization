When I contacted Frigidaire, they provided me with a different warranty that specified a 1-year rather than a 2-year warranty. Frigidaire tried to pass this off as my warranty, but I found my original warranty. I explained all this in subsequent phone calls, but the outcome is that Frigidaire is not going to honor my 2-year warranty which I got when I bought my unit. I will never buy another Frigidaire product. Additionally, I paid nearly $700.00 for an appliance that only worked 18 months, and Frigidaire thinks that is just fine.",
