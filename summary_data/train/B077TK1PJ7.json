They run a little small. Originally when I ordered them my son, who is 9, was using a 5.5 size but that was too tight. I ordered a 6, which didn't give him much room to be honest. And at the time they did not offer half sizes so they are fitting a little snug now. Wish I could order him another pair but the next available size is 11!",

This was her first pair of Puma cleats. Before she only wore Nike Tiempo. From now on I'm saving the $10 or so delta in price and will buy these Puma's again. Nice padding. Strong foot liner. Great for narrow feet.",
