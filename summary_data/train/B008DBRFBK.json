The other issue is that the suction is awful leaving the cleaned surface fairly wet.

Given that the rest of the machine will easily last far longer than that, and the hose isn't easily replaceable (my research says you have to buy a part for a different machine and work it a little), this is a frankly inexcusable design flaw for a machine that costs this much from such a major manufacturer.",

The only thing it seems to do well is spraying the cleaning solution onto the carpet and making a LOT of noise. Vacuum removes very little cleaning solution. Requires scrubbing with the included suction head and single row of bristles. Could have done the same thing with a stiff bristle brush and a bucket of soapy water. Had to hang the rug outside in the sun to fully dry. Will be returning product.",

Also, recommend suctioning out water thoroughly from light colored upholstery/fabrics to avoid water stains. Finally, if you start to lose suction strength, empty out the dirty water.

After you tape it up to seal it, the hose will break again where your tape ends. This is a huge inconvenience and design flaw, as there is no way to just replace the hose. Eventually your hose will just be 5 ft. of duct tape, and will never wrap up to be put away properly again. I guess you could say this vacuum sucks.",

First and foremost, this unit needs a built in heater. Yes, you put hot water in, but after working a few stains the water cools down and loses its cleaning effectiveness. Secondly, the unit needs a longer hose. If you have a full flight of 12 or 13 stairs you will need to place the unit on one of the stairs, which is a bit challenging. Finally, the unit needs a rinse only feature. The unit is a great purchase for the money and I have not run into a stain it could not handle.",

I hadn't gotten a chance to use it for that yet so I did a test run on my poor sofa and this thing is AMAZING. Setting it up was super easy and fast and it cleaned my cushion sooo good! I obviously need to do a 2nd run but that's my fault because I wasn't doing it in a fully lit room and didn't see the spots I missed. I can't wait to tackle my whole sofa this weekend and then my car! :D",

Top product, and super useful. Cheaper to buy this than to get the car detailed once.",
