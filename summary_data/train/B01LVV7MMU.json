I used to be afraid when frying. always approaching the pan from the side or even doing the dip and run LOL!, but now I can cook and not worry about the excess splatter hitting me on my arms, chest or stomach. I did not realize how badly I needed this until I actually used it. I am going to buy these as stocking stuffers for some of my family this Christmas.",

Just wipe the outside with a soapy sponge then flip it inside out and wipe again. Just watch out when you open the package. It comes folded in a clear plastic cone thing. I ended up cutting 2/3s through the thing before I realized that it was also used to store the Frywall. Highly recommended.",
