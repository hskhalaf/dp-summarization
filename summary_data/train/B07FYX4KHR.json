This seems to not be the case with craft packets. But I trust this company and will be buying more from them. I already have more kits from this brand in my lists and can\u2019t wait to buy more. Thank you for your great quality, great packaging, and keeping on your promise to deliver what is in your kit as advertised. It means everything!!! Oh and the price point seems just about right in comparison to other projects available at this time.",

      "text": "As other reviewers have mentioned, this kit is completely ridiculous. The holes are tiny and the thread shreds, making it basically impossible for anyone, even an adult, to complete the jewelry according to the instructions. The holes in the beads and flowers are almost too small to thread one day but many of the items require threading through the hole once and then back again. We tried using tweezers and needles with no success. I have a very disappointed 6 year old.",
