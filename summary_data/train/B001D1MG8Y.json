The only thing I didn't like was that it doesn't have a handle or shoulder strap. Also, there is only space for 4 games while many other cases have room for at least 6+. However, I still recommend it. I will use this case for taking the DS out of the house and the G-Pack organizer for home use.",

The only problem I have is charging the NDS while playing, the cases' lid seems to almost bend the charger port when it's opened. Also removing the GBA/Slot 2 cover is kind of hard to do while in the case, but once it's removed the GBA games fit just fine through the port. Other than those to teeny problems this case is really neat, I like the customization options. Although I would have liked a .PDF of the template, the plastic templates work but are not the easiest things to work with. Overall I really like this case.",

We solved this issue by letting our son have at it with permanent markers to make his own design case. Problem solved.",
