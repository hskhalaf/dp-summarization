      "text": "Seems to be decent construction, but a little more difficult to use than other brands of this device. Specifically,the spike which sticks into the cork does not start threading until you have jammed it in pretty far, which can lead to just tearing up the top of the cork rather than screwing into it. In order to avoid this, take care to apply SIGNIFICANT downward force while turning the handle, at least until the screw has a good hold. The stopper is a nice addition, and it functions well.",
