I don't have much of a green thumb, but these herbs seem to be happy and are thriving! The instructions were easy to follow and the set up was a lot of fun for me and my kids. It includes everything you need to grow your own herb garden.",

My only complaint is they want you to place the watered pots in their paper/cardboard holder that looks like wood, but if we did they would leak all over the table or whatever they were on. We have them on a towel instead.",

You add a little bit of water and instantly the pot is filled with soil. I want to just buy those packets so I can plant other seeds myself.",
