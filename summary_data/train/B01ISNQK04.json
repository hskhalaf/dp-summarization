Our hearing is not what it used to be and we were looking for an alternative to a dog for perimeter security; bears and such.

A little survey tape strategically place along the line reminds us not to trip it but we do and it works great. We call it our E-Dog.",

The extra bottom hook feature allows easy construction of a tripwire or campsite alarm.
