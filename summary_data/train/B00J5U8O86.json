Our living/dining room is 400 sq. ft., well within the specification of 400-550 sq. ft. It keeps the room at 75 when it is 88 outside, but when it is 94 the room creeps up to 80.

Now they are wonderful, sometimes even cold (even on the hottest days). I was puzzled after reading the few negative reviews, but careful reading convinces me that most of the problems people have had stem not from the machine but from: 1) haste (impatience), frustration and anger 2) improper installation 3) selecting the wrong unit (not matching the size of the room with the Btu's of the machine) 4) and failure to consider humidity in the analysis. Humidity must be included in choosing the right machine.",

      "text": "Actually never got to see it. It got as far as my driveway, then was returned with no explanation. Still a mystery, but I reordered the same AC in black. Would have preferred white, but the Northwest was in the middle of a heat wave, and there were no more available. The identical AC in black works well and cools the house fairly quickly, even with vaulted ceilings.",
