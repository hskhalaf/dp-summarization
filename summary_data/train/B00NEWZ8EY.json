I took pictures of a man on a scaffold painting ( you could barley see the man he was so far away)...took the pic and zoomed in, you can actually see the stitching in the cap he was wearing. I am using it mainly for moon photography and it is unbelievable. I am shooting moon pics handheld and get better results than with a tripod. I think this is because when you put the camera on a tripod it disengages the image stabilization. I take moon pics every night it is available and they are amazing. The camera is also great for regular photography.",

Can't possibly be used without a monopod or tripod in any significant zoom mode, but I a super pleased with the quality of the shots so far. Excellent for wildlife. Of course I had to shoot the moon just because everyone does, and that is cool, but I really like it for shooting birds and other wildlife.",

This camera will not deliver the same quality photos that you would get with a DSLR but the ultra zoom allows you to get nature photos (and family photos) that you could not get with other much more expensive cameras. The feature set is excellent and I find that the photo quality is still very, very good. If you enjoy hiking and the outdoors this is a camera you need.",

And quickly share everything you capture: the PowerShot SX60 HS is Wi-Fi\u00ae**- and NFC-enabled*** with an easy Mobile Device Connect button.\n\n* Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.\n** Compatible with iOS versions 6.0/6.1/7.0/7.1, Android smartphone versions 2.3.3/4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4 and Android tablet versions 4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4. Data charges may apply.\n*** Compatible with Android devices version 4.0 or later\n\nULTRA ZOOMING POWER IN THE PALM OF YOUR HANDS\n65X OPTICAL ZOOM (21\u20131365MM) WIDE-ANGLE LENS WITH OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER FOR OUTSTANDING OPTICAL PERFORMANCE AND VERSATILITY FOR BOTH CLOSE-UPS AND WIDE SHOTS\nImagine having the power to capture animals in the wild from a safe distance, shoot architectural details atop a skyscraper, and see the expression on an athlete's face from up in the stands \u2013 all from a compact camera with a built-in lens. Lightweight with superb controllability, the 65x Optical Zoom lens on the PowerShot SX60 HS camera is a marvel of optical engineering; but it's also a Genuine Canon Lens, which means that the images you capture with it will be beautifully natural and true to life \u2013 whether you're shooting at the wide angle or extreme telephoto end.\n\nBEAUTIFUL IMAGES AND FAST PERFORMANCE START HERE\n16.1 MEGAPIXEL* HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nThe PowerShot SX60 HS camera employs a 16.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.\n\n* Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.\n\nCANON DIGIC 6 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe PowerShot SX60 HS camera is equipped with the very latest Canon proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which makes several important advancements to image quality both in stills and video. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot SX60 HS, powering full resolution high-speed continuous stills shooting. And video recording is better than ever, as the DIGIC 6 Image Processor enables Full HD at 60p, as well as MP4 recording. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM\nThe PowerShot SX60 HS camera gives you the power to create images with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. The 16.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works in concert with Canon's latest-generation DIGIC 6 Image Processor to create the Canon HS SYSTEM. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you'll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality even at high ISO speeds all the way up to ISO 3200; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur in a variety of situations for incredible photos, even when shooting video.\n\nRAW MODE\nThe PowerShot SX60 HS lets you shoot in RAW mode, which records all the information captured by the sensor, giving you outstanding flexibility and complete creative control when editing your images with Canon's powerful software. The camera also allows you to record in RAW and JPEG formats simultaneously. Now, in RAW mode, you can even select among several aspect ratios, including 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, 1:1 and 4:5.\n\nSERIOUS VIDEO AND AUDIO CAPABILITY\n1080P FULL HD VIDEO AND EXTERNAL MICROPHONE SUPPORT\nWith the PowerShot SX60 HS camera, you'll preserve memories and creative film clips in beautifully realistic 1080p Full HD Video at 60 frames per second. The quality is especially apparent when you play back your video on a large-screen HDTV via the camera's HDMI output. Simply press the dedicated Movie button to begin recording. And now for the first time on a PowerShot model, a new input allows you to attach an optional external microphone (\u23003.5mm) for serious audio recording to match the high-quality video you'll capture. The camera's powerful zoom is equipped with Canon's precision-engineered Ultrasonic Motor (USM) and Voice Coil Motor (VCM) for fast, silent zooming and focus that won't interfere with audio capture. Advanced videographers will appreciate the camera's Manual movie mode that lets you adjust aperture and shutter speeds, and ISO speed either before or during video capture for enhanced creative control.\n\nThe PowerShot SX60 HS also records video in the Apple iFrame\u00ae format, a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, so uploading and emailing high-quality video is quick and easy. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, so you won't have to make time-consuming conversions that can degrade quality.\n\nSIMPLY TAP TO CONNECT\nBUILT-IN WI-FI\u00ae AND NFC (NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION) FOR EASIER CONNECTIVITY\nThe PowerShot SX60 HS camera supports NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, eliminating the need to manually find and open the Canon CameraWindow app* on your mobile device. Simply touch the NFC icon on your camera to your compatible Android\u2122 device**, and the CameraWindow app will launch automatically for quick, easy sharing of your images. Built-in NFC technology also makes it simpler to install the app. If the app hasn't been installed yet, once you touch the devices together for the first time, the download screen will display automatically.\n\nBUILT-IN WI-FI\u00ae MAKES SHARING QUICK AND EASY\nThe PowerShot SX60 HS camera is equipped with built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae technology for on-the-go convenience when you want to share your photos and videos with friends, family and the whole world. Easily post your images to social networking and media sites \u2013 Facebook\u00ae, Twitter\u00ae, YouTube\u2122, Flickr\u00ae, and Google Drive\u2122 \u2013 through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY# directly from your PowerShot camera, or save them to the online photo album to share anytime, anywhere. The camera can also connect directly to both iOS\u00ae and Android\u2122 devices##, and upload images via the free Canon CameraWindow app without a computer. You can control the destination of your uploads to share with everyone or to selected groups, and even add comments. Sharing video is also easy with the PowerShot SX60 HS, which records video using the easy-to-share MP4 format. Enhanced Wi-Fi\u00ae makes posting in real time possible, so you can keep everyone up to date with photos and video even as events unfold. The built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae technology on the PowerShot SX60 HS also allows you to transfer images to other Wi-Fi\u00ae equipped PowerShot cameras or print your photos directly to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) certified printer.\n\nREMOTE SHOOTING\nWith the built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae on the PowerShot SX60 HS, you can use your smartphone or tablet## to remotely control the camera. Simply connect wirelessly to your device and access the free Canon CameraWindow app*.

The camera's versatile zoom, flash, self-timer and shutter are all under your control, with images being saved to your camera as usual.\n\nMOBILE DEVICE CONNECT BUTTON\nOne-touch connection to your mobile device or computer is made possible on the PowerShot SX60 HS with the camera's dedicated Mobile Device Connect Button. You can choose to transfer images to your smartphone or tablet for immediate sharing with the CameraWindow app, or to your computer on the same network with Image Sync to make saving and organizing your images easier. When the camera finds a linked computer on the same wireless network, images are sent directly to it. Otherwise, images are temporarily stored on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY then transferred once a connection is made, eliminating the need for cables.\n\n* This software enables you to upload images to social network services. Before uploading images, please be aware that image files may contain privacy related information such as people and places. If necessary, please delete such information. Canon does not obtain, collect or use such images or any information included in such images through this software.\n** Compatible with Android devices version 4.0 or later.\n# One-time registration is required on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY online photo album.\n## Compatible with iOS versions 6.0/6.1/7.0/7.1, Android smartphone versions 2.3.3/4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4 and Android tablet versions 4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4. Data charges may apply.\n\nOPTIMAL IMAGE STABILIZATION IN ANY SITUATION\nINTELLIGENT IS AUTOMATICALLY CHOOSES FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT MODES TO OPTIMIZE IMAGE STABILIZATION FOR VIRTUALLY SHAKE-FREE IMAGES IN A WIDE VARIETY OF CONDITIONS\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot SX60 HS camera, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're shooting still images or video.\n\nSTILL IMAGE SHOOTING\nNormal IS Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning IS Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. VIDEO RECORDING\nDynamic IS Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered IS Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting. Active Tripod IS When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake. EASIER TRACKING AND CAPTURE\nZOOM FRAMING ASSIST AND ZOOM MEMORY\nIts 65x Optical Zoom lens gives the PowerShot SX60 HS camera the ability to capture subjects at great distances, but because it can be challenging to track a moving subject at maximum telephoto, the camera includes sophisticated technology to help you get the most from the camera's powerful zoom while simply enjoying shooting. When you press and hold the Zoom Framing Assist button, the camera will zoom out to include a wider angle of view, enabling you to more easily locate your moving subject. Once you find it, releasing the button will cause the lens to return to its original zoom position, intelligently keeping the subject in focus until you're ready to shoot and capture the perfect close-up moment. You can even make zoom adjustments while the button is pressed, with an animated assist frame that makes viewing easy. When the button is released, the lens will return to the adjusted zoom position. Zoom Framing Assist also lets you select an image area (Face/Upper Body/Whole Body/Manual), then keeps that area of your subject the same size in your frame no matter how the subject moves. For instance, you can tap the Zoom Framing Assist button to detect your subject's face. As your subject retreats and advances the camera automatically zooms in and out so their face remains the same size. It's especially useful for capturing the expressions of fast-moving children, and for letting a friend take a picture after you've composed the shot. And, for even more convenience, the Zoom Framing Assist function is also available when shooting video.\n\nA new Zoom Memory function lets you save the zoom position and return to it immediately when you power the camera on. You can also save a Manual Focus position. This is especially convenient at times when you want to power off during short breaks while remaining ready to shoot immediately, for instance if you're waiting for clouds to pass by, or changing the camera's SD card or battery.\n\nFASTER FOCUS FOR ACCURACY, SPONTANEITY\nHIGH SPEED AF\nThe PowerShot SX60 HS camera is equipped with Canon's remarkably responsive High Speed AF. This High Speed AF technology achieves an increase in speed for quicker start up and a shooting experience that's spontaneous and natural. And a speedier AF means it's possible to photograph fast-moving subjects, which complements the PowerShot SX60 HS's High-Speed Burst HQ mode. You'll capture great shots as they happen \u2013 frame by frame \u2013 with reduced lag time.\n\nCONVENIENT SHOOTING FLEXIBILITY\nBRIGHT 3.0-INCH VARI-ANGLE LCD WITH 922,000 DOTS FOR SHOOTING AT A VARIETY OF ANGLES, PLUS AN ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER WITH 922,000 DOTS FOR SHOOTING\nThe PowerShot SX60 HS camera gives you lots of ways to frame a great shot. The bright 3.0-inch Vari-angle LCD has excellent resolution (approximately 922,000 dots), and flips out and swivels/rotates for shooting at unusual angles, even letting you capture perfectly framed self-portraits. The camera also has an Electronic Viewfinder (approximately 922,000 dots) to easily see subjects when using the camera in very bright sunlight, or preventing camera shake by holding it steadily.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nENHANCED GRIP\nThe carefully designed grip on the PowerShot SX60 HS camera was specifically developed to make high-magnification shooting easy and accurate. Substantially sized and tall enough for your whole hand to hold securely, the grip is very comfortable and adds a distinctive professional style. The camera's design allows easy access to controls (like access to a convenient front dial), and maximizes camera angle flexibility with the Vari-angle LCD screen to allow you to handle the camera like you would an SLR for optimal control.\n\nEXTRA ACCESSORIES\nExperience the PowerShot SX60 HS camera's full potential using accessories that are normally used with EOS DSLR cameras. The PowerShot SX60 HS is compatible with Canon Speedlites, transmitters, and select filter adapters and lens hoods to help maximize the camera's versatility photographers need to achieve their creative vision.\n\nHDR\nShooting in high-contrast environments can often result in photos with overexposed and underexposed sections. To tackle this problem, Canon developed the High Dynamic Range shooting mode to make shooting even more intuitive. Under High Dynamic Range, the camera will shoot three different exposures in a succession (underexposed, overexposed and normal) and then merge them into a single image. Underexposed areas are combined with the overexposed and vice versa, resulting in an evenly detailed image with flattering shadows and highlights. With the PowerShot SX60 HS camera, a tripod is not always necessary, plus the camera features artistic sub-modes Art Standard, Art Vivid, Art Bold, Art Embossed and Natural, which add dynamic, creative effects depending on the ambience you want to convey.\n\nCREATIVE SHOT\nRather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of advanced Canon technologies to analyze the individual scene, subject and exposure to apply any of 46 filter options. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five additional variations of the composition. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.\n\nSMART AUTO\nSmart AUTO for the PowerShot SX60 HS camera makes it easier than ever to capture the sharp, bright, colorful images and videos you're looking for. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58* predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results. Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects and landscapes in the evening or on a bright, snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as \"keeper\" shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot SX60 HS ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.\n\n* 58 predefined shooting situations for still images, and 21 predefined shooting situations for video.\n\nHYBRID AUTO\nCapture the essence of special days \u2013 vacations, important occasions or any time you're shooting many shots in a day \u2013 using Hybrid Auto on the PowerShot SX60 HS camera. Hybrid Auto records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the day's clips and pictures* into a video. The feature also makes sure the \"highlight reel\" is stunningly beautiful by automatically recognizing the scene and optimizing camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.\n\n* Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.",
