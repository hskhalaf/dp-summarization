I'm a professional trainer and these V20's set up fast and project sound in a large room for 30 people or more. Nice case which is required, protects speakers and easy to pack. Great to have after work for listening to music in the hotel room. They are not accurate transducers yet are satisfying enough especially for their size. Media controls on speaker are also convenient and work well. Markings / buttons could be slightly larger.",

      "text": "I bought these speakers for use in teaching a dance class using digital files on my laptop. They replaced a little Altec Orbit, which was a nice little speaker, but just didn't have enough power. One space in which I teach is a multipurpose room in a church basement...big space with ceilings of about 20 feet. The Logitech speakers do a nice job of providing good quality sound and...the big consideration...have plenty of power. Love the fact that they can be adjusted to compensate for the sound output level of the recordings, which are by no means uniform. They are light and easily fit in the second compartment of my laptop case. I would by these again in a hearbeat.",

We were a little nervous (having not based our top 'must-have' as great sound) but we were completely satisfied. The V20 Notebook speakers performed really well with MP3 playback, movie watching and Talk Radio. Yeah, they don't have a nice deep bass or warmer middle but they get their power from the USB port! A massive improvement over the built-in notebook speakers and they look cute too. One downside is the lack of a AUX input. Other than that, we are very happy with the purchase. Oh, the travel/storage case is great too.",

The sound is better than the laptop speakers, but, as one should understand, not a replacement for a home stereo. They do, however, allow you to hear your streaming radio, music, or videos across the room, and still be able to hear it clearly. The flip-out stands in the back are great. They come with a decent zippered pouch for traveling and mobility. I highly recommend these speakers over any other speakers in this category. We have owned three laptop speakers like this, and these are by far the best.",

We use them at our church with a laptop to play DVDs, and while they don't blast to the back row (which is good, or the front row would be deaf), they make themselves heard well and get picked up by microphones with no loss of quality (as opposed to the laptop speakers, which sounded bad by themselves and worse when amplified). Better than similar portable speakers costing twice as much.",

I need speakers that reproduce audio fairly accurately and, for the size and the price, find these speakers to do a great job. They're small enough to be able to pack them into an oversized laptop case. I love the single USB connection, which frees up my headset jack for other needs. The only two drawbacks I find so far is because of their small size, you can't crank them without getting some distortion and lower frequencies aren't as great as if you had a subwoofer. But at normal sound levels, these speakers are really great!",

The sound quality is pretty good and they meet my needs. Caution: the speakers can only be spaced about 3 feet apart because that's the length of the cable between them. And the USB cable is only about 18\" long. Keep these parameters in mind if you are considering them.",

Also, it appears that sometimes one can not use them in a plug-and-play manner, having to have them connected to a port with the initial boot-up rather than after the computer has already started. The carrying case is not, but they're not actually my idea of easily portable. I have a high opinion of the Logitech products I've purchase, and overall I like these speakers, and use them with a Dell notebook with satisfaction.",

So if you have a USB mouse or similar it will affect sound quality. Apparently there is a Microsoft fix for this so don't let that put you off. The speakers in their case are as large as my netbook, a tad bigger than I expected, but the sound quality makes up for all the cons.",

They said to just hook them up, but I had to experiment to get them to work; I hooked them up with my laptop off, then turned it on, and that worked. The carrying case is solid, but these are comparatively large speakers compared with others on the market. The controls on the top of the speaker are quite small and close together, so it's hard to operate them (when they're hooked up, they go on automatically when the laptop is turned on). Otherwise, a very good product.",
