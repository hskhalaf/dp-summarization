It is in bathroom, comfortable, strong and nice looking. Dimensions are accurate, very easy to put together. All predrilled holes line up, screws are tightened with allen wrench, provided. Might actually want more for our porch.",

Double boxed chair pieces did not fit, pegs or tongues did not align, had to enlarge one groove on side to complete assembly. Once adjustments made stained borh chairs, recommend light sanding prior to staining. Over all chairs look good and feel solid. Would buy again.",

It should be noted that these are not unfinished in fact they are stained in a redwood color.",

Not to mention, out of the two I ordered, only one came with instructions and screws. So I had to go to the hardware store just to finish one. Overall, it's a quick assembly. But the wood does feel cheap. I don't anticipate it falling apart anytime soon, but I do anticipate it crumbling eventually from dealing with the blunt force of people sitting in it. The wood just feels thin and rickety.",
