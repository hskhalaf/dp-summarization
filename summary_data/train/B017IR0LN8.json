We've tried fixing it for another 2 hours - no luck. If you don't care about drawers closing though - it's honestly a really nice dresser.",

The only thing we wish was different the fact that the drawer rollers come pre-installed this limits some of the ability of the drawers to close perfectly - but it saves you the headache of attaching them yourself. Overall we are very happy with this dresser.",

The biggest quality issue with it are the drawers popping out; they don't actually stay shut. Doesn't matter if the drawers are empty or full. My husband has assembled a lot of furniture before and he was really disappointed by the quality of the parts, we may just end up going to buy different sliders for the drawers to see if that solves the problem.",

      "text": "I have put together probably 100 pieces of furniture in my day, and this was the most overly complicated piece to date. And you might think that something with a, literally, 47 page instruction manual and over 100 screws would be sturdy as a rock, but you'd be wrong. It's no better than a $100 piece you'd buy at Target and assemble it 20 minutes. This took me over 4 hours. I do not recommend!!",

I was informed by Delta/Serta that this is a stand alone piece that does not match the grays used for other Delta/Serta products. I have been informed there is nothing they are able to do to remedy the situation. I am extremely dissatisfied with the level of customer service and the quality of the product. Will NOT be purchasing from this company in the future.",
