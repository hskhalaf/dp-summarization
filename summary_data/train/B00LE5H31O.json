After that, it had a hard time staying going (seemed like low fuel flow) and a day later, morning. It looks prefect and has always been taken well care of, never dropped, used only by me. It does not work after less than 10 used over 4 months. The return window is closed, so I\u2019m left with a paperweight. Perhaps try a different option.",

It puts out a good amount of light and is easy to light up. The mantle wasn't hard to get on and burn. Really, I have nothing bad to say. I was concerned about the glass globe, but it has been robust and has withstood rough treatment both backpacking and car camping. I couldn't imagine using the version with the metal glabe - it would severely limit the light output. This is cheap enough, and good enough that you won't regret buying it.",

I'd like to thank those other reviewers who suggested using a coleman type 51 mantle. They work great and are obviously better quality. The lantern does not come with an instruction manual, contact info, or how to get replacement parts (like spare mantles) so the type 51 info was invaluable. Otherwise very bright and adjustable. It gets very hot so I'd be careful using it inside a tent. A little heavy for back packing (so buy your hiking buddy one and let him/her carry it). I plan to use it for canoe trips.",
