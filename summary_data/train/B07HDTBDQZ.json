Never thought I would be a sneakers gal, but these may have converted me... temporarily of course. These fit true to size, are super comfortable (I walk hills) and did not give me shin splints. Great value.",

But I left them on and walked around in them it seem to help them stretch, the more use they get they are almost broken into fitting comfortably without being tight after wearing them 3 days. But they don't seem original. But at first glance they are noticeably smaller than a normal size 12. Recomend trying a size up.",
