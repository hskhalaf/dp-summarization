My complaint, hence the 3 stars, is its too loose of a fit. I like my Julie Designs because it\u2019s a nice snug perfect fit. This one is a baggy fit and if I keep it, it\u2019s going to the tailors. (My board is a hybrid board and not a skinny pro board) Especially extra loose around the nose. POOR Cut/Fit. If they tailored up the fit to be more like the JD's, this would be a for sure winner.",
