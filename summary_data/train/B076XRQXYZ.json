I will need a new shoe shortly and with a marathon coming up in October, was looking for the same pair as I currently have so I could break them in in time. I ordered this running shoe ( the Wave Inspire 14) because I was not able to find the version 13s. I took these Inspire 14s for one run so far (6 miles) and was happy with the support, room in the toe box and the overall fit.",
