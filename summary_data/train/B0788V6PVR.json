He actually took a nap on it to break it in, lol. I wouldn\u2019t recommend trying this, but my dog did end up jumping on without any issues, too. I\u2019m looking forward to trying it on the water!",

I spent my afternoon reading a book on the lounger instead of on the couch. It will not hold air for more than 2 days before you\u2019ll need to refill it to have enough bounce.",

So I imagine outdoor use will be even better. Definitely handy, and no complaints on the beer opener either!",

My four stars may go to a five if I can inflate more easily out of doors. Maybe I'll get really Legit and try a lounger in a hammock. Then I'd really be floating on air.",

Great longevity of inflation - I filled it with air one evening, and the next evening, after 4+ hours of heavy lounging, it was still at about 80% inflation level. Great ease of inflation outdoors - took me 10 seconds and one try. However, you need a lot of room if you're going to inflate inside. Overall, 10/10.",

Since this product is so light weight once it is inflated there is a carabiner and stake included to make sure it doesn't blow away if you ever find yourself able to leave this lounger. Very happy with this purchase and looking forward to trying it out on my day hikes.",

Certainly not it's intended use but it feels very durable and I wasn't worried at all about her popping it. It seems like the same nylon material as their hammock so it's very strong.",
