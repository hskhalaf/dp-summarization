      "text": "I was a bit hesitate to purchase a 1080P WiFi camera that cost less than $40. But I am surprised by how clear the video & audio is, The audio is very clear, no freeze, it's much better than my previous camera from another brand. I subscribed the cloud service, it does not cost much, but it does a great job, motion detection with video clips, saving the videos in th e last 7 days to the cloud, NO SD card needed, and it's safe, isn't it? Got 2 of them, will difinitely purchase more.",

      "text": "After countless attempts trying to get the camera to connect to my network and smartphone, I finally had to throw in the towel after endless frustration. The smartphone app lacks basic functionality, the instructions that came with the camera were no help at all, and I could never tell for sure whether the camera was working or not (no indicator light; sometimes the device reset, and other times it didn't; and it would seem to be booting up and then go silent). I had the correct network speed 2.4GB, a new Android phone, and a functioning home network. What I didn't have was more time to waste, so buyers beware. I learned my lesson.",

You can also tap the screen on your phone to move the camera around to catch more things. When I'm at work, I can easily check on him on my phone, which eases up my worries about him. You can also talk to each other via the speaker. It's just so wonderful!",
