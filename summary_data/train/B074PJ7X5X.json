Stick drift is ridiculous on it which is why I dont give it 5. Forums are full of complaints and no resolve yet. My left stick drifts up making it hard to hold angles on siege. BT has slight lag.

The controller also has unbearable input lag and frequent disconnects. I wanted to LOVE this controller but I just can't recommend it to anyone in its current state. I fully intend to return this ASAP. So disappointed.",

I won't be trying to get it fixed because I'm tired of it, will be looking forward to purchasing a SCUF controller and see how much better it is since everyone is getting one. P.S.

Especially if you like the Xbox one controller style, but prefer the PS4 layout. Has hair trigger locks for shooters and such. Has four additional mappable buttons, two triggers on the underside(both removable) and two additional buttons beside your R1 and L1. Includes a 10ft. long braided cable. Includes removable thumb tabs for the sticks. Con: Just one. It isn\u2019t wireless. Take that into consideration if you have little ones around or a cable would be a trip hazard. The cable, again, is 10ft. long which gives you plenty of length.",

Buttons are responsive and are positioned perfectly to give you all your moves in FPS games without having to move your thumbs off the sticks. Lets you do what others can't in PVP, and is more affordable than SCUF controllers. Razer is a mainstay in PC gaming peripherals, and this first run at console gaming is quality.",
