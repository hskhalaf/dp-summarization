Fits nicely with my sparring gear feet. I don't feel held back or restrained by them. I am 5'4 and ordered the adult small.",

I would not recommend this item to anyone with more than a 15\u201d calf....and if the previous post is correct about length being the only variable, I would not recommend the XL either for the same reason",

I have already seen some thread came out, so I do think it will last long. Also it is a bit hot to wear outdoor in summer time. This shin guard will be more suitable for some indoor activity.
