      "text": "I am very pleased with the performance of this laptop (so far). It seems to have all the functions I require. It is very good value for money, and while not being too heavy is fairly sturdy and is a good quality item. I was very pleased to discover that it has a CDRom drive - something I didn't expect as most modern devices seem to lack these. I find this very useful for a number of reasons. The keyboard is well spaced and very comfortable, and although I am not at all tech-minded I enjoy using it.",

You have to press really firmly and it makes a loud \"click\" noise from the mechanics of it I guess. The McAfree stuff they preload it with is annoying and pops up constantly so going to have to look at a way of getting rid of that. The typeface, style, look is very android.",

From all other aspects i would give a rating of 5 for this refurbished product. Buy this if you want to take a calculated risk. Ovarall, i would go with a rating of 3.",
