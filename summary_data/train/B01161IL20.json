Good quality and nice packaging with suggestions on usage. However, I was not happy with my most recent order. Out of the 8 bottles, the lemongrass was not filled completely. The seal was intact so it must have been a manufacturing issue. I used the oil once (3-4 drops) and the bottle is completely empty. I have purchased other Art Natural products and like them overall but I was really unhappy to see that I paid for eight EOs and received seven.",

I kind of was expecting it, so I checked each of the bottles, however, none were opened and they were intact. It has 8 instead of 6 bottles, so i got 2 more oils that I normally get. They work fine and as well as my previous ones. I got more for less money. I think I will stay with this one. Thanks again.",
