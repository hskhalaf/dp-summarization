The plumber was able to move the water line for installation of one of the two Vespin II's we ordered, but not the other. Amazon was very helpful in accepting the return of the one that could not be installed without tearing into the wall, but prospective buyers need to be aware of the two issues above before purchasing this particular Toto.",

      "text": "Got several of these for our bathroom renovation (including replacing a 5 GPF toilet from 1965 which we nicknamed the Exxon Valdez). A skirted toilet is MUCH easier to clean (the Vespin II is basically a skirted Drake), and the hard, glossy Toto finish stays clean. Also, a Toto rarely clogs and one flush is enough. That said, I liked an older Toto (ca. 2004) from my last house a bit better (totally skirted - this one has a small indentation in the base), and it flushed a bit better, but I think this is probably because the Vespin II uses even less water (1.28 GPF).",

The only improvement I'd make is fix the fill valve setup to not make noise as it fills. Right now, you hear the water dripping and splashing as it refills. It's probably easy enough to switch out the fill valve with one that lets the water flow smoothly down to the bottom instead of falling and splashing. That one improvement will make this toilet perfect. I expect the toilet to impress everyone who doesn't know what they are missing with their cheapy toilets.",

Had it for closed to 1 year now, and would say construction and function hold well. Maintenance is also minimal as nothing sticks to the inside of the bowl. We have hard water, and no ring around the water line. Flush mechanism placement is a little odd - mounted vertical so to flush you push the lever toward the wall/back of the toilet.",

If you add a bidet to it, positioning it is more of a challenge than other toilet bowls. The nozzle can easily hit the back of the bowl after it extends so you'll have to pull it closer to the front.
