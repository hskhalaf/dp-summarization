I then bought it from their main site to see if there was any difference and it was good, but not as awesome as the first time on here. Then I purchased it through here again, and it was like a totally different jerky than the other times. Really thin and fatty/greasy/slimy pieces that still tasted hard and almost stale. For the price it was a huge disappointment especially since it is costly so I bought it as a treat for me at Christmas time again.",

Some pieces tasted great, but then too many would have an almost complete absence of whatever spice they put on it. The best thing about this jerky was the cool zip function the bag had on it.

It\u2019s dry, with a texture that needs a good chew. The seasoning is subtle and not overpowering, you can really taste the beef. I got the 16 oz bag and it last me a month.

Low/no sugar which is nice and no corn syrup or artificial additives. While the beef is sourced from the US it's not grass fed. Grass fed maybe would take it into the more \"premium\" category, but the taste/consistency is still lacking. Not bad, but I won't purchase this again. To me it feels 50% for human consumption and 50% as dog treats. I'll stick with Whole Foods 365 brand jerky in the future, even though I think they may have some sugar the taste and quality feels much higher.",

The packaging is not resealable, sadly, and it makes no fewer than three mentions of the fact that it's made in \"Downtown LA.\" Like that's something to be proud of. Solid 4/5; nailed the texture and hardness, but loses a star for the extreme salt and the lack of resealable packaging.",

I bought this for myself because I was on the search for a dryer jerky as opposed to a fatty one. People's Choice filled that bill for me. Since then, I have told several friends about it and I have purchased another bag for my friends at my physical therapy office because two of them are fully Keto and I wanted them to experience this jerky.",

The peppered flavor is too sweet for me, and I have been sticking to the Original flavor which is keto-friendly. One thing that bugs me though is that I have had several bags now. Sometimes you get runs that are super greasy with a lot of fat on the pieces (still good) and sometimes the pieces are super-dry and hard. I realize we are dealing with a non-uniform raw product, however, some kind of happy, consistent, medium would be better.",

I LOVE this beef jerky because it's DRY like beef jerky is supposed to be, and it takes some jaw to rip off a piece. Plus it takes a long time to chew it, which really helps with how long it takes to eat it. 1 oz is 1 serving, but since it's so dry, you get a lot of jerky for 1 Oz. I have bought more of this because I love it so much.",

There are no tough tendons or thick plasticky pieces. The flavor is peppery and earthy with a hint of soy sauce. I was unhappy when I saw that the 2.5 oz bags were not resealable. After my first piece, I realized why. I am buying more. This one is going on my recurring order list.",

      "text": "I ordered the top 3 best reviewed brands of jerky. Peoples, Old Trapper and Wild Bills. Long story short The Peoples brand won out my favorite. All three were good for a variety of reasons but overall Peoples is my favorite. Pros. Dry. makes less of a mess. No weird after or during taste. Being dyer you get a little more for your money. Cons. Dry. tougher. some people don't desire this type of jerky. Only comes in small packs.",

It's also healthier than a lot of the other jerky sold by other companies, so that's totally a plus. I love that it's tougher and drier than the beef jerky you find in the stores as well - not overly so, either - and I grew up on homemade jerky, so I'm very accustomed to this. Oh, and I wasn't expecting a resealable bag for the 1lb bag - what a friggen plus! I'm so happy I found this brand - I'll be ordering more in the near future!",

This product reminds me of the old-fashioned beef jerky of the good old days. Like others have mentioned, the cut of beef they use for this jerky must be fattier because the strips can get a bit greasy, but it's still the best jerky I've had in a long, LONG while. My family went crazy over this stuff and finished the bag in 3 days! Added plus is the no sugar, no added preservatives (except salt). Definitely plan to order more, because it's worth every penny!",

      "text": "When I first opened the packaged I was surprised as to how paper-stiff the beef jerky was until I tried one, then another and another! My husband reacted in the same way. Even my Yorkie enjoyed the pieces I gave her, knowing it was 100% beef. Great taste and texture. Will definitely continue to purchase this beef jerky because it not only tastes very good but the fact that it is 100% beef with NO SUGAR making it a healthy snack.",

Beef jerky is food that is simple to make, yet surprisingly hard to find simply made. And that's what this is; a simple food, surprisingly well made.",
