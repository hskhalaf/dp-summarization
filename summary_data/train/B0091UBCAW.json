I wanted a top load All In One (with fax) printer (for paper) with a small footprint. This fit the bill. The secret to keeping the printer heads unclogged is to use the printer regularly AND turn it off every day. I've had Epsons, Canons, HPs and Brother ink jet printers for 40 years and only had trouble with an Epson 410 rarely used.",

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure it in different ways? Now you can. Much like \u201cMPG\u201d ratings on new cars, there\u2019s now an industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry-approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for inkjet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \u201cout of the box\u201d (default) print speeds using \u201creal world\u201d printing scenarios, so you can be sure you\u2019re getting a product that performs at the speed you need.\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n * Sharp documents \u2014 laser quality black text delivers crisp, high quality proposals, reports and brochures\n * Convenience \u2014 the included OCR software also allows you to scan and save documents as text-searchable, editable PDFs\n * High-speed faxing in black and color \u2014 as fast as 3 sec per page; speed dial storage up to 60 numbers; fax memory up to 180 pages\n * PC-Fax \u2014 fax documents directly to/from your computer\n * Save energy \u2014 uses up to 70% less power than laser printers\n * Product protection you can count on \u2014 phone support, without charge, for the life of the product; plus, get free templates and \u201chow to\u201d tutorials\n * Packaging Specifications (W x D x H) \u2014 Dimensions: Printing 15.4\" x 21.3\" x 11.5\", Storage 15.4\" x 14.8\" x 8.7\" and Weight 13 lb.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n * WorkForce WF-2540 All-in-One\n * Instruction manual\n * CD-ROM with drivers & bonus software\n * Power cord\n * Telephone cord\n * DURABrite Ultra Cartridges: Four 200-series: Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow\n\nEPSON INK SUPPLIES\n * 200 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge, Standard-capacity (T200120)\n * 200 DURABrite Ultra Cyan ink cartridge, Standard-capacity (T200220)\n * 200 DURABrite Ultra Magenta ink cartridge Standard-capacity (T200320)\n * 200 DURABrite Ultra Yellow ink cartridge, Standard-capacity (T200420)\n * 200 DURABrite Ultra Color MultiPack, Standard-capacity (T200520)\n\nEPSON PAPER SUPPLIES\n * Premium Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 50 sheets (S041257)\n * Bright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586)\n * Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)\n * Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331)\n * Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)\n\n\n\n\nECO FEATURES\n * Recyclable product\n * Uses up to 70% less power than laser printers\n * Save up to 50% on paper with manual, 2-sided printing\n * ENERGY STAR qualified\n * Epson America, Inc. is a SmartWay Transport partner",
