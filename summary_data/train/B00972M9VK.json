The speaker volume is great but I am planning on purchasing an external speaker in hopes of a clearer sound. It came with a regular aluminum adjustable antenna along with a corded antenna that will mount to a window with suction cups for improved reception. I have no complaints on this item. If you are in the market for a simple, easy to use scanner, this one is the one I highly recommend.",

This model has much more channel capacity with 100 different frequencies capable of being stored in the private settings for my county. I've read about how people have some trouble programming it, and there is a small learning curve. But once you understand how to do it, it's no big deal. Very compact and reliable scanner. During the recent massive snow storm, I learned a new appreciation for our first responders and the work they actually do on a daily basis. I highly recommend.",

Found the ability to scan frequency ranges instead of \"service\" banks to also be very useful. Reception with the supplied \"suction cup\" antenna is reasonable, but an inexpensive magnetic antenna (like from Hustler) makes a real improvement. Audio is very good, even without an external speaker. Overall, I'd rank this unit as an 11 (think Spinal Tap).",
