      "text": "I love their taste! And I have reordered. But I have two pieces of advice. First, make sure you understand the quantity/dose information. It says \"200 milligrams\", but that is per serving--and a serving is defined as \"two gummy supplements.\" So, a bottle of 60 actually only contains enough for 30 days. Second--and this one I really don't get--each bottle of 60 sells for $13.31. A different option allows you to buy a \"three-pack (60 each bottle) for about $52.00. Do the math: Order 3 individual bottles of 60 (totaling 180 gummies), and pay about $40; or, buy a \"3-pack\" (totaling 180 gummies) and pay about $12 more.",
