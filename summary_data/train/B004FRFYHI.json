You can cinch a towel into the bungee cross-arrangement. The bag is comfortable to carry, (I walk a 1.8 miles with it daily) & is well made with heavy canvas.

Also, enough with single purpose pockets like the mask and sunglass holder, they are cute but pointless. The mask holder should be bigger with a zippered pocket or the velcro should be stronger, as it is I have concern that my mask could fall out which doesn't make me happy. The sunglass holder should be a pocket where you could stow stuff instead of just sunglasses.",

This Promate bag is fantastic-well constructed, roomy, vented for easier drying of contents, and roomy enough for all his gear.
