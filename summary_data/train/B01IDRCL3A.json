      "text": "My neighbor told me about this salt block. She said if you cook a steak on it, it will be the best you ever had. I was doubtful but decided to give it a try. I put a little olive oil and some pepper on my steak, cooked it on the slab for 5 minutes each side and had a beautifully cooked med-med rare steak. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!! I cook everything on my salt block now. It gives amazing flavor to anything you cook on it.....seafood, chicken, vegetables, etc. My recommendation - let the grill heat this up for 15 minutes and then cook your meat on it.",

I don't ever get it wet -- to clean I just scrap off the top, wrap in a clean dishtowel, and store it. Candidly, I was super careful about heating it slowly for the first use, but after that I just placed it on the grill and turned up the heat. Never had an issue.",
