In 6 kits, there were over half of the buttons not working and many of the LED lights also not working. This makes it very frustrating for kids, who are following directions and not getting their LED to light up. I feel like I wasted $500 on these kits. Very disappointing.",

Also, it has a book or manual which you can use and also has a lot of tutorials by using which you can make a lots of project.

You will lear a lot about electronics, controlling LEDs, motors, etc. and writing the corresponding code in fun hands on projects. Kit comes will everything you will need for these projects and your future projects (LEDs, transistors, resistors, capacitors, bread board jumpers). In other words, everything you need to start exploring electronics.",

I think 5 minutes introducing them to my Dremel tool will take care of that problem. The second is not as easy. The tilt switch is totally worthless the leads are too short and it will not stay in the breadboard. If you finally get lucky and find 4 holes that seem to be holding on to the switch, don't tap the board. The switch will come flying out and the little devil can go quite a way! So far, the rest seems to be working as designed. TucsonBill",

I've had this for a month and have proceeded to purchase many more sensors and configuations from Amazon. I particularly like working with the Arduino Nano v3! It does everything the Uno can do but a fraction of the size. The Uno in this kit is a perfect place to start though. Enjoy.. I have! :)",

I found myself wishing for an inventory sheet so I could know what I should expect to find in the box, so I could discover any missing parts before I started.

No parts were missing, if anything it comes with enough extra parts to have a lot of fun experimenting with.

One thing that I particularly liked was the laser cut wooden base that allows the Arduino and breadboard to be mounted side-by-side. Makes a quality base and wiring is much easier with everything held in position.",

Computer programming requires exact attention to detail, unless you are programming in a great programming interface. The interface that this kit uses is primitive. That means that it is necessary to pay exacting attention to spelling, context, and spacing.",

To know you are actually using the temperature sensor, it is the one with bent outer legs, and there is only 1 of them in the kit. There are multiple transistors so make sure you pay attention and dig around through your parts.",
