Proofreading is one difficulty with this book. There is a second difficulty: explanations of strategies often employ complex vocabulary suitable for a teacher's manual but not suitable for high school level students. Clarity and simplicity are sacrificed. There are better books on the market.",

In math it doesn\u2019t explain the problems well..it doesn\u2019t show you how to solve them and they try to have you learn stuff you wouldn\u2019t need for the test. If you\u2019re trying to pass your GED test I would recommend for you to go to classes and take pre tests to see what you need to study on.",
