I have a toddler and it has already saved two outfits I though were goners. Once it was a white shirt covered in acrylic paint. Tide didn't touch the paint. Ran it through on cold with Persil - perfect! Next, the time that really sealed the deal, a shirt was covered in oil - and I do mean covered. One wash with Persil, the stain was completely gone. I tell you, I have found my detergent for life.",

I cleaned out our washer, thinking there was no way a detergent could cause these odors...same result after the next load. I tried adding extra pods to the wash which only made the smell worse.

There's been nothing different about the way I do laundry. After trying to reclean a couple of times, the only thing that worked was soaking the articles in very hot water to soften the glop and then brushing it off. Never had that happen with other products and these are 'supposed' to be among the best. Not sure whether I'll buy them again or not.",
