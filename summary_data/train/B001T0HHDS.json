It does not get hot enough on the low setting but burns clients on the medium setting. Also, the diffuser does not stay on at all... Very frustrating!",

The toggle switches are on the handle, where you hand naturally goes, so while it's easy to flip from high or low, it takes some getting used to not to turn if off accidentally. No big deal, though. Interesting note: a few days after I received and used my Babybliss, I had my regular appointment with my hair stylist. He has a similar,older model that he says he has had for several years. He says one of his favorite features is the weight. He says it's nice and light and easy for him to use all day.",

Granted, my old dryer was easily over 15 years old, so it did its job and technology has certainly improved in that time. I've used it for a couple of weeks now, no complaints. Due to its size, I'm not sure it would be great for travel, it is relatively light, however. At this point, I'd consider this product again.",

Heavier than my last drier but I'm not using it as long as this one dries so much better I haven't noticed that all that much. Great purchase.",

It is a a bigger investment but definitely seems better quality and performs much better than the cheaper ones I've owned in the past. It's high velocity setting really will dry even thick hair quickly. It comes with a director to place over the \"nose\" so you can concentrate the airflow in one area. It has a cool shot button and low, med, and high heat settings. It does seem to weigh more and be built far more solidly. Not only that, it is quieter than others I have used. Best dryer yet!",
