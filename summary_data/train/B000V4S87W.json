I don't feel comfortable carrying my expensive electronics in a bag with a completely open top. Nor would I care to see my papers, mail, or whatever falling onto the floor if the bag tipped over, so I returned it. It doesn't make much sense to label it a \"laptop\" bag. It's not a fashionable briefcase; it is a classy and sturdy tote.",

It's vertical orientation means I'm less likely to whack someone trying to squeeze by them in narrow spaces (e.g., airplane aisles!). I first bought this bag over six years ago. Just replaced it with the same model due to its sturdiness. Main reason for replacing the old one was that the handle-straps are finally starting to wear out. I sincerely hope Solo keeps this model forever. I'll probably need a few more of them before I finish my working lifespan! PS - I paid about $100 for this bag 6 years ago. Paid $114 for the replacement. GREAT VALUE!",

They do point out the metal feet on the bottom to protect the bag but not the nylon fabric - and it says leather body - so apparently the bottom of the bag isn't considered \"the body\".

It really should have two zippers so that it can open from just the top and not from the side. I'd like to be able to open a little at the top to reach in and grab something while walking. The way it is right now, it's inconvenient and I end up never using that pocket, which is unfortunate because I liked the pockets and it's one of the reasons I bought this one...",

The colours are great, lovely dark brown leather and vibrant blue lining. Delivery time was amazing, it was shipped from America to Australia within a week I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it.",

At times, I wish the bag had wheels due to the cumbersome feel and weight. As others stated, the bag is quite long, and I agree that the bag may be awkward and too long for some due to their height.",

Plenty of room and pockets for all the extras, and the bucket bottom with feet is very stable. It definitely is genuine leather, soft and supple. The style is feminine instead of boxy and all-business, yet makes a professional impression. Could double as a beautiful handbag on its own, in my view. I wouldn't change a thing.",
