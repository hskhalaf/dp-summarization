Other features that stood out to them were its fashion-forward design and relaxed fit. However, a handful of people griped about the large sizing and easily soaked sole. Overall, it was still considered an appropriate footgear for indoor workouts.",

      "title": "Comfortable well made shoes BUT......",
      "text": "Nice comfortable well made casual shoes, but for me fatally flawed. The wide tread picks up small stones very quickly. Shingle/gravel is a real nuisance. I have a shingle drive and try as I might I cannot get to my car without picking up stones in the tread, which then uncomfortably click-click-click when walking on any firm surface. The stones (maybe up to half a dozen per shoe) are easily prised out on return but I would NEVER buy these wide tread shoes again !",
