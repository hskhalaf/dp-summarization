My rims and tires are Tubeless Ready (TR), but it is very difficult to get tires to seal on the rims without tubes. For this reason, I am forced to use tubes, which are prone to pinch flats if not inflated with higher pressures on trails.. The higher pressure greatly reduces traction. Using these tubes and some tubeless sealant allows me to run lower pressures and avoid pinch flats while being able to more easily change tires for road and trails.",

My only complaint is that, as other reviewers have mentioned, the valve body unscrews easily. The solution to this is to simply tighten them further before using them, as they are not tightened well enough at the factory. This is really quite easy to do and not really a concern. So far, so good, but I'll update my review in a few months as appropriate.",

    "description": "Bicycle inner tubes with PRESTA Valve. Sunlite tubes are high quality tubes at an affordable price. These tubes work on all brands and genres of bicycles. Verify the size you require. Replacement inner tube for road, recumbent, triathalon, mountain, single speed fixies, cruiser or any bicycle tire with the same tire dimensions. Be sure to verify the size of inner tube, valve type and length. Remember to always add a little air (to give the tube form) to the new inner tube before installing. This will prevent it from bunching up and/or causing a pinch flat or possibly blowing the tire off the rim (when you immediately and fully inflate) which ultimately will pop the tube.",

      "Please check the side of your tire or on your old inner tube for the proper size, valve type and valve length.",
      "When changing your bicycle inner tube ALWAYS be sure to add just a little air to the tube before installing. This gives it form so it doesn't get twisted or bunch up which may cause a pinch flat. Once the new tube is installed and BEFORE fully inflating only add a few PSI to further form the tube. Inspect for an even bead of the tire to the rim on both sides.",
      "Then, inflate to approximately half the desired PSI and re-inspect the tire bead to the rim again. If even beading all the way around on both sides then inflate to the recommended air pressure. This procedure is important because if the bead doesn't hook properly on the rim then as the inner tube is inflated it can sneak out between the tire and rim and then BOOM!"
