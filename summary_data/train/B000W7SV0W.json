As everyone says, the packaging is a bit weird - you need to hold the plastic flap now and shake upside down to get the powder out, then use the brush to apply from there.

I bought this powder a while ago when i still was getting horrifying breakouts and I'm pretty sure it made it worse. Don't waste your money, you get what you pay for when it comes to powder foundation. i'll stick to the best powder foundation in the game, Mineral Hygenics",
