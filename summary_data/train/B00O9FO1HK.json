They sent us a replacement machine (hence the 1 star) and this time I de-scaled every 2 weeks. It lasted 3 months; same problem. I have emailed the company (because there was no 'contact us' link on the order or product page), and I'll update the review when I hear from them.",

The second problem is that after about seven months of use, the water does not empty out from the tank when I make a pot of coffee. zi need to restart the unit two or three times to completely empty it.

It keeps my coffee hot for at least 3 hours and unlike coffee makers using glass carafes and heating elements underneath, it will not \"scorch\" the coffee. Use filtered water from a Brita faucet or pitcher and there are products available to run through the machine 2 - 3 times a year to remove any mineral buildup on the heating element.",

I was getting dizzy doing research on coffee makers I finally decided on this and absolutely no regrets.

I pretty much brew the amount of coffee that I am going to be drinking /serving for an hour or so and then brew more if needed. The biggest difference I can cite is the flavor of the coffee which comes with this high-quality coffee maker. 9 Month Follow up: Still very pleased with this purchase. Bottom line makes a great cup of coffee.",

The carafe is thermal, and will keep coffee hot all morning, the poor spout thermos top works great, the product quality is between good and excellent. Someone put some thought into how to make a really good quality drip coffee maker, from the brew temperature of the water to the pouring, storing (thermos), and clean-up. I have a variety of other coffee makers - mocha/espresso pots, pour over, french press, etc., but I use this over 90% of the time due to the simplicity and quality of the coffee it makes.",

The carafe design is awful, You can not get all the water out - you must turn upside down and wipe around rim with paper towel. hat being said, the coffee is so good without spending $400 on a machine that we kept it and would order another because of the great taste. Cant they just redesign the carafe???",

Brews a full pot in about 6 minutes and stays hot for about 3 hours. No complaints. Simple is good.",

There is no slot to slide it into, like other brands, so I have to remove it and sit it somewhere and then pour the coffee. Otherwise, I make the most delicious, aromatic cups of coffee, which competes with the best baristas.",
