And there's no pockets or internal divisions of any kind, making it a nightmare to fish through if you carry stuff. Recommended if you only carry a few items in your bag, or if you don't mind providung your own organization through pouches, etc.",

I am impressed with this bag for the price (my coworker has a similar bag but more expensive and I think if we put them next to each other, it would be hard to pick which is which).",

The main reason that I rated this 4/5 stars is that when the black side is facing out, the seam of the back is pushed inward and it makes the bag a little smaller and a little awkward. Again, nothing terrible, and all in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase, especially for the price. I would recommend buying this product.",

Looks very professional, but I usually wrap a scarf around the handles for a little extra fun when I\u2019m going out. Large enough to hold all of my belongings, but I do not feel that it is too heavy. The little bag inside is great for small things like chapstick or feminine products. It connects to the inside as well so it is very easy to find. I recommend this bag to anyone looking for enough space, but not for someone who likes a bag with pockets. This bag does not have any pockets.",

I really wish there was a pocket or two on the inside, but since this bag is a reversible one there aren't any (not their fault, just something I failed to consider when buying a reversible bag) and my stuff gets all jumbled inside. All in all it's a decent bag though.",
