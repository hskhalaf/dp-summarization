This one seems very sturdy, with a 12 pound baby in it I had no concern she would slip through or flip over. The shade screen attaches easily and is removable which is nice. I do wish it provided a little more shade but I guess they were balancing shade versus open air ventilation with net sides . All in all I would definitely buy again, and well worth it! Highly rec for the very young. Don\u2019t waste your money on the blowup doughnut similar units.",
