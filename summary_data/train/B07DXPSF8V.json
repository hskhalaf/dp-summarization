Using the alternative it's perfectly dry and clean, this one leaves it still slightly wet with a little product on it it but can be wiped easily. To note, it's not a film left on (like the previous version), I think its more that it just doesn't dry as well as the leading chemical options. But it's like 95% there which is incredible since most of the green alternatives are usually healthy but have major performance issues. Highly recommend this.",

I love that these don\u2019t have harsh chemicals or residue so I don\u2019t worry about my kids eating off of their plates. It truly gets things clean too! We aren\u2019t the best about pre-washing but these still get things sparkly clean! Highly recommend.",

Melaleuca never got everything clean, there were always things that needed re-washed. Puracy gets it all! Love it!",

Just scrap the food and put your dishes in the washer, tear the pouch and let the powder to its magic. Clean (even after heavily stuck food and leaves no residue or smell). Absolutely happy. On to subscribe & save option now. Yeah! Packaging could be a bit more eco-friendly with maybe a plant based soluble wrap on individual pod.",
