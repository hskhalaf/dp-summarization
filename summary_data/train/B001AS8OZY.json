An old 10.5 seems to be the new 11. Anyway, for me the 11.5 2E from Ariat fits well.

So I would like them a little narrower, but those are not available. The solution is thicker socks...OK, but can be kind of warm. Still...I will keep buying them.",

It does have a design flaw if you are using it for hiking. It lacks a lugged sole. The lugged sole (for example Vibram) keeps small pebbles From acting like ball bearings between the sole and a hard surface.",

The shoe laces are the only thing that could be a little longer lasting. This shoe does not make you feel like you are wearing a brick on your foot.(Very light weight over a lot of other boots). I will buy another pair when these wear out!!!! One note, I am a guy that weighs a lot more than the average guy and loves these shoes!!!!",
