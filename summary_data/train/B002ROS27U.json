And very fast! It makes a little bit of noise but is hardly noticeable in my kitchen. My brother bought one that was rather expensive but this one was very reasonable and I couldn't be happier. It does require a water source but my husband, who is not a handyman, installed it in half a day.",

      "text": "Original review: At first I thought this was going to be a great ice maker. I purchased it in July and it is now the end of August and it has quit making ice. As I did not keep the original box, I am unable to return it. Money down the drain. Do not purchase! REVISED REVIEW - turns out it needed to be unplugged and defrosted. Make sure after defrosting that the arm is completely down. There was very little ice build up on the side of the unit, but enough that I guess it was time. We had been putting it through some extensive use for about a week completely emptying it about 3 times.",

There is no ice obstruction so that isn't the reason, it randomly fills throughout the day but it doesn't live up to what the manufacture says. I would purchase a product from a different make.",

It's a little noisy but no more than the refrigerator. I love that it keeps the ice frozen, unlike the counter top ones. We installed it under the counter due to the size and it is perfect. Stainless steel so matches all the other appliances.",

It's able to keep up to small gatherings, but if you're going to have a larger group, you have to stock pile a few bags ahead of time. Not a huge deal, given it's not commercial grade. Works well - would buy again (hopefully I don't have to any time soon!)",

Do yourself a favor and buy a braided stainless steel water line with 1/4 inch fittings on each side for less than $20 no matter the length. I've been getting good ice for over a month now. The machine Is quieter than my wine refrigerator, and the noise level is not an issue. Good luck.",

In order to get warranty service you need to ship it back to the manufacturer and pay the shipping. The cost of that is prohibitive. I purchased the extended warranty and that was useless. In short, we have a useless machine and wasted money. Stay away from this product and stay away from the manufacturer.",

Since it was online, I'll keep it and be frustrated.",
