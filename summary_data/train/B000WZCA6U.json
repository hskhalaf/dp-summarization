Also if you are already scary looking on Halloween you can apply this to your face to clean you up rather quickly. So I guess the gourmet amazon reviewer gives this 2 thumbs up! Also, it's not too greasy when applying. Might be a bit pricey but do you wanna look good or look like some scary Shaun of the Dead victim character?",
