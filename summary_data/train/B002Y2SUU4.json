I'm still able to do great wide-grip pull ups, but basic pull-ups can feel a little cramped. Overall, though, I'm very glad I bought this system and would buy it again without hesitation.",

He isn't quite big enough to use it for push-ups just yet, butvdoes for sit-ups. My husband also can use it without issue, but with caution. He is 6'2 about 225lbs and it does get wobbly on him. Overall, awesome product! 5-stars for kids but 4-stars for larger adults based on stability.",

      "text": "I am a Personal Trainer and wanted to have something at Home to augment working out that does Not involve driving back to the Gym on my days off. After the hellacious New England winter of last year, I decided to buy this and have been using it for about 4 weeks now. I am 5 `10 and a solid 182 and do every single exercise, including adding weights to my body for pull ups and dips.....and it is stable and confidence building. By doing some Fitness Work at home, this Reinforces the most important aspect of all......the Fitness Habit. Keep it visible and not hidden away and you will actually Use it.",

Also I really like the dip handles and the full range of motion pushup handles (allows deeper push-up). In addition the push-up handles will be easier on those with painful wrists. Another benefit is the little step allows you to jump into the up position for negative pull-ups and chin-ups if you are too tired or weak to complete them from the down position.",
