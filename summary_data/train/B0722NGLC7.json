      "text": "Really rather disappointed with this. The speaker faces upward, surrounding the mics of the Echo Dot and interfering with its ability to recognize voice commands. The clock on the front, while handsome, is entirely separate from the Dot, and requires manual timesetting. This is basically a poorly-thought through speaker cradle for the Dot that happens to have a completely unrelated digital clock on the front face. The sound quality is quite good, but once it starts playing, the mics can't pick up voice commands, as the speaker's output is directly between you and the Dot's mics. Very disappointed.",

My wife and I use our docks music feature every night to fall asleep to hard rain, wind, thunderstorms, ocean waves whatever sound you like . The next model should have the speakers on the front or sides of the dock and not on top. This makes it hard to communicate with the dot when music is playing. That's why I give 3 stars and not 4 stars",

I think a better price for this would have been in the mid to low $30s; I Paid $49. It serves it's purpose but does not provide the sound the description claims.",
