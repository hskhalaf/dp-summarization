      "text": "I loved this product because I have been making boiled eggs often and I literally can\u2019t stand taking off the shells. The egglett holders stand upright and the holder for all the eggs fits into a holder so that you can remove them all from the water at the same time. The holder isn\u2019t super large so you don\u2019t need a super huge pot to hold them in but larger than a regular sized pot. You can also put them in without the holder. Great product and totally worth the cost",
