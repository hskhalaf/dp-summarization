So helpful! -swabs and microfiber cloth come in sealed packages, and very clean. -there are good instructions on how to clean -cleaning fluid worked well, evaporated off leaving clean surface -case to put it all in is sturdy, ready for next time I need to clean -Rocket air bulb looks like a rocket, high quality, with the right amount of air burst. Disliked: -loupe's (2) cr2032 batteries were dead. (With new batteries, loupe worked great.) -had to clean the lens of the loupe with the kit before I could clean anything else.",

All my pictures had little dark spots. The spots were in the same position on each picture. The Movo kit allows me to clean the sensor seal with the swabs. The magnifier loupe helps me to see if the sensor is clean. I can then use the brushes to remove dust or stains left and repeat the process until the loupe shows me the sensor is clean.",

That was refreshingly honest, not the usual \"use our product obsessively\" approach. Secondly, the kit itself is well-constructed, well-organized, and makes it easy to select and properly use which tool is needed for the steps outlined in the cleaning process. Thirdly, the price is right. I am by no means a professional photographer and to be honest don't have much desire to become one, but I am thoroughly enjoying my Canon EOS Rebel T6/1300D dSLR and want to make sure I give it the care it deserves. Your cleaning kit will enable me to do just that. Thank you!",

I've shied away from attempting to do more than wife off lenses in the past because of fear of damaging the sensor. However, after a bit of reading, I purchased the Movo Deluxe...kit, and in 30 minutes had watched a good, brief Canon video walking me through the cleaning process and completed the process and tested it. I am delighted and plan to use the kit on another Canon camera. This is very easy and I'm sure I'll improve as I go forward. But for now, this is a homerun!",

Pics attached (taken with phone) are in order from very first opening upon delivery of product 4.19.19. After watching several instructional videos on YouTube, I was successful in cleaning and spots are completely gone.
