I actually returned two of these thinking the first time it was just defective since the paint was chipped before we even opened the packaging but unfortunately the second set had the same problem. My toddler was actually interested in the chipping paint and was trying to scratch at the missing spots and making it worse. I hate plastic toys but it looks like that might be the safest option. I don't recommend this set at all.",

Paint chips and toddlers don't mix. He is already too attached to the rest of the pieces so returning it is not an option, but sadly I had to take away the milk. I would have contacted the seller but that option is not available.",

My son has been playing with these foods for about 2 months now and they are doing very well holding up with an 18 month old. There are some spots on the edges where the paint has come off a little but besides that we haven\u2019t had any problems. I would definitely recommend these",

It's ok, but I expected more for the price, and my toddler doesn't even recognize half the items as the food they're supposed to be.",

I think I may throw them out, last night I stepped on one and it broke. Not a design flaw, I'm a big dude, just hurt a bit and made a sharp object.

I can teach her not to do this, but even dropping some of the heavier items on a ceramic tile floor (my kitchen) could possibly cause tiles to have hairline cracks. Otherwise, it's a generous and colorful assortment. Also did not realize the 4 boxes are wood as well. Did not have a use for them in her current play--1 or more large plastic jars with lids or her FP shoppind cart are better for storage. Love the quality of Melissa&Doug toys.",

So I worry if he puts it in his mouth at all it can/will easily splinter. Otherwise, excellent product, but I totally think they need to do something about the toast.",
