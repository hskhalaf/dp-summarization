They were comfortable, but I could hear everything well--All the dialogue, etc. On the pro side, I was not wincing and covering my ears. I wondered...are they working? During the final credits I removed them. OMG--suddenly too loud! So yes they work. Have recommended to friends.",

For anyone who is just starting to get into the concert/rave scene and aren't sure if they want to invest in an expensive pair of earplugs, these will do the trick. The little pouch that they come with is amazingly handy as well. That being said, I have since moved onto a more expensive pair of earplugs, which do filter out sounds while letting more music in better than these. However, for the price increase, these are still the best bang for the buck.",

    "description": "Color:BlackHearing protection that filters the noise, not the experience.\n\nSet contains 1 carrying case, and 2 pairs of ear plugs (1 short stem, 1 long stem). The filters are interchangeable and fit snugly into either the short stem, or long stem ear plug. The filters offer an average volume reduction of 19 decibels (Clear Filter), or 25 decibels (White Filter). \n\nRave Ear Plugs were specifically designed for those who want to enjoy an experience while protecting their hearing. The soft 3 layer design has a small filter that reduces noise 19db (Clear Filter), or 25db (White Filter). The Ear Plug design is comfortable, light weight, and easy to wear for extended periods. The short stub design keeps the ear plugs out of sight, and the soft silicone material keeps them out of mind. \n\nProtect your ear plugs with the black case that can slip in your pocket or hook on your key ring, etc. Protect your hearing by reducing sound, not clarity. With a precision filter, damaging noise is reduced but speech and sound remain clear. Foam ear plugs are notorious for muffling speech and sound; however you won't have that problem while wearing Rave Ear Plugs. \n\nNoise reducing ear plugs can help protect your hearing for a lifetime. They can and are recommended to be used for any of the following applications: Concerts, Festivals, Musicians, Band Practice, Theater, Events, etc. \n\nYou no longer have to compromise quality for safety. Hear the world for a lifetime! Add Rave Ear Plugs to your cart now so you don't have to add hearing aids later.",
