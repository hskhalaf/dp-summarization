      "text": "I researched breathalyzers thoroughly and decided on this AlcoMate Prestige based on the fact that it's self-calibrating and quite accurate. However, the product is not exactly as pictured by Amazon. The picture of the product as sold by Amazon shows a silver breathalyzer, a few mouthpieces, a small pouch, and a larger carrying case. The product as delivered did NOT include the larger carrying case. Note that the same product without the larger carrying case (i.e. as I received it) is available from other sellers on Amazon for $20 less than the Amazon prices.",

The best part about that is you don't have to mail your unit away and risk losing it or being without it for a few weeks. The ONLY negative thing I can about my order was the large black case which is shown in the picture DOES NOT come with this breathalyzer. It's not a big deal, but the way it's pictured it should be part of the package.",

I'm going back to buying my original unit a Bac track which Car & Driver rated as the top one and much, much cheaper.

All my tests have been really accurate for me, as long as I wait 20 minutes after drinking, like it says in the manual. I don't know about comparing it to police breathalyzers either, I think they cost ten times as much.",

Readings vary considerably from test to test, and a level of 0.000 has been returned more than once after a drink or two, so I have little confidence in its accuracy. Not only that, but it's fashioned from flimsy plastic which doesn't hold itself together well enough for the battery cover to stay on by itself. The \"CE\" logo looks fake, and the whole item feels very cheaply made indeed. Could be I just got unlucky. Either way, a waste of a hundred bucks.",
