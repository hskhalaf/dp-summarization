The screw is tightened sufficiently and it is locked in place, but with about 20 lbs of force i can push the seat down. Makes it VERY uncomfortable to ride.",

It did not take a short and easy time to assembled, like the 90% was meant to lead you to believe, it took considerably longer. Also, the reflector was partially broke when I opened the package.",

They took care of this error that i made free of charge. Great Job Huffy!",

All of the features in the description matched with what I received. Its an attractive bike. I had another similar cruiser in he $185 range from another manufacturer that was not as good.",
