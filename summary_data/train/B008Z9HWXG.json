NOTE: the Matte Grey/Green is a Matte grey HELMET with a Green chinstrap.

I do remember the impact of my head on the ground and thinking to myself \"Well, this is going to be bad\". My helmet is ruined (the inner foam liner is very broken) but I am not.

Also, many other helmets have big size adjustment knobs at the back of the head, which seem to me to be a hazard in a fall where I might hit the back of my head. I bought this helmet for ice skating, a sport where most adults do not wear helmets, greatly underestimating the danger of serious brain injury from an unexpected fall. Being dull black, I love the looks, and that it stands out less than other colors. Also excellent for cycling in cooler weather.",

I'm not saying that the hehmet won't work, I just don't like it for those reasons . I will go back into a bicycle store that sells Bell , find the type that I like , and try again on Amazon for that model.",

This LARGE size BELL SEGMENT helmet is perfect! The fit is ideal for my 23.5\" head measurement. I very much like the design with the segmented inner foam and somewhat more supple outer shell which does conform more freely to my head. This helmet also includes some removable padded inserts of several thicknesses which further allow the user to adjust the fit. This makes a lot of sense and I'm happy I made the switch.",

Despite what looks like a rigid bowl-style shell, the Segment is actually flexible. Utilizing a series of interior EPS foam segments connected by a reinforcing skeleton, the helmet conforms to your head, fitting much more like a cap than a helmet, all while still meeting safety standards - including the ASTM F2031 BMX enhancement.
