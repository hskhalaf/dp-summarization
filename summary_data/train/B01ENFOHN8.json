It is of no use to me now. I recommend that you invest in a higher-quality product than this unit. It was a waste of money.",

My only complaint is that the happy face that Apera uses to indicate when the pH test is successfully completed, is very tiny.

      "text": "If you have a need for a pH meter that warrants spending as much as this thing costs, spend a little bit extra and get one with replaceable probes. I followed the storage and maintenance instructions to the letter and after about 100 uses the probe just gives \"Err1\" code when trying to calibrate. I opened a brand new bottle of calibration solution just to see if that was the issue; nope. This thing works well when it does work, but the probe wears out so fast it doesn't make any financial sense to buy this model.",

Second time was a little wonky, with my tap water ranging anywhere from 3.0-7.0. Needed an accurate reading the third time and was coming up with numbers in my tap water of 2.0, which is far more acidic than hydrochloric acid. So i boiled more water, let it cool, and re-calibrated with the 7.0/4.0 solutions, and first read of tap water was 1.7 and dropping. My finger would fall off at that level. Getting my money back today (hopefully).",

I usually calibrate once every 2 weeks, but it's never off by much. If you're purchasing this pH pen, I recommend buying Apera storage solution as it doesn't come with it and it'll help extend the life of the pen.

Cons: Only two calibration liquids you'll need to buy the third to have full pH range. Sometimes readings fluctuate but I think that is just a matter of how the probe actually operates so its not really a con.

I think that the manufacturer doesn't give detailed enough instructions on proper probe maintenance and storage. I always rinse the probe with Distilled water after use and store in 3M KCl solution. I have a feeling that many of the complaints in the reviews could be avoided if the manufacturer was more specific about the probe storage.",
