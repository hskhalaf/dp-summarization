      "text": "I've been a guitarist for 15 years and needed a cheap bass to do some recording. I picked this one up and was surprised by just how nice it was. This looks, feels, and plays like a bass quadruple the price. The headstock logo doesn't have the Fender prestige but the sound and playability is excellent and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference in a blind test. The neck is satin instead of lacquered which makes it much easier to move up and down the neck and it doesn't get sticky. This bass is a total steal. It was set up great out of the box. I couldn't recommend this more.",

After a little research the Squier Jazz Bass seemed to fit the bill. Wow! I can't believe that Squier can produce such a fine instrument for such a reasonable price. This is way more than a beginners bass. Many of my bass player friends use these basses at gigs when they don't want to risk loss or damage of their big dollar rigs. Well done Squier, well done Amazon!",

I needed a bass for school since covid wouldnt allow me to practice on the faculty's bass and I was decided to go with this beautiful jazz bass in silver. My dad loves it, I love the more earthy sound of a jazz bass compared to the stingier p-bass. Came with just a teeny bit of the protective plastic on the pickguard messed up but its ok, its not visible from more than a foot or two away. Love how this bass sounds and feels, I'm so excited to learn more and be like my dad \ud83d\ude0a\u2764",

The bass is really good for bending, harmonics, and the frets are a nice length. Definitely a nice, long, neck",
