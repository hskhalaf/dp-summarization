That's a long time now that everything's connected to the internet. I should have read the bad reviews before I bought it.",

When I had my rental modem, it always kept at 300+ in speed. I did notice that I lost some of the speed and holds at about 150+ through 250+. I expected a little loss as far as speed. Tested with: Speedtest.net Overall it does work fairly well for my needs. I probably will suggest the Net gear cm1000 model though just because their rating of speed is higher.. I am happy so far with performance and hope that as upgrades come available I will regain some of the speed loss.",

My complaint is that the built-in stand is weak, much too lightweight, and utterly flimsy. Once you attach the coaxial cable, the modem will move wherever the cable wants it. My modem is doing a permanent wheelie due to the weight of the coax cable. Also, you can't reorient it to lay flat. Very little thought went into the physical design of this thing.",
