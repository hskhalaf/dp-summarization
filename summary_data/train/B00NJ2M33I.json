You have to constantly put pressure on the connector plug to get any sound at all. I guess I'll move on to another manufacturer test my luck there.",

The vinyl coating over the ear covers has worn off on both sides and the covering flakes off onto you when you wear them. I guess it might have been affected by how I must put them on and off.

I haven't had time to check and see if the impedance matched the output of the computer equipment. However, the ear pads did fit one of the old sets nicely. So, I replaced them. Trouble is, I have a useless set of headphones in my collection now. Guess I'll save it for spare parts. Not enough expense to deal with this anymore.",

      "text": "I had high hopes that these would deliver a decent listening experience for the budget. Given I usually use $9 earbuds, I figured these would be about the same in quality. FALSE. Plugged them in and tried them out -- right away I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear anything, and there was static and pulsing in my music and podcasts. Plugged in my old headset and experienced nothing of the sort. These headphones are garbage. I am returning them immediately. Save the time and DON'T BUY.",

Still have a pair of ZX-100s that I've been using for years and they continue to work perfectly; although the material that covers the padding is beginning to flake off onto my ears. That's why I got the ZX-110s which, basically, are the same thing. Highly recommend these headphones.",

However, the frequency response is definitely biased toward the lower end, so you'll need to adjust your EQ to bring up the higher end, starting with where the vocals live. Therefore, I would not recommend these for cheap accurate music listening (panasonic and koss have better offerings under $20), but for something really comfortable to wear while watching youtube videos or playing video games, these are great.",
