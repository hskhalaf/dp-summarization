Granted I was able to get the rust out using the provided cleaning directions... It will work, and it will rust. You just have to be committed;) And really into seasoning (first seasoning you have to do 3-4 times!)",

The ridges hold food up on the sides well. I'm using an induction heater and it heats very quickly. The heat drops off quickly going up the sides. I can't get this wok to take a seasoning on the sides, but the bottom is at least fairly well seasoned. It looks like that's because the induction stove doesn't heat up the sides enough. It rusts quickly on the inside where it's unseasoned, so I have to oil it after almost every use. The outside doesn't rust.",
