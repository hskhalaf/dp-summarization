Mix your adult beverages like a professional! High quality material and arrived in perfect condition. Reasonably priced as well.",

After having used it for this type of purpose, I can honestly report that the device works very well, indeed! I was able to mash things up without having to resort to using a blender for small quantities. It's easy to clean and saves me a lot of time and work. Based on this, I would presume it to work very well as a drink muddler. It's elegant and sits in the hand comfortably. I am completely satisfied with the Barvivos performance and am happy that I bought it.",

Muddles perfectly to get that extra fresh flavor in your drinks. If you don't know what a muddler does it basically is like taking a maraschino cherry and cutting it into many little pieces, releasing more flavor in the process. Cleans very easily and looks very attractive next to my other barware. Also great for starting conversations when people ask what you are doing when making the a tasty Old Fashioned.",
