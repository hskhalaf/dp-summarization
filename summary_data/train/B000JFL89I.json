I figured it was user error. The barrel manufacturer sent a new wrench. On a tip, before attempting to try it again, I mounted a craftsman 1/2 in wrench in a vice, set the torque to 25lb, and the 1/2\" wrench broke before the torque wrench ever clicked. Due to the delay in getting the new barrel wrench, I'm one day past Amazon's return policy, so I'm now blessed with an over priced breaker bar.",

Well I find this wrench to be great, with easy adjustments and with the 25\" long handle it's great for torquing wheels on your car.. It even comes with a plastic case. It works great for me and I would buy another one even for a gift for a friend. I recommend it to all who use this kind of tool..",

This Mountain brand wrench (made in China) illustrates the case that, as with most tools, you tend to get what you pay for. This torque wrench looks fine (decent quality), is quite hefty, comes with a slip certifying it is within spec., and seems to work well. However, the scale is quite hard for me to read, especially in shade, and the steel and tooling appears less than first rate. Overall, a decent deal for the money you pay for this.",

      "text": "This seems to be a good quality wrench; it hasn't broken yet with just about weekly use. The thing that I don't like about it is the locking mechanism for the torque setting. It is a knurled nut on the end, which sometimes comes loose during use which will affect torque settings. That's the reason for the three-star rating, since obviously a precise setting is important when tightening crucial parts.",

Only compaint I have is that its hard to read the dial when setting the wrench.",
