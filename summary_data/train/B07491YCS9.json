Most of all, there isn't one dish in two weeks that I haven't enjoyed--if an ingredient (e.g. fennel) isn't what I like, I just pick another meal. This is a life-changing \"how to\" book!",

I thoroughly enjoy cooking, and I am trying to adhere to a more Mediterranean diet, but I don't want to be on a \"diet\" which is exactly what this cookbook is. Mediterranean fare is already light, and this cookbook manages to take all the flavor out of everything. Amazon no longer allows free returns so this one will go in the donation bin.",
