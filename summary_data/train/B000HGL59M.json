My only beef is with the instructions. So far for the box joints instructions the guide recommended using a 3/4\u201d template guide but this should have been 5/8\u201d - so definitely make sure you do some dry runs on some sacrificial work pieces before unleashing on your prime lumber.",

As many reviewers have stated, it would be nice if there was an easier way to ensure both sides are aligned exactly but it is just a nice to have. The instructions could be a little better but there are plenty of videos on the Internet that will help you out. I definitely recommend this specific one because it comes with everything so you won't be needing to upgrade to get the miniature template.",

One word of caution, the template guides will not fit on your router if you don't have the right sub-base.

This is caused by the offset not being correct. Unfortunately there is no way to adjust this without making modifications to the jig because the offset is created by a solid piece of steel that has no adjustment. The dovetail still fits tight and looks great but having to spend time fixing this 1/8\" error every piece is kind of annoying so I am removing 1 star for this.",

Get the advanced manual (dowloadable from the PC website) and learn how to make this thing do so much more. The only minor issue is that the knurled brass nuts on the template lock down are very easily turned by mistake when flipping the guide for through dovetails. I'm planning to put some nylon on the threads to prevent them from accidentally turning. The manual says you can also put an extra nut in there to lock them down, but that makes it more difficult to change the setup.",

      "text": "This is a great product. My only concern and complaint is that the depth gauge for cutting box joints is not practical. Yes it's a good selling point but that gauge doesn't work when you are trying to do through box/finger joints. The best thing is to change the depth of the gauge to whatever your thickness of stock is going to be (add a little more depth so you ensure the depth is a little more than stock so you can sand it down flush).",

Using straight wood it works very well.",
