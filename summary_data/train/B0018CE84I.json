      "text": "Cannot say enough how great this product is. Our cocker spaniel doesn't love when we put them in, but tolerates them well so doesn't seem to sting (just makes him confused and shake his head for a sec). It has helped his streaming eyes so much. He used to have contact green gunk in his eyes before we started using this. Now it's only on occasion, and the gunk is lighter in color. I don't know the medical term, but looks cleaner haha. His eyes don't produce it as much in general, and his eyes look less red and irritated. Love it. So great!",

I highly recommend this eye rinse and will definitely continue purchasing this product in the future. Thank you!",

It's definitely good for flushing out the dog's eye, basically the same way we use eye drops (to keep our eyes clean and hydrated). But I doubt I'll continue to keep myself stocked. You don't get much for $8 a bottle. $2/oz in a 4 oz. bottle of saline solution? Glad I bought it when they were cheaper but when I run out I'll probably make my own or just use warm filtered water to wipe away debris from dog's eye.",

My dog also seems to itch his eyes a lot less now too. I have been using it for a few months now and am running a little dry so I will most definitely be buying from here again.",
