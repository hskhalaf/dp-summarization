When you roll the device over the dough it wobbles from side to side because the tolerances between the wheel and the pin that holds it in place are so poor. It is not professional quality as advertised. The grip handle is only 3 1/2 inches long and less than 1 inch wide. It\u2019s difficult to hold. The wheel is about 1 3/8 inch diameter and is difficult to roll through the dough. Just don\u2019t buy it!",

If you really want sharp, crisp edges without any bit of dough that didn't cut through all the way/getting stuck and then you having to run the blade back over it/tearing it, then you should probably buy the 49 dollar dual sided brass one made in Italy. BUT, for the price this one will get the job done albeit a bit slower and not as clean or professional looking.",

The black plastic handle is comfortable to grip. Additionally, the hole at the end of the handle was an important feature because I hang the majority of my kitchen tools from the hooks on a magnetic knife strip. I'm assuming if this is washed quickly and well maintained, it should last you a while.",
