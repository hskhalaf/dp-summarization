It is spacious inside and has convenient shelves, drawers and door compartments. It came dent free, which was a bonus! We have it in our garage, on a sturdy bench table. The only thing I notice is that the side feels warm to the touch, maybe it's because the garage is hot at times while it is summer time. But I would recommend this fridge!",
