Unfortunately, they were also very uncomfortable to wear, even within just the first hour. (And I'm someone that practically lives in high heels) I ordered a size 7.5, and they were a little wide, but not enough to be a problem.

I saw one young lady had issues with how the back of the shoe rubbed sores into her ankles/lower part of her legs...well I have thicker legs/ankles and I've had this problem B4 with certain shoes. The shoes are absolutely gorgeous, the heel is a little high for me...but YES the shoes rubbed/dug into my ankles/legs. Didn't wear them out and about...so I'll be returning. Again beautiful shoe esp the floral one!!! There's a nice little cushion made into the shoe 2. Skinny ankles enjoy \ud83d\ude09",

I don't want to have to wrap my ankle in order to wear these, so I'm going to donate them rather than spend the time to break them in. I'm not sure they can be broken in. I recommend saving up for a more comfortable pair.",

After wearing them for a few hours they started to hurt the sides of my feet but that is only because my feet are so wide. They are obviously not top quality or material but I was not expecting them to be for such an inexpensive price. Regardless I will probably buy at least 2 more colors!",
