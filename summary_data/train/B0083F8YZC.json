Those fuses blow quickly, so I replaced it with a 10 amp fuse with much better results. The cigarette lighter plug sometimes will wear out from excessive heat generated from the current draw. I am on my fourth cooler now. I typically retire them after a year or two of extremely heavy use. They are rugged, and tolerate a lot of bumps, scrapes, and drops. Additionally, I use an insulated bag inside the cooler in order to keep frozen items cold for much longer periods of time.",

They are 10x better and more efficient than this (use less energy, protect your battery and get down to -4 degrees). This Coleman uses 5amp continuously and never turns off. In northern VT it averaged about 50 degrees. Drinks felt warm on not too hot days even. Returned. Wanted to warn others because the reviews fooled me.

The cons, the fan is loud, so when it is on the seat behind you for 800 miles it begins to get annoying. This unit does not come with a wall plug converter which means when you shut your car off it stops cooling and you have no way to plug it in your hotel I recommend getting a converter so it can be taken in when stop and turn up the radio to drown out the fan!",
