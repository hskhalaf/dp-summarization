It is raised off of the ground enough to make it feel like a real bed. The air pump works well and the bed didn't need to be topped off with air often. The only feature I wasn't impressed with was the \"pillow top\" which didn't offer any extra comfort. It did however keep the sheet from sliding around too much. A standard queen fitted sheet worked well. Overall a good purchase.",

A little bulky for traveling so this will primarily be used as an occasional guest bed and it is perfect for that.",

When fully inflated, it's very firm, but still soft on top with the pad. I did take this on an extended camping trip, which was a mistake for a few reasons. The height means there is not much vertical space in dome tents (even large ones). I purchased a camping battery that had an outlet that can handle 100W peak, but the pump drew too much power. Another power source was needed to get it inflated. I'd like to see a reduced power (and slower) mode for outdoor or off grid use.",

    "title": "Coleman SupportRest Elite Double-High Airbed with Quilted Top, Queen",
    "description": "Give your guests a luxurious, restful night of sleep with the Coleman SupportRest Elite Quilted Top Double-High Airbed. This air mattress has a removable, washable quilted top that is as soft and comfortable as a traditional bed. Equipped with a built-in SwiftRise pump, it rapidly inflates in under three minutes. Once the mattress is inflated, the AirTight system and Double Lock valve work to prevent leaks and maintain the desired level of firmness. With its Support Lock reinforced construction, this inflatable bed helps provide a more stable sleeping surface to promote all-night comfort. Its double-high height makes getting into and out of the bed easier. When you're ready to pack up, you can use the pump to deflate your air mattress completely for easier packing. An included carry bag makes storage and transport simple.",
