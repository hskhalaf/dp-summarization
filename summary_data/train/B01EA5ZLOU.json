      "text": "I have owned this hand held blender for just under a year. Originally, I loved it! I use a hand held blender quite often to blend drinks, soups, etc... About 2 months ago, however, I began having trouble with the unlock feature. Somehow the bottom attachment was not clicking into the top piece properly and I had to detatch and re-attach a few times to get the green light to go on - which is the only way you can use the blender. At this point it takes me about 5 minutes of detaching and re-attaching to get it to work and sometimes it does not work at all. I do not recommend this product only for this reason.",

She used every attachment! Moderate to light tasks.. but she did use it frequently. With all this heavy duty motor and the Braun brand to stand behind it... I expected better. The point of failure was the little plastic piece that holds the attachments so that the active piece in it spins, powered by the motor. Sad!",

We haven't used all the attachments so far, but what we have used or experimented with has been great. The attachments aren't the easiest to clean, and I do worry if the attaching end soaks in water that they may become unusable, but the build quality is good enough that they have held up so far and come clean after a quick soak of the ends.",
