Yes, my skin and care looked nice, but I would rather spend the money for something of equal or better quality. It\u2019s a nice pillowcase, but I later ordered a set of 2 satin pillowcases for $10 and I\u2019ve been far happier. I would suggest going that route instead.",

I haven't woken up with wrinkles on my face (that take hours to go away due to my age) since I started using silk. I had a 19mm silk case before but elected to go with the 25mm as it's supposed to hold up better, last longer, and be more luxurious which I concur. It's much heavier than the 19mmas it's supposed to be. I wasn't sure if it wold be that noticeable but it is. I was originally reluctant to spend this much money but after having slept on it for a while now, I feel it was money well spent.",

It\u2019s nice, a bit oversized and the quality seems fine, I\u2019ve only had it for a month so no issues. I wish it had a hidden zipper instead of the flap because it moves around and isn\u2019t as fitting as I\u2019d like.",

It's pretty and nice fabric but save your money if you wanted it to keep you hair nice or you want a pillow case that stays cool. It doesn't deliver",

I washed and traveled with it several times already and the seams didn't come apart yet so I'd say the durability is there.",
