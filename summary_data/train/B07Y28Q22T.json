For music they perform really well and provide separate highs, mids and lows and a punchy bass, the bass isn't overly pronounced but is very present.

They stay on the ear pretty good without falling out but has inconsistent seals. Bass would drop as you lean forward and back. Comfort is decent. After a few hours, those fins do bite into your ear.

The little wings on the side also keep them much more firmly in place than the airpod pros.

The case is small which is another plus. In terms of sound, I'm very pleased. I've owned multiple true wireless earbuds (Jabra, Samsung, Sony) and these sound the best imo. Highs and lows are not overly pronounced in the sound signature, which I prefer because all genres sound consistent and balanced. Overall, the build quality is premium, they sound great, and these are now my new daily earbuds. Good buy.",
