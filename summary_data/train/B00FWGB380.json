      "text": "I needed the impact driver and saw both fir a porch rebuild. (I had the same saq earlier) but my my brother used it making a 45 degree cut in a 2x12 and burned up rhe motor. The package deal sounded good fir the price but the new saw started smoking after 3 minutes of cutting through about 6 feet of 1x6 floor boards - nothing heavy duty at all. I havent really tried the driver yet. I was greatly disappointed as I own many black and decker tools and the others have performed well. I enjoy being able to share batteries between tools, but do not enjoy motors that burn up so easily.",

I have yet to use the Circular Saw, however the Max Drill/Driver has helped me in my bathroom renovation (mixing mortar and screwing down concrete backer board for tile). Although, in truth, the jobs have not been small by nature which could contribute to the battery life being less than exceptional, the lighter tasks around the house that required a drill went quickly. Very light weight and easily maneuvered. I wouldn't rush to purchase this again, but it served its purpose. Remember, back up battery!",

The saw is compact, light weight, and will cut through a 2\"x4\" with ease. It also has marked guides on the blade cover so I can set the depth of the blade correctly. Well worth it to me, and under $100 for the set, and a nice zippered bag, and charger.",

It's the best drill in their shop as of now. The saw is equally compact and powerful. My boyfriend is a woodworker, and both he and his father are very handy. They are always building furniture, and fixing this that and the other. Their stamp of approval is all I need to know this was a great buy.",

I haven't tried it for much more. The driver has plenty of power and the built in light is an added bonus. I'm very happy with the way these tools have performed.

Can't comment on battery life yet, but still going strong after about a dozen cuts. Got a clean right angle when using with a Kreg square cut, cross cutting a 1x12. Much easier than dragging out the AC powered saw for light jobs. Drill works fine also. I expect to be using them both frequently. Great value for the price.",
