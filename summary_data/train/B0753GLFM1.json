Yes they did keep my feet dry all day BUT they have very little support on the balls of your feet but plenty in the heels. I was also shocked they aren't slip resistant either. I was going to give 3 stars but no lie they're very stylish for boots that actually keep your feet dry.",

The lining is super soft, the fit and soles are comfy, and its great to have a winter boot that can work for many occasions! You can\u2019t go wrong with buying this!",

They're cute and not to heavy or get too hot when the weather is warmer. They feel like good quality shoes. I will suggest buying crew socks to wear with them though. I don't like them rubbing my ankle so crews were a must.",
