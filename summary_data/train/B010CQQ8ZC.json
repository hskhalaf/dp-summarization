I don't think I can wear even thin socks with them. I wear a size 5 and normally, it fits perfectly in 99% of the shoes I buy. This one is just a little tight, not sure it's even a half size smaller than normal. It might stretch out over time.",

I got a half size bigger to wear with thicker socks. A classic for me. I was glad to find them.",

So in the 1890s, Joseph William Foster made some of the first known running shoes with spikes in them. By 1895, he was in business making shoes by hand for top runners; and before long his fledgling company, J.W. Foster and Sons, developed an international clientele of distinguished athletes.",
