Also this rack isn't very universal. I hung my grandfathers model 37 windchester, and the hooks are so big it just flops over making it look like a joke. Don't waste you're money on this. I thought that since it was made in the USA it may be of better quality... But no, China's the way to go apparently.",

They would probably complain winning the Lotto because they had to drive to pick up the cash! Lol. These Hooks are great. Took me less than 10 minutes to install. Depending on the weight of your Firearm, I recommend picking up 4 \"screw-in\" type drywall anchors. They are rated @ 35 lbs. each and then use the 4 screws included in the hardware kit. The rubber padding is great and is not coming off and I couldn't care less that the screw holes are not beveled and recessed. You can't go wrong with these. Great value and as always, fast Amazon shipping.",

After seeing them first hand I think they are more suitable for hanging an extension cord or garden tools in a shed or garage. Decided to use a rubber quick fist product to mount the rifle. If you are mounting a rifle decoratively in a house or something they may work great. I wouldn't recommend them for a vehicle application.",
