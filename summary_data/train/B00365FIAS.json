      "text": "This grill/smoker is marketed for doing either function well, but in practice does neither one effectively....It cannot maintain teperatures less than 210F (too hot for smoking), what smoke is produced is is directed AWAY from the meat and out the vents, and there is very little charring (no direct flame) in grill mode. Bottom line, I can do everything this unit does in my gas oven in the kitchen... so why even bother?",

Great for grilling steaks, pork tenderloins, any kind of chicken, especially burgers , bratwurst and kielbasa. Have never used as a smoker , have three other smokers for that. If you like to grill , perfect , heats up in a flash and does not use a lot of fuel. Cooks food in a jiffy.",

You need the accessory pack for hanging drumsticks and ribs, and for kabobs. But get an injector, shoot a chicken or a turkey full of your favorite stuff, and cook it as slowly as possible for a few hours. It's perfect. Even the wood chip holder is great. I thought it was going to be too small, but it's perfect. And the drippings get caught in the grease trap instead of your midsection. And what's better than cooking outdoors when it's 100 degrees.........",

The install was quite easy and intuitive, you don't need much mechanical background to assemble this unit. I ordered the accessory kit as well as the cover, and they all were delivered promptly. With the accessory kit you will find your options for cooking different foods are endless. I have noticed that after close to five hours of use, this unit does not consume much propane. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the meat cooked from the Big Easy is very tender and the clean up process is super easy. Just follow the seasoning directions and you will be roasting in no time.",

I can't say enough good things about it. The only negative I can probably come up with is that the temperature is always a little high for smoking (250-300F) but with an internal thermometer we've never had overcooked food, and it's always juicy. 10/10 - would definitely buy again.",

Just put the meat in the basket and turn it on and walk away until your thermometer alarm sounds. Best tasting roasted chicken ever!",

      "text": "Versatile. Cooking is quick, easy and convenient. Assembly was easy considering the instructions are completely illustrated. Took about an hour at a leisure pace to assemble. Cook times are really fast - takes getting used to. NOTE: Top of the cooker cooks faster than the rest, so keep that in mind. Smoker works great as well. I have a full size Char-Broil charcoal smoker and a Weber kettle. Probably won't even use them unless I just need shear capacity. I'm from the North originally and Charcoal is the only \"accepted\" method of cooking/grilling. But the propane convenience of the Big Easy can't be overlooked. Recommend the 22 piece accessory kit and the grill cover. They really come in handy!",

The \"holy grail\" of holiday turkey cookers countrywide. There it sat until I decided to grill some \"prime\" sirloins from Costco. The steaks I was able to get the coveted diamond marks on them , but the crowning achievement was using as a smoker for ribs! Amazing ribs using 3-2-1 method, can't wait to try other BBQ favorites. Actually at this very moment am trying St.Louis ribs for the first time, can't wait for dinner!! This grill does it all decently, and a good price (mine was 169.00 w/prime)",

It lightly tinges foods with the smoke on lower heat but I have to pull the drawer and blow into vent hole to get the smoke chips going again. I've found the sweet spot inside the cooking chamber which is very centered away from the walls. I hang ribs by the basket so they touch eachother almost...4 at a time. It gets 4 stars because my big grill sits idle while I use the big easy for most everything now. But I need to buy a true smoker. cheers, Jill's husband.",

Its like any other grill you do have to get use to the different temp. settings. The food even when more done on the outside is still very moist and juicy on the inside. The smoke chip holder is smaller and you have to add more chips for longer slower cooking. I will say it was not difficult to assemble and it took about 30 minutes to do. So far it seems to be very sturdy and I plan on using it alot. I would say its a great value.",
