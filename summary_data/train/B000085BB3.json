I went on the Amazon return and there isn't an option to return it or even exchange it.",

The keyboard is almost identical to the Texas Instruments which was a pleasant surprise. Perfect size and functions for home and small business use. If it stands the test of time, I will have made a very wise choice.",

      "text": "If you never use the adding machine tape, this calculator is fine. But if you print a lot, it is super loud and annoying, about 3 times louder than the Canon adding machines in our office. It annoyed the staff in our accounting office so much that I had to stop using it, and bought a Canon.",

However the new printer is very slow, instead of printing the whole number at once it only prints one number at a time from right to left. if you use big numbers you end up waiting for the printer to catch up with you.",
