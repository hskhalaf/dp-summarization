As a 5 foot 9 inch woman, there was no way that I had burned over 5800 calories with just a 30 minute walk before 1:00 PM. If you are looking to use this purely as a smart watch, I would recommend. If you want this as a fitness and health tracker, look elsewhere. I am in the process of returning this watch.",

I also liked that it came with 2 different sizes of watch bands.

Without the bezel, you can still quickly scroll by using 1 finger along the edge. Some say only 1 message is retained, not true, go to messages on the watch and scroll down. There is an unmentioned inactivity warning after 1 hour, I'm still searching for how to modify it. You CANNOT verbally answer phone calls using this version of the watch, but you can reject, or send a text response. Sleep tracking, heartbeat and automatic activation of workouts are good features.",

I have tiny wrists with a prominent bony bump, so I rarely wore my previous Samsung watch because big bulky watches are too uncomfortable to wear. The usability is fine. The smooth, sleek look is great! CONS: It did not come with any kind of charger. NADA. WTF?? And battery life is not great.",

The stats on sleep quality and workout activities are not accurate or reliable. And even if it were accurate, the data is not rich enough to be actionable. It makes me miss my MS band.
