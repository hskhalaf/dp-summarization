These are the best - I only put them in when my eyes feel terribly dry, and then they feel better for a long time after. No more putting drops in my eyes at night and waking up to drier eyes than I went to bed with! The bottle is also at least twice as large as your standard eye drops bottle!",

It doesn't burn my eyes at all, and is a thinner consistency. I am \"challenged\" when it comes to putting eye drops in, sometimes getting more under my eye than actually in it. So this consistency works for me, easier to drop in and makes my eyes happy.",
