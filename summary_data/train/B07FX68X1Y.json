I pressure cooked it 15 minutes, then air crisped it for 10. The meat literally cuts with a fork, yet has a nice crisp from being air fried and has a nice pork+apple flavor, and I get a nice dessert :) All in all I'd say it works exactly as advertised.",

The Foodie is a snap to use and clean and is very compact when we travel with it. Keeps things simple. Temperatures and time are very accurate. As an aside: always reset your pressure lid seal (push it down all the way) before using. This will ensure your system will pressurize.",

One broke off and the whole basket would have to be replaced by Ninja by returning it. Otherwise, I like the Foodi.",

I probably wouldn\u2019t have tried this but due to severe winter weather I wasn\u2019t able to pull out the rectec grill. Perfectly cooked 2 steaks in 12 minutes using broil setting. Fat was rendered perfectly and the coloring and little bits of charred meat sealed the deal.",

It is LARGE and if you live in a Condo or Apt check the space in front of your cabinets as it needs room to vent the hot air. It is HEAVY too and has rubber-like legs that you can't push over. You literally have to lift it and it weighs about 30 lbs. Otherwise I like it very much. I made the 5 lb chicken and it was very good. And I roast vegetables and they are quick and outstanding.

This product sort of combines all of that into one appliance on my counter. The cleanup is very easy also.

We use the airfrier most regularly, AF baked potatoes and bacon are great. Being able to pressure cook meat from frozen really saves the day when nothing is defrosted. Whole grain rice is so much easier in the pressure cooker too. Absolutely would buy again.",
