      "text": "Just outside of the warranty and the phone screen cracked whilst inside my trouser pocket. The phone was advertised as being reversible when taking calls but this feature never seemed to work well. It was whilst carrying out my own screen repair that I noticed the second microphone required for making reversible calls was entirely missing??????. Its very apparent that these phones are built to break the screen and Digitizer are poorly bonded so flexing of the screen puts undue pressure on the glass leading to premature failure. The phone is also very difficult to repair and i scratched the case removing the back. So would I recommend this phone absolutely not stick to a reliable brand.",

The stereo sound is awesome thanks to the speakers at the both ends. The only drawback that I can mention here is that the sound volume is too loud even when it is only one step above mute. I hope it get fixed in the forthcoming OS update by Alcatel.",

Also of note, the service they provide for replacing cracked screens is surprisingly easy to use if you're in need of it, and reasonably priced. Given my experiences with the phone vs. The floor, I'd recommend getting a case - the lovely screen coming to the edge of the body and the not-plasticky-feeling back can make it feel a little slippery at times.",
