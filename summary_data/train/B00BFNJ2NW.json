I do wish you could access documents on cell phone and tablets without having to download them to the device first, or if they would automatically upload the new copy with it's changes. still a lot of room for improvement but they do what they said the would.",

Transporter lets you sync only those files you want to a particular device, making it ideal for syncing with limited-capacity mobile devices and smartphones. And for your larger capacity devices, such as your home computer, there is no more need to worry about capacity limits holding you back from enjoying and sharing your files whenever you want.\n\nEASILY SHARE AN ENTIRE MOVIE COLLECTION WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS\nTransporter is ideal for sharing large collections of files, such as your entire photo or home movie collection with family and friends. You can share up to 2 Terabytes per Transporter, which is enough space for 2,000 HD movies, 400,000 songs, or 1,000,000 photos.\n\nSince Transporter is a device you own and control, you will never have to worry about monthly fees or subscriptions to store and access your data. This makes Transporter an easy, cost-effective, and completely secure way to share your media collection with those around you.\n\nPRIVATELY COLLABORATE WITH CO-WORKERS AND COLLEAGUES\nWhether you're a lawyer, doctor, dentist, financial planner, or mortgage broker, the need to share, collaborate, access, and protect confidential files is a must. Transporter gives you full control of the location and redundancy of your data, whether you need to collaborate with colleagues in another office, or just need secure mobile access.\n\nBecause files stored on Transporter are only transferred between Transporter devices and authorized computers, your files are never stored in the cloud and remain completely private and secure at all times. Files transferred between Transporter devices are always encrypted during transit, so you can rest assured that personal documents are only being stored and viewed by people you have authorized.\n\nACCESS ALL YOUR FILES FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\nIf you're on the road for business and need access to the latest spreadsheets or simply want to download a movie while on vacation, Transporter lets you access your files remotely from anywhere in the world. All files stored on your Transporter, regardless of size or type, are accessible when using the free Windows, Mac, Android or iOS software on any supported device.\n\nAUTOMATICALLY PROTECT VALUABLE FILES OFFSITE\nTransporter offers the easiest way to protect your files offsite. A full copy of shared files is kept on each Transporter, and changes to any files are automatically synced in real-time between shared devices. This ensures everyone has the most recent copy of your files no matter where you are. Should access to your primary Transporter ever be interrupted, software will automatically continue to access files from any shared Transporter until your local network is restored.\n\nADD TERABYTES OF STORAGE TO YOUR IPAD AND IPHONE\nTransporter removes the need to constantly shuffle movies around or delete photos to keep from running out of space on your mobile device. You can use Transporter to store everything that you don't have space for on your mobile device and download it when you need it. Using the free Transporter app, you can download a movie for a flight or show friends your favorite pictures of your kids.\n\nDRIVE SPECIFICATIONS\nThe Transporter is a Serial ATA (SATA II) device, and works with most recently manufactured 2.5-inch SATA hard drives, commonly known as mobile, laptop, or notebook drives.\n\nMore specifically:\n\n * SATA II, SATA-300, SATA 3Gb/s (Rev 2.0 SATA)\n * SATA III, SATA-600, SATA 6Gb/s (Rev 3.0 SATA, backwards compatible)\n * Minimum disk capacity: 160GB\n * Drive thickness: 7mm, 9.5mm, 12.5mm, and 15mm\n\nThis makes Transporter one of the few consumer electronic devices that can physically accommodate 2TB 2.5-inch mobile hard drives.\n\nOPERATING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n * Mac OS X 10.7.x Lion\n * Mac OS X 10.8.x Mountain Lion \n * Windows 7 SP1 32 and 64 bit\n * Windows 8 32 and 64 bit\n * Apple iOS 5.1.x and higher\n * Android 4.0.x and higher\n\nPlease note: A direct connection to your router via Gigabit Ethernet is highly recommended for optimal performance.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nTransporter, one 1TB 2.5-inch SATA HDD, power supply, drive carrier, Ethernet cable, and set up guide.\n\nCONNECTED DATA TRANSPORTER WITH 1TB DRIVE\nKEY FEATURES\n * Automatic real-time syncing between devices\n * 100% private with files never stored in the cloud\n * No subscriptions or monthly fees\n * Unlimited sharing with no restrictions on file size or type\n * Access from any computer or mobile device with Internet access\n * Comes with 1 TB SATA hard drive\n\nConnect to your router via Gigabit Ethernet.
