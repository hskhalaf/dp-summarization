I like that the ports for the game cartridge & micro SD card have a cover, so you don't accidentally pop out the cartridge or dust doesn't get in. Everything feels like good quality to me & I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another, should I ever feel the need for another design or want to give one as a gift.",

The control buttons would not respond even when I tapped on the screen the unit remained non responsive! At first I thought that I had damages the unit when I applied the protective film but I was thrilled when after removing the film the unit worked perfectly!!!",
