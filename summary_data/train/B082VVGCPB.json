Started up no problem and started booting windows, asking the standard first time bootup questions. I plan on making a smart mirror for our kitchen so this is perfect! All I want it to do is show a dashboard and youtube videos and be able to be discretely stashed away. Right now to set it up I have it plugged into my tv with an HDMI and using a wireless mouse and keyboard. Works great.",
