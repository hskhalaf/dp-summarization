After reviewing the basic functions with my son he was able to control Botley with little direction. Even my 3 year was interested and enjoyed Botley but she needed much more guidance and help to control him. This is a wonderful STEM activity for kids that keeps their minds thinking without the use of screens. When my son woke up the next morning he asked for Botley over tv which sold this product for me.",

He takes inputs from the remote control or select line and he'll follow a dark line (provided on cards or make your own). It doesn't require hooking up to the computer to code, good and bad as there are no codes (scratch) written by the user just button pressing. This is great for beginners but more advanced coders could get bored. It's super cute and has good sayings, even gets dizzy if turned too much. Cool toy but quite expensive for what you get hence the 4 stars.",

For instance: object recognition only recognizes large objects, and sometimes Botley seems confused by the lines when set to line mode, but overall it's a great toy and a fun introduction to programming.",

I would have appreciated more ideas in the instructions but I\u2019ll try the website to see what we can come up with. Batteries were included and ...get this...they included enough extra batteries for one additional change in the robot. Nice touch!",

The batteries were corroded which ultimately caused the programming and bot to not work. :(. We ordered two months in advance so the return policy had ended :( We ordered a new one yesterday right after opening, got it the next day and works perfectly. We used our own batteries as there were none in the box, have all pieces, and are now enjoying learning and playing!",

My six year old understood a little better but got very frustrated with it when he couldn't get it to do what he wanted it to do. I think it's a good toy I enjoyed playing with it but I believe it would be better for an 8 year old.",

Super easy set up, my 6 year old figured it out before I was even done reading through the directions. Botley can detect and avoid objects, follow looping commands and paths, and even has little quirky phrases. The kids enjoy it so much that it's the first thing they ask to play when they get up and/or get home from school... And how can you say no to something that is teaching them and there is absolutely no screen time?!",
