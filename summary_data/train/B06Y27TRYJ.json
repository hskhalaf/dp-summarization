As picture indicates, illuminates the area well beyond the swim platform. So far, very happy with this purchase. Only con was that prior to purchase, I couldn't get any answers about how many amps each light takes, so that was a little frustrating. Pamphlet that came with these says 2.8 amp draw @ 13 volts..",

We installed two lights on a trawler with a 15 ft beam and there is enough light to cover most of the transom. The test will be when we're in clear water to see if they light up behind the boat for the advertised distance. We also wired them to a single two way switch I'm thinking of separating the power so I can light both colors at once. Overall we're very satisfied with these lights and the price is more than competitive with the competition.",
