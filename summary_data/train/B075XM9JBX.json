I used the size chart and it says I'm a medium so I got the medium. Yes, it fits but its not snug and there's still some room at my toe, so I'll try ordering the small (its hard having narrow feet!) These are decently warm but not as warm as my Billabongs, but then the price is way less. I'll probably love these for the summer but they're not warm enough for winter (I run cold though).",

I paired these wetsuit socks with some water shoes and was solid on every river crossing. I stood in the river comfortably for about 5 minutes. The Large size was a perfect fit for my size 11-11.5 feet and they were low profile enough to fit right into my shoe. Incredible comfortable. I bought 2 pairs and my nephew was also comfortable with his size 10.5 feet. He used the socks alone to cross the river and did just fine. Highly recommended.",

I didn't even have the courage to try my fins on before we left. But thank God I ordered these.

I wear a 10.5 shoe, have a narrow heel, bought a medium after debating between medium and large. Either likely would have been fine for kayaking. On my foot, the medium is hard to get on, but a little talc like divers use for donning wetsuits (same material) really eases the process. I gave no rating for warmth or durability yet, too early. Warmth should be no problem since it's made of wetsuit material with an excellent record for insulation. If worn inside a shoe, this design with a heel reinforcement should prove better than the designs with reinforcement/nonslip only on the sole.",
