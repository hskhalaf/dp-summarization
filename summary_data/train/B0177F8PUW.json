I went to the covergirl website. First, it does not contain the cruelty free trade mark. Second, the colors are not the same as the authentic pallet. Other than that the packaging looks authentic. The colors in this pallet are beautiful. You do receive two pallets. Although it's not authentic, for the money it is a descent pallet.",

I\u2019m not big on the darker colors, but recently someone did my makeup for a wedding and the used several of the colors in the palette, Includinf the darker shades and my eye makeup looked amazing. I don\u2019t have a problem with it coming off during the day. I did wear a cream eyeshadow base to the wedding, but I don\u2019t do that for daily use and my shadows stays on. I definitely recommend this palette. It is a great price! I have celiac and this has not irritated my eyes like many shadows have in the past.",
