While people thought that this road shoe had a midsole that was reactive and a fa\u00e7ade that was visually appealing, they didn\u2019t react well to the rest of its aspects. The upper unit was criticized for not being breathable and adaptive to the shape of the foot. The sizing scheme and width profiles were also held negative regard.",
