But I\u2019m a size 6 and they just fit without being too big, just. They are not too wide fitting though, but will give and stretch a little as they are fabric. I\u2019m happy with my purchase and would recommend this seller. I used click and collect service as I don\u2019t like to wait in for parcels. I was kept informed of when my parcel would be ready for collection.",

As some other reviews have said definitely order 1/2 a size smaller and they will fit perfectly.. they are very well made as you\u2019d expect from puma, the in soles aren\u2019t glued in but they don\u2019t move when you tie them up. But the magic is when you put them on.. they are so soft to walk on very much like the boost material by Adidas.. possibly the same stuff? But they are great quality and feel great on your feet.",

Apparently this offers smooth support as you shift your weight from heel to toe. so is much better for you. They have an engineered, knitted upper adapts to your foot for a better fit, and overall this is a really comfortable, and stylish pair of running shoes. which I am very pleased with. Can't fault them at all. Fit as expected.",

Fits my broad feet well, but there is plenty of flexibility so narrower feet should not be a problem. The soles are very well cushioned, reducing impact significantly: easy to walk and run in, the uppers breath well, and the styling is neat and unobtrusive -attractive, even, as far as running shoes goes. Pricing is keen, so they are well worth getting hold of. No complaints at all here.",
