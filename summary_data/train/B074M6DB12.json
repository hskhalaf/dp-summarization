I paired this with the hood sold thru wind hard a subsidiary of aegismax. They seem to be made for each other. Packs down like their mummy bags into a very compact stuff sack. Packing into stuff sack is a chore, but it can certainly be done. Can be ventilated thru footend or cinched closed. Comes with large storage bag. Definitely backpacking worthy for me.",
