He managed to break the latches and get out within a couple days of use. A lot of money for a cage that didn't work. This dog is not wild, he's 7 years old and rather calm but when he decides to escape from his crate - he uses his strength to bully his way out of the cage. Obviously the bars etc. are strong - but the way the openings are secured is inadequate, and he broke them with ease. This isn't a mastiff or a saint bernard - shouldn't have happened.",

He has already bent two sides and took off 1 bar completely. It seems that the bars are hallow.",

The bars are hollow and not welded to the frame and beyond looking imposing, it does little to keep a nervous dog contained. Extremely disappointing. It actually took her less time to break free from this than the \"cheaper\" standard wire crate I had before. I suggest the manufacturers take a look at the definition of indestructible and go back to work on their design as this is far from it, and not worth the money.",

When my dog outgrows its height the top can be removed completely without affecting the sturdiness of the cage. It is large and roomy and VERY STURDY. I like the idea that's its on wheels and sits 5.5 inches off the floor it can be easily moved and folds away nicely. The inside area is 27 inches high. Like I mentioned the top can be removed which makes it ideal for very tall dogs. . .Its well worth the money. Any questions just email me.",

Also attached HDPE on lower half to add a bit of privacy. Its Working fine and I like the larger floor space it gives to the dog than a Vari-kennel, much more secure than a wire kennel. I really like the side door for placement so it doesn't take up so much floor space in width.",
