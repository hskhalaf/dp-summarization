      "text": "Great cutters. They cut fairly cleanly and the pressure required to close is quite stiff and nice. I use these cutters to cut out models/plastic (Gunpla, specifically), and while they're no God Hand or Tamiya nippers, for the price, this is a great buy. Might seem a little silly, but the reason I can't give it a 5 star is that the handle absolutely reeks of rubber/plastic out of the package. I've had it for about a week now as I write this, and it still smells a bit. Not as bad as it was, but on the first day I had to wash my hands pretty hard to get the smell off.",

My only complaint is since they are spring loaded I wish they had a way to keep them closed when not in use. But that is minor. I highly recommend.",

Their is one thing that would be nice though is to add a small locking hook to keep them closed for when storing them say in your took box or took bag when not in use, because I've noticed that the tips of the cutting edges are very sharp.

I treat mine regularly with WD40, but, because of the humidity in the Southeastern US, tools left in a shed or garage become rusty and lose their cutting edge, it seems, every year or two. So far these cutters (made of carbon-steel) are holding up very well. They are extremely sharp and tough little buggers ... and I think it would be very difficult for someone to duplicate their quality from a national brand hardware store at 'three times' their price.",
