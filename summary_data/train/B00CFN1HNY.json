I test every hour or two while awake as part of a recovery promise to family and to rebuild trust.

      "text": "I have been using this product now for about two weeks so far so good. I like the option to guess your BAC before it tells you. Its been eye opening to see how little (in my case) my BAC goes up after one drink versus my partner. I've been doing a lot of research (aka drinking) to test and see what the effects are on my body. My partner and I can each have one drink and our readings are vastly different from each but consistently the same. I would highly recommend this product as it works great, is small and discreet, and being that I'm a tech nerd...I love that it has a phone app.",

We all have a lot riding on our jobs, and a DUI will end our careers. So this little bit of piece of mind helps. I have carried it with me ever since I bought.
