The blue scraper has one side with smaller teeth for a soft scrape, and one side with larger teeth for a deeper scrape. If you've never used a tongue scraper, I highly recommend that you do. It gets all the crud off your tongue and makes your mouth feel so clean and refreshed...even more so if you the mouth spray with it. So easy to use.",
