This smaller one is is better for indoors, is pretty much indestructible, but can only handle short grass (not really medium, and not long). The bigger 1:10 one can be damaged by high speed crashes, is quieter actually, and can handle tall grass just fine. Both can handle puddles, gravel, snow, sand. Reaaaally enjoy the adjustable speed sensitivity on the remote, for both. Batteries last as advertised, if not longer. Enjoy the video I made for fun :D",
