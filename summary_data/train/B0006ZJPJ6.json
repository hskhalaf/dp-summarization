His reason for doing so is to prevent him from damaging the mailbox when he is cutting or trimming the grass. Our mailbox is very unique in the neighborhood and we received tons of compliments, even from our mailman. We took off the inner top shelf and allow the mail to drop to the bottom of the box, now we only check our mail every two weeks. This works out great for junk mail, I only have to deal with the junk mail twice a month.",

It won't fool anyone into thinking that it is actually stone, but it looks quite nice for a plastic mailbox.",

This worked well with no problems. We have already used it for a two week RV trip and it works great. For us, it will hold lots more than two weeks mail. It is a very sturdy unit and seems very solid and weather proof. The assembly instructions are OK, not that hard to understand. It looks great next to the end of our driveway. It is easy and simple to switch back and forth from the large capacity vacation mode to the normal size at-home mode.",

It can hold up to 3-4 weeks of mail is safe from the elements. The lock on the panels is cheap tho and one of ours doesn't lock securely and may need replacement. Standard size pieces work the best - oversized envelopes and packages may fit. We have some tough cold winters and the plastic will get brittle in the cold, so it can crack if hit by, say, a snowplow.",

First off, I normally hate molded plastic with faux texture. But somehow this mailbox pulls it off. The magnets are a little weak, so I replaced them with neodymium ones. I used nice big screw on metal numbers instead of the cheap stick ons, & they look great. It's so clever the way it switches to a locked box. I understand the one reviewer who could put his arm through, but we don't have security issues like that. Our neighbors watch our house, but now they don't have to collect our mail everyday.",
