I was able to remove my quiver and it fit nicely in the side quiver pocket. I also put my discharge head, rail lube, and broadhead wrench inside the side pocket. Pros: lightweight, great fit, plenty of padding throughout, great side pocket for the quiver, great padded raised scope pocket Cons: would have been nice to have an additional pocket for the accessories All in all, a very nice protective case for your shorter axle to axle crossbows. Note: my bow's dimensions at their outmost points were 22\"wide x 35.5\"long x 10\"tall",

I'm going to purchase one more of these cases for my other ultra compact 22\" crossbow when further funds are available. The arrow/accessories zip compartment attached to the right side has ample space for a five or six bolt quiver, rope cocking device or crank cocker, rail/string lube, etc, but not long enough to fit the plastic Allen crossbow bolt case. Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this item to others needing a quality case for their ultra compact crossbow.",
