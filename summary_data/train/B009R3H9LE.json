      "text": "Lovely bike. It came with a minor dent but not one I wanted to endure a return in order to fix. It is small and did not chip the paint. The only complain I have is the brake. It is quite dusty as far as brake material goes, and it's braking power is not optimal being the only brake on the bike since I don't ride fixed. As far as the bike, it is beautiful. Classic white by daylight and glowing by night. I love it, except for when I'm trying to sleep and it's lighting up my room, but that's the price of downtown apartment living I suppose. :) great bike!",

      "text": "58cm is incredibly fast for those 195-205 pounds. Well balanced with endless upgrades given your maturity. Great baseline bike. Best part is: their upgrades are cheap. Well made frame. But, the bad: issues with the rims--blown three tubes in 2 months. A bit off center. The mechanic took his time on the second snakebite--and still he deduced it was the rims. So, prepare for upgrades if you want to progress. In the meantime, excellent bike for the price. Reminds me of old skool Specialized. Can't go wrong if you are serious about the sport and want to go long term.",

It bothered me to some degree. Second, my Kilo Glow arrived with some nicks and chips in the paint. Would of loved some Kilo paint so I could of touched them up. Other than that..

This bike not only fulfills this role but it also makes me want to ride everywhere. I saw little to no problems with the paint or tubes upon arrival, which can sometimes be a problem when shipping bikes. It would have been nice to have building instructions but the assembly was easy and I didn't have to drive myself insane looking for parts or missing hardware. I can't wait to get out and ride this thing.",

The ammonia in them will dry out and they will stick. Super pumped to get this on the road for real. Just took a cruise around my neighborhood and it was great. I'll post an update once I get in a good 30 mile plus ride.",

    "description": "Get ready to take your night riding to a whole new level on the Pure Fix GLOW in the Dark Fixie Bike from Pure Cycles. The bike's paint is solar-activated; just give your bike an hour of daytime sun for an hour or more of night-time fun. Whether you're a night owl, a raver, or just want to trip out your friends this is the bike for you.\n\nThe Pure Fix GLOW marries the elegance of a classic urban geometry frame and straight fork with the toughness of durable, fully Tig-welded high tensile steel construction that's built to last. The bike is kitted out with a Pure Cycles Drome saddle for a nice mix of comfort and style, front alloy dual pivot brakes for quick stopping, custom Pure Cycles x WTB Thickslick 700 x 28C tires for excellent control and contact with the road, and 40mm deep-dish wheels. Weighing from 22 to 25 pounds (depending on size), this lightweight bike is easy to maneuver through city streets.\n\nWith the flip-flop hub, you can quickly change from riding in fixed gear mode to freewheel. Riding with the 15T fixed cog gives you an unmatched feeling of connectedness to the bike, the road, and helps you perfect your pedal-stroke.

The bike's paint is solar-activated; just give your bike an hour of daytime sun for an hour or more of night-time fun. Whether you're a night owl, a raver, or just want to trip out your friends this is the bike for you. Pure Fix Cycles Fixie bikes start with the simplicity and elegance of an urban geometry frame and straight fork made from durable high tensile steel to give you the ride and the connected feel you want and need from your fixie. A Neco thread-less headset holds Zoom riser handlebars with Oury grips on a Promax stem. The classic Vader saddle gets the job done, without frills and it keeps the weight down. Radius front brakes stop when asked and are easily removed for a purist ride. Wellgo pedals and cages connect you to a Lasco three-piece sealed bearing crank set. The gear ratio is 44:16 with 74.25 gear-Inch using a KMC chain. Hubs are custom Pure Fix Lasered KT Quandos. Tubes and tires are a nod to control and contact with Kenda 700cc x 28.
