It does leave a little skin on the top and bottom, but not enough to complain about. Super easy to use and clean which is always a bonus. I do wish it wasn't such a cheaply made product, but at least it does what it promises to do. I can see this lasting at least a year of two of moderate to heavy use.",

I had to run various vegetables (potatos, apples, cucumbers, etc.) 2 to 4 times to get it fully peeled. If you buy vegetables cheap and they are not symmetrical/perfect in shape, this peeler won\u2019t work very well either",

The machine will not work. 3) The cutting blade part is made up on plastic. The while thing is made up of plastic. I don't think, it will last even a week if I use it regularly.

There is very little waste, and it will peel the next potato before we can dice up the previous one. My wife made me buy two more so that we can run 2 at once and have 1 for backup. I'm giving it 4 stars for now, as we've only had it a week and want to see how it holds up. But great so far!!",

Cleanup is so easy too; I just wipe the contact points and put the detachable blade in the dishwasher.
