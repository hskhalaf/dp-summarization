Very small increase in my electric bill after installation. Use it year round. Even on days of extreme temps it has no problem maintaining the set temperature. It has been 0F a couple of days had no problem keeping up. Last summer had 85% humid days in the high 90s and the humidity in the garage was 50% and 75deg. I did add extra insulation in the garage so the heat wouldn't jut go out the roof. Its so great being able to work comfortably. I love this unit. Probably needs professional installation.",

HighSEER replaced the damaged units using nothing but e-mail correspondence. I definitely recommend this product and company!",
