The result is buying A LOT of very expensive ink (even the off brands are expensive relative to how much printing I do. Also, it won't even scan if the ink is out. At the moment, I need to print a black and white document, but can't because I have no magenta ink. Frustrating. The quality of printing and scans is fine.",

The copy and scan functions produce clear, crisp results. The document feeder for Fax and Copy functions works very well, just like the \"big\" machines. The auto duplex function for printing and copying is the best I have seen on a printer in this price range. And dual sided copying and faxing saves time and is trouble free. The software setup was easy and troublefree. This is just a great value product and knocks the socks off the competitors.",

Favorite feature is the 2 feeds so I can easily switch back and forth. Don't do photo printing or faxing yet, so can't speak to those features, but the copying and printing and ink useage are all top quality.",

Photo quality is slightly grainy, but I need to play around with the settings to see if I can improve that. It's definitely better on Canon paper, however. Print/copy quality and speed is fantastic.

Our use of the Fax machine is limited, and I have yet to try it out. I would highly recommend this \"all in one\" to anyone with the need for a quality multifunction printer at a great price.",
