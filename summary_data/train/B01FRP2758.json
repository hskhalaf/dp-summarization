A few months go by from my purchase and I see this is now an \"End of LIfe\" product which will receive no further updates? Why did I even bother spending my money on this router if its not going to have support? What a joke for a company to put out a product and less than 2 years later make it end of life. Stay away from this company! Will be going back to Netgear or Asus!",

Worth the price purely for the ability to have a strong internet connection in very room of my house and outside. Highly recommend.",

The QOS, if you want to call it that only allows you to point it towards devices, unlike others that prioritize types of traffic. The interface doesn't show the devices when monitoring traffic, only IP addresses, which if you are monitoring your kids habits makes you go and check the IP address in another location. Hopefully with updates they will fix these issues, however, I feel like this was released before it was finished.",

      "text": "The Wi-Fi speeds are very fast. However, my LAN wired connections to my computer, TIVO, and ROKU frequent disconnect randomly and then don't reconnect. Wi-Fi will continue to work even though the LAN connections are not working. The only way to fix this is to reboot the router. Rebooting the computer, TIVO, and ROKU don't fix the issue. I do have the latest firmware 1.0.10 from their website installed. I hope this is something fixable via a future firmware update as I otherwise really like the router.",
