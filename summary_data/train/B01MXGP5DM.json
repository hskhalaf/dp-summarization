      "text": "If your hair seems dry no matter what conditioner you use, I highly recommend this treat for your tresses. It is intense moisturizing, yet it doesn't weigh down my hair too much. I love natural ingredients like coconut oil, as I feel they are the most effective. I didn't like the shampoo, though. When I use both the shampoo and conditioner, it does weigh down my hair and make it look oily. So I use a different shampoo with this and love it. Sometimes my elementary school daughter doesn't rinse it out well enough, and then her hair does look oily. However, I rinse thoroughly, and I do not have that problem.",
