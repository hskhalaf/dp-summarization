      "text": "As some said, this looks fragile, and may easily break. But I bought 2 or 3 to try them out and this is by far the most secure for the ipad: holds it on the bottom and top, instead of the others that have a retractable frame that squeezes the device from the sides. Also, installation is very simple. I don't know why they tell you to put it on the dashboard--it will not work on most, it did not on mine. Plus suction is always best on glass. So I put it on the window and it's great! Not sure how to take it off though, it sticks so well! I will update with use.",

The suction surface is very sticky and conforming and may even hold on a mildly textured surface. The arm is not particularly stout and shook around a little on rough roads but never came loose. My biggest criticism is that it cannot hold the iPad in a portrait orientation which would have allowed it to be dash mounted without blocking the passenger airbag. Never mount any device in front of an airbag.",
