However, today I put them on to wear for the first time and noticed that one of the nose protectors is missing. Not fun.",

Sojos always makes it so easy to care for their glasses, though-- they pack their glasses with a microfiber wipe for the lenses, a microfiber drawstring pouch for storage, and promotional goodies! Love this brand! If you're looking for a great value for the price, you've found them.",

The polarized is very cool - just took me some getting used to as that I've never worn polarized before now. Reading my cell phone with them on was the hardest to get used to. They are very \"plain\" and simple, classic. They feel sturdy and durable. Will be ordering more colors!",

Their prices are very affordable and with so many styles and colors that's a great thing! They're delivered in a box. Inside are the sunglasses which are wrapped in tissue paper for added protection.

Also a nice soft drawstring case for keeping. Polishing cloth inside it\u2019s own envelope style pouch.

I love the color pink but can never find sunglasses either tinted the right shade of pink or that don't have completely see through lenses. These are perfect! As soon as I received them I was a happy buyer. They came very well packaged and their quality is so good that I would never believe they are as affordable as they are. I get so many compliments on them and will easily wear them all summer long. If you are a fan of aviators, these are a must.",
