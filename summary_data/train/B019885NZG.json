My only complaint is that even though I have renamed the zones to things like \u201cfront lawn\u201d or \u201cflower bed\u201d when using Alexa I have to say the zone number rather than the friendly name. I\u2019m hoping they update this as the system matures. Overall I\u2019m very happy and I think it will pay for itself with water savings because it knows when it rains close by. You can also hook up an external rain sensor, but I\u2019ve opted for just using my closed weather station for climate information.",

My landscaper keeps transferring control of my controllers to him, when I notify Rachio, they say they have no way to lock down my account and they don't email or otherwise notify the owner. Essentially someone can steal my controllers and transfer ownership to themselves, and I can do nothing about it. This needs to be fixed \u2013 how difficult would it be to require an email or app confirmation from the rightful owner? I mean think McFly!",

There were a lot of negative reviews on this but I think they either didn't follow the instructions or they have pumps, which I think would have been harder to use. I have a generic suburban yard in a big city and it was a snap. Had to fiddle getting the leads into the holes but still took me about 45 minutes from start to finish and I am not a home repair expert.",

The station it uses for weather data is a few miles away, which can be surprisingly inaccurate in Florida: an isolated thunderstorm can be very small but bring a lot of rain. I suspect the third generation product would handle this much better out of the box. Update: After two months of our rainy season, I am feel like the Gen 2 weather data is useless to counterproductive for my location, and the only advantage over my old unit is that I can update the schedule remotely. I will probably have to buy a personal weather station or disable Weather Intelligence.",

You basically connect each zone from your system to the corresponding zones on the Rachio. You don\u2019t need to connect the rain sensor as it isn\u2019t applicable to the Rachio. One aspect that I like is that the system splits the watering time to give a small break for water to limit runoff. For example, you set it to water for 40 min and it will water for 20, pause for 15 and then water again for 20 min. Overall, it\u2019s a great unit and I wish I had installed this originally.",

The orange trees were always wilting, back lawn was always dry while the front looked ok.

The ease of setting the zones and being able to start and stop them anyway is fantastic and especially comes in handy when making repairs as I do not need to keep running back into the garage to start and stop a zone.

From their website: \"Network must use WPA or WPA2 Personal security encryption. This helps ensure your network and connected devices stay safe while online.

So I'll save you time for when you make custom nozzles for your drip zones: 1 GPH = 1.60 in/hr (typical) 2 GPH = 3.21 in/hr (medium) 3 GPH = 4.81 in/hr (heavy flow) I wish I could post more but the unit does what it's supposed to, interfaces with the iPhone well, and hopefully will take care of my yard!",
