These might be ok for baking cookies or things without a lot of running juices or sauces- because those do seep under the mat. And they aren\u2019t the easiest to clean.

The quick cleanup after use is great, and I'll be saving money, too, since these will pay for themselves pretty quickly. I suggest you give them a quick run in the oven before using, because they do give off an odor on first use.",

I personally believe though the mats we received are defective and won't go away.

I use them all the time at 350 and they work very, very well. The bottom of my cookies tan perfectly and they never stick. The product has remained as perfect as the day I bought them. No burning or melting or anything. No more parchment or foil needed for regular baking. This is a terrific bargain. Update: I\u2019ve used these continuously and they are still in mint condition. If I\u2019m cooking in my oven I\u2019m most likely using these. They\u2019re great!",

I\u2019m going to purchase some for my kids and wedding shower gifts. THE BEST!",

But really that\u2019s hardly a problem when you compare to the money you save not buying foil or parchment paper. Definitely recommend!!",
