The two pockets in front are perfectly positioned and the waist tie is plenty long enough. The fabric this is made from is especially nice and comfortable while being worn. Easy warm water cleaning cycle, and the fabric is also just thick enough to protect against hot spills or splashes...saving your street clothes and maybe even your skin! Guests have commented on how good it looks as well! Recommended without hesitation!",

Good stitching everywhere, very sturdy. The neck strap can be knotted to adjust for length. Why pay more?",

I don't like the metal slide for the neck adjustment as it does not stay put.",

The apron has saved me from ruining a few shirts and it launders quite nicely. It is not too heavy or bulky & does exactly what I hoped it would do. Expect to add another one or two to my apron wardrobe.",
