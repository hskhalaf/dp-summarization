I purchased this board just to see if these types of balancing exercises would be useful for me. After only a few uses on a wood floor, the rounded bottom of the board has morphed into maybe 6-8 flat radial regions based on the supports underneath the surface plastic. So, instead of smoothly balancing and shifting weight, this has turned into a jerky wobble from one flat spot to another along the rounded part of the board. I'm going to purchase a higher quality board now.",

The bottom rubber round foot is well rounded so you will be wobbling at first and the stand is made of wood with a sandpaper film on top to give you a grip. The sandpaper film is covering the entire top so you have a wide area to stand upon. However, be careful on accidentally bumping your balance board on anything as the side pieces of wood did chip off. Other than that, it\u2019s a perfect deal for a balance board.",

      "text": "Very sturdy and decently challenging balance board (for a 195 lbs adult). I've never had the greatest balance so I bought this as a way to passively improve my balance and strengthen core muscles, etc. I mostly use it while watching netflix or TV at home and just balance on the board while watching instead of sitting. I started off terrible but improved pretty quickly. I can now balance on it for about and hour before my feet get sore. Once I master this one, I'm planning to move up to one of those rolling balance boards since standing still does get a little monotonous over time",

It also is nice way to maintain a bit of fitness when you have to be at a desk all day. Very well made I have used it daily for a few months now without issue.",
