I couldn't tell the difference when playing many kinds of games. Also the bevel on this was much thinner and the base is a much cleaner style that doesn't clutter up my desk. While the base doesn't have much in the way of adjustments, for me it's where I would have adjusted it anyway. No dead pixels on either of the two I bought. Very satisfied!",

I game on this monitor but it is NOT a gaming monitor. This is a product meant for business use. It gets the job done, always turns on and works well. Color is not 100% consistent from monitor to monitor so will need some adjustment.",

Shame on me for expecting a product to work after being boxed in the original packaging for 4 months... WTF!??",

This is basically a 16x9 television panel. We will probably pay more money and get 2560x1440.",
