      "text": "This was a higher priced bike leash, but so worth the cost. My dog is 70lbs and has DNA herder within. On one of our first outings with the new leash she bolted out from the side of the bike at a passing car. It was easy to maintain control keeping both of us safe. My dog and I are having a lot of fun with her running along side the bike. Such great exercise. High recommend here. So well made, easy install. Happy with this purchase.",

      "text": "Our dog (and my husband) loves this so much! She does really well on it and it does a much better job of getting her energy out than we ever could running her. She was already leash trained really well so the transition to this was seamless. It attaches so low to the bike that even if she did try to get away she couldn't pull the bike over. Definitely a great purchase.",

Right would have been better - however having him on the left away from the ditch is a good idea. Highly recommend for active dogs. LOVE IT. (The free folding water bowl is a nice touch. We use it every time we go out).",

That said, I have had no problem with the finger tightened bolts.",
