      "text": "I love the very fine, soft bristles. I tend to brush my teeth very hard resulting in receding gums. Years ago I followed my dentist's recommendation to use only \"soft\" toothbrushes. Some of them started off soft but soon hardened, so I was going through a lot of brushes. I only knew what soft was when I tried these. You just cannot brush too hard with these and they do a great job cleaning. They are by far the best, most comfortable I have ever used, and I am 68. I cannot attest to the whitening because I didn't pay attention to that.",

In comparison to Curaprox CS5460 (Amazon UK best seller toothbrush), the Dental Expert has better grip and its plastic almost never hit my teeth (with Curaprox it happens quite often). However, the Curaprox has denser and higher quality bristles which is, and it comes in different colors so you don't take your wife's toothbrush by mistake.",

They're soft and feel great, allowing the powder to do its work without 'hard' bristles getting in the way. Once of my favorite things about them is that there is an angled shape at the end of the brush. My index finger rests on it naturally when I'm brushing my top teeth and provides more control than the general tapered end of most brushes.",
