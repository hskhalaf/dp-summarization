That's also why I have one for each hand to distribute that scrolling, which helps when I'm on a computer 8 hours a day.",

The 810 seems to work OK, but after only six weeks of use, it already has click issues similar to after 15 years of use with the better model I had. To increase the time before this inferior model fails completely (by reducing the number of clicks), I have changed my computer software to single click instead of double click.

It lets me assign scroll functions to keys 3 or 4, but then does nothing when you press those keys. You should get a scroll cursor on the screen, and then scroll using the mouse, but it doesn't work. I'm using Windows 10 64-bit operating system. Don't waste your money on this ... get a mouse that has a physical scroll feature.",

You can set up a key to start the scrolling mode, then the movement of the cursor will initiate the scrolling, but it wasn't good enough for me. I used it at a daily basis for over two weeks to give it a change but after that it ended up in a drawer with the other devices I've tried so far. I'm sticking to the Logitech M570.",
