She definitely likes it more and after a few days, while cleaning her litter box, her stools look much better too. I can\u2019t account for taste...obviously. So I left that portion blank.

I think Honey can still eat the shaved pellets, but it might take a bit of annoyance for her. I didn't bother returning because she was out of pellets so she absolutely needed them asap. That's why I'm rating it 2 out of 5. Other than the quality control of the pellets, it's a good source of nutrients for rabbits.",
