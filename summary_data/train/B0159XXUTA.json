      "text": "After running around to 2-3 gas stations to refill the tubeless air-filled tire on my wheelbarrow from Home Depot, and using a bicycle pump it still will not stay inflated. Well, can't find such a replacement tire locally at Home Depot or Ace Hardware, so decided best option is to try this one. Arrived earlier than promised in packaging undamaged. Easy to install onto old wheelbarrow axel, just had to cut the old plastic tube bushing in half so the tire will fit in middle of the axel rod. It will works doing minor hauling for my garden- moving pine straw bales, bags of mulch, soil, pine bark, that kind of stuff. Pleased with this product",

The part at the center where the rod goes through to attach to the wheelbarrow came out much further than what I had before. However, the spacers on my wheelbarrow were hard plastic, so I just sawed them down to the length they needed to be, and voila! I love that this won't ever need to be pumped up, and it does bounce like a pneumatic tire. It's nice! This looks sharp with my hunter green wheelbarrow, too!",

      "text": "Like most others who bought it, I had to cut down the bushings to make it fit. It is a very heavy wheel and when you are already wheeling heavy loads up steep hills the extra weight is noticeable. Also, unlike an inflatable tube, there isn't as much give in the tire so when it is a bit rougher to wheel it over uneven surfaces, like tree roots and tree branches. If you're working on a flat surface, this is a great tire. For working in the woods, no so much.",
