Slid the face cover down for a bit but was happy to put it back up going into a headwind. Finished up the 24 miles comfy and warm. Sure, you'll fog glasses with it over your nose but drop it just below your nose and no problem with fogging. Easy to breathe through it and it kept the cold wind from getting in. Easily adjusted with one hand to be able to drink from the water bottle while riding. Really happy with this so far.",

Fits snuggly under my helmet and kept my face, neck, head, and ears warm all day. Fits perfectly under my snowboard helmet and did not interfere with helmet functionality. Highly recommend this product.",
