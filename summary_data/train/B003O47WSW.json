Pros: easy to use and no leaking Con: the cleaning up the spout at the bottom is annoying and a little hard to clean. I soak mine to make it easier and use hot hot water. Still I'd buy this again in a heartbeat and will should it ever crap out on me.",

Batters that are too thick to flow, are easy to scoop into cupcakes any way. So for your average cupcake batter, or pancake batter, this dispenser is quite nice and is priced appropriately.",
