My daughter uses her's at the beach and pool for a cozy sound in her area. Not sure what app she is using for music. Great size. It's a speaker that isn't going to affect people near by that aren't interested in our kind of music. I bought the 2 year protection for it, just in case. I also bought the case for it. It is also red, and fits well. I forgot what case.",

The only downside is that the speaker cover broke within days of receiving after a drop on a soft surface (carpet) and it won't snap back in place, making travel with it difficult. I'm planning on hot gluing the cover back on, because I otherwise love and will continue to use this JBL daily. I would still recommend, with a warning on the cover popping off.",

In my perspective JBL's speaker sounded a lot crisper and clearer than that of the UE. Not to mention the bass was far superior on the clip 2 as well. For a better speaker at a cheaper price, I made the right decision!",

I had absolutely no trouble pairing it with my Samsung Galaxy via bluetooth, and I even used the attached plug in my computer. Worked seamlessly. MAJOR Kudos to the designers for having the plug cord wrap around and blend in with the speaker! Love it!!!",
