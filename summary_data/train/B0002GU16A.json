      "text": "I received my printer yesterday, replacing my outdated Epson Sylus 740i. Set up took about 10 minutes with easy to follow instructions. Today I did an experiment printing color photos, without any type of editing, from the program given with the Canon printer vs. the JASC paint shop photo album software that came with my new Dell PC. Comparing both, I have decided the photos made from the Canon software are better images, more true color and sharper. The Canon software is also much easier to follow to perform certain tasks to edit or set up your pictures before printing. I read all of these reviews before purchasing this printer and am happy to add my positive comments to them.",

      "text": "Printer functioned very well for about 6 months, but then failed to print colors properly after that? Replacing print inks, print head, cleaning the print heads, reinstalling the program, etc. failed to make any difference. Of course I had the exact same problems with an earlier HP photo printer, and a later Canon photo pinter using different PC's? I suspect that these printers have a built in design to make them disfunctional after a given amount of usage to force the user to purchase a newer product. Nothing would surprise me.",

I use the printer infrequently, and unlike my previous Epson photo printer, I was very pleased to see that the print nozzles do not clog from lack of use. When first turned on there is a waiting period while the printer goes through an automatic cleaning cycle, but this does not appear to be too wastefull, and apparently avoids the clogging problem. I recommend this all purpose printer highly.",

It is my first encounter with a Cannon Printer. I especially like being able to replace only the color that runs out. The brand I used for the last two printers did not have this feature and lots of color ink were wasted. The printing of photos with a 5MP Cannon Powershot S500 are incredible - I speak as one new to the digital camera market. Hope this helps.",

    "description": "CL) CANON IP4000 PIXMA PHOTO Printer\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAmazon.com Product Description High speed, sharp resolution, and economical ink refills: Could you ask for more in a home printer? The Canon PIXMA ip4000 is designed with over 1,800 nozzles that produce tiny 2-picoliter droplets, resulting in finely detailed images that are worthy to save in your family album. Pigment-based inks insure colors will stay true, and the prints are resistant to water, fading, and smudges. \n\n \n\n\nThis printer can connect directly to select digital cameras. Learn more about PictBridge. With resolutions up to 600 x 600 dpi black and 4,800 x 1,200 dpi color, your office documents or school reports will look as beautiful as your photos. Built-in two-sided printing reduces your paper costs and allows you truly professional design options. Top speeds of 25 ppm black and 17 ppm color (draft mode) will have your pages in hand in just a few seconds; a borderless 4-by-6-inch photo can take as little as 36 seconds--as fast as those old instant cameras, but with better quality. (All reported speeds are maximums. Actual speeds will vary.) Thanks to the PictBridge-compatible direct print port, you can connect your digital camera and churn out photos while bypassing your computer system.  The ip4000 is compatible with Mac and Windows operating systems, and requires either a USB or parallel cable to get it up and running (cables not included). Canon provides a one-year warranty covering parts and service.\n\n What's in the Box\nPIXMA iP4000 photo printer, iP4000 print head, BCI-3eBk black ink tank, BCI-6Bk black ink tank, BCI-6C cyan ink tank, BCI-6M magenta ink tank, BCI-6Y yellow ink tank, Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy 4x6 sample pack, power cord, documentation kit, setup software and user's guide on CD-ROM; printer cable not included\n\n This printer supports a variety of useful technologies:\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nIf you're looking for outstanding quality, high speed, and advanced convenience features, the Canon Pixma iP4000 Photo Printer is ideal. Its ContrastPLUS 5-color ink system with four dye-based inks plus a pigment-based black ink produces true-life photos with improved color saturation and contrast along with laser-quality text. Plus, it achieves a resolution of up to 4,800 x 1,200 color dpi, for exceptional detail and photo-realism.\n\n Canon Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) uses a high-performance 1,856-nozzle print head that ejects consistent, prescribed-volume droplets as small as 2 picoliters. Simply put: more nozzles with higher accuracy equal better results at impressive speeds. You can even produce edge-to-edge borderless photos in 4-by-6, 5-by-7, and 8.5-by-11-inch sizes, with the look and feel of traditional photographs.\n\n Using the Pixma iP4000 Photo Printer is fast and easy. How fast? It can produce up to 25 ppm in black and up to 17 ppm in color, and a 4-by-6-inch borderless print takes only 36 seconds (highest-speed mode, ideal conditions). How easy? With direct photo printing, you can even print without a computer: simply connect any PictBridge-compatible digital camera or DV camcorder, and print!\n\n Canon Think Tank System: To help reduce printing costs, this efficient system has five individual ink tanks that let you replace only the color that runs out, rather than an entire cartridge containing unused ink. Plus, a unique low-ink sensor alerts you when ink levels are low, so you are prepared to just drop in a new tank as needed.\n\n Features: \n\n * ContrastPLUS ink system for true-life photos and laser-quality text \n * Up to 25 ppm black, up to 17 ppm color \n * Dual paper path with built-in two-sided printing \n * Maximum 4,800 x 1,200 color dpi resolution with microscopic droplets as small as 2 picoliters \n * Direct photo printing from PictBridge compatible digital cameras and DV camcorders \n * Borderless 4-by-6-inch photgraphs in approximately 36 seconds \n\n\n\nSee more",
