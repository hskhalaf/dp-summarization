They only needed to do one thing to improve this basic idea so that it could be safe to use at home. The resilience of the elastic bands. However, these are just off the shelf bands with no improvement. As a result, these bands easily rip and tear after a few months of use. The lifetime product warranty that they are talking about covers only the first 90 days of use because that's how they define the product lifetime in the fine print. That's the product you will be paying $30 for. Beware.",

They seem well made and are good enough to supplement my other resistance-training tools. After a few weeks of use, I can recommend these. I will continue to use them and will update my review if my experience changes.",

I think the bands will last longer than my door frame. Follow the directions and make sure the door gap is small enough that the gadget will not slip through. Bands seem well made. I'm not concerned with them coming apart. They have inserts secured in the ends to keep them connected to the clips that allow quick attachment to the handles. I haven't used the ankle strap. But it seems well made also.",

I'm not familiar with the resistance band exercises, so it would be very helpful to see the photos more clearly, and for each exercise to list the muscles worked. I had to ask my personal trainer about the right technique to use because I couldn't always tell from photos. However, I am very pleased with the resistance bands, I did the \"lateral walk\" and it definitely worked my glutes!",
