One thing I noticed that I didn't quite like is that the trigger on the devices is not smooth. Kinda jumps from real slow to full blast with no smooth transition. Other than that It was well worth the money. The same set by DeWalt would have cost almost a grand. Again this set is worth the money and after using for a few months now almost daily, they have worked reliably.",
