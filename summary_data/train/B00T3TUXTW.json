The air in the cushion raises thigh just enough to keep the sore from having contact and pressure. It took a few minutes to get the air amount just right, for comfort, but I am very pleased.

You just can't pinch that anti-deflate valve out of the way. It's really unnecessary to have the anti-deflate valve in there, since it only takes two breaths to inflate it to the firmness I like. I cut out the valve. This is my 3rd one, they have all been the same in that way. I keep leaving them behind in my hurry to get off an airplane. Advice to manufacturer: leave out the one-way anti-deflate valve, don't include the air injector pump, all would be fine.",

I needed to use the pillow immediately after receiving it. But the pillow held its air and shape and I didn't have to add air to it even after using it everyday for 2 weeks.",
