A heater like this doesn't even need a pilot to operate safely but apparently Mr. Heater felt like putting one on anyway. Save yourself the money and headache. DON'T BUY THIS!!! Buy a dyna glo tank top heater instead. Less money, simpler design, and it's purpose built for a 20lb tank. No need for an adapter hose with a fuel filter like this one.",

Both times I've purchased a new hose as well (the correct filter hose), so I'm pretty confident it's an issue with the heater itself.",

When operating, the unit was warm-as-a-bag-of-baby-bunnies or hot-as-hell depending on the setting.
