This product did the job and enabled her to enjoy the fish and coral for hours. I liked it too because it allowed me to be lazy and just relax in the water a bit easier. I liked how you could adjust the amount of air in it easily on the fly. It packed down small in our luggage. The colors were nice and vibrant. I got yellow and pink for her. It\u2019s easy to put on. And comes with a little storage sack.",

Just lay on your stomach and watch fish. Without it, it felt unsettling to be in 10-20 ft deep water, because you're always treading water and fighting waves. With it, i felt like I could take a break any time to fix my goggles, or whatever. With it on I felt safe and could stay out for well over an hour. It turned snorkeling from swimming in the surf to loafing around watching fish. Get this. Highly recommended.",

We saved enough to pay for the vests, which seem to be of good quality, were easy to figure out and inflate, and were bright colors so we could find each other. I'm sure I'll be using them many more times to peek in on Sponge Bob and friends.",
