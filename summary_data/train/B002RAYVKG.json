I used up some old diapers that she outgrew by putting them in doubled-up grocery bags for this. I put her old changing pad underneath it in the car, just in case. I have two of these and I might get a third.",

The storage containers on each side are great for TP, wipes and bags - plus they make the seat very stable. It is too big to fit into a standard diaper bag, but light enough to throw into a stroller basket or be carried around by a two year old (our daughter loves to move it around). I highly recommend for travel. It is also really nice that the child does not sit directly on the bag. Very easy to clean and compact. Great buy.",
