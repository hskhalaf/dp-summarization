These are low drop (4mm) this - turns out - serves me really well as am overpronator, got my calves and ankles stretched properly and am transitioning from 7mm drop shoes. (with short Achilles tendon or limited ankle mobility these might be really bad choice). The low drop nudges you towards midsole/ball striking and higher cadence. For the ample arch support they provide they are springy and light. Very comfy heel cup (got narrow heel), no friction there. And finally they look nice, the 3d mesh looks definitely posh.",
