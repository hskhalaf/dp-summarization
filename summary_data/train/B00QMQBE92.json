If I gained 5 #, or wore a bulky sweater, I would no longer be able to zip it up. These vests are made in Viet Nam, which explains the inappropriate sizing. Also, the vest is paper thin, so there is obviously very little down in it. I bought it to replace a great LLBean vest whose outer shell was starting to look worn after 20 years, but I will keep my well-worn (and warm) Bean vest and return this vest. Very disappointed.",

Would like to get another in a more fun color but wanted a very basic one first. Almost forgot, often vests stick up and have super large poked out shoulders. This one is nicely finished and doesn't stick up or out! Fits snug but I use thin layers not bulky ones.",
