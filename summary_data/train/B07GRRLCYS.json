Lately I have experienced a rush hour and sadly I am understaffed so I placed one in my shop to monitor possible theft or business sales abuse. I can only have so many obvious security cameras in certain areas so this one worked well in a small corner. Setting it up was easy and the quality of the recordings were good. No one has noticed or questioned me about it so far.",

Tried 4 or 5 others but they didn't measure up, either difficult to use, had to link to phone, etc. This camera is simple to use...put the SD card in, choose motion detection, choose HD and start the camera. I use it walking around does just great, the video clarity is surprisingly good ! Had some trouble with initial order, but Fuvision was very helpful and sent me a replacement. I would recommend this camera if you are looking for something small, light, easy to use! I only hope they offer a 64 GB or larger SD card capacity in the future, right now only 32 GB...",
