It works extremely well especially in New England where we have our fair share of strong winds!! It comes within it's own durable box with the charging cord. I suggest charging completely before first use. Have used for a little over a week. Haven't had to recharge it yet. Nice strong arc and well worth it for the minimal price. I'd definitely recommend it.",
