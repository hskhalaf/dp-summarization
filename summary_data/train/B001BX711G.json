She is small and lightweight but it\u2019s definitely sturdy enough for an adult, although I can\u2019t speak to regular use by an adult. It was reasonably easy to put together and took my husband and i about 45 minutes altogether. The bed looks fabulous and not cheap at all. She says her friends are envious of it, so I guess everyone likes it!",

Would have given five stars but for the long delivery wait and missing screws, other than that lovely bed and great price:)",

The frame is sturdy, my only complaint would be that the instructions aren't very clear and one more thing the black paint on this frame is gritty. I like to hang canopy curtains on this but being that the paint is gritty my curtains snag on the bed frame, in my opinion I think the paint on this frame should be a shiny black, overall its a beautiful frame and the price is right.",
