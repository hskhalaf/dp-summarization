This is lot more powerful dehumidifier and works very well to maintain 50% humidity level in my 1500 square feet basement in New Jersey. Operation noise is quiet than LG and I hope it lasts long. I need the dehumidifier thru June - September only because it drops to 45% after October. But it is needed during the summer to lower the humidity to maintain lots of book and equipment I have in the basement. Books last much longer when the humidity is low in my opinion.",

I used the unit in my 1300 sqft home in the main living area, so I don't believe that the conditions caused undue stress on the unit. Customer service from Frigidaire was great, however I am frustrated that I cannot find a dehumidifier that I can depend on for more than a few months.",

One started leaking right away and I had to use flex seal on both to stop it. The other one didn't start leaking until the next day and once again, it wasn't until I sprayed the adapter with flex seal did the leak stop. I am trying to dry out my house post Hurricane Harvey and the last thing I needed was a leaky dehumidifier.",

Our old 50-pint was several years old, and was still working when it was recalled, so I expect the same reliability from this new unit.
