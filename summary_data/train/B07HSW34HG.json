When you realize it won't work and try to go through the process to return it, it actually states it's not returnable (even though I just received it this week). Thankfully Amazon was a dream and returned my money. Just beware!",

Received the new one and it's charging without issue. I am hoping that this one lasts longer than the last one. Will update more after a few days of use. ********** I bought this stick for a trip and it worked fine. Kept it aside and when i took it out for my next trip, it's not working. To be specific, the stick is not switching on, in spite of charging it for hours. I expected this to last, at least, a few trips, if not more. Really disappointed!",

Pretty worthless, a $4 stick from a street vendor with a 3.5mm cord attaching it to the phone worked better. This thing didn't even last for 3 days. UPDATE 1/1/2017 The seller ended up sending me a new stick for free, and without asking. Haven't used it to give it a review since I have a hard wired stick. But they get 5 stars for trying, but still 1 star for the stick until I use it a lot to check it out.",
