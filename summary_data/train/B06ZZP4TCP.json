I use it as the everyday bassinet as well as folding it down to bring with us when we are not home. It lightweight enough to move easily (Moms - I move it in the bathroom to grab a quick shower!) The feet of the bassinet fold inward for rocking and prop flat for stationary. The bassinet is pictured with the MiClassic fitted sheet. I also find mini crib/ oblong bassinet sheets fit as well. The pad is water resistant for easy clean up which is great for my 7 week old little boy who is in between diaper sizes.",

The bassinet has mesh all the way around like it looks in the first few photos. It is really big which is awesome since it looks like we\u2019ll be able to use it for months to come. Setup is super easy and take apart is as well, sometimes the legs are hard to get off but I rather have them sturdy then loose. right now we use it as our daughters bed every night with any issues and have traveled with it a few.",

As you can see they are incredibly small for this gargantuan bassinet. I would return it but due to the packaging being too small for the item, I went full Rambo and the box is now unusable. So, in short, only trust the measurements of the bassinet and sheets. Don\u2019t trust the pictures or what amazon recommends.",

You can see the baby very easily, it's very portable and it's affordable(unlike some others).

It also folds up well and my daughter who is now 3 weeks still looks so tiny in it, so I definitely think it will last for her to sleep in up to 6 months. Also, the design is simple and I like the beige color.",

Not easy to find a sheet that fits so make sure to look at the measurements first or search for Miclassic bassinet sheets. It rocks which is really nice. It\u2019s not automatic. It doesn\u2019t vibrate but then my baby doesn\u2019t like the vibration so it didn\u2019t matter. Great product. Love it!",

Also, because of my own assumption, I thought it would have been smaller because it's portable but it's surprisingly spacious which ends up being a great thing!",
