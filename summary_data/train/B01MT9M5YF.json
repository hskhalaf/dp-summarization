Everything on it works well, although the manual did neglect a couple features it has, such as Delta Tune. Although the scan function is a bit slow, it does help find radio traffic when things are quiet. Additionally, it also has a weather radio that uses your CB antenna to pull alerts in, and it WILL go off when an alert is issued. While it plays the alert automatically, I do wish it would switch back to the CB when the weather announcement is complete. (This may be a limitation of the weather system.)",

The only thing I don't understand about the radio is that it has a feature that will turn it on in case of an alert, it comes on makes a noise and goes right back off without playing the message.

The thing I like most of the cb is that it has a clock, something my aftermarket radio doesn't have. It is a real fun thing to have, listening to truckers is very entertaining.

      "text": "I love this CB radio. Great features between the weather, CB, and PA settings. I like that you can change the color of the display to suit your vehicle more. It is a very big CB unit though so be aware. Only thing I wish is had was an \"auto dim\" feature that was in sync with your headlights and not just a manual dimming feature.",

I paired it with a 4' Francis and has been great. My only issue is the built in SWR meter. It is not accurate at all. But I guess I read that about every radio with a built in meter.",
