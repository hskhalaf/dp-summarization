The earbuds are quite a bit heavier than most earbuds, but are still comfortable for extended use (I use mine 5-7 hours a day). I use rechargeable 800mAh NiMH AAA batteries in the controller and they last at least a week (25-30 hours of use). Downside: They are absolute rubbish outdoors if it is windy.

If you are doing anything other than sitting nicely and quietly in a chair forget it. Last but not least, who in the world needs yet another device with batteries?
