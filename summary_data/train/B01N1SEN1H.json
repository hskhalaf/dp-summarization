      "text": "I was a bit disappointed by this umbrella. While I'm very happy that it still fits in my handbag, it's still a little bulky. This umbrella supposedly can fit two people under it, but it barely covers me and I'm tiny. If another person tried to shelter we would both get wet. While it is easy to open, that's not the case to close it. I have to push down very hard before it closes and that's not very convenient when it's raining and you're trying to get in a car. Lastly, the spokes have already started to rust and I've only had this umbrella a little over a month, and probably used it 3 times for the most.",

They are sturdy enough for some wind gust and just wide enough to keep you dry in windy conditions. I also loved the feature of pushing the button to retract umbrella. It helped to shake excess water off before entering a building. All in all a very good product. Definitely an upgrade from your average dime store umbrella. I would highly recommend this product.",

I just bought a third one to keep in my car for \"emergencies.\" My feelings...this umbrella is easy to use, is sturdy enough to handle the wind and rain we get here in Washington state, and it works very well in keeping me dry. I highly recommend it.",
