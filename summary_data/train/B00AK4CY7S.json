I like the overall function of this a lot better than my older bostitch one. The reason I'm giving this a 2 star is because the oring on the cylinder broke after 7 months in the middle of a project. I use this tool moderately and I expect a higher standard from dewalt's tools.",

I wanted one that wasn't going to screw up my molding. Wishful thinking on my part I guess. Had psi set to 100 which sunk them perfectly when it worked.

Ok for trim but if you need any kind of structural holding, use a real nail. Also be wary of where you have your fingers. 18 gauge brads are so thin they will follow grain and shoot out of the project anywhere. Looks terrible and is painful if your finger is in the path. I bought this to assemble bird and bat houses made from cedar. Brads have insufficient binding grip. Went back to using 6d finish nails.",

The Dewault nailer also does a much better job of punching the nail, leaving no shiners for the entire project (replacing every window and door casing in my entire house) I used it on.",
