I'm going hiking abroad this summer and wanted to print some maps of specific areas. The map pictured here is printed double sided and no bleed through. Great paper.",

We print with a HP laser jet printer and the ink looks good and has never came off. Sometimes these will sit in the water for a few days and never come apart. We buy a few packs every year to make more labels. All of the benefits of regular paper, and all of the benefits of a laminated paper.",

      "text": "Paper fed and printed well. I was able to cut and bind a book with it. It feels a little different than regular paper. The book did not get significant water exposure so I cannot attest to it's waterfastness. I would strongly recommend fanning the sheets according to the directions so they don't stick together in the copier.",
