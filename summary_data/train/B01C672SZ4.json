However I wanted to upgrade to make my memories better. This is a great camera for a first time DSLR. I am still experimenting with the settings but the functions are so easy to understand and snapbridge is an amazingly easy app to use. I cannot wait to be fully aware of what this camera can do when I learn more about the settings, especially in low light situations. I would definitely recommend the coolpix to anyone who hasn't used a DSLR and for the price it really is a steal",

It hasn't got a viewfinder but has a 3 inch screen which can be tilted and moved. The only minor issue is at or near maximum zoom, if it is poor light, it can struggle to focus. But this is nitpicking for what is a very good camera. Perfect for upgrading from a small compact to something a bit more useable in terms of features and ability. A natural progression before you get an SLR. Recommended.",
