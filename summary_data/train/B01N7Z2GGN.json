It will hold whatever I throw at it in terms of weigh and movements. You must know that it is a little shorter that most gym cages because it is designed for home use but once you get used to curling your knees for dips and pull ups its all good! You can do nearly every body part in some form or another with this cage and an Olympic weight set! I don't have to go in early or stay late to get my workout in before or after work.",

The Amazon tracking system gives you one tracking number for the first box with nothing else, so when Box 1 of several is dropped off you have no way of finding out about the rest of the boxes. I spoke with the underlying manufacturer and she said if you don't have all your boxes within 48 to 72 hours of the first one then it's time to submit an inquiry. She was right, two days later the rest of the boxes showed up.",

If you are mechanically challenged get someone who isn't. I put this and the lat pull down by myself and I'm 3/4 of a century old! Whomever designed this did a great job. All parts drilled perfectly and fit perfect. I definitely recommend their products. NOTE: they are lacking when it comes to answering the phone (minor)",
