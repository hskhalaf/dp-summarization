Almost no settings at all. You can't even disable IPV6 (seriously ?? ). But feed this monster with DD-wrt and this gives out 5 star performance. I use it as a dedicated VPN router. This maxes out my internet connection when connected to VPN (70 mb/s). Shout out to Hardware engineers, Booo to stock firmware (Web UI) developers, for being lazy and not giving some basic settings/configs.",

There's no real options in the router other than the standard port forwarding, dns, and SSID setup and that's where the DD-WRT flash came in. After the flash I got anything you could hope for and more. The hardware on this router is great, the software/firmware side are wonderful after the DD-WRT flash too. Great router, cheaper than the version that comes factory flashed with the ddwrt type firmware and interface.",

It has optimization features if you use a \"Killer\" brand NIC but I don't know why anybody would even own one of those either when pretty much all onboard NICs these days work just fine. The GUI is definitely dumbed down for advanced users, however for most people it should be sufficient at least, you have your main options like port forwarding, VPN usage, custom DNS, etc. And you can flash the firmware to DD-WRT if you desire more options.

I had my service provider come out and inspect my line and service, and they replaced my modem even though no issues were found but the issue continued.

It was definitely a WiFi issue as our 6 wired Ethernet devices maintained connection.",

I will test protecting this Wireless router behind a Palo Alto NGFW 3020 and see if it still drops clients. If it does.......the gains from the reduced pings and limited menu features are not worth it. Going back to Asus and making my own firewall. Stay tuned.",

Have a look around and you'll find a big problem with the latest firmware (late 2017). Linksys rolled everyone back to version .208, but that didn't fix my router, which came with .208 firmware. I worked with Linksys tech support for 2 days. It's not acceptable for a router this expensive to not have any base functioning firmware. Not even Windows servers expect a periodic restart any more. I learned years ago to not buy Linksys, but I was lured in by the Killer performance feature. I'm trying the Netgear Nighthawk next.",
