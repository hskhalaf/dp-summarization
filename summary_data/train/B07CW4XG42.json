      "verdict": "Generally, the response for the Under Armour Charged Rogue Twist is mostly positive. A lot of the users commend the good grip that the rubber outsole of the shoe provided. A lot of them also really liked the integration Charged Cushioning\u00ae into the midsole, which increases the shoe\u2019s responsiveness. The shoe, as said by many, provides sufficient comfort, especially during long-distance running. Some of the concerns of the buyers were the stiff heel and the thin padding of the shoe\u2019s tongue.",
