I love this reel, but after one season I don't see the original hardware lasting much longer. Also, the drag is glitchy. I set the drag and forget it, yet some days it \"locks\" down and I really have to play with it for the drag washer to slip again.

      "text": "The handle feels really cheaply made. The whole reel feels like it would break. But you know what? It handles like a champ. I paired it with my med-heavy Berkley rod, put runcl braided line on the reel and put it to the test. I used it for saltwater fishing, and it really handled everything I threw at it. Pulled in 2lb fish, no problem, snags, no problem. Fish after fish after fish, it was awesome. I would definitely buy again. I can't say how long this reel will last, but, with the regular care I usually do, I feel like it will last a long time. Wow. Awesome. Love it.",

Started off catching nice snapper and this reel performed flawlessly. I set the drag a little low just in case I caught something bigger. Drag is smooth and easy to change on the fly. Later in the day I caught 2 really nice redfish with this reel. Reel is so amazingly smooth when catching bigger fish. I have 20lb braid on this reel which has made for the perfect combo. His is hands down one of the best reels I have ever owned.",

I\u2019m here To tell you KastKing is going to blow the high end fishing market away! This Centron 500 Ultra Light Spinning reel is amazing. I put it up to Shimano anytime. Smooth drag excellent retrieve. With 9+1 bearings and very good quality parts what a deal. It\u2019s $22.00 a fraction of the cost of Shimano Nasci 500. Do yourself a favor buy a KastKing reel and put it up against your go to reels you\u2019ll find that your going to have a New go to reel!",

      "text": "This whole reel feels like it's made out of cheap aluminum. The bail bent and came loose on the first day out on the water. If you get any heavy fish on this like channel cats, the drag just isn't enough and then when you really crank it tight, it feels super sloppy and binds, often breaking the line (even 25lb test). So if you're looking for a pond reel for your kid, go for it. If you're looking for a reel to do any kind of regular fishing on... Just get an uglystick combo and you'd be better off.",
