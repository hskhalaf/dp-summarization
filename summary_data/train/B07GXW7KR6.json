Unless you purchased a system w/a camera or listening mic, there's no way to verify the emergency w/o extra expense. Additionally, their monitoring service is required ($25/month) so you can connect w/your system via their app, or your smart phone. In summary, the system is useless unless you're at home. I should've done more research on this product before I purchased it and SimpliSafe needs to be more forthcoming on their tv & radio commercials. I have no problem with Amazon what so ever, but I thought. Amazon customers should know these facts about SimpliSafe.",

Without access to the app, this essentially becomes a very expensive door alert/noise maker - which similar products can be purchased for much less. While the fee is lower than other companies, this fact appears to be intentionally omitted from both the product description and from their website.",

Highly recommended, and when I purchased (March 2020) Amazon had the best price by far. $20 less than smallest bundle on the vendor's website and with more components.",
