The router has incredibly accurate adjustments and the adjustment up and down is very simple and smooth. Changing bits is easy, it does require the two wrenches included, but the task is a simple snap each way. The router does not vibrate much either; the motor adjustments for speed are easy to reach under my router table. It has ample power to cut easily through oak and maple without burning the wood. This isn't a lightweight router; it's full size and full weight. I highly recommend this router.",

Seeing the damage it did to birds eye maple really made me appreciate the power. Anyway, the tool is extremely useful for finishing and is very high quality. I wish it was variable speed since I mainly work with hardwood, I believe lower speeds would be more ideal to start working hardwood. Anyway, the locking cord, the detachable base, and power are all great. It is comfortable to use and very powerful. Great for a beginner in woodworking.",

Do not hand-hold the router in an upside-down or horizontal position\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nRoute and smooth even demanding hardwoods with the 1-3/4 horsepower DEWALT DW616 fixed base router, which provides a micro-fine depth adjustment ring provides for precise depth adjustments in 1/64-inch increments. And the adjustable, tool-free steel motor cam lock makes depth adjustment and base changes quick and solid-locking.\n\nThe 1-3/4 horsepower DW616M motor pack \n(view larger). DW616 1-3/4-HORSEPOWER FIXED BASE ROUTER\nAT A GLANCE:\n * 1-3/4 horsepower, 11.0 Amp motor\n   \n   \n * Adjustable, tool-free steel motor cam lock\n   \n   \n * Precise depth adjustments in 1/64-inch increments\n   \n   \n * Easily tackles even the toughest hardwoods\n   \n   \n * Three-year limited warranty; one-year free service\n\nPOWER AND PERFORMANCE\nThis kit's DW616M 1-3/4 horsepower, 11 amp motor provides all the power, durability, and versatility required on professional job sites. A dust-sealed switch protects against dust ingestion for longer switch life, and the motor housing is nickel plated for a smooth, long-lasting depth adjustment. \n\nWith a micro-fine depth adjustment ring, you can count on accurate adjustment in 1/64-inch increments, while a clear, Lexan sub-base ensures durability, visibility, and the ability to accept standard template guide bushings. The included sub-base concentricity gauge enhances accuracy even further by helping you maintain bit concentricity, and long, eight-slot collets that are self-releasing provide excellent bit retention for dependability. \n\nCOMFORT AND CONVENIENCE\nA steel motor cam lock and quick-release motor latches make adjustments and base changes tool-free, fast and easy when you need to switch tasks, and a unique, detachable cordset helps keep this tool easy to service. The over-molded, rubber handles and well-balanced body will keep you working comfortably for hours. The unique switch and cordset configuration allows you to keep the switch in your right or left hand, and a flat top further increases to ease of bit and depth changes. \n\nWARRANTY\nThis DEWALT tool is backed by three-year limited warranty covering any defects due to faulty materials or workmanship (from the date of purchase). It's also covered by DEWALT's one-year free service contract, where DEWALT will maintain the tool and replace worn parts caused by normal use--for free.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nDEWALT DW616 fixed base router with DW616M motor pack; DW6184 fixed base; 1/4- and 1/2-inch collets, sub-base concentricity gauge; two wrenches; operating instructions\n\nMicro-fine depth adjustment ring provides precise depth adjustments in 1/64-inch increments (view larger). \n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nPowered by an 11 amp motor, this fixed base router features the micro-fine depth adjustment ring which provides precise, quick depth adjustments in 1/64-inch increments and constant switch and cordset location.
