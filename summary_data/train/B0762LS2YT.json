Microphone rod looks just cool and works really well. There are two microphones on the end to deal with NC function. Bunch of options in the app. On top the packaging is very luxurious, would do as perfect gift. I use it on my PC and PS4. Price is a bargain for such a set. Definitely 5 stars.",

      "text": "My husband started to play on his PS4 again, but with a little child it was important to maintain low noise levels. That is way I turned to Amazon in search for gaming headphones. I showed him several options and my husband picked this one. After using it for a week he couldn't be more happy (I'm happy too, I can't hear any gunshots in the house :)). The sound is superb as well a comfort and overall quality of this product. I know that such good headphones are very pricey on the high street (starting from \u00a380), so this half price alternative will serve us well.",

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\nChristopher Hagen5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent price for excellent productReviewed in the United States on August 25, 2018Style: Over Ear - VRColor: BlackVerified Purchase Amended review - my previous review was based on a poor experience that ended up being mostly my own fault.\n\nFirst things first - the user manual is not perfectly clear on proper setup - for setup using the software you can download from the website, just don't even unpack the 3.5mm audio jack - use only the USB.\n\nThe sound on these things is amazing. Once customized to suit you, and using the 7.1 surround setting, everything is just perfect. I have never heard Pink Floyd or played Overwatch or watched a movie in such immersion before. Using discord and other voice chat or recording services, the mic pickup is clear and loud, and the noise cancelling works great to deaden nearby fans or a TV playing a movie or TV show. Well worth the price.\n\nWhen the bass hits, you feel it. It's not painful or uncomfortable, but your skin ripples like a stone into a calm body of water. Pressure is not excessive, the headmuffs sit very lightly without pressing down or in very hard. The auto-expanding headrest band is not the most comfortable, but is well padded.\n\nI am very pleased.Read more 10 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse OJ A.5.0 out of 5 stars You should get the 1MORE Gaming Headset - great features, super comfortable, and sounds amazing.Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2018Style: Over Ear - VRColor: BlackVerified Purchase The first thing I noticed when trying on this headset was how comfortable it feels. I also own a pair of HyperX Cloud gaming headset and my biggest pet peeve with those is how uncomfortable they feel after a long session of gaming.\n\nI figured to be fair I should try to give the 1MORE's a long gaming session to see how they turned out. I have to say after a good few hours of playing Overwatch, this headset was as comfortable as I first put them on.\n\nThe noise cancelling mic is superb. My friends on our discord noticed I sounded clearer, I didn't even mention I was trying a new headset. The sound quality in general exceeded my expectation. I was hearing things I wasn't able to hear with other headsets.\n\nI also plan to use this headset when I'm listening to music off my laptop while doing work. Everything just sounds warmer and brighter with the 1MORE's.\n\nIf you're a gamer and also want to have a headset where music sounds great in as well then get the 1MORE's. The LEDs are a nice touch as well.Read more 4 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Zack Leger3.0 out of 5 stars Interior speaker guard rubs against my earsReviewed in the United States on June 28, 2019Style: Over Ear - VRColor: BlackVerified Purchase The sound quality and software are excellent. More than enough customization to provide any sound you want.\n\nI have two major issues with this product:\n1. The padding around the ears is too thin. My ears are in constant contact with the plastic speaker guard, and rub against this plastic mesh causing irritation that is often painful. My ears are average in size, and I have never had this problem with other over the ear headphones.\n2. Microphone quality is only alright. It's a big step down from other headphones. Would like to see the next generation of this headset have a true microphone, at least as an option.\n\nMiscellaneous comments:\n1. Surround sound is very good for listening to music.\n2. Any sort of touch, tap, or rub made against the headset or the headset's wire can easily be heard in the headset.\n3. Noise cancellation seems to be nonexistent. The materials alone seal the sound out fine; however, I am unable to notice any sort of noise cancellation.\n4. RGB customization is lacking. Can only change the color, cycle between 3 lighting patterns, and turn ALL the lights on or off. I'd like to disable the RGB on the false mic because I find it distracting, but I cannot without turning off all the other lights.\n5. I have my own audio setup with Voicemeeter for use with soundboards. For some reason, there is severe stuttering when I pass this headset's mic though Voicemeeter. I've tried changing settings on both my audio software and the headset's application with no improvement.Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Brandon Nguyen2.0 out of 5 stars Ok headphones with major flawsReviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020Style: Over Ear - VRColor: BlackVerified Purchase The sound is fine but constant creaking from the aluminum backs get annoying. If you move your neck at all, weather it be the cord coming out of the headset or the stiff headband readjusting itself, a booming creaking sound will echo throughout your ear. Even a light tap will cause the headset to make a vibrating noise.\n\nThe software brings little to nothing to the table as most of them tend to muddy out important sound ques. Also occasionally the headset will just not work for 4 minutes. Not even unplugging and plugging will fix it. You'll need to just sit there and wait for sound to come back.\n\nThe microphone is finicky as it can pick up my keyboard but can barely hear me. I've spent hours adjusting my microphone volume and sensitivity but still have not found a definitive solution. And for some reason what would be 50% volume on one headset will be only 10% volume on this one, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI also have an issue with the comfort, or lack of comfort. I've been this headset constantly over 3 months and I still have issues with the thin padding and hard headband. It feels like the headset just squeezes on my head and the headband just digs into my skull, and after a while the tip of my ears start to hurt from pressing against the plastic. I could readjust the pads to alleviate that issue but doing so will lead to a lessened noise cancellation effect.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Saul5.0 out of 5 stars Everything about these is amazing!Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2018Style: Over Ear - VRColor: BlackVerified Purchase I love these. I also have a pair of $110 dollar Bose headphones and these blow them out of the water in sound quality. They are the same comfortable as the Bose. The 1more are a little more heavy but I don't notice it while wearing them. I like the customizable LED's with their windows app. The mics are good for playing online games with my friends.\n\nI've been comparing these for a few hours to the Bose headphones (listening to flac music files only) and these are much better. I hear a lot more little details in the songs with these. They can get much louder than the Bose. (With the aux cable plugged into a phone or computer theyre not that loud, but when you use the USB cable plugged into a computer they can get crazy loud. 10/100 is about as loud as I ever set them. The noise cancelling is great. Can't hear anything when I'm playing music. I am very impressed in general with these and I would definitely recommend them. I also bought 1more's triple driver earbuds last year and those where great too. 1more is a great company.Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States TOP INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS \nTranslate all reviews to English Jay5.0 out of 5 stars My new daily gaming headsetReviewed in the United Kingdom on January 8, 2020Style: Over Ear - VRColor: BlackVerified Purchase I have worn this headset for a period of 8 hours now and this is what I think about it.\n\nSound - excellent, for the price of \u00a348, the bass and crispness of the audio is very good. The maximum volume is extensive as I am only using a volume of 1/100 (already quite loud for me) on my windows PC. I play computer games such as csgo and enemy footsteps are easily heard.\n\nNoise cancelling - outside noises are less audible when you have the headset on and you pretty much can't hear them at all when you play music\n\nBuild - feels sturdy\n\nComfort - one of the best features, even after 8 hours the material felt great on my ears. The adjustable head band is easy to use so no unnecessary messing around needed. I liked how the headband stretches instead of being one of those adjustable levels headbands.\n\nMicrophone - pretty clear and no static but all in all quite average. I've used audio chat with some friends and they said it was decent. I wish the microphone was a moveable component such as on many other headsets and took the place of the LED stick (which doesn't really have a useful function) so my voice could be clearer. The LED stick either remains a constant colour (microphone off) or lights up when you speak (microphone on). I guess the flashing would be distracting for others around you but personally you wouldn't be able to see it.\n\nThe software to change the LED and use the special XEAR functions (surround sound, audio clarity etc.) can be downloaded from the usa 1more website. In my opinion they're not that good and I disabled all of them. Also, I think the software messes up the mic quality through the environmental sound cancelling option so you might want to turn that off.\n\nOverall, a very good headset for this price and it will serve as my daily gaming headset from now onRead more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Looks like every detail was thought through including software. Ear cups are very comfortable and flexy adjust in every way. Microphone rod looks just cool and works really well. There are two microphones on the end to deal with NC function. Bunch of options in the app. On top the packaging is very luxurious, would do as perfect gift.\nI use it on my PC and PS4. Price is a bargain for such a set. Definitely 5 stars.Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

That is way I turned to Amazon in search for gaming headphones. I showed him several options and my husband picked this one. After using it for a week he couldn't be more happy (I'm happy too, I can't hear any gunshots in the house :)). The sound is superb as well a comfort and overall quality of this product. I know that such good headphones are very pricey on the high street (starting from \u00a380), so this half price alternative will serve us well.Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

IThey cancelled out the surrounding noise great.The knob for volume AND bass toggling is perfect for switching games and/or to watch videos. The icing on the cake is the customizable LED lights for the headset. I like red, but there are multiple colors for any mood/look you want. Very pleased and would buy the next pair they come out with.Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Please try again Report abuse Michal Wolek5.0 out of 5 stars Very comfortable and stylish gaming headsetReviewed in the United Kingdom on March 27, 2020Style: Over Ear - VRColor: BlackVerified Purchase Pros:\n\nComfortable - I've been wearing it for hours and my ears have not started aching yet, not even once. That was always the problem for me with over-ear headphones, and these fit just great.\n\nStylish - They look great. The LED colours look nice and vibrant. They can also be turned off for more professional setting, when you might need to be video-conferencing for work. They are not overly gamified, so they do not stand out much with the lights off.\n\nUSB/AUX - Can be used both with a USB connection, providing additional features like the LED control and some effects, using the designated software, and with an AUX connection when you just want to connect them to your phone or tablet.\n\nCons:\n\nDrivers - Not included in the box, but that's understandable, as hardly anyone has a CD drive anymore, but there was also no working link to download the drivers reliably. Fortunately I was able to find them on the official website by just Googling the model and scrolling all the way down on the website. Had some hiccups when installing the software first time, but got them working no issues the second time.\n\nNeutral:\n\nFor some reason, the microphone does not want to work on my laptop and only works on my desktop PC, but this might be the issue either with the laptop or my USB-C dongle, so I am not counting this, as they work perfectly on my desktop PC with direct USB connection.\n\nOverall these are great headphones, especially for the price, and I am very happy with these. I was finally able to retire my old headset and pass it on for my brother!Read more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Immaginate le peggiori cuffie cinesi che abbiate mai provate ..peggio! Alch\u00e8 vado a scaricare una app, quella ufficiale one more che ha anche il lettore integrato e l'equilazzatore.. Riesco a migliorare il suono ma anche cos\u00ec non arriva alla qualit\u00e0 di cuffie cinesi di 20\u20ac...con il volume massio imbarazzante. Ok penso sono cuffie pensate per usare la parte usb e con il suo sotfware pc...Allora accendo il pc , windows 10 le riconosce all'istante..penso bene ...vedrai Davide che adesso suoneranno bene...Accendo youtube (ma solo per paragonarle alle cuffie cinesi gaming e non alle sony di 150\u20ac) e sento o meglio non sento quasi i bassi...Allora penso va bhe \u00e8 necessario il software 1more. Vado sul sito consigliato sul foglietto e sul sito...Il sofware \u00e8 scomparso, nel senso che sul sito europeo non \u00e8 possibile scaricarlo! Dopo un p\u00f2 di ricerche su google trovo il sito americano e li c'\u00e8 il software. Lo scarico e come cerco di installarlo windows mi comunica che \u00e8 presente un grave virus! Sono un informatico e sono certo che sia un falso positivo per cui aggiungo un eccezione all'antivirus di windows 10 e procedo. Dopo l'installazione mi si para d'avanti un sofwtare fatto malissimo e con difficolt\u00e0 capisco come si attivano i vari menu (tasto destro sull'icona di speaker ma non c'\u00e8 alcun tool tip di aiuto per capirlo .vergognoso..io lavoro pe una azienda sofware e un minimo di queste cose ne capisco) Abilito le varie funzioni e ce ne sono tantissime...peccato che pi\u00f9 funzioni attivo pi\u00f9 l'audio peggiori. I bassi si possono aumentare ma la qualit\u00e0 \u00e8 vergognosa, i medi e gli alti sono abbastanza buoni , ma davvero i bassi sono solo fastidiosi e questa \u00e8 una cuffia gaming non una cuffia monitor. Sono davvero sconvolto e voglio sperare che mi sia arrivata una cuffia difettosa ma temo che non sia cos\u00ec. Anche in passato ho ascoltato cuffie simili ma non arrivavano a 30 \u20ac..queste costano sul sito americano 100$ ...MA STIAMO SCHERZANDO? A questo punto posso solo pensare che le recensioni siano state pagate ad arte. Mi spiace fare l'ennesimo reso, ma fin quando trover\u00f2 prodotti scadenti non posso fare altro che restituirli. La cosa pi\u00f9 che mi di spiace che dal punto di vista costruttivo le cuffie sono stupende , esteticamente parlando sono bellissime e sono anche comode....ma non c'\u00e8 altro di positivo. Delusione TOTALE!Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Tale fascia \u00e8 ricoperta in finta pelle e tessuto, i padiglioni sono realizzati in plastica e sono ricoperti da un disco con scanalature circolari, con una serie di scritte in bianco. Le scritte, insieme ai loghi 1More sull'archetto e all'asta estraibile sul padiglione sinistro, si illuminano grazie ai LED inseriti all'interno. L'asta estraibile non contiene il microfono, ma funge solo da elemento estetico e da indicazione sull'attivit\u00e0 del microfono (dal momento che l'illuminazione \u00e8 attiva in corrispondenza con la rilevazione di suoni).\nNel complesso, la qualit\u00e0 costruttiva delle 1More Spearhead VRX \u00e8 elevata per un prodotto di questo tipo.\nPassiamo al confort, l\u2019imbottitura dei padiglioni sono ricoperti in morbido tessuto che potrebbe sembrare scomodo ma posso assicurarvi che dopo un po anzich\u00e8 dare fastidio sembre come se si adattassero, in pratica si sopportano benissimo anche dopo lunche sessioni di gioco.\nSul fronte della connettivit\u00e0, le 1More Spearhead VR offrono sia il tradizionale jack da 3,5 mm (TRRS, ovvero a quattro poli) sia la connessione USB tramite micro-USB. Quest'ultima fa s\u00ec che sia possibile bypassare la scheda audio interna del computer per sfruttare invece l'elaborazione interna alle cuffie e il relativo software. Il padiglione sinistro ospita, oltre ai due connettori di cui sopra, una rotella per la regolazione del volume e un tasto per accendere o spegnere il microfono. Premendo la rotella si pu\u00f2 passare, nel caso di utilizzo dell'ingresso USB, alla regolazione dei bassi, avendo quindi accesso rapido all'equalizzazione.\nIl software \u00e8 la parte centrale di queste cuffie:\nesso permette infatti di regolarne tutte le funzionalit\u00e0, dal colore dei LED (che sono infiniti) fino all'equalizzazione e agli effetti sonori. Il driver, scaricabile dal sito del produttore, include anche la suite di controllo. La schermata principale include la regolazione del volume, dei bassi e del volume del microfono, oltre ai controlli della cancellazione del rumore del microfono.\nIl 7.1 virtuale e la chicca di queste cuffie secondo me a questo prezzo non si pu\u00f2 chiedere di meglio, vi baster\u00e0 configurare le impostazioni tramite il software ed il gioco \u00e8 fatto.\nL'impatto sui giochi \u00e8 grande Ci si sente in mezzo all'azione ed \u00e8 possibile sentire i nemici alle spalle o ai lati con precisione, posizionandoli nello spazio e avendo quindi un'idea di quali azioni sia necessario compiere.\nIl microfono funziona benissmo chi vi sente dall'altra parte vi sentir\u00e0 chiaro e pulito, grazie anche alla cancellazione del suono.\nNel complesso posso dire che queste cuffie sono davvero ben fatte, appaiono come un prodotto valido per qualit\u00e0 e prezzo.Read more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Al riordino mi hanno applicato lo stesso prezzo in offerta anche se era scaduta. Le cuffie sono top, se uso sia per la ps4 che per ascoltare e produrre musica su pc.
