That's what will happen if you don't want the 15 minutes between drinking and testing.

Its VERY finicky and hard to learn to use, and there is EXTREME emphasis on NOT drinking for 20mins before taking your BAC level... it will play funny tricks on it (ie not scanning your bac, or scanning too high, or erroring out). Overall, it seems accurate enough to trust it that it wont let my BAC be over what is says.",

Either way, It's a fun toy for a party and strikes up good conversation. Also helps to prevent a DUI or if you just want to prove who's drunker!",
