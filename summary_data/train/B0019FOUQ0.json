I did it in under 15 minutes. However, the ease of building also means that it's not entirely sturdy; because there is no adhesive used, the poles frequently jiggle out of place and my shoes slide down the poles and onto the floor. For the price, it's not a bad shelf, especially for someone on a tight budget who needs extra floor space (a college kid, for instance), but I wouldn't recommend this as a permanent fixture in your home. It's a little ugly and doesn't always work well.",

Another problem were the bars constantly falling off and shoes falling on the ground. It was nice for the 1st month or so. But once the racks started falling off, kind of a hassel for the next 10 months until it broke. It would be best to hang on a door you do not use.

This eliminated the swinging of the rack every time the door opened but at same time put it \"essentially behind the door\" in a space that wouldn't be used otherwise. I freed up a lot of space by eliminating shelving for shoes. I really like the ability to flip a rack up so you have more height for boots.",

I have more shoes and there isn't enough space for them! I had to flip my hi tops upside down to fit them in. This is possibly the worst thing I've bought on amazon. Horrible.",

I saw a number of negative reviews about this shoe rack about it not being sturdy, but it was a tip from a previous reviewer that prompted me to give this rack a try. When you assemble this rack, use a rubber mallet to press poles into supports until completely inserted and snug. You can use a regular hammer as well with a towel or block of wood to protect plastic rack supports. We have tried other floor based shoe racks that did not work well but this rack is very sturdy when assembled correctly and holds a lot of shoes or boots.",
