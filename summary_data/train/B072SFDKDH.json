The app seems to be well built and doesn\u2019t look sketchy like some I\u2019ve seen. Not so good news: This is not Apple HomeKit compatible. The instructions include a way to create a Siri shortcut to operate the control by voice, but it\u2019s neither as seamless nor as reliable as normal HomeKit devices. If you want to use geofencing you have to give the app full time permission to access your location, something I\u2019m loath to do. I recommend this device, but I\u2019m still waiting for the promise of home automation to be mature.",

As far as the app, well I set a schedule to close at 930pm. Since the door was already closed, the app opened the door instead. I tested again by creating an \u201copen\u201d schedule while the door was open, and it closed the door. Scheduling open or closes is worthless in my opinion.",
