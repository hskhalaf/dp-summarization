Everyone should use hydration moisturizer (every day), retinol and vit c at least every other day. I alternate using retinol and vit c and people have noticed the difference. Try it!!",

Stable collagen production fights wrinkles, and ensures evenness in the skin's tone and texture. Vitamin C's function as an antioxidant also benefits the skin, as it is able to protect the skin from damaging free radicals.",

I kept using it and bought it the second time but still didn't see much difference and didn't buy it again. It's way over priced and doesn't last long.",
