Not cheap so pretty not happy.",

TYMPANIC (ear) is the most accurate reading as someone who used to work in the Medical field. This new model by Braun is a dream! Must purchase for your little ones and adults. Easily operable.

It measures the temperature within seconds, provides accurate readings, has built-in light that is great for measuring toddler's temperature at night. It also has an option to display temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit. It comes with 20 lens filters, so can be used right away. On a side note, I would recommend to make sure to purchase right lens filters for this model as they can drastically affect the accuracy of reading. I would recommend ordering the filters from Target or other store as the ones I got from Amazon were not right.",

It's a major annoyance and I wish I had known this before buying. I have no infants or toddlers in my house, so why do I have to keep selecting \"adult\" before I use? You should be able to set it to the age, and forget about it from then on.",

This turns taking the temperature into a chore as you have to do it multiple times, trying to figure out if it's working or not, until you find a magic angle which doesn't cause the lens to displace.",
