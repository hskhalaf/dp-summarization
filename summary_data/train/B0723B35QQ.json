I have rinsed and applied a light dish soap to this product about ten times now and it is like new. This is a fabulous item to add to your new kitchen especially at the price! On each side is like a little trough, so it holds crackers or pickled vegetables well. The owner sent me a handwritten thank you letter which was what sealed the deal that this product was not only great quality but so was the company that made it.",

You can fit a lot of meat and cheese on this board and it is great for entertaining or just a Friday night in with family. Easy to clean and store. For the price this cheese board is amazing! Unrelated to the product but very helpful; it also came with a measuring guide for everyday cooking which I find really helpful because it's hanging on my fridge.",
