      "title": "Great addition to the white wooden rocking chairs  on my front porch",
      "text": "I purchased this chair for the short end of my covered front porch. I purchased cushions at a local Home store because without them the back was uncomfortable and the seat was a bit low. Unfortunately the back pillow hides the beautiful design but it can\u2019t be helped. The color of the chair is a matte black. I assembled it myself in about 30 minutes using only the tools that came with it. The diagram could\u2019ve been clearer so I suggest that you familiarize yourself with the list of screws, washers and nuts before you begin. The chair is sturdy and comfortable. I highly recommend it",
