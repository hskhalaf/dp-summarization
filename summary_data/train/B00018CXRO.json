Unit itself has adjustable grind, and can hold more than enough ground coffee to make coffee for 2-4 people. Adjusting the fine/coarse setting is simple and well marked, and the rest of the function is self explanatory. I've bought this unit twice and am considering buying another for my house.",

      "text": "As others have mentioned, the bottom ground coffee receptacle is attached to the grinder with a brittle plastic \"click and twist\" connector. This cracked within two months of light used. I taped it and got a few more months of use, until the plastic flange broke off. There's got to be some daydreaming millenial over at Bialetti headquarters who reads Amazon reviews and can suggest a design change, no? Hey, I'm talkin to you, Lorenzo. Capiche?",
