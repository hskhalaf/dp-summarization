The little rubber button to activate is too easily bumped when stored in the flimsy storage bag. I drained a number of batteries without knowing at least one flare had activated in the bag. Flare button needs to be redesigned to have a small protector 'hood' or something over it to keep it from accidentally being activated when in the bag. The pouches in the bag are almost worthless and need to be redesigned with sturdier and thicker/foam fabric to help prevent flares impacting each other.",

This then bleeds the batteries without you ever knowing. The fix for this is to leave one battery out of each light and store it in the handy little pouch that I'm guessing was designed for this purpose. I've bought a set for each car.",

I'm buying another set for my second car! Great idea well executed.",
