When you first take it out of the bag, it is new of course so it's pretty fluffy, your pet may tumble over a little bit until it stabilizes and takes to his/her shape. After that, you're golden. It's soft, deep and dark, just like they want it! You should get it, in fact, get two, so you don't have to keep taking it to one room to another all the time like I do. I'm ordering another!",

Without being prompted! As soon as they laid down, I knew this was the right pick for my cat. It\u2019s the perfect size for him. Here\u2019s a photo of him enjoying it the first night. Haven\u2019t washed it yet and I received it today, so I can\u2019t speak to the durability and washing of this product yet. I will update my review if anything changes.",

We loved the beige color too and it looks great given his coloring so we don't see his fur all over it. We just wish it was slightly bigger.",

It is extremely soft and has a smooth bottom. There is no shedding of the fabric at all. OK bottom line you know how finicky cats can be and how they immediately know if something has changed in their domain. My cat went and checked it out and as soon as I put a couple of treats in it to attract his attention, it became his new lounge area.",

I'm thinking about getting him another one because he loves it so much...but then it won't have his smells in it (even though it smells like his vomit - yuk).
