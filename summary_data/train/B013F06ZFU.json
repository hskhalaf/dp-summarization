I have used it for one or two seasons and it has held up quite well. No bends, chips, or cracks. The plugs sometimes get caught in one of the tubes and it can be a bear to get out. I wish the handle was \"T\" shaped so that it is easier to hold and use. However, I did like the metal ring on the end of the handle for easily hanging in my shed.",

It will occasionally plug up depending on the consistency of the soil...soft wet ground will not have the power to push the core out, but will yield laterally to leave a hole. Carry an appropriate sized stick or rod to clear the tubes. My only gripe is that I wish the handle were a few inches longer.",

You do need to push harder if you are a smaller person (my son is about 100 pounds and he couldn\u2019t easily do it ). But for me it was easy. The plugs come straight up through as you go to the next push. No clogging if you keep pushing out the dirt. Lawn guy wanted $250 because he Needed to rent a heavy machine so I figured I would try this. It\u2019s sturdy and well work the money. Put on music and go to town on your lawn :)",

Also, the pole grip is made of a hard rubber, and my hands became sore and abraded after an extended time aerating (padded gloves recommended, which I didn't use). Lastly, the two cutting tines could have been sharper, as it did take some effort forcing them into the ground, though ground was a bit dry. I would like to see Garden Weasel make a version with a cross bar, which I would buy. I will likely return this one.",

The hands have to go down some and puts wrist in a slightly strained' position. It did not hurt, just awkward. For the price, the quality and solidness are great. Holes are big too.",

Others have mentioned the welds inside the core tubes as being a little rough which made the cores stick, but on mine the welds were very smooth. It worked really well. I used it to do some smaller areas on my lawn I couldn't get to with a larger aerator pulled behind my lawn mower.",

I had to soak it and then take a screwdriver and poke the dirt up. So now the tool is poking holes but not allowing the dirt to flow out the top. Maybe I did something wrong and there were some directions I should have followed, or the dirt in Southern CA is just to hard for this tool to truly work properly.",
