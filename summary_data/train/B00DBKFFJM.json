Then the next step is to send a warranty claim and they warn in big bold letters: If you send two claims, we will deny your warranty request!! I almost feel like i'm causing them a serious inconvenience with my warranty claim. mastitis, engorgement, baby feeding, not having a pump for two weeks are all problems that they seem very unconcerned about.",

Seriously, it is almost a crime that the insurance companies just give out inferior pumps when this is available. I was concerned when returning to work with my second baby that I would not be able to produce enough milk. With my first, I pumped like 6 times a day at work to make enough with my Medela PISA. Now, those worries are gone. Totally gone! The proof is in the pictures. 10 mins of total comfort and quiet on the Spectra vs 20 mins of loud wrenching and pulling on the PISA.",

I have tried the Medela Symphony in the hospital, a PISA, the Ameda Purely Yours, and the Evenflo none come close to this pump. The problem is these pumps die and the manufacturer warranty does not apply to Amazon purchases. I have now had two of these die in 9 months. What happens is when you turn the off the screen goes off but the machine will continue to pump until the battery dies, and then it will never turn back on. I am now buying a third pump :(",

So far the battery works really well (I pump 40 mins each time, also on the roads so usually not plugged). Really happy with the purchase and highly reccomend! The only downside is with the bottles- they don't screw very well so lost a few amounts of milk (3 bottles and probably still counting).. :/",

Battery life is pretty great - it only required charging every few days. I'd always get a good amount of milk every time. Pump parts were replaced only once (probably should've replaced them 2-3x). I found the tubing became loose at the base where it attaches to the pump frequently. The Spectra bottles weren't great (no venting) so I'd transfer the milk to a Dr. Brown's bottle every time. Overall, I don't have any complaints about the Spectra. It's quiet, battery operated and portable and worked very well for me.",

It also gives you the ability to change the cycle and suction levels for the letdown and expression phase to your liking. Spectra also has a Facebook forum that you could ask questions and also read other mothers questions and answers.

I love how the vacuum and speed settings are both adjustable so you can get the best output and can be customizable for each person as well as throughout your pump session if needed or over the course of your breastfeeding journey. It's definitely more gentle than the Medela pump in style advance I used through two children! I used this spectra pump three times a day five days a week for almost a year at work (went back when baby was 3 months and stopped pumping at 14 months). I never had any issues with it and it worked great.",

Highly recommend especially with all the different settings you can make it totally customizable for your total comfort level!",

The S1 is portable and quickly rechargeable for active moms, and also quiet and discreet for soothing pumping. The added night light allows you to easily pump at any hour. This pump conveniently weighs only 2.9lbs. With a maximum suction strength of 250mmHg and the ability to be used as a single or double pump, the S1 will be a great asset in your breastfeeding journey. The S1's completely flexible, touch button, with the S1 pump's digital controls allow you to set the pumping program to the speed and rhythm most effective for your body. The suction is adjustable in both let-down and expression mode. This quiet pump also includes a timer. \nOur Founder, Heidi Humphries, insisted on the quietest motor available for the S1Plus, which when in the \u201cmassage mode\u201d simulates the natural suckling of baby. Spectra Baby spent years developing features for the S1 Plus like \u201cbackflow protection\u201d to keep your breast milk from harmful bacteria. We thought hard about things like \u201cadjustable suction levels\u201d because it provides a more natural flow of milk.\n\nWe are moms. We are nurses. We understand.",
