I bought it for a choke type application, but it'll come in handy for years to come. At under $20, it's well worth it.",

I then needed to lift a tractor implement and didn't have any chain, so I made it work with this strap and some large D-rings. Bought another just to have more lifting options. Pay attention to the weight ratings- you don't want to try and lift a D5 and then crawl under it like a moron. But for normal stuff, lifting a mower up to scrape the deck or sharpen the blades, these straps are great. Plus you don't have to worry about scratching paint the same way you would with chain.",
