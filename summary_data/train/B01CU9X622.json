I am currently eavesdropping on my children as they participate in a very serious situation involving batman, some kind of skeleton creature and bunny scissor laser beams. All of this is based on a scenario which is has to do with the bridge. Typically Lego sets are built, dismantled and the Legos are then added to are immense collection. This set however has become a staple to imaginary play. It certainly deserves at least 5 stars.",

This set for $100 is already a good deal and it's even better since you can get it on Amazon for $80 right now. This set is great to look at and fun to setup.",
