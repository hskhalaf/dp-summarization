      "text": "I bought this case for my niece who is a Pokemon fanatic at the moment, but was a little skeptical of how much she would use it given that kids aren't known for placing a lot of value on keeping things in good shape. I was pleased to find out that I was very wrong. She loves it and uses it to store her DS and all her favorite games. If you or your kid love pokemon, you can't go wrong with this case. It seems to have pretty solid construction and isn't just cheap plastic either.",

Update 9/2/2017: Case is still going strong! The soft touch rubber/silicone interior has held up wonderfully for minor drops. The case has minimal scuffs and the picture is still gorgeous. I really can't express how happy I am to have purchased this.",

Sad to say i sent it back and am waiting on a refund so i can order o diffrent case that i hopefully wont have this problem with even tho this one had the design i liked the most. UPDATE: they sent me a new one instead of a refund. After using it for 6 months, it scratches really easy and the games fall out. Also if you wanna upgrade to the \u201cnew\u201d 3ds xl, it fits but it also powers on every time.",
