I will be taking this to my trip to the Philippines. Many beaches and islands to go to and i cannot wait to use this. I feel like a little kid using this and showing my husband what it can do.

Using the camera on his bike and skateboard also pise challenges, but despite our rough roads, the film is clear, albeit a bit goofy. We are very happy with the battery life, ease of uploading, and waterproof quality during storms. Great purchase and highly recommended.",

The camera fell off somewhere in Yosemite, leaving only a thin layer of the adhesive in its place. Great video lost forever. I have old helmets with GoPro mounts still adhered to them. They're next to impossible to remove. This adhesive though, is an otherwise great product's Achilles heel. UPDATE: Although I did not expect it, Akaso replaced the camera! That changes everything. Aside from the adhesive, this is a GREAT camera. I'm changing my review from one star to five.",

Hardly worth calling it audio recording at all. If you do not have video editing software, don't bother with the time delay as well. Unlike most smart phones that stitch the individual images back together, the camera saves them as individual files. No big deal if you know what you're doing, but for a novice this might be challenging. If this camera broke, would I buy it again. Absolutely. Are you getting all the features of the latest GoPro.

Comes with a bunch of mounting options and remote control. Cons: No chest strap. There is no add on filter capability. This is a serious shortcoming and one the manufacturer should address. This is odd for a camera that is listed as suitable for SCUBA. You must have a filter underwater to get decent colors. I would also like to add a polarized filter for daylight. Other reviewers have come up with workarounds for retrofitting scuba filters.",

Other than that, it's a really decent and light weight camera. It comes with a lot of useful adapters. The housing and mounting systems are similar to the GoPro.

The quality of the picture and the length of recording are great. I bought a micro SD card for 4K video from my local warehouse store for $10 and it works great.

I'm confused by all these other reviews raving about the image quality, because it's not even close to a GoPro but I will say it's nice that you get a whole assortment of accessories. It's a good camera for putting into dangerous situations as a crash cam knowing that it'll likely get destroyed. But don't buy it thinking it'll be good for capturing precious memories.",

He loves it and it was definitely worth the price of $40-ish but overall, the picture quality is t that great and the sounds is barely audible. Good buy for kids who have no idea of quality but not a great but for adults or those seeking a higher quality product.",

Using it with the open case was great and the camera's mic captured all surrounding noise. The remote is also very handy.
