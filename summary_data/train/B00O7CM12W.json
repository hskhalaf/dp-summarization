No problem - with this TENS unit, I can place the electrodes on the different spots and get relief all at once. It has eight electrode pads. Shoulders, hips, back - all getting treatment at once. I would definitely recommend this unit. Great value!",

Their response was to tell me that this unit is made like that. They added that it's only recommended for elderly patients with very limited sensation. I am in my forties. By my estimate (and according to their logic), you might want to wait until you're in your 130's before you try this unit.",

Also, the standard timer setting is excessively above anything I have ever heard recommended by a physician.

It\u2019s more of an EMS than a TENS, per se, because the muscles will contract and release as it operates.
