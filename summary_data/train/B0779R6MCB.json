For the perfect solution: I ended up going back to weekly claw trimming, and buying a few more scratching posts. They\u2019re doing a great job using the scratching posts instead of the furniture, their paws don\u2019t hurt, and everyone is happier.

Easy application and I try to put on one nail at a time then reward my cat with a treat. It is important to distract them for a few minutes while the glue dries else they'll run and hide, shake their paws, and try to tear the nail off. My advice would be to do it in a bathroom or room where they can't run off and have some toys around to distract them. Not much glue is needed either! WORTH THE BUY!!!!!!!",
