      "text": "We purchased this heater on 1/8/18. It stopped working on 2/11/18. For about a month we really enjoyed using it. We liked that you could chose a temperature and it would turn on/off automatically to keep the room at that temperature. For instance, we would set the temperature to 72 for our baby's nursery, and it would keep that room very comfortable for a baby, while the rest of the house we kept cooler per our preference. For being so expensive, this malfunction should not be happening after one month. I cannot recommend this product.",

Vornados are very safe because the heat is designed to be low enough that combustion is very unlikely. Of course it has a shut off in case of tip over. The only thing I don't like is the electronic control. It is difficult to see the set temperature in the dark and there seems to be a several degree variation from the set temperature. I was happier with the less expensive version that just had a knob to adjust the temperature you want.",

There is very poor quality control. It is junk. You can not rely on it. A total waste of money.",
