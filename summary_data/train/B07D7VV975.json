I recommend purchase a flat design that you have to pry off. Current I have gorilla tape out the outlet with the covers still installed. This is more effective at the moment. original review: It's easy to use but a little tough to come out which can be a good thing because it is hard for you, it will definitely be difficult for you kid",
