      "text": "I bought this size (12\") for the shower, but would work equally well on outside windows, but think I'd prefer the 18\" size for that. This squeegee comes with a 2nd replacement rubber blade. The rubber is soft, supple and as such does a great job of not streaking and keeps our shower looking sparkling clean. It is built well and should last a lifetime. Recommend and would buy again.",

There is nothing I don\u2019t like about this squeegee and find that the pivoting handle and improved channel has enhanced my ability to get streak free windows. Every home owner should upgrade to a well made squeegee and stop wasting their time and efforts with cheap squeegees. A good squeegee makes a big difference in the outcome and is money well spent.",

    "description": "Sorbo Fast Release Swivel Handle with an outlet for safety line on top. Its spring-loaded lower jaw prevents accidental openings. This is the fastest fast release on the market. It is not necessary to slide the handle to the end of the squeegee to release, it snaps off wherever it is located. It can also slide back and forth to allow better reach. And with the swivel, overhead windows can be cleaned horizontally from a standing position. Its handle grip fits most poles on the market. Sorbo 3x4 Adjustable Squeegees are the safest, lightest and straightest squeegees. Made from extruded high-quality aluminum alloy, they are extraordinarily rigid and strong to give unparalleled consistency and durability, but lightweight to help prevent user fatigue. Being rigid they apply even pressure from end to end, assuring streak-free windows. It is adjustable with four settings which make it possible to reduce firmness when cleaning high windows from the ground. Tips are angled at 40 degrees to prevent the frame from coming in contact with the window frame while allowing the rubber blade to clean closer to frames and corners. Sorbo Squeegee Blade is composed of a special blend of natural rubber to ensure resiliency and superior consistency. This formula allows for better adaptability to window glass irregularities to make window cleaning easier and faster. It is very smooth and slides easily on the window (requires little pressure on glass). Special rubber blend allows for longer shelf life, greater temperature resistance and longer usage life than other squeegee rubber.",
