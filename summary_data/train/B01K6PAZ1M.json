Annoying slippery and little to no grip when naturally held in the hand. Prepare to drop this constantly..

It\u2019s not as bulky as the OtterBox Defender that I have used on previous phones and you definitely get better screen clarity if you apply a screen protector directly versus the integrated one on the Defender. The trade off is that it probably will not provide the same level of protection when dropped on its face on a non-flat surface (a rock, etc), because the Defender has more pronounced raised edges on the front than this model.",

The case was relatively easy to put on the phone and seems to be well constructed. It is not waterproof and there is no screen protection. It ads very little bulk to the phone. My biggest concerns are the little rubber tab which covers the lightning port and the lack of a rubberized grip surface on the case. I believe that the lightning port tab will wear our very soon and the lack of a non-slick gripping surface is a real design flaw.",

On the new SE, Apple moved the logo on the back of the phone down an inch, so the logo doesn't line up with the round window on the back of the case. So if you put this case on the SE, you'll just have a blank circle on the back of your case. Otherwise it fits perfectly. OtterBox needs to design a new case for the SE.",

I just felt a lot safer with the defender, but if you're not too worried and like something more slim this is the case for you.",
