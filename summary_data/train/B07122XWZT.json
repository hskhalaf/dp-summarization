When cruising, you need dress-up clothes for formal nights, casual wear for casual nights and. of course, sports wear. That being the case, we generally have two bags each to schlep through the airports. We need bags that maneuver easily and these double-wheel garment bags fit the bill perfectly. They're easy to pack and easy to roll through busy airports. We purchased one and loved it so much we purchased a second one.",

      "text": "I was considering this bag and a Samsonite equivalent. I decided to give this one a try since it has spinners and is 50% cheaper. I find the build quality to be less than the Samsonite. The zippers are a bit rough on corners. There is no internal storage space except in the corners and on the flap of the fold over for the suit. I use packing cubes to take up the extra space and add more capacity to the bag. The handle is a bit flimsy, but works. The bag is a little taller optimal. The bag comes with one hanger and a detachable hook. I have checked the luggage once on travel, and it worked fine.",

He preferred to not have to check a bag, and this bag fit the bill for 2- or 3-day trips. He is very happy to be able to stow everything in the overhead bin. Zippers are sturdy. My son decorated the handle with yarn, so the bag in the pics is personalized, and I snapped these after two trips, so the bag in the pics is not brand new. I would definitely buy this bag again.",

Probably only good for a short trips when you're packing light. Clothes unpacked with no need to iron. My only improvement suggestion is that the top/front portion could be made a bit more sturdy - as it collapsed a bit when I put my laptop case on top to allow me to roll both in tandem.",
