Unplug it, plug it back it back in and it finally scans. When it does work, I've never been able to scan more than two pages at a time and sometimes only one of two pages will scan. It just stops scanning. I really wish I would have paid the extra money for a new one!",

The interface makes it easy to save scanned files to directories on a local drive, or a network location. The only quirk I've found is that if you're scanning multiple documents of different sizes together, the largest document must be scanned first.

The software that comes with it is easy and smooth to use unlike the stuff that's often bundled with hardware.

This is a serious oversight and a debilitating limitation. I would have bought a dozen of these scanners for my business except that it won't work with the TWAIN compatible scanning software we use. So what's left is a nice desktop scanner that can only be used with its own included software--and for that it is way overpriced.",

I'm looking forward to learning more about the document management and search features so I can organize my documents. The purpose of the purchase was not to go completely paperless, but to consolidate the yearly documents and make them easily accessible in case I need to grab and go in an emergency. Now I just need to find a safe way to store my digital data!",

I plan on scanning all of my receipts also so I don't have baskets around containing numerous receipts. Now if only it had software to capture receipt information so I could track spending on specific items. I am well aware of another well advertised scanner that has that feature, so it would be great if the Fujitsu scanner added that capability.",

Amazingly fast, creates high-quality scans; jams occasionally but not very often. OCR works very well -- and works no matter which orientation is used for the paper feeding. I highly recommend this gadget for paper hoarders determined to go digital.",

      "text": "This is the best paper feed scanner out there. The size is small when compared to typical scanners. It is very very fast and and easy to use. The best part of it all is that if you put documents with clips or staples which jam the scanner it is built in such a way that it will be very easy to remove the documents without damaging the scanner. Makes scanning a breeze and the best thing is that you won't have to worry about other damaging it. Finally, when you put away all of its compartments, it will not use much space. Two thumbs up for this bad boy.",

For quick scanning - even lots of pages - this is good value. Earlier versions required you to chose between the PC or Mac software, but I think current models some with the software to support either one.",
