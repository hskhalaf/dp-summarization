All of them have been amazing, although Hickory is still my favorite. This product is the real deal, and the flavor proves it! Beware of cheap brands!!! Cheaper brands use cheaper hardwoods and simply flavor the wood with Hickory (or other) oil. This never works right, because the true flavor comes from the thermal breakdown of the various lignins that make up each kind of wood. Simply adding an oil doesn't do the trick. I'm using all of these in my Smoke Hollow 26142E 26-Inch Electric Smoker, and the results are finger-lickin' good!",

Looks like someone topped off the bag with these large \"chips\". I would have retured the bag, but it was too late as it had been a few months since I ordered it. I had to throw out those large chunks as there was no easy way to cut them smaller (I tried!).",

Get a bag or two of this and you will NOT regret it!!!",

It makes me so happy that the best wood chips I've used are also the cheapest I've used. This is some really good stuff.",

    "title": "Western Premium BBQ Smoking Chips, Apple BBQ",
    "description": "Flavor:AppleEnjoy the distinct apple smoke flavor from Western Premium BBQ Products. Take your cookout to the next level with Western Premium BBQ Products Apple BBQ Smoking Chips. They are made from real heat-treated apple wood to deliver a robust flavor to every meal. Apple smoke can give your smoked meats a bold new layer of flavor. Smoking chips are a great way to add depth to the taste of your next barbequed meal. Kudos to you, fellow grill master. You got this far by adding some wood smoking chips to your grill to infuse your meats with an apple flavor. Western Premium BBQ Products Apple BBQ Smoking Chips are easy to use and they work on gas grills, charcoal grills, and electric smokers. The next time you\u2019re thinking of making smoked meat for the family, add some Western Premium BBQ Products Apple BBQ Smoking Chips to the grilling process. Be the cookout hero your friends and family deserve! If you\u2019re using wood chips for smoking your meats on a gas or charcoal grill, place dry wood chips in a foil pack or a smoke box and place them over the heat. Let the apple chips start smoking, and then move them to one side of your grill. Place your meat on the grill and close the lid. Cook to time or temperature you normally would, keeping the lid closed as much as possible. If you\u2019re using wood smoking chips in a charcoal grill, load your grill with lump charcoal. Light the charcoal using your preferred method; however, we would recommend you avoid using lighter fluid, so your meat retains the natural apple smoke flavor. Several minutes prior to cooking, fill a smoker tray or a foil pouch with one to two handfuls of chips. Place the tray or pouch on the hottest part of the grill surface until it begins to smoke. Once the chips have begun smoking, move them with tongs to make room for your future meal. Add your meat to the grill, close the lid, and smoke until you achieve that great apple smoke flavor.",
