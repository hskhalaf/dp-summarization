      "text": "Very spacious backpack with 6 pockets. Each pocket can be used ( a lot of backpacks have a bunch of small pockets that can\u2019t be used) Small when nothing is in it but can fit all of my books for this semester! Has a nice organizer pocket for pens/pencils/calculator. Has a tablet and a laptop pocket. My favorite feature of this backpack is the cushion for your back. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the zippers are a bit wonky. They don\u2019t zip effortlessly and get a little stuck in certain spots. Other than that hiccup I would defiantly recommend to a friend.",

      "text": "Bought this for my son for school. He needs to carry a 3\u201d zippered binder, a lunchbox and a Chromebook in a slim case. Unfortunately, it did not all fit in this backpack. I would think most backpacks like this should be able to hold a 3\u201d binder, but that was definitely the item that made this a no-go. Returned and replaced with a Jansport (his previous one lasted 6 years, we were just looking for something different...). A few other notes: I\u2019ve had a High Sierra backpack (non-laptop style) for years and love it. Fabulous quality and comfortable to wear. The zippers on this one snagged more than expected, and the overall weight was heavier as well.",

I bought 5 different types of high sierra bags for my children and these far exceeded all of the others. I am planning on only buying this style of high sierra bag for my kids school bag too!

Also, the product does NOT match the picture. every part (zippers, bottom & trim) showing black in the photo is actually blue on the backpack. Photo matches his original backpack, so that was a bit surprising and misleading that it didn't match what was shipped, especially since this purchase was from High Sierra themselves.",

Typically I carry around 2 laptops with me, 17inch, and 15 inch..... They both fit easily and they feel safe in their compartments. Dimensions of the EON 17x - and it fits with about a half an inch on the top. Hope this helps you decide if it can fit your laptop! -Height = 1.5 inches -Width 16.46 inches -depth 11.1 inches.",

It has adequate pockets for keeping items separate and good quality construction feeling in the straps overall. I especially like the mesh pocket sides which allow for carrying a water or other drink bottle (one each side) not taking up any inside the bag space.",

I think this backpack will easily last a couple years. We have seen the exact same one for twice the price ($85) at a popular shopping mall retail store. I truly understand wholesale vs. retail and business markets/markups, but when a family is shopping for school supplies for multiple children the financial burden can seem overwhelming, so finding deals like this one really help relieve some of that stress. Again great product, appealing to my teenager, and I think it is built sturdy enough to last through her last three high school years.",

The only problem is the media zipper at the very top of the backpack. I found that the zipper could zip back slightly when equipping the backpack. One time, I was unaware of this and headed out to school in rainy weather with the media zipper slightly open. Lost a book and several pages of notes to water damage as a result. I fixed it with some duct tape, but that media zipper is still the only thing preventing a solid 5-star rating for this pack.",
