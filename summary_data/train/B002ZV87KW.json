Good thing even though she got the arm off she wasn\u2019t able to open it up to the inside of the bunny. I am impressed though how really sturdy these are and I like the knots in them. I also like the squeaker, it\u2019s a soft sound not loud and annoying like some others.",

I wish the main squeaker worked better. It lasts but doesn't always squeak. Although it is a great design that doesn't puncture and not work like most. Overall, I like it and so does my dog.",

The fabric is tough, and he's adorable, but after a month the squeaker no longer squeaks. I ordered the small cow next, and it's just simply too small. The squeaker is hard to find, and quiet, I think simply because the toy is tiny. I love the design, and the fabric is tough, but... Since I think these have high potential, I will try one more time with a large cow, to see if we can get a longer lifespan.",
