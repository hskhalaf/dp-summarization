My stepdad was able to connect the generator to the main electricity box of the house and thanks to this they are able to have a refrigerator connected, a couple of lights and fans for a few hours per night. So far it has been a great generator, cost efficient and reliable after two months of constant use every night. Highly recommended.",

It runs smooth and is as quite as many of the inverter generators at 58-59db at twenty three feet. I put a meter on it and the voltage is dead on at 60 cycles. I will buy a Champion again but that may be many years in the future. This small one can run a 5k -7kbtu window A/C. I just checked the sound in my camper with Windows open at about 50 feet and I got a reading of 36db. That is very quiet!!",

I would put hours at roughly 10-12 hours per gallon at more than a half load. Another great thing about this product is that it is light and easy to move!

It is a peace of mind to have this one handy. Highly recommended.",
