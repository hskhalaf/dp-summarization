This saves a step, leave the coffee warmer, and gives the same results. Less mess, less washing out the blender.",

Doesn't work as well on thick liquid and will stall out if I try to use with mixtures that are too solid. It runs a LONG time on a couple of batteries. And, the design of the mixing fork is so simple, I just wipe it off after each use.",

The mixer spins very quickly, and the longer it runs, the more effective it is. This is because, as it spins, centrifugal force causes the fork to \"spread\" creating a wider mixing element. So, let it run for a couple seconds and it begins to mix more and more vigorously. We use it twice a day and no signs of wear. Will order another one!",
