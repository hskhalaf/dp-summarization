I read somewhere in a newspaper health article that Pellegrino undergoes huge pressure for centuries, moving very slowly from one cavern to another. I may describe it poorly, but it is really good for you (I take it to help my bones among other things) and it tastes great. I haven't spent a great deal of time trying to understand the issues, but there's pretty strong research that it's better for your health to eat alkaline foods - or rather foods that are alkalizing. The calcium and magnesium make this an alkaline food.",

I won't be buying these again - the price is not a bargain if the water is almost flat when received.
