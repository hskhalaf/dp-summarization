The wires are hollow in the middle, and at the center of the whole toy, these wires meet. There are gaps in between where the wire and square meets, so definitely a great breeding ground for bacteria and mold! I was hoping it was sealed and solid, but that is not the case.",

It can't really be sanitized (I saw from other melted reviews) and it doesn't come with any cleaning instructions. I assume it cannot be submerged either so I've been cleaning it with a cloth and mild soapy warm water.",

The toy is small and light enough for them to practice gross motor skills in grabbing, moving, and holding. Due to the shape, it prevents gagging as they can't shove it down their throat like some other teethers. It's easy to rinse off and wipe down and I can see her using it for a good while. I introduced it to her at 2 and half months and now at 3mo she is grabbing a lot more and likes to play with it!",

He was so used to playing with it, when tooth growth/gum irritation began, into the mouth, he naturally put it in his mouth, gumming it. His mom bought other teethers but my nephew gravitated toward this unique toy/teething comforting choice.

I love that it is easy to grasp at this stage unlike some of his other toys. It is pliable so he can put it in his mouth and when he bangs it on his head by accident he does not cry. On top of all that it is a still a rattle that makes a noise (not loud and annoying but just right) when he shakes it. I am looking forward to seeing how he plays with it when he gets older.",

The colors amuse him and it's easy for him to grasp so it doesn't frustrate him. It seems pretty durable and is easy to clean. Love it!",

When I came to Amazon to find it, I noticed this similar toy and decided to buy this instead because I figured it was dishwasher safe, making cleaning of it easier than a wooden one. Unfortunately, however, my son did not enjoy it nearly as much as the wooden version. He doesn't use it as a teether, but holds it in his hands for a few minutes before tossing it aside. We didn't get much use out of it....",

It's easy for her to grab, gnaw on, shake up and down(center is a rattle), etc. She also likes to grab the cloth cube in the middle. Easy to clean with a Purell wipe or similar. Scary how many parents on here are idiots. One put it in the dishwasher and it melted. Another steamed it with the same result. It's an awesome toy that I would definitely give as a gift.",

When he does grab it, it goes right into his mouth and it appears he is looking for something a little more substantial to chew on.
