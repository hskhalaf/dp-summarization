As a shoe claiming to have waterproof characteristics, the Hydroventure delivers well while accomplishing more.",

      "title": "Probably a great shoe for the right feet",
      "text": "Despite the relatively wide toe box, this shoe is very low volume in the forefoot. I normally wear either a men's 10 or 10.5 EE running shoe, and for me a men's 11 in this shoe felt like I was stuffing my toes into a much smaller shoe. Design and materials seem like just what I'm looking for in a trail running/hiking shoe, but going up to a size 12 in hopes of more toe room didn't seem worth trying as the issue isn't length, nor width, but rather a lack of \"head room\" for the toes.",

      "text": "Love these, as I do all my Topo Athletic shoes. Ordered 1/2 size up as recommended by Topo and they fit perfectly. Water resistant, not water proof--these strike a great balance between breathability and shedding water in rain and wet environments. Going through stream crossings and immersing them, they will squeeze the water out pretty quickly and do not pool water in the shoe for long. I bought these because running in my MaxFly and Terraventures in pouring rains was trashing the shoes--these hold up very well in wet conditions. Mid-cushion, less than the Terraventures, but quite adequate and comfortable out to half-Marathon distances. That's as far as I've run in them so far. Good traction.",

I was a fan of Brooks Addiction Walking Shoes only to discover from research I needed a shoe with a wider toe box to slow down this bunion on my right foot. I purchased Merrells Glove 3 and took some getting used to the zero drop with no cushion. The Topo is perfect for me. Wide toe box, narrow ankle with cushion. I'm rolling with this brand from now on.",
