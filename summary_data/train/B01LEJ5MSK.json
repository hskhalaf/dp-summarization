I mix a nickel size with a few drops of any facial oil and work it into my skin. The combination leaves my skin feeling so protected and dewy! Snail mucin is also known for having healing properties. This is SO great for sensitive skin. Personally, I think this is so much better than the snail essence. Recommend!",

      "text": "Wow! This cream is amazing, my skin has never been happier. I've previously used COSRX's Snail 92 Mucin Power with great results (pimples cleared up quickly and previous pimple scars faded). This cream offers those healing benefits along with moisturizing properties. By itself this cream isn't enough for my dry skin type but combined with other products my skin is perfectly hydrated. The cream soaks in fairly quickly with no stickiness left behind only soft skin. My husband has oily skin with acne scars and this cream has also worked wonders for him with a significant reduction in scarring. Since he has oilier skin he can use this by itself.",
