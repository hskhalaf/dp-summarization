      "text": "I have dark brown/black hair and my eyebrows are already naturally kind of full, but I've found that wearing even light eye makeup and not filling in my brows sometimes looks a bit unbalanced. I found this brow powder is perfect for lightly filling in some of the sparser areas. I either use this as my only brow product, or sometimes I'll pull in a lighter brown color to fill in the inner parts of my eyebrows. I'll also use this as an eyeshadow to smoke out my eyes.",

But I have extremely sparse brows, so I need to create them daily, and this powder barely has any color density to it. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this product for anyone who needs what I do. Don\u2019t waste ur money. Bobbi Brown or Tarte (which I\u2019ve used in the past) have some that work great. I guess u really DO get what u pay for.",

You'd have to decide. It would be perfect if it didn't get a shade or so darker after 8 hours.",

BTW, I also bought the pro Brow Brush - duo Angled Eyebrow Brush....absolutely perfect tool for applying a powder eyebrow product. This is definitely my new fave!!! Try it! You won't be sorry!",
