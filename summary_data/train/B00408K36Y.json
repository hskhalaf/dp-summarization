      "text": "Very small. Very lightweight. Uses 2 AAA cells. Easy to operate controls. Sound through Panasonic RP HJE120-K earphones [20-20khz] is extremely good! Great frequency response. Sound reproduction is superb! I like to DX at night. I try to receive distant stations and low power stations. This radio is not good for that. Reception is pretty much limited to your local stations. AM section does a great job serving up local programming. FM section with the tiny antenna extended does a good job separating local FM stations. For it tiny size and weight this is a good radio to put in your bag. It\u2019s one more bit of information. Five Stars with a few reservations.",

He's pretty fussy and not good with figuring things out, so when I found that the radio takes THREE steps to use it properly, I was a little worried. The ON button is NOT connected to the volume which is separate --- so one turns it on by clicking over the FM or AM. The volume is set with a different switch. Tuning is separate as well--but that's to be expected. Anyway, he hasn't complained --neither about the process involved OR not being able to tune in stations he wants to hear. For that, I'm glad.",

It's outstanding in terms of size and price, but not for sound. I might buy one for a small child but that's about all. I should also mention that the controls (volume, station, AM/FM, ON/OFF) are very poorly designed and placed; in fact, the worst that I have ever seen on a portable radio.",

      "text": "I was looking for a small pocket radio for pocket change. This is that radio. For the change I paid, I am happy it did not have any bells and whistles (it doesnt even come with an earphone, flimsy cover or crappy demo batteries). Every penny seems to have gone into the core components and it does an excellent job of catching am and fm waves and converting them to audio. Recommended if you are looking for a small, cheap, utilitarian am/fm radio.",

And being smaller, it has a smaller speaker, with less bass. But having said all that, it really seems to be a good quality little radio. The tuning is very good... it locks into a station and holds it. I've had it for several weeks, and use it every day. Still on the first set of batteries.

AM is very good and I can listen to talk radio while I mow or jog. The size is right, and there is an antenna to improve FM when necessary. Will order this one again should it break. I like it.",

It is VERY directional on the AM band...you must rotate it for the best signal...but that is true for any AM radio.",

I've since ordered the older discontinued Sony ICF-S10MK2 which reviewers says is good at picking up AM. They seem to have made manual pocket radios with better reception back about 12 years ago.
