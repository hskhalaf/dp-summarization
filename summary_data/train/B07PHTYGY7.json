He gets to Australia today, OUTSITE THE RETURN WINDOW - and it doesn't work at all. He takes it in to a shop there - the sim card works in other phones, so it's not the sim card. They couldn't get the phone to work and he had to buy a new one. ARGHHHHH",

For one, the product doesn't even match the images or firmware, as it is an ATT phone that has been unlocked by ATT. There is no Alcatel print - Just the ATT logo. The phone itself isn't a bad phone. But because of the ATT hiccup, there are a multitude of errors that can happen, such as not being able to receive texts - This has been documented on plenty of other sites, and I found this to be true as well. I am returning and reporting this immediately. Do NOT buy this phone.",
