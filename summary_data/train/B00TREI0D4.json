I contacted the customer service number and email that was provided in the box, and got zero response. Sent it back for a refund and got one for the same price off the apple online store and works perfectly.",

The battery life is acceptable and it has a clear and bright screen. It runs all of the Apple programs and its processor seems to be very fast. I am very satisfied with this purchase.",

I purchased this specifically for my Gaia gps app. Took a short drive in my TJ and it worked perfectly (with Bluetooth antenna). This is my 4th tablet/pad to get it right. Thanks to Amazon's return policy i never worried about returning. Tried Android 6.0, 7.0 and an earlier version of an iPad (IOS was too old to work). Very relieved this works!",

      "text": "The first one I ordered kept disconnecting in the middle of restoring it from my backed up ipad. It was also acting buggy (crashing and restarting during setup). This one was a dud. They sent out a new one to replace it, but that one couldn't recognize my wi-fi. Another dud. This company is quick to send out replacements, but I am wondering if I'll just get another dud. I'm bummed. The prices seemed pretty good, but even if I did get one that made it through the initial setup phase, it makes me wonder if there is some other hidden problem that won't rear it's head until several weeks or month into usage.",

That being said, the device does work very well but is not an upgrade or improvement over what I usually use (samaung tab s2). I have noticed that it is more touch responsive and Apple pay is slightly easier to use. I also appreciate the additional security of the device and safari. Is a good product and would buy again, however, not compelled to become an iPad fanboy or switch to iOS exclusively.",

Additionally, i can do amazing digital art with it, as it is very responsive to a stylus, and that is because I began using it after installing tempered glass for protection. The greatest thing is, the technology inside it is closely related to the summer research I'm undertaking this year.",
