She is a hyper girl and this toy keeps her busy for 30 plus minutes each time I give it to her. I don't recommend leaving a child under 2 years old with it without supervision, because it has a few sharp latches that CAN injure them.",

I would just be careful if they pick it up because it\u2019s heavy for her. She tries to carry it and she can, but if dropped, I know it will hurt her foot pretty bad.

However, I can see door #4 causing problems because her father and I can barely get it to latch and unlatch properly. It is clear that it was secured crooked, so it cannot completely lock. Also, a few other locks are secured crooked/loose, so that is something we're going to have to watch out for moving forward. Overall, I love the idea, but I wish it was given a once-over before being shipped because these things could've easily been fixed.",

Melissa & Doug products are quality all the way but are often way overpriced for a child's toy. You could probably make something yourself that would be less troublesome and at a much cheaper option.

I think for the price of this toy that should have been done already. Other than that, the toy is awesome! My granddaughter LOVES it and spends a lot of time playing with it. It\u2019s great that it includes learning for colors, numbers, and animals in addition to working on their motor skills.",

Most of all he likes the animals that are hidden, he even learned who exactly are hidden there without opening the door. Wonderful board and at one it is reaching four goals - learning colors, animals, building's shapes, opening locks. When I have read detailed information before buying the game I found that it is for ages 2-3, but my son did all this in his 18 months. Bright colors, paint is not erased, strong and hard board, precisely to play sitting at the table.",

It will probably become one of the toys that gets rotated. There are a couple of cons: Many kids like stepping on toys instead of picking them up, and because of this, the yellow doors on ours have become a little warped or something. Also it is very heavy, so the kids sometimes have a hard time carrying it around.",
