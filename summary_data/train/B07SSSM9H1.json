      "text": "We bought this for our outside patio, and it withstood the weather great. It wipes down very easily. It still looks like new despite having been outside for almost a year, and the paint still looks clean and fresh. We moved the table and 1 chair into our bedroom to have a corner where we can get away when we have too many Zoom calls going on the living room and it's a nice addition. It makes our bedroom feel like a hotel room. The chairs aren't terribly comfortable if you're sitting for more than an hour, so that's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. Otherwise, definitely a good purchase!",

However, as another review already stated, it rusts very easily. I\u2019ve only had this set for one week and it is already starting to rust on the seat after 2 days in the rain. It\u2019s a bit disappointing, but I do like the set and plan on keeping it and just trying to keep anymore rust from forming.",
