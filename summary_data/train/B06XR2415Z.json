It\u2019s pure quality compared to a few others I tried I like this one the best. Great quality and great price one bottle usually lasts me about 3 months of everyday use. Plus it\u2019s natural . Plus plus plus. My friend told me about this brand and now I\u2019ll never go back. Very satisfied customer",

I purchased this fortifying eyebrow and lash conditioner just a week ago, so I'll update my review at a later date. It's hard to believe that it's already working after only one week, but I think it might already be starting to restore the thickness and color of my eyebrows. Too soon to tell on the lashes. It's super easy to put on and I like how thick it is compared to other brands I've tried (which definitely did not work).",
