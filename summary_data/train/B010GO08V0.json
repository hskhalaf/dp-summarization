Only have to hand wash the large dishes, such as chargers or cookie sheets because the capacity of this dishwasher is small and the opening is pretty small too. But overall, this dishwasher is great. Just don't have any dishes in the sink when running the washer because the drain water comes out of the hose pretty fast and can ricochet against dishes in the sink and get all over the place.",

It also takes an extraordinarily long time on normal cycle - almost two full hours. However, given that it's task is getting dishes clean, and it does that well, five stars.",
