I hear there\u2019s some mods that fix these issues so have at it if mods are your thing. Even if this game is on deep discount I\u2019d stay away until Square Enix patch these issues which is looking like that\u2019ll never happen. PS4 version is the one to get.",

However, there is a totally free and easy to install fan-made patch (called FAR) which, in my experience, made the game run almost perfectly. But seriously, Nier:Automata is so good that even with having to install a community patch and tinkering around a bit with settings it's still an easy 5-star game.
