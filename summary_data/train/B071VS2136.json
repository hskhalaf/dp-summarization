      "text": "Toe box is narrower than all four prior Gel-flux models. Front of my foot felt squeezed, both sides and the top of my foot. Probably the result of eliminating the band around the toe box which enabled them to provide more space inside for a slightly wider foot. This narrower fit in the toe box eliminates the reason I've bought Gel-Flux for years. Also the materials used seem cheaper with this model compared to all prior models. Time to look at other brands. Hopefully they'll fix their mistakes with #6 and get back on track..",

      "text": "Actually, these are not women's. This is like my 5th pair of the gel flux. I have had versions 2-5. I hope they don't stop making because they fit good. The secret is the independent plastic truss between toe and heel sole sections. This minimizes twisting and allows the heel to anchor the shoe and minimizes supination (rolling to outside). This results in more even wear and less stress on both the shoe upper and sole. This means they last much longer. My other secret is shoe trees. These cedar forms are placed inside the shoes immediately after wearing drying them and retarding bacteria which would otherwise weaken the uppers.",
