Had to rent snorkel gear for my daughter because no one could use - 3 of us tried using it to make sure it wasn't something she was doing wrong. Don't buy!!! Not sure why there are so many great reviews of this product.",

      "text": "Just average quality as they get scuffed up almost immediately after you walk into the water for the first time. The snorkel does a good job of keeping the water out, much better than those tubes you get from the renting places at the resort. The best part is that it pays for itself after one snorkeling trip!",
