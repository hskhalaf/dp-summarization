Our tub sides are not smooth (see pics) as well as the glass and this squeegee takes the water off with the first swipe. The fact that it comes with extra blades is an awesome bonus.

It does come with extra blades, which I guess is cool. I think it might be good for body repair finish work, to squeegee off water when wet-sanding.

      "text": "I like that the blade is thick yet flexible and that the material the blade is made from really grips the shower & tub walls. The grip pulls all the water droplets off the walls, leaving them dry and spot-free. I bet it works great on glass, too. Two extra blades came with the squeegee. The foam grip on the handle is very comfortable on my arthritic hands. The size makes this squeegee easy to use around faucets, knobs, and in smLL APcea molded into my fiberglass tub/shower.",

      "text": "The photos in the product description show the white model to have a black handle. This is not the case. It is definitely gray, which is irritating because b/w color was the second biggest factor in my decision to purchase it. I am only taking off one star, however, because the product is otherwise excellent, and I might end up preferring a grey/white squeegee in my gray, black, and white bathroom once I get used to it.",

It's very easy to use, and I like knowing that it is not hurting the new finish on the walls and floor - my water is hard and I want to get it off before it dries, and that is easy to do before I get out, upon finishing I spray the walls, doors and floor down with the hand-held shower head and proceed to squeegee them down, easy and quick!",
