      "text": "Bought it roughly 2 years ago I work in a weld shop repairing various things. I frequently use it to grind out cracks in materials, locate cracks, grind small holes to tolerance, or clean up weld in tight corners. So far I would say it has earned its keep in my toolbox and been one of the better purchases I\u2019ve made. Oil frequently, and the lower unit wants to unscrew so I put lock tight on and been happy ever since. It is starting to show some play in the bearings but it\u2019s outlasted soooo many other die grinders in our shop I can\u2019t complain.",

      "text": "The plastic seemed like a good idea when I bought it, less shock when I let it drop. However cleaning it from its messy encounter leaved little to be desired. Almost I'm possible to wipe it due to the textured finish. Also on that note the textured finish prevents you from easily sliding it around your hand as you position for optimal angles. My opinion is to buy an IR all metal body unit. They may get dinged up more and look like their beat badly in only a matter of months, however they deliver better air control and are much easier to clean and the slimmer body make them more adaptable to changes to body position.",
