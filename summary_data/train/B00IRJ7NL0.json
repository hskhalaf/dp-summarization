Attached is a photo of 5 of them using it/waiting in line. I also purchased a second one as a gift for a friend. It's so easy to install. Just insert the batteries and hang it on a door.

I would stress that it should be a supervised toy only. Due to the concern that the string can be pulled off and ingested, we put the unit away when she's not playing with it.",

My problem is what happens when kitty catches the string with his claws: the belt is stopped and the motor makes a loud squelching noise that frightens him. It's a terrible reward for doing what cats are programmed to do. So I'm really torn about this toy because it really is fun to watch and my cat took to it immediately.",

Fast forward another month or two, and he seems to be used to it and interacts with it frequently. If its not currently on, he gives it a big swat anyhow to let us know he wants to play.

The first time he tied a couple of big knots in the string which jammed up the whole device, and the other time he put a few twists into the white belt which slowed it down until it eventually stopped.",

Mostly because it's a manual on off switch. If it stayed on for 10 minutes or so and shut off automatically it would be perfect but you cannot turn it on and leave otherwise you come home to dead batteries. Maybe an option where the cat could paw it on and then it turns off after awhile? For the price I didn't expect this kind of issue. Otherwise it's an awesome concept.",

She is 15 lbs and when she caught the string it was sturdy enough not to break as she kept pulling on it. It is a bit noisy and runs constantly until shut off. Make sure the string is captured on the inside of the device when it is shut off to keep string from being nibbled on. I only ran it for 15 minutes each time to keep her from getting bored with it, but it would not start the third time even with new batteries, thus returned.",

One end of a long, brightly-colored, silky cord (string) is sewn (with an industrial strength sewing machine.) onto a white elastic \u201cconveyer belt\u201d which is constantly rotating. The string flings in and out for kitty\u2019s non-stop amusement. Cats can bite, paw, claw, pull, and ultimately STOP the string.
