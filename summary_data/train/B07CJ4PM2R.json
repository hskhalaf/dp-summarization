And while they felt OK, I noticed lately that they were causing my toes to scrunch together because the inserts were pushing them forward. I took the problem to the local Pacers store and a terrific salesman suggested these instead because they have the arch support insert inside. It's been two months and they are comfortable and don't scrunch my toes. They also seem to have better workmanship than the Asics. So I just bought a second pair to alternate.",

I took a shot at these even though they were a bit more than I usually pay. I was not rewarded by that decision. I find they don't fit as snug as other Wave models I've had. Therefore they feel more \"slippery\", i.e. my foot moves around slightly even though they are the correct size. I also found them overall less comfortable and caused some foot aggravations that their other models do not. Next time I will stick with the less fancy but far more comfortable models.",
