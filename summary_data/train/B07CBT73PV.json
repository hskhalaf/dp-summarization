Turns out that one can plug into the wall but not be getting power. When this is the case, look for a rocker switch close by. It will give power to the outlet. When you put the rocker switch in the correct position, the unit will light up and you can be assure power will be available.",

I appreciate the bright blue color (so you don't forget it) and the two USB charging ports. It was easy to use and comes with a carrying pouch. However, I used it again this year for another trip to Europe, and it wouldn't charge anything. The light would briefly turn bright blue (charging) then dim to almost nothing. I tried it in 3 different hotels with the same results, then at home in the U.S., and it doesn't work anymore. Something that only works for a few weeks isn't worth the money. Disappointed in this product.",
