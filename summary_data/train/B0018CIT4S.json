I was convinced that this treat was nothing but wild salmon. When I reordered it was actually out of stock and I had to wait. When it finally came, I opened it and smelled chemicals but no salmon. Either the bag lining was heavily treated with chemicals, or the treats were. Also the treats were white and more dense than before. She ate two and lost interest. Also she threw up - maybe a coincidence. Not giving her any more of them.",

My kitty is so obsessed with them that she will push my hand out of the way as I am putting them down for her. She makes a little happy noise when she eats them that is very cute.",

The other one has asthma, and I'm able to pill her and use the inhaler on her because of these treats. These truly are a godsend. Amazon used to deliver these to us here in India, but doesn't any longer, which is sad for me but terrible for the cats :-(",

These are perfectly dried and consistently the same perfect crunchiness. I won't be buying any other brands from now on!!",

I was surprised to see that the treats were these little freeze-dried fish cubes. I'm not sure if they're too big or too dry, but they weren't a hit. He might just be picky. As with every cat, some treats work and others don't, so I would still recommend trying these out if you're looking for something special. They are somewhat pricy for cat treats, so if you have safer options it might be better to go with those if money is tight. The packaging is quite fun.",
