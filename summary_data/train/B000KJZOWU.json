But this baby was a very large baby and caused more back pain/hip pain than my others. So, it's hard to really know if the comfort was actually less or if it was the fact I had a giant baby in me.",

Even though this is the compact sleeper, it's still relatively large for someone who is only 5'3\". I'm certainly glad I didn't get the full-sized one! The main downside is that it is very difficult to roll over in the night, but I suppose that was to be expected :) Overall, a great buy. Much better than propping myself up with 5 pillows!",

I find myself rolling over a lot at night and this pillow does not allow for easy movement either. I have gone back to using a head pillow between my legs and a wedge for my belly. So far this combination has been the move comfortabel and manageable.",

I tuck the larger, more curved end between my knees, run it up along my belly and tuck it under my side just below the arm pit. Amazing!

If I were even a tiny bit taller, it wouldn't work. Even though it did fit me, it stretched a bit far from my body so there wasn't a whole lot of support for my pregnancy belly. The only major flaw is the difficulty of maneuvering the slip cover. This should be made like a boppy pillow slip cover with a zipper down the side, or better yet, over a seam. The current design is a pain in the behind.",
