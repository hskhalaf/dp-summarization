On a positive, I thought the instruction manual was great. I just wish the experiments were a little more unique for the price.",

The kit does supply some chemicals but the chemicals could easily be purchased from the store for much cheaper (i.e. baking soda). Several of the experiments are variations of volcano eruptions but the cheap tiny volcano supplied hardly looks like it is erupting.
