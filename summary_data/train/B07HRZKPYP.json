I bought this computer mainly to design as I am a Fashion Design major and I gotta day it\u2019s fast and accurate. But I gotta say the battery life isn\u2019t great which was expected as it is an extremely powerful and portable laptop. I have run Fortnite and Apex and it looks better than my 4K tv. There something about that Full HD 15.6\u201d screen that\u2019s make the games feel quicker and sharper. I\u2019ve only had for a week or so but truly amazing product.",

I spent a few days sussing out other laptops online and was reluctant to purchase anything I saw, knowing that I needed a machine that could easily accomplish heavy graphics processing and spatial analysis. I took a chance, never previously owning an MSI, and can confidently say they made a truly great product with the P65. If you are a creative professional that requires a box that can handle heavy processing workloads, take this P65 with the best specs you can afford out for a spin. You'll dig it.",

The laptop is definitely gaming ready, and I am able to hit 60 fps on virtually anything. The only complaint I have is the battery life. It has an 8 hour advertised battery, but I am finding that it only gets about 4.",

Even when I first bought this laptop, the fans got quite loud and the laptop got pretty hot. A year later, I'm working from home every day, like most people, and the fans have drastically worsened. It's like someone is digging into your laptop with a mini jackhammer, even after cleaning. This shouldn't be happening after a little over one year. Not worth the money.",
