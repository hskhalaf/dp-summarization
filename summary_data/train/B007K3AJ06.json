We were told on the Sprint 800 line this BB could not be hooked up to a line, so we went to Sprint store ans they were able to hook it up w a line!! Took awhile longer, bc he had to go into phone and finish set up. Works great now:)",

You'll have to buy your own. 2- There's something wrong with my text messages. When people text me, it says that they sent it february 17th 2047 at 8:01pm. Weird. I'm going to get that checked out soon. I think it can be fixed. Overall, good phone for the price. It's no Iphone, but I'll get used to it. I like it so far.",
