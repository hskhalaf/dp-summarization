Love the speed on the \"Internet Sharing\" (hotspot/access point) for connecting my notebook and other devices. Also, love the downloadable maps which can be used offline. MS Office is a big bonus. My main complaint was that the import of my Contacts had to be done via Bluetooth from my old phone rather than a VCF file.",
