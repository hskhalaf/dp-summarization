      "text": "Definitely the right choice of sewing machine. The large area throat plate makes it much easier to sew large quilts. My little brother sewing machine I just use for applique\u0301 projects since big brother only has the straight stitch. The needle does unthread often (I think the thread cutter cuts a bit short.). The needle threader on this machine I have never been able to master yet. The one on my little machine is simple. Other than that, this sewing machine is great. Oh, one more thing, you can't tell when your bobbin is low on thread. I'm glad I chose this sewing machine.",

It\u2019s an amazing industrial straight stitch machine. I have plenty of fluffy top of the line machines but the pq1500 SL is the best for straight line and free motion quilting. It\u2019s all I need coupled with my serger from now on! Amazing machine. Oh, if you want this machine you need to keep checking on Amazon as the price fluctuates.

All of my other Brother machines have a drop in bobbin which makes changing the bobbin so easy to do. I don't understand why they chose the bobbin placement that they did on this machine.",

      "text": "After using a Husqvarna for 30 years, I bought the Brother 1500 to do quilting. I have used the Brother for 3 1/2 months almost every day. It sews smoothly, very straight stitches, easy to change presser feet and adjust for variety of sewing and quilting. I especially like the walking and free motion feet. However, top and bobbin threading are very picky and hard to do. The bobbin placement is difficult to reach. The instruction manual provides minimal information compared to the one the Husky came with.",

The table extension makes processing heavy quilt layers a dream.",

It is a single stitch only machine that I purchased to match up with my computerized Brother to make hundreds of face masks. I keep to clean, oiled and dust free and change the needle every couple of days. I am pleased!",

I am still getting used to the knee control for lifting the presser foot, but it really helps. I would recommend this to anyone that is a quilter and is looking for a free-motion quilting machine.",
