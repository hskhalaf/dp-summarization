Like other reviews the cover is very cheep so I bought another cover from Amazon for $7. I did drill a hole in the bottom for water drainage if needed and filled the bottom with fine rock (a little bigger than sand) to help protect the bottom from the Heat and add a little weight. I also drilled holes behind the legs for air intake for better fire combustion. (Less Smoky fire) . I didn't want a normal Rock fire pit so this will work beautifully. I expect it to last for many years",

If there was one thing I would recommend it would be for the manufacturer to NOT CHEAP OUT on easily the most inexpensive item in this package. Just make the thing a little larger so that one person can easily stretch the cover and put it on.",

Our first fire in this pit melted the asbestos mat we had underneath it and literally started burning the deck! Overall, great product and produces lots of heat.

      "text": "We've had this fire basin for a few months now and love it. There appears to be good air circulation, so the fires burn hot (i.e. good brightness and not too much smoke, although still smoke). The copper also turns a pretty color with burning, but that's true of all copper. I also really like the cover, and have put it on several of our larger and more unwieldy fires with no detrimental effect, as far as I can tell.",
