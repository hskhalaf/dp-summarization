      "title": "Delighted",
      "text": "A very small scanner, almost 'cute'. Software easy to load and update. Runs off USB. So far pulls paper through easily and love the little paper guide on the back which pushed the paper up (as opposed to just out the rear) saving even more desk space. Software easy to use. Only scanned to pdf at time of writing but scans cleanly and I have no doubt scanning to OCR or other applications will be just as clean.",

      "text": "I hate this scanner. I bought it to replace my beloved old scansnap s1100 because that one wouldn\u2019t work with my new computer The old scanner made it easy to scan directly to Evernote, but this one makes EVERYTHING incredibly difficult. You have to go through several very slow steps before you can get your document into Evernote. Why did Fujitsu take a concept that was brilliant and ruin it?",

Scanning technology has really improved these last few years, but it's the compact size that really counts - the ScanSnap takes up hardly any space.",

Thoroughly recommended if your aim is to get rid of paperwork that you will probably never need to use again but just might!",
