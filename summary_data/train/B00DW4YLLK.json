      "text": "I purchased the 6 pack as I can no longer lift a 5 gallon jug due to a back injury. High quality materials and finish well worth the price. However, the OEM Federally mandated spout is hard to work. I have a generator and it is difficult not to spill gas...that's dangerous when working with hot equipment. This is not the manufacturers fault as even the mandated spout is of high quality. Whoever designed this spout never had to work with hot equipment i.e. lawnmower, generator. I purchased a high quality spout over Amazon made by Combined Mfg. and additional vents made by scriber plastics. NOW everything works well without spillage..",
