I started to peel and was terrified it would last for weeks but after using this and a hadalabo mask (another favorite mask of mine), the peeling subsided in 2 days!

In about 10 minutes I washed it off and it has now become a staple in my facial routine. Can't use it every night because that's impractical...it comes in a small-mid size tube that probably would last one week. It's totally worth it when you want to pamper your inner princess.",
