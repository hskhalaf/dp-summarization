      "text": "Very happy with the size and portability of this HD. Although I will only be talking about the HD and not the portability because I bought this HD more to have it always plugged in to my computer. I have no issues with it. I cant even hear it. I only know its plugged in because I can see it on my computer. It works amazing. I am using it for all my drop box files and backup. Very happy with this and I will recommend this HD to anyone. Also the size is awesome. Its nice and small and fits anywhere.",

Speedtest shows nearly as fast as my internal HDs and (surprisingly) faster than a Class 10 Ultra USB 3.0 memory stick. Running 24/7 for several months now. UPDATE: 01/2019: Drive failed after just a year and a half. Not a good record there. Still under warranty, but anything on the external drive was lost. (mostly lots of backups of multiple computers but some archival storage.)",

The customer service at Western Digital eventually resolved the problem and sent me a new one, however it was extremely frustrating as they only work through email instead of getting on the phone to troubleshoot. Took about two weeks to finally come to the conclusion it was not functional. I was pleased they honored the warranty and sent a new one. The second one worked great for about 3 months. However it recently stopped working with Time machine and I am frustrated trying to fix these issues. I will not purchase again.",
