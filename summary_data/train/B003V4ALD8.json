I was really happy with it, so I bought another, but it's not even close to being the same. It's much thinner, and the leather is stiffer and lower quality. It looks almost nothing like the product photo. I'd be surprised if this lasts for a year of daily use. Then it'll be time to move onto something else. I imagine most of the 5-star reviews are from the previous version, because there's no way that this one is of any decent quality.",

The only signs of wear are in all the expected places: slight fading around the belt hole I always use; tarnish/shine on the tip of the metal tongue that goes through the belt hole; very slight bowing of the belt where it goes around my back.
