Holds well to a wooden umbrella pole and is very easy to operate the latch that allows you to remove or install the light onto the pole. Batteries last a good long time in this light. Highly recommended. Update: July 23 2017 another customer asked if these would fit his umbrella pole with a diameter of 2.5 inches. I measured it with my calipers and the maximum pole diameter would be an inch and a half.",

Spring loaded braces ensure the light stays in place but easily maneuvers higher or lower to adjust needed light. 3 different light settings from low, medium, and high allow you the best options for outdoor entertaining. This was money well spent! Be sure you measure your umbrella pole circumference though, just to be sure this is the right size you need. Aim lights up at bottom of umbrella for less light or ambience, aim them downward onto table for family game night and while eating dinner. This was actually the perfect solution for my patio set up to bring plenty of light.",

I recommend mounting it just under the umbrella's thin metal extension arms unit that moves up and down the pole. That allows the umbrella to close in a normal fasion without having to remove the light. I rated the bright light setting as a nine since moving from medium to bright does not add much extra light. I suggest that you don't let that deter you on buying this item as the light still offers a pleasant, intimate effect.",

While it is easy to install, the flimsy plastic mechanism for gripping the pole is inadequate and barely allows the light to hang on. Four hard plastic spring loaded jaws do not apply enough pressure to adequately grip the center pole of my umbrella. It might be more effective with a larger diameter pole or if there were rubber or some other friction producing material on the jaws, but plastic against a smooth surface of the pole with relatively little pressure from the springs simply doesn't work that well. If it weren't so cheap I would send it back.",

      "text": "I was surprised how bright these little lights are. They have two hooks to allow you to hang the lights or you can open the casing and attach the lights to any attachment (pole, umbrella tie) or even prop it up. Be careful - when inserting the lights back into the box, I have twice inadvertently clicked the power button on the light and drained my batteries. Easy solution - don\u2019t store them in the original box. The lights are very light and easily portable. Additionally, while they cast bright direct light, from a distance the light is not bright at all. So, the lights are not disturbing to neighbors on, say a community roof top or shared patio.",

It's not as powerful as a corded electric light, but it provides ample visibility for dining, playing a card game, etc. on a table a few feet below. It's also easy to detach and use as a flashlight for cleaning up the patio or making your way back across the yard after an evening outdoors. It's not weatherproof, so be sure to stow it in a dry place after you're finished using it.",

We keep the umbrella up on our deck table even when dining there in the evening because there is a tree overhead, and it\u2019s constantly dropping bits. But it can feel a little funny sitting under an umbrella at night. Enter this Patio umbrella Light, which turns your umbrella into an illuminated roof (we aim the lights upward). It\u2019s easy to use, and we just slide it down the pole when the umbrella must be lowered for wind. I like the three levels of light, too. Good purchase!",
