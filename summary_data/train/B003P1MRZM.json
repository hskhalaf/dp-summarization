It is small but it is a piece of art, and the Butterfly clasp in the back is awesome.. I just hope my daughter will keep it forever. LOL",

It just doesn't work very well unless you have three hands. I honestly can't imagine why anyone would design a watch band like this. Much as I like the watch, I will probably return it.",

In stainless steel with rose-gold finish, domed metalized crystal, multiple-layer silver-white, silver and rose-gold dial, continuously sweeping second hand, luminous hands, calendar, padded and stitched dark brown leather strap, locking deployment buckle and water resistance to 30 meters. Duet: 97B110\n\n\n\n\nIn 1875, a young Czech immigrant named Joseph Bulova set up shop in New York City, and a legendary American watch brand was born. Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch.\n\n Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, \"America runs on Bulova time.\" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data.
