I've tested it in ArtRAGE, Krita, Painter Lite, Sketchbook, Inkscape, CorelDRAW, ... and it works fine with any of them. Notice that the controls work a little different in Windows and Linux (Linux interface is rougher, and a little less polished). The two-wheel HMI is awesome.",

Why didn't they make her wireless? It's absurd that it's the brand's pro and keep using wires! Another thing I don't like is that there's no option to scroll, if you don't use a mouse like me and use the tablet for anything I'd missed the scrolling feature I had in wacom years ago. Pencil when you use slanted usually does not work the click. Overall it is a good tablet for the price, it would be perfect if only it were wireless!",
