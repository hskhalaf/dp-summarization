I will update my review if I can get a replacement easily. I feel bad because I really liked this watch.. hopefully mine was just a defective unit.",

The band is easy changed with a standard 22mm band. The band that comes with the watch is small for larger wrists. If your wrist is larger than 7.5\u201d you will most likely need to purchase and use a different band. The charging dock is proprietary with a short cable. At this time you cannot buy a replacement charging dock, a HUGE negative. If you break it or it fails your watch is useless. Maybe in the near future they will sell them as an accessory.",

The processor in it is already ancient, so I don't know why they didn't update it since this watch was just released. Another problem is that I could never get it to sync to my phone every day.

The huge upside of this watch is the second display, when your watch reaches a set percentage it turns into a regular watch. So even your smartwatch dies, you still have a functioning watch on your arm that is measuring heart-rate. For something that seems so gimmicky, it is actually incredibly helpful! The materials and built quality are on par with a Samsung device, but it does have some little nooks and crannies that attract sweat and dirt.",

Not sure it would be worth $300 for the upgrade but if I were looking for a new watch I would go for the 4g model. That being said, this model has been very reliable, looks great and is fun to have.",

Bottom line is that I'm happy with the purchase especially since I bought it around Christmas 2018 for around $180. If you can find this watch for under that you should buy it.

Has the ice features of notifications, exercise tracking, Google assistant, heart rate, etc. This is one terrific smartwatch and well worth the money.

The watch is holding up quite nicely. I workout a lot and it has kept up with me. I got the silver one so I can swap out the silver metal band no problem and looks great. Battery life is great and the lowest I get is around 20-25% with an all day use. We shall see on how things go but right now I am quite impressed.",
