Also, the beaters are placed SO CLOSE together in the center that they hit each other! It is difficult to get the beaters to come out unless you really tug on them (one flew across my counter). I simply do not like this product at all, and it is being replaced with something else. I would send it back, but just used it and no longer have the box it came in, so to the trash it goes. Going to purchase one locally so I can actually see the placement of the beaters. Very disappointed in this mixer! :-(",
