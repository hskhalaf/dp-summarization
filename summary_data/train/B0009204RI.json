Fast forward to 2018 and I decided to pick up the rx-65. it's identical to the 995 with a few updates.. modern cars have made this thing a nightmaee anytime I'm near a BMW with blind spot detection.. this thing bounces off the wall. It's not so much the fault of the design both the 995 and the rx65 are excellent units but without some kind of signal processing for both blind spot and radar guided cruise it's virtually useless.",

Can program detector to ignore nuisance bans, for example, X-ban. I like the button on the 12v charger plug that mutes alarms, don't need to reach up to the detector to mute. Paid for itself many times over and again. NOTE: may not get a useful warning if yours is the only vehicle on the road and you get hit with instant-on radar (or laser) at short distance]",

The new RX65 is a great replacement, consistently alerting me to police radar over two miles away. I live in southeast Georgia so the land here is pretty flat but I am confident using this detector. I am not a speeder but do like to know when the police are around. We all know how police choose to pull people over based o bias and I am glad to know when they are around I am driving right for conditions.",

Used it regularly for about 3 weeks and 4800 miles. Depending on how you look at it, this either saved me several speeding tickets or many extra hours of driving (if I had gone the speed limit). Did not take long to get used to and gave plenty of early warning on the interstates and flat,straight state highways in TX. Knowing limitations of technology, I did not push as much on state highways in mountains. Obviously can't compare to other models but a satisfied customer.",

The faster response times and more sensitive receiver result in alerts noticeably sooner than the V955, especially when coming around corners. Highly recommend this product.",

    "description": "Style:Red Display| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingBeltronics Pro RX65 radar/laser/safety detector provides ultra performance! This detector has it all. Digital technology provides ultra long-range detection. Features include text display, digital voice alerts, 7 selectable features, and custom travel case. It integrates with Laser Pro 905 for laser blocking.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nManufacturer's Description (October 30, 2008) \nIf you are as serious about safety as you are about driving, then you need the Professional Series RX65, an advanced radar, laser and safety detector. The RX65 is a breeze to use, and boasts extreme sensitivity to all Radar and Laser bands with over 10 times the range of other detectors. \n\nIf you are as serious about safety as you are about driving, then you need the Professional Series RX 65. Click to enlarge. \n\nControlling alerts is right at your fingertips using the included SmartPlug power cord. Click to enlarge. \n\nIncludes quick release windshield mount. \n\nAvailable with blue or red LED display. Click to enlarge. \n\nSuperior Detection\nThe RX65 includes full X, K, SuperWide Ka, and Safety Warning System radar capability, front and rear laser detection, Beltronics' patented Mute and AutoMute, audible and visual band alerts, and all the performance you'd expect from Beltronics. Digital signal processing (DSP) gives you superior long-range ability, along with reduced false alarms. The AutoScan mode can virtually eliminate those false alarms, and provides both Highway and City settings. \n\nThe RX65 also features Shadow Technology making it immune to VG-2 radar detector detection, meaning law enforcement can't detect your radar detector, keeping you one step ahead. \n\nEase of Use\nThe rugged RX65 gives you control right at your fingertips using the included SmartPlug power cord. Patented Mute and AutoMute technology on the cord allows you to quickly silence alerts. Advanced programming lets you customize several features, and programmable bands let you set the device for your region, including International and North American settings. \n\nInstallation is a snap: use the quick release mount to attach it to your vehicle's windshield, and remove it in a snap. Don't want to leave it in your vehicle? No problem, Beltronics includes a travel case to keep it secure while you're on foot. \n\nUltra-Bright LED Display\nDon't miss a visual alert with the RX65's 280-LED display. Exclusive threat display tracks and displays multiple radar signals, including signal strength. Tech Display provides actual numeric radar frequency for any radar signal. You can also view Safety Warning System (SWS) messages about upcoming hazards, construction and more. \n\nRed Light, Blue Light\nThe RX65 is available in both red and blue LED models, so you can choose the display that most suits you. \n\nHow Safety Radar Works\nSafety Warning System, or SWS, uses a modified K-band radar signal to alert users of Highway Construction or Maintenance, Highway Hazard Zone Advisories, Weather Related Hazards, Travel Information/Convenience, and Fast/Slow Moving Vehicles. The SWS safety radar system has 64 possible messages (60 currently allocated), all of which can be displayed on your RX65. \n\nWhat's in the Box\nBeltronics RX65 RED Professional Series Radar, hard shell metal case, coiled SmartPlug, quick release windshield mount, manual",
