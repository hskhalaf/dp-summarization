It's near impossible to get all four cats to like the same food, but they all devour this. It's also my understanding that New Zealand has stricter guidelines for cat food than the USA which makes this even better as far as I am concerned. I also noticed one of my cats had coarse hair that always seemed to get matted who now has soft fur that doesn't get matted anymore after being on this food exclusively for about a month.",

We received this today, and this is his second meal, small to start of course, but he's never wanted seconds on anything, ever!! If you have a very fussy eater, try this, it's a winner!",

They both love this brand of food & I have seen a difference in their health (less shedding & fewer hairballs for the long-haired one). I DO believe that a couple months of this has contributed to some weight gain by both (initially the younger cat lost a bit), so we've started cutting back their portions. Our vet says that since they still have access to dry food, they only need the amount of meat in a mouse's body once/day. The recommended portions are much too large for normal cats.",
