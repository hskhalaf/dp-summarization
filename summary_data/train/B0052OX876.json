I pulled the trigger and bought one. I\u2019m a long time user of big name plasma cutters, and am really pleased with this one. Note that on eBay you can get a stamped steel torch stand-off just like Hypertherm\u2019s that is way better than the wire kind it comes with. I\u2019ve done a couple projects with up to 1/2\u201d plate and am on my first set of consumables still. If you\u2019re on the fence, I recommend going for it-you won\u2019t regret buying this.",

It cut conex boxes apart like a hot knife through butter on 220v. UPDATE: 2 years later and this plasma cutter is still kicking a$$. Even though i posted pictures of it cutting through Connex boxes with ease, it also has no issues making quick work of 1/2 inch thick steel I-beams. It does everything from massive industrial structures to fine art! Don\u2019t believe me? Check out what this little box has done for my business. Www.facebook.com/barrelhousemetalandwoodworks",

The ground clamp was always astoundingly short on this tool and the regulator that came with it always has leaked. I would not recommend this product to anyone I know.",

You absolutely can not beat the value. Price vs quality is just amazing. Again, this is not a professional unit, so you can't treat it like one.

My only complaints are that the air hose it came with is really crappy.. I replaced it on day one. Also it does eat consumables like a fat kid on Halloween. Their pretty cheap so its not a big deal to buy a big bag of them. My uncle was so impressed using mine, he bought one himself. He loves his too.",

I clogged/burnt two tips but it comes w/ three additional. I also got the tip pack which (as a homeowner) I suspect will last me a couple years.

The least expensive USA made machine for 1/2 in cuts were over $1,200.00. The Lotos is not a production plasma cutter but will work great for the average home welder.

About 800lbs of scrap cut into manageable pieces running 110V input and the machine impressed me. Probably not so great for ornamental stuff, but for doing rough cuts for finishing parts and pieces, this is your machine at $1k under the competition.
