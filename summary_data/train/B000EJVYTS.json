It fits perfectly in the space and has surpassed my expectations in every way. It's attractive and fits a TON of trash in a very discreet way. I love it.",

Bought it for the convenience, but noticed can hold much more than plastic trash receptacles can because you can compress trash into it with its rigid metal sides. Other advantages: tops seals nicely when closed, so no odors, batteries last a long time...haven\u2019t needed to replace yet! 18 month update: still love it! Looks and works great.",

I had to scroll to the bottom to find that information. Not sure why it has to be sold separately, you can not operate this without it. Was super disappointed. AND I had to pay to return it. I consider that poor customer service.",

      "text": "I've had this trash can for about a two months now, and it works as intended. I initially purchased it because we started seeing roaches in our kitchen after the tenant in the neighboring apartment moved out. I wanted something covered that would keep the trash and smell contained. It definitely does the job. The automatic open/close feature helps keep the outside of the can sanitary, as well, since you don't ever have to touch any part of it. I had hoped this would also be helpful in keeping the dog out of the garbage as well, but my dog is the perfect height to activate the sensor.",

Perfect! 2) Then entire lid flips open so I don't have to worry about accidentally spilling something on the side. 3) Deodorizer works...I know I have since experiments happening in my trashcan for the last two days, but I can't smell it!
