      "text": "The handle actually measures 16.5\u201d long. The label said is by Vaughan, but it didn\u2019t said what type of wood is it. The wood is a lighter color than shown in picture and it looks like Maple wood; I HOPE it is really hickory wood. The wood looks to be good quality. It comes with a wood wedge and two metal wedges. I have an old CF1 Vaughan hammer head and this handle fits into that head although this handle said it fits CF2 hammer. My hammer head is 20 oz, after I attached this handle to my old hammer head, it weights almost 2 lbs.",
