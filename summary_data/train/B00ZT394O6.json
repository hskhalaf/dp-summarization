I would whole heartedly recommend the Wabi. Mine never leaked, never died, always worked exactly as expected; however I followed the directions perfectly and was VERY CAREFUL when filling with water. Do this and you will be do grateful for such a wonderful product.",

Love that it has a dry and storage option for 12 hours so the cups aren't sitting there. First one that they sent had a shattered bottom, like the mail carrier had dropped it. They should probably add some styrofoam to the packaging. They sent a new one extremely fast, even before I sent back the old one! Was wonderful.",

After the illnesses, we use it for anything A to Z that you want dried or steriled fast.
