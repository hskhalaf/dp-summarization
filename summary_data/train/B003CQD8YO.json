The price through Amazon was much better than retail outlets such as Fry's and Best Buy. The down side to the programmable touch pad is; when the computer goes into standby or hybernation, the keypad goes dark and requires a total \"power off\" reboot of the computer or the keyboard must be unplugged from the computer and re-plugged to gain access to the touch pad. This may not seem a big inconvenience unless the computer is buried within the desk such as mine. I would like to see a driver re-write to address this issue.",

You have to be right by the computer otherwise the wireless doesn't pick it up, and even when it does it's super finicky and only responds to part of what you do on the keyboard. The mouse is super glitchy - sometimes barely moves and then when you're very close to where you need to click it gets super sensitive and the tiniest movement brings you halfway across the screen. It's actually kind of hilarious how bad this thing is, of course, less so when you paid money for it.",

Keys have a soft touch to them and the coverall construction is solid and not flimsy. An included power/charging cord is supplied so i can charge it up without having to use batteries.
