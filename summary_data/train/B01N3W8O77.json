The magnets aren't strong enough to keep it closed, especially with a door moving, and the front still pops open with it locked. Still, pretty good bargain and I just bought some stronger magnets and glued them on to keep the front closed. I don't care about being able to lock it, I just want it to stay closed when the door it's hanging from is opened and closed. I will say I think the mirror is glass and not that cheap reflective plastic so no issues there.",

Also, my mirror has a cut in the top right corner. At first I thought it was a protective film for shipping but then I realized it is just a cut of the glass. Disappointed for the money I spent but too much of a pain to ship back and I didn't keep the box.",

However, just a little nudge that the cabinet door wouldn't close without having to lock each time you open. I like easy access and so to unlock the door every time you want to open the cabinet can get annoying when you open it so many times in a day. Also, wished cabinet depth was more than 3.5 because door wouldn't close if you have thick necklaces on the necklace hook. Overall, loved the product as well as the quality except few nudges mentioned above. Will definitely recommend this.",
