The reason he doesn't use it is because the stairs are too steep. We removed them and added some other non-stylish stairs, and he USES IT. Defeats the purpose. If you guys can come up with some better stairs to attach, with a more gradual slope, that would be awesome.",

At night she's been sleeping inside it and during the day she likes to sleep on the roof. It's perfect for her and I'm so glad I purchased it. It's also attractive enough that I don't mind it being on my porch. It looks very cute.",

      "text": "We got this for my cat. It was mostly pretty easy to install, but part of the upper railing wouldn't screw in right. She enjoyed the shade it provided in the summer, but when it rained, it leaked. I'd recommend weather proofing the house. I didn't get around to it, so instead I'd put down a piece of cardboard and rubber mat over the top. It looks ugly, but keeps the inside dry. Now it's winter and I'm concerned there might have been some rot damage. We'll see come spring. It was fine overall. It looks pretty cute as well.",

She loves it. we have a fleece mat on top for padding. and the dogs like the lower level. It was easy to assemble. Lighter than most cat condos of size. Light weight. Very stable which was important. This unit has never so much as budged when she comes flying through the house and leaps onto it. If you looking for a cat condo for a large cat look at this.",

      "text": "My 12 lb dog loves this house although he prefers the balcony (with a plush cushion purchased separately) so that he can look out the window. The only down side to this item is the stairs...they are way too narrow and steps themselves are small, closely spaced and slippery not to mention the poor design choice of having them assemble at a strange angle. Perhaps the stairs might work better for cats who are more agile. Luckily, my dog is big enough to jump up to the balcony himself but I suspect that as he ages, I'll have to invest in a ramp as others have done.",

When assembled there are noticeable differences, and uneven sections. My dog is terrified of the steps, and is still uneasy about going into the house section. She is now comfortable sitting on top when her bed is up there to watch people out the window. I am hoping she adapts soon! I will be changing, or modifying the steps ASAP. I think being able to see thru them makes it confusing, and unsettling for my dog (yes they are indeed narrow too). Overall I am happy with the purchase!",

But I was hoping for a bit of quality here for the pricing. I can't complain much as It was more a matter of time over money, but if you have the know how, build something yourself...

So I couldn't tell you how well it stays dry if that is not done since there does seem to be some space where moisture could get (as it is delivered) if not sealed properly.

Each one could fit in the house no problem but this is where it makes no sense none of them could climb the steps. These steps are too narrow (6 \" wide) too steep and the height between each one is too small. We fixed the problem by replacing the steps to a wider set and facing sideway. This is a nice looking house just poorly design not worth the trouble to send back and time consuming to fix it. I would consider it a good investment for indoor cats only.",
