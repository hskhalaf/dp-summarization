This one is like a hot knife through butter. Smooth and quiet. Took my lugs off and didn't waste a bunch of air doing it. Very efficient. I took off an entire wheel before my compressor started running again, and frankly, that is just amazing.",

I know for certain this gun would perform even better if I had a nicer compressor. Just keep in mind that this gun needs more air than small compressors can kick out, and pay attention to the rated torque this gun provides. Use it for what it's limitations are and it performs amazingly! Highly recommended! DeWalt wins again.",

      "text": "Really like this impact wrench!! It's smaller and lighter than the other ones I have. And the best part is that it doesn't break your wrist!! With the adjustable torque setting it's like nothing I've seen before. I almost sent it back until I used it, figured this small wrench wouldn't be able to do anything....this little wrench is loosening bolts that other wrenches can't even come close to loosening!! Well worth the investment.",
