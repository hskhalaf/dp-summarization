My only \"complaint\" would be that I wish they offered higher output bulbs, like 75w equivalent or 100w equivalent, and not just 60w equivalent (840 lumens).",

First you need to go online - deregister your old hub and register your new hub. Once that is done you have to manually enter the S/N for every light your old hub controlled, it will not detect them. The S/N is on the base of the bulb itself. If you have some in the ceiling where you need a ladder I recommend you keep a list of all the S/Ns or you'll find yourself climbing a ladder like myself.",

    "description": "ABOUT HUE: Philips Hue is the World\u2019s Leader in Smart Lighting.* Extend Smart Lighting throughout your home, including outdoor spaces, with the Philips Hue system. What is smart lighting you may ask? It means absolute control of your home's lighting through your smartphone, tablet, Hue wireless dimmer switches and sensors or even with your voice. As a bonus, Philips Hue is the only smart lighting product with Energy Star certification and lasts up to 22 years. GOT VOICE? Do you already have a favorite Voice or Smart Home assistant? With the most options for Voice control, Philips Hue Smart Light bulbs work with any Voice or Smart Home Assistant (Works with Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple HomeKit, Microsoft Cortana, IFTTT, Nest, Logitech, SmartThings, Razer, Xfinity). HOW IT WORKS: Hue smart light bulbs are wireless connected to the Hue Hub (included in Hue Starter Kits, also sold separately) using a technology called Zigbee. Thanks to this technology one bulb can transmit the signal also to other bulbs, so you don\u2019t need to add a Wi-Fi extender to cover all the rooms in your house or clog up your Wi-Fi network with additional Wi-Fi devices. Add up to 50 light points on one Hue Hub.\n\n* According to market share data from leading research bodies in US and Europe; these markets represent over 90% of global sales of both Philips Hue and the Smart Lighting industry.",
