The only aspect that could be confusing is that there are four or five folder. But if you stick to the one folder at a time, recordings are simple to make and find for playback.",

The only way to do that is to directly link your recorder to your computer as a recording device, and only supports up to Windows 7, making it incompatible with mine. Amazon should really separate the listings of he 2 products, since there is a vast difference if you cannot transfer files from one, but can from another.",
