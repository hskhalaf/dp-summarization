Used right out of the box and it does have a slight chemical smell from fire retardant treatment. That goes away with first wash.And blanket gets softer after same first wash.",

First, they WILL keep you warm - slept very comfortably under a tarp in low 20 degree temps with wind chill in the mid-teens with one of these blankets and a goretex bivy cover. Next, the blankets very closely resemble those I used in the military, which means to me they can/will take heavy use and (reasonable) abuse. Last, for my purposes, I didn't want or need \"designer\" labels or the latest high-tech innovation, with the price tag that matches. They are definitely not that, which in my opinion is a plus. They are, however, outstanding no-frills-get-the-job-done pieces of gear. Highly recommended.",

I bought this to take camping but I have since decided to keep this one for our bed as it is such a nice weight for the fall and winter without being itchy ! I had been looking for one similar for years like the military used to issue and luckily I found this company ! I am a huge fan and will be making many more purchases for gifts for my family! Thank you for offering such quality while still being very affordable!",
