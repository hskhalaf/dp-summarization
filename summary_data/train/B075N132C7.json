Adding that 80 mm fan at the top lowed the temps inside the case. I also drilled several holes through the front glass to create extra ventilation points.

The case is clean, easy to setup, silent, and looks amazing with the AMD LED cooler in it, although I haven't yet got the LEDs in the fans to turn on (will need to read the manual for that, I guess). Really happy I got this thing!",

Plenty of room for add ons. I added a 240mm radiator and two 120mm fans up top which was easy to do. Since I was going to be overclocking I\u2019m sure the case would get a little warm with only one exhaust fan. That would maybe be the only downside to this case in my opinion. Other than that I\u2019m very happy with my budget build for my daughters first pc.",

Some downsides however, the rear case fan was installed backwards, all the fans on the case were forcing air into it with no outlet. In addition, the USB ports on the front of the case are very tight, almost to the point of things breaking off inside of them. The false back is useful for cable management, but the provided notches for tying things down are a tad shallow and can be somewhat difficult to attach to, especially near the edges. Overall, a good case in design.",
