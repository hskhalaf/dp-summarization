Arch support and comfort are still there. The straps are a little different, but work. My only complaint is that the strap between the toes is for sure not as soft as the old ones and it took me a long time to break in/build up calluses for it. Are these as good as the old ones? No. Are they still better than so many other flip flops out there? Yes. Worth getting. Now to see if these can hold up 10 years too....",

I don't feel like I have to clench my toes in order to keep them on and I can wear them all day long. There aren't any negative aspects in my opinion and I try to make sure that my reviews include both positives and negatives if it is warranted. I love these shoes and I would purchase them again for sure!!",

My new ones are 7s and just perfect! Bought striped split toe socks to wear with them on colder days. :O) These shoes are my faves...wear them around the house also as they are better for me than bare floors and flat feet.",
