I can shoot the flag from say 150 yards out and it comes back with 3 different yardage numbers, none of them the same value. They are as much as 30-40 yards different. Not sure if its the cold weather it doesn't like or not but it's extremely frustrating that the NX7 Pro can't come up with a solution. I've attempted to contact customer service and all my concerns have fell on \"deaf ears\" Hopefully I just got a lemon but we'll see.

Its also fun to use. Support is great as there is a an office in FL, as opposed to China. When you call you get real USA support. Also recommend picking up the Frogger strap set available on Amazon as well. This will allow you to attach it to a golf cat frame or your bag.

I lost the battery cover the other day (user error!) and they immediately shipped me a replacement. This is a very rare combination of a superior product and highest quality customer/product support.

      "text": "Love the size and ease of the finder, however locking onto the pin at any distance was extremely hard and at that would give me inaccurate readings. I golf with 3 other guys every Friday and they all have Bushnell range finders that would lock and give an accurate reading and I would compare what mine was saying to there's and it would always be 30-100 yards inaccurate and that's no exaggeration. I'm hoping it was just a defect in the one I got as it seems others have not had the issues I have had.",
