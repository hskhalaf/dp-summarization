      "text": "I've used this meter for a while now. It does the job. it takes a couple of seconds to give the right reading, but it's ok. It's the right meter for the right price. It has everything I look for in a meter, even a temperature reading and it's the right size (Fits well in my hand). The voltage detector does not sound when near a power source, but sometimes that's a blessing, specially when the meter is close to a source and you're trying to check the voltage. I have another multimeter, but ever since I got this, it's the one I use most of the time.",

For measuring current of household devices, make sure you get anor similar device. Extech products have been good for me.",

However, the SELECTOR SWITCH moves very easily, which is not a good thing, because the OHMS setting is adjacent to the VOLTAGE setting. After accidentally moving the switch too far, 480 VAC caused the meter to read inaccurately, with other functions. I replaced it with an Amprobe-220, which malfunctioned after falling once, from 5ft. onto concrete; cheap meter! Went back to Extech, purchasing the EX655; which is the updated version of the MA640.",
