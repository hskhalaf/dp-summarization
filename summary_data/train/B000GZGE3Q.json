It will move when they try to use it to stand up. We never let him use it unsupervised. I had to hold the front because it would not hold him. Now that he has more balance, he'll push it. I wouldn't recommend it for babies who are just starting to stand and walk without close supervision. It moves too fast for beginners on wood and tile floor. We used it on carpet and grass first.",

The rubber on the wheels prevents major slipping on hardwood floors and it still moves well on thick and thin carpet.",

He\u2019s 16 months old and not walking yet, but he\u2019s all over the house pushing this around. He\u2019s able to pivot and turn it side to side when running into walls and contraptions. I\u2019m hoping he will walk in no time with the help if this push toy.",

The first one was for my now 19 month old grandson and it is still one of his favorite toys to push around even though he has been walking now for months. It is sturdy and doesn't tip over when a little one is just learning to take steps. The one I just bought is for my 7 month old granddaughter for Christmas and I am sure she will love it as well. It is beautiful, colorful and the clacking noise of the alligators chomping is fun but not obnoxious. I highly recommend this toy for anyone with a soon-to-be toddler!",

He loved it so much and immediately began cruising all around the house, with just a little help steering around corners. The wheels are designed to not push too quickly, and the toy is very sturdy.

High price, but it has lasted 5 children and still works like new!",

As his parent I also do not like toys that have a sound system. It does roll very easily on our wood floors. I just have to make sure I am with him so he doesn't lose his footing with it. We usually have him play with it on the carpet. I would recommend this to anyone. It gets 5 stars for its cute design, ease of use and it doesn't have any annoying sound affects like most kids toys these days.",

She loves this toy - if we walk by it she will not move forward and will turn her body until we walk toward it. Her ability to stand alone is not there yet, so we have to make sure we are holding her shirt to make sure that she doesn't lurch forward too quickly/fall down.

The only issue that I have with it is that the wheels are hard to turn on certain carpets. Obviously, if you have shag carpets in your home, this won't work at all. It will just get stuck and your little one won't be able to use it. From what I can tell, short carpets, hardwoods and tile floors are best for this.",
