So rather fight a needless battle I got one of these. We got a ikea hook on the wall to hang it on, so she can grab it, place it on the toilet and go. The grip is good so it doesn't move, it's easy for little hands to grab and it's easy to clean. And when she visits granparents its easy to pack up. Side note. When she first got the toilet she thought it was a hat. Toddlers are silly people.",

We have used it at our relative\u2019s house & I\u2019m fairly certain she has a round seat, and we\u2019ve used it in public on some odd shaped seats, and it\u2019s fit every time, so far.

You have to actually push down on the potty seat in the back for it to snap in the toilet seat but my 3 year old can do it with no problems. I like that it stands up for storage.

It's easy to drop on the toilet and remove. Easy to clean. And I could see it being easy to travel with. The handles don't let down so may be annoying in a suitcase...overall not bad...but I should've spent the extra money for the one he can step up on that covers the seat more.",

He seems comfortable on it and no longer tries to push himself off, so win win! Also, the guard in the front is helpful for boy pee.
