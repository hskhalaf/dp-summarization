It would have been preferable if the USB and micro HDMI ports could have been slightly more widely spaced, as using the camera with the remote cable on the gimbal is difficult with the micro HDMI plugged in - however, persevere, get the right combination of cables (that are small enough to fit side by side) and it works beautifully.",

The focus speed with E-mount lenses is excellent and the touch screen movement of focus point is a great improvement over [e.g.] A6000. The build quality is good and the menu system 'typical Sony'. It is difficult to know how so many options could be organised differently on any camera. The big downer is the price.",

I like it so much I sold all my Panasonic M43 bodies and lenses. Yes, the touch screen is not feature-rich like the Panasonic, but you soon get over that when taking in account its specification with super phase detect focussing and low light capability The still images and 4K video quality are excellent. The RX100 was my travel camera, now I'm going to have to pack both of them!",

I now use it almost entirely with manual focus as the auto really struggles with moving images and where a lot of detail is present. Still landscapes and portraits are good though. Low light performance has been underwhelming so far and I was expecting better. I use it with the sony 18135 lens .",

    "description": "Sony Alpha A6500 APS-C E-mount camera (5-Axis In-body image stabilisation, 11 fps, 425 points hybrid AF, touchscreen, 24.2 MP APS-C Exmor, 4K movie) - Black. Autofocus does not focus well sometimes due to reasons such as distance from the subject and the environment in which you are photographing. Check the solutions as follows according to the conditions or environment. Make sure you are not too close to the subject: The minimum distance from the subject in which you can photograph (minimum focusing distance) is determined by the individual lens. Photographs will not be in focus if you attempt to shoot at less than the minimum focusing distance. Please shoot at the focus distance or farther away from the subject. Minimum focusing distance is noted on the front or side of the lens. Make sure the subject or environment do not inhibit focusing: Subjects with no contrast, such as blue sky or white walls. Situations where multiple subjects are at different distances within the focus area. Subjects with repeating patterns, such as building exteriors. Bright or backlit subjects. Shiny subjects, such as water surfaces, and glossy subjects. Fast moving subject. Focus as follows for such subjects or in situations where it is difficult to focus. Compose the shot with the focus locked using a subject at the same distance (Lightly press the shutter button to keep a green frame displayed.) Switch the lens or camera body to \"MF\" (manual focus), and adjust the focus manually.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nA6500 Camera Body\nRechargeable Battery NP-FW50\nAC Adaptor: AC-UUD12\nShoulder strap\nBody cap\nAccessory shoe cap\nEyepiece cup\nMicro USB cable",
