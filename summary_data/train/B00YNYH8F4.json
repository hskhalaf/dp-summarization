After getting rid of the IUD, I got this cup knowing that my period would return and sadly, it just doesn't work for me without major, major leaking, even without a heavy enough flow to fill the cup. I found the cup to be easy to insert and position, but even after checking that it's properly positioned, I have to go back to the bathroom within an hour because I can feel myself leaking. I never had this problem with my previous cup, so I know it's likely my anatomy that's the problem.",

The silicone is so thick that it made folding and keeping it in place it feel almost impossible. Once in, the fit was VERY tight and I felt a burning sensation. I took it out only to be sore for a few hours afterward. I know every body is different so I'm not surprised there are people who have had success with it. However, I'll be going back to Softcup.",

As an 18 year old virgin I can say that it was scary at first to try to fit that cup inside, but with practice and you being on your period, it becomes less complicated. Once set inside, it doesn't move and you can't feel anything AT ALL. Removing it isn't hard either if your relaxed and not panicking. My only issue was that my cup leaked after a few hours, but that's mostly cause my flow was super heavy and I was still new to wearing the cup. Anyways if your indecisive about getting this cup, I recommend you trying it out, there's even a 15% coupon online so why not?",

I have never had to take out in public which has been great not to deal with the mess in a public bathroom. I clean it in between uses as instructed. It is durable and I have recommended one to every female I know.",

It\u2019s also a perfect color (white is just not a good choice!) the purple shows enough to keep it clean but it doesn\u2019t look grimy. I\u2019m about to buy a new one, as it seems like it\u2019s probably time, but I\u2019ll buy this exact same one again because it\u2019s perfect.",

It took one or two tries to figure out how to best shape the cup upon insertion, but once done, it was easy to use again. In my experience, the Lena Cup cannot be used alone since there is some (minimal) leakage. To remedy this, I've paired it with some Thinx underwear during my time of month, which works pretty well and makes the whole monthly process a much cleaner experience. I would highly recommend this to a friend - though, make sure to have some sort of light back up :)",

      "text": "I bought the smaller size in colour pink about a year ago. The silicon used for this cup is more on the firmer side. I've felt softer cups. In my preference, this hardness is ideal as it retains it's shape well and snaps out into shape easily. The shape of the cup has remained as new. The cup is still performing as new. Suction hasn't degraded and it fits well. With every cycle I have learnt to place it better to eliminate any leaking. There is staining but I know there are means to remove staining. The cup comes with a little, high-quality, cotton bag that is not thin and doesn't fade.",

      "text": "I have never used any sort of cup before, so I was pretty apprehensive. I picked this one because I took a quiz online which suggested that this was probably going to work best for me. Inserting it and removing it definitely took some practice, but I am really loving it! Once it's in, you can't even feel it, and I literally left it in ALL NIGHT with no other protective layer and there was no spillage whatsoever...I could cry lol. I definitely recommend switching to the cup!!",

      "text": "I've been using the Lena cup for a while and it has SAVED me. I've converted to menstrual cups for good. I still need to use one pad in case of leakage because I bleed heavily for 3-4 days and then it gets better by 4-6 where I don't need to use a pad. Before using the cup, I'd have to line my panties with two pads because I'm so paranoid about coughing or sneezing and then disaster strikes.",

It does take a little while to get use to how to insert and remove, but I quickly caught on. The customer service reached out to me after my order to make sure I was comfortable with the cup, which I find that very comforting. Girls go for this product!! I love not EVER having to use chemical soaked tampons again and literally throwing money in the trash every month. And this cup is going to be phenomenal this summer during my many trips to the beach.",
