This blade not only cut it with ease it did it quick that a more suitable blade on the same material. So far after a couple hundred cuts it shows no signs of dulling. Make sure you have it tracking correctly and don't over feed it. I think a lot of Bands that go dull are from people expecting to much and over feeding.",
