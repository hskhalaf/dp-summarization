However, 2 days later he said he wanted to go smoke in his car, which I thought was weird since I bought him this fancy new ashtray. I went to check on him because it was getting late and I caught him doing the dirty with his \"ex-employee\" in his car. So, now my patio is ash free - thanks to this ashtray... It catches ash as well as cheating boyfriends - dual purpose!",

Holder for the cigarette is deep enough to sustain the wind. Yes, it's very light but this is an advantage - easy to hold in the palm when walking away from the table (it's California, you know, everybody wants to die in good health :)).",

It also has a place to hold a cigarette securely if you need to set it down for a moment. We have received many compliments from guests that have used them and wanted to know where we got them! I would absolutely recommend these to others!",

He wanted to try it out before our Sedona trip & he hasn't used anything besides it since then. He loves that the top lid flips down to help conceal the mess & odor & especially loves that the lid has an indentation that snugly holds the cigarette when you insert it, even in windy weather. He pops it in his pocket to go outside the hotels to smoke. Thinking of getting another so I can dedicate one of them to travels & leave the other at home (in the garage smoking area).",
