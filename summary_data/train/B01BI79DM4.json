The zippers are cheap as hell and were broke when they came out of the bag, but the cover itself is good quality and fits tight and EASY to install, unlike the factory canvas ones. When I say broke on the zippers I mean they were split open so once I zipped them up and back they stayed put but they won't last long I can see already.",
