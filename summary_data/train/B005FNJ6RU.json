In the past, I've just blocked the wood-burning fireplace with cardboard and put the TV in front of it, but moving into my new house, with a beautiful gas fireplace, I didn't want to hide it. This screen is extremely heavy. Despite their neverending attempts, my little catsnakes have been unsuccessful at opening the doors or tipping the screen. Personally, I wouldn't trust this to withstand small children without some kind of mounting or heavy-duty adhesive, but it's great for keeping your furbabies safe.",

But if that's the case you can probably afford a properly made screen and aren't looking to get it cheap on Amazon. Also, the door handles of course get very hot. Caution to parents of little ones.

Without the back braces, the screen will sit flush against the fireplace and looks exactly like inserted glass doors. The screen is HEAVY and is beautiful in person. The glass inserts are beveled and show up beautifully against the black and look very upscale. Totally worth the money especially since the company acted so promptly to correct the damage issues.",

Box was thin and arrived a little smooshed; the fire screen has glass and the glass was not wrapped in any bubble wrap or cardboard (I'm surprised it did not break) and two pieces of the glass were floating around in the box. Although I like the product, I may think twice about having something shipped to me from Plow and Hearth.",

The only down side is that you have to either set it up as recommended with legs on the front and back, but this means it will rest a few inches away from your fireplace. Or, as I did, you put just the front legs on so it sits flush with your fireplace, but that means if you move it, it won't stand on it's own. It does, however, stay in place with weight balanced between the fireplace and the front legs.",

      "text": "Everything is OK for this screen, but the tempered glass on top of the screen prevents the flow of the heat. The screen looks good too, but with this minor design flow. I have to pull back the screen about 3 inches away from my fireplace for the heat to flow correctly. I thought the tempered glass is pretty, but it actually not noticeable at all. I would buy one without no tempered glass.",
