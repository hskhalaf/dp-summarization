If that didn't happen I would have kept it. Also, I am 5'6 133lbs and got the Small and it fit perfect. Pros: Lightweight, stylish, protective Cons: Shoulder armor digs into skin while arms are up driving the bike. When arms are up, it chokes me a bit.",

The mesh is just right, plenty of ventilation but the jacket is solid in enough places I don't feel the wind on the highway, even with the insert removed. It's a beautiful color and the decorative stitching is eye catching. I love the neckline. I ordered an XL, plenty of room to move but feels like a tailored fit. The price was really great!",

I am a ultra curvy woman, and this fits beautifully in length - along with cool belts across the back so that you can size it just the way you want to. I was concerned because of the 'wine' color - but it is red. I look forward to wearing this riding my red HD trike, and wearing my red matching helmet.",
