No real sense of where you are cutting height wise, either barely cutting or buzzing to the dirt. And you are going to wear whatever you trim. For an extra penny they could have had an actual guard that functions. Going to pony up for a gas powered one that this tried to replace. This little toy is going to the trash heap. Do yourself a favor. Get a 4 cycle that runs on straight gas and has bump feed. My last one lasted 20 years. I\u2019m done with this after 2 uses.",

Expect about 20 minutes of run time each before the battery runs down. Charges fast in less than an hour.",

I\u2019m not great at assembly but have always managed to figure it out. This tool is the exception. I even went to the company\u2019s site hoping to find a video, but there was no help there.",
