Most people are up-sold to a Nighthawk, but that's really overkill. My first one died unexpectedly though. Supports DD-WRT and Tomato, worth Tomato probably being the better alternative. You can also bridge or repeat with this router. I daisy changed a few with acceptable results. Could use more simultaneous bands though. On a cantenna/wok-fi, you SNR is acceptable and will do half a mile or better with a good collector on either side, 1/4 mile only on one side to a router inside a house (through a wall) if you boost the other Tx.",

This router lacks that ability. Also, it\u2019s only 2.4GHz, which also seems to have made a noticeable difference. But, for as inexpensive as it was, it more than admirably performed its duty.

      "text": "I bought this router about 16 months ago, and am using it as an AP. It worked fine and had decent range for a while, but the past week or so the signal has been cutting out multiple times a day, or dropping to unusable speeds. Really disappointed in the longevity of this one. And of course, ASUS support is just not worth the hassle to get a replacement. Would not buy this again.",

The Asus interface is much smoother and faster than netgear, but it is not as flexible in the sense of routing. That being said, if all you want is a home router with good range from the antennas, this is an all around winner for the dollars spent.",

Also, my internet speeds are way faster now, although that is probably more of a symptom of my Linksys routers being really old, but I have not seen a drop in speed over the several months of use. I am very pleased, and the price was right, especially with the $10 rebate.",
