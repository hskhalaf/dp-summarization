I weigh under 100 pounds (side sleeper), my husband weighs 170 (back sleeper), so we aren't heavy people, but this mattress still sinks ridiculously. I often find myself rolling to the end of our bed because of the mound created between us and the indentation on my side. BUYER BEWARE. We've had this topper for only a month, and I'm already looking for a new one. I'll never trust LUCID again.",

Initially, it can make a hard mattress seem softer, but after a while of laying on it, you basically sink through and it winds up being even less comfortable than without the topper. The only reason I\u2019m continuing to use it is that the extra 3 inches to sink down into is enough to prevent my arm from falling asleep when sleeping on my side. Otherwise, I find it makes things worse when sleeping on my back.",
