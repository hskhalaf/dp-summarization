It comes with everything needed to get a gun clean, with a few purchases outside from the kit only to the liking of my fiance. The cleaning supplies feel of good quality, and the bore cleaners themselves feel of a good quality and heavy duty material vs the rod type cleaners. I am happy to have done my research and stuck with this brand and kit itself.",

I do think this kit should be sold for about 20% less, and the intrepid shopped could buy a fishing tackle box and assemble the individual parts for less.

However, just as others have stated, it seems like the company could have used a better case.
