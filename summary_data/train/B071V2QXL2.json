      "text": "I went on the advice of various commenters, and order these in a 9. I typically wear an 8.5. They're definitely too big for me. My heel tends to slide out whenever I take a step. On the plus side though, they were very comfy in the insoles. The heel is slightly odd the way it's constructed, so it feels a bit weird when I stand in them, but I suspect that's something I'd get used to. Overall, they're not exactly what I was looking for, so I'm still debating whether I'll return or exchange. Either way, they are definitely comfortable and I'd probably remind them to anyone who's on their feet a lot.",
