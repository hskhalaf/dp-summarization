A friend had one of these loungers while I had the hard ground, and whenever he got up I would slide into his lounger. It made the music festival so much better to lounge comfortably while not impeding anyone\u2019s view. So I purchased 2 (right from my phone while lounging) so at this year\u2019s festival I would be comfortable. I doubt there will be a festival this year due to the current situation, but I\u2019ll have my yard to lounge in. I can\u2019t speak of durability yet since I\u2019ve used it a handful of times, but it has worked so far.",

We had it set up for 4 days, it looked like it deflated a little after a day, but felt exactly the same when i sat in it, so i might be wrong. for $40 I would say very worth the price.",

As fun as it was while it lasted, the lounger only worked for a few months.",

It does take a little physical effort to fill, but nowhere near the headache of blowing something up with your own breath or keeping track of pumps and a variety of other equipment.
