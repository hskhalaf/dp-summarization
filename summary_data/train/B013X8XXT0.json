Couldn't find a scratch on any part of the glass, front or back. There was some edge wear on the metal but it was not noticeable unless you were looking for it. If I ever need to upgrade or replace this phone I will definitely check out what Edge Cellular is offering because when they say LIKE NEW it is LIKE NEW!!!",
