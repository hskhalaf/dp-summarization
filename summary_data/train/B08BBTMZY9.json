So when I row at what would be around 20 or 22 strokes per minute it registers 115 strokes per minute. The seller told me not to worry about it. Which is disappointing, but I can still get a great workout from the machine. If you need/want the monitor to read correctly spend the extra money to invest in a waterrower or concept 2. If you are only concerned with getting a good workout, then this is a good deal.",

The rower came 3 days before the estimated delivery date so that was great (SoCal to SoCal delivery). It rolls away for storage nicely and very well constructed. With my kids distance learning right now, they hop onto the rower for their PE time so it's working out great for the whole family.",
