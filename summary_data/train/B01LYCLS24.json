I highly recommend this product as a reasonably priced robot vacume. Battery lasts longer than advertised. Picks up that stuffy dust n dirt! All food from dinner and hair balls and small objects. Make sure you have a clear path for Eufy to patrol at night. Tidy up a few things, pick up chairs, make sure wires are tucked away!!! And you get a spotless clean floor every morning you wake up!",

It picked up dog hair and a good amount of dirt on both hardwood, tile and carpet. It transitioned between them fine as well.

I hit Auto on the remote and \u2018she\u2019 covers the entire house. If the battery runs low, \u2018she\u2019 will begin to make her way back to the base to recharge...Brilliant!!! You can also hit the house icon on the remote and Eufy will return back to base. Another good feature is if \u2018she\u2019 gets stuck in a tight space-you will hear continuous slow beep to let you know, help is needed. I believe you will enjoy Eufy as much as I do.",

So while this particular item didn't work for me - I will be on the lookout for any other products from this company because their customer service is outstanding!!! I still highly recommend this product to anyone with a short-haired dog - the suction and overall cleaning action is phenomenal.",

      "text": "This little vacuum worked great for the first year. Great for keeping down the general amount of dust and hair on the floor. However, after about a year, the navigation and battery-life began to deteriorate. At first the robot would almost never run into furniture, but would slow to a stop before changing directions. Now, it hits everything at full speed before bouncing away. Battery life is down to about 30-40 minutes and it is no longer able to find its docking station. The initial performance of this product, especially considering the price, easily gets 4.5-5 stars. But a 1-1.5 year period of usefulness makes this a borderline disposable product, so I have to reduce its rating.",
