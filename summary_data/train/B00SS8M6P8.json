Because of this all the wicks separated from their base attachment in the bottom of the glasses.

    "description": "HOSLEY'S Set of 12 Unscented Glass Filled Votive Candles. Perfect for weddings, holidays and other events. 12 hour burn time. Glass Votive & Candle included, ideal for Aromatherapy, Weddings, Party Favors. Horsley candles are equally well suited for to a variety of indoor and outdoor uses, including emergency power outages or simply providing warm, ambient light. Available in economical 12 pack or bulk 48 pack, be sure to keep your emergency kit stocked with extra Horsley candles. To maximize the burn of your candle, we suggest trimming and maintaining the wick to 1/8\u201d. Trimming the wick helps maintain an even burn and helps keep the flame from getting too close to the glass. As a general rule, we also suggest using for no more than 4 hours at a time to maximize the burn duration. Always use on heat/flame resistant surface and burn within sight. Keep away from things that can catch fire and away from children and pets. Always keep the wax pool clear of wick trimmings, matches and debris at all times. Product may come in a different package.",
