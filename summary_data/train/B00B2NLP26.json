      "text": "I bought this for the underwater camera and it works great. Last week I attached this to my selfie stick that I use for my GoPro, which also has a floaty thingie on the back of the GoPro underwater case. I attached this to the opposite end of the GoPro, just in case. While in shallow water and taking off my snorkel gear, I let go of the pole. After removing my gear, I looked over to my GoPro/heavy metal selfie stick and it was floating! With this Foam Floating Camera Wrist Strap AND the orange floaty foam block attached to the underwater GoPro case, it stayed afloat all by itself, a wonderful surprise! Thank you!",

      "text": "This waterproof camera wrist strap is a tittle more flimsy than it looks, however, it did the trick. I didn't let the camera go to see if it would float, but I could feel the pull of the buoyancy on my arm, so I'm sure it would float as light as the camera is. It was handy to be able to slide it up my arm above to get it out of the way while snorkeling to different locations. I got the pink, but rather than the picture showing matt black (where it attaches to the pink) it was a shiny patent leather look which looks rather goofy. Overall it did what it was supposed to do.",

Unfortunately, it seems the Olympus camera is too heavy for the strap. I does however increase the buoyancy so I would have a chance to catching it before it gets too deep, but I will definitely need to purchase another strap to ensure my camera actually floats.",

This Cowboy Yellow Foam Floater clips onto your waterproof camera easily (& clips off when you're on land), the wrist strap can be adjusted for tightness & fit, certainly the price is right...and most importantly, I tossed my camera into the water a few feet away, & the highly visible yellow float bobs along the surface with the camera just inches below. Perfect! If you have a smaller waterproof camera that is not too big & heavy...I highly recommend it.",

It is of much lower quality than what I was thinking it might be (granted, I bought the cheapest, so I'm not surprised). It shipped from China, which I wasn't expecting. All things considered it got here fairly quickly (about 3 weeks), but I was pretty worried when I saw it would be shipping internationally less than a month from the trip I was buying it for. Don't expect this to make it to you much quicker than 3 weeks. I didn't see anything, anywhere in the description that indicated it would be sent internationally.",
