I pushed more weight for more reps & sets and still had energy to give after my workout. Even though I work out at night, this didn't mess with my ability to fall asleep at my usual time.

      "text": "I would say this product was a little better than most NO2 supplements. My expectations going in were low, as with most sports supplements. I will say this one did at least seem to show some effect. I found that if I took an additional does of the main ingredient on its own, I would have better results. That was the strong point of this product, the main ingredient supplied was a pretty decent dose. I would say you really have to time this supplement correctly. Working out less than 45 minutes or more than an hour and half after taking it produced diminished returns. Overall I would say this was not a miracle pill, but still a good supplement.",

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Unless you want their lowest tier or products like fat burner, or pm activator. Its very misleading I think people should know. One positive is that the capsule size is manageable to swallow.",
