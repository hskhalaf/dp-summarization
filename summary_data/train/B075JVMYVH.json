The Dreadbolt certainly looks more impressive, but the Wrathbolt has the same functionality in a much smaller size. Still, since it's a bow, this is more of a blaster to play with outside a Nerf battle. It's fun for target practice since toy bows aren't exactly the most accurate. It's an extra challenge. Some might find it tedious to load and cock the blaster, but I find it all right. The click when the arrow is in place is satisfying. It's a fun little toy to shoot around the home. :)",

I was hoping the actors would be able to catch them during their scenes, but in close quarters, they just shoot too fast and far. So, we're having the actress shoot offstage, while the other actor hides one of the arrows and with a little sleight of and, brings it out. It's working out great, and like the rubberband gun I purchased, I have actors running around the theatre shooting at each other. Great fun!",

Super fun to play with, love the accuracy, ordered the four pack of refills. Love it! Now having said that, I would think twice before ordering this for very small children. I haven\u2019t tested it, but I would imagine the arrow could hurt or give a blackeye if shot in close proximity.",
