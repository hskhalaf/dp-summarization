      "title": "Great bluetooth headset, some microphone quality issues",
      "text": "I bought one of these headsets to use with my new job, where I'm often on conference calls since many individuals in our office work remotely. The earphone quality is great and I have no problem hearing others on the line. Sometimes I get complaints about the microphone quality, especially in windy situations (or when you're near an air vent). It works well enough for me to not immediately replace it, but I'll probably look elsewhere if it stops working. (I don't imagine that'll be anytime soon, thankfully). After 6 months of ownership, it still holds a charge of at least several hours. (I don't often need to talk more than that between charges!)",
