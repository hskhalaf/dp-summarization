So I ordered the regular size the same day. The micro beads massaged my scalp as I was applying the treatment and then there was a slight tingling sensation but in a good way. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I have only used it twice so far. I will come back on after I have used it for 6-8 weeks to see if I can up the rating.",

The exfoliating \"little grits\" are coarse enough to scrub away build-up but are not scratchy or too rough. My hair is very fine, platinum blonde (sometimes toned to a silvery-mossy, cool toned blonde,) and it does not weigh-down my hair- at all! My hair feels so soft, moisturized and has volume all at the same time... that never happens when I use a hair masque! Highly recommended! Love Love Love",
