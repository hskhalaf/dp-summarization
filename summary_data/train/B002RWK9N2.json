      "text": "I am pretty disappointed with Yamaha on this one. I owned it for just over 3 years and it had MAYBE 50 hours on it. Always started right up (although I condition the fuel in all of my equipment). The control unit went bad in this - it produces 12v but no AC. The control unit costs $700, not including labor to replace. I wanted to stay away from the cheap-knock-off-throw-away generators, but the Yamaha has even less value than the cheap ones now. I can see a replacement part of $300, maybe $350, but really? $700? Things go bad, but you've got to make the parts some what reasonable. In the trash it goes...",

The side panel goes into a thick rubber molding and the suction is very strong when trying to remove it. No way it can be done without tools resulting nicking/scratching the cover. They need to install an access port in the cover in order to get to it. These units are made in China. This one on this Amazon page is listed as model EF2000ViSV2 . My model is EF2000iS.

Used a 25 foot heavy extension cord with a surge protector to provide multiple plugin sites. Plugged in TV and antenna booster. Ran for about 3.5 hours using less than 1/2 tank of fuel. Perfect for our needs. Only problem is filling with oil. Be sure to have right funnel before trying this.",

Subjectively it was a much more annoying noise too in addition to being louder as measure by a sound meter. Soooo, back to the Yamaha. Light, quiet, dependable.

I misplaced the manual, so I went for the quick PDF download, they want $20 for the owner's manual. Honda's manuals offer a free download. A $1000 generator and they want to soak customers for another $20 for the manuals. I'd buy two Honda generators before I'd give those ripoffs $20 for the manual. Edited to add, thanks for the links, not sure why Yamaha wanted me to pay $20, but it's nice I can download the PDF. Again it is a great little generator, apparently I just had a SNAFU with customer service.",
