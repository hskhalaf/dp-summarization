      "text": "Over the years, I've probably owned 20+ pairs of Keens including sandals, hiking boots, hiking shoes, casual shoes, winter boots and aluminum toe work boots. I've noticed a trend in recent years that Keen products are not fitting me like they use to. This may be attributed to my feet changing over the years, but I suspect it's more likely Keen saving a nickel per shoe on materials by sliming them down. The foot beds and toe boxes were previously wider than most brands, which I need and appreciated. This particular pair of shoes ran narrow, weren't comfortable or supportive and were pretty goofy looking, too. I wouldn't consider them.",
