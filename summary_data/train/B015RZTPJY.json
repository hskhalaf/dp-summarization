Twist cap amazing, it doesn't leak and my kids were able to use it.. i like that it's compact and you can just throw it in your backpack when it's not filled with water. and yes, the wife went ahead and order herself another one.. so now we have 2.",

Great to be able to make it smaller when necessary (airport security). I (along with my wife) was initially skeptical on the price, but after using these on an extended trip, I'm so happy that we pulled the trigger. Totally worth the price and highly recommended!",

The way you bring the strap around to hold it folded up - does not keep it held well. It's just a metal loop you put around a notch. It doesn't hook to keep it locked in place.

My Nomader has already been to the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Russia, Switzerland, Canada, and back to the U.S. I filled it with water and clipped it to a belt loop with a caribiner daily. It easy to open, eaay to clean, and doesn't leak. When we got home, my wife retired the ribbed water bottle she was using, and ordered a Nomader to use. I'm glad she got her own; otherwise, she probably would have taken mine. I love my Nomader!",

One note: you do have to ensure the drinking spout cap is well-seated before tightening, or it will leak. But that was inattention on my part. When everything is secured properly, the bottle does NOT leak! I kept ice in mine, and it does sweat when that cold, but that's to be expected. Thank you for such a wonderful product!",
