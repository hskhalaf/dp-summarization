Don't have a kid or domesticated animal? Level it and you'll get a backseat view of the car and the road ahead of you, great for feeling like you're being chauffeured without leaving the front seat.",

Readjusting a mirror is difficult when you can\u2019t see what it will look like from the front seat. Overall, I highly recommend it! It may not be as cute as some you can get but it\u2019s way more practical if you are using the mirror to see your baby rather than being cute for the baby to look at themselves.",

There is no reason to get any other mirror on the market that I've seen. You don't need a light, trust me it won't work well anyway.
