It, however, failed to satisfy in terms of longevity and durability. Overall, if comfort is the user\u2019s priority, the Berghaus Active GTX is a low-cut hiking shoe that can deliver. On the other hand, if the ability to last is the prime concern, it is reasonable to consider other options.",

Because of the size (or maybe it\u2019s a design issue) they make the same kind of sound as flip flops do when you walk in them, I figure it\u2019s because of the size and my foot is moving too much as I walk. I\u2019m a big berghaus fan and own a lot of their clothes, but I\u2019m not as impressed with their footware. Wouldn\u2019t buy again...",

I sent photos to Berghaus and they said I should return them to Amazon as the 30 day rule does not apply for faulty items.

Had some North Face gtx shoes a while ago and had to send two pairs back as they were definitely not waterproof. Only bought them as I couldn't find the Berghaus ones in my size anywhere - glad they're available again now.",
