Could be very sophisticated when styled with the right skirt or dress. I agree with the other reviewers who said the strap falls off the heel. I contemplated having a cobbler shorten the elastic to make them stay on more tightly, but this remedy has previously resulted in the straps causing heel blisters. So back to Amazon these delicate cuties went.",
