I've purchased moose antlers (and deer, and elk) from other companies, but Amazon is so wonderfully convenient, I threw a couple on a recent order. Don't do it! They were tiny pieces, not close to the minimum measurements listed, nor anything like the picture. For this price, this is not the product they advertise. The picture I added shows an old (and already chewed!) piece at the top from another company - the bottom two are the \"extra-large\" pieces I just received. This company is not representing the overall quality of Amazon's other services and products at all.",

As usual, they immediately switched bones and within 4 days, the puppy had this XL Moose antler down to a nub so smaller (and splintered everywhere). The ACD and pup share the other, cheap antler now and it's going strong like it's brand new. As many have stated - these size descriptions are as inflated. I feel certain we'll find out that Trump's staff is ultimately behind the marketing on these.",

At over ten bucks apiece, the large one is a good purchase. The small one a waste. Sigh...",

Pros: The dog didn't stop chewing it until it was gone, he loved it. It is softer than deer and elk and may be a little safer as it does not splinter. Cons: Since its softer and doesn't splinter it left little crumb like bits all over the rug. Moose antlers are a little more pricey so I would've been happier if it lasted longer than a day or 2 of solid chewing.",

Hard nylabones are out, but the rubbery ones are way too easy for them to eat. So I'm always on the search for something that has that perfect balance. They love the taste of these antlers and will work on them for days. They are softer than elk antlers, so I worry less about them breaking teeth. Some people have complained about the size, but they were exactly what I expected. I usually get these at Petsmart and Petco (for WAY more money!) and the sizes are the same.",
