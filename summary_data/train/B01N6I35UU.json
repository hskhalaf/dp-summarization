With a little practice, one can have a pallet completely broken down in five minutes with little effort and minimum wood splits. I have already taken apart over a hundred pallets with this tool and can tell it will last for years. I wish I would have found this tool years ago!",

As tough a tool as it is, the head is held on to the shaft with a little pin ball bearing device. The ball bearing fell out on the second day. Hence the head fell off. I did make a repair. When I contacted the company, they were aware of the poor design. That's it. No gee I'm sorry or we'll send you another pin. If you buy this, it will fail so be prepared to make an in field repair.",

It has a detent ball that is supposed to keep the pin from migrating out, which worked OK until the detent ball itself fell out of its socket. I was able to drill the ball socket thru and use a cotter pin to secure it. Otherwise I'm happy with the product so far.",

I googled and found the duckbill and shipped it in one day. It arrived and used it on the next board and had it lifted in 5 minutes without pounding or raising a sweat. Duckbill has saved me well over $1500 in demolition extra cost. I donated the duckbill to the contractor and now he swears by it.",
