Video quality is excellent and stabilisation remarkable, delivering buttery smooth images while hurtling down the side of a mountain. The integrated folding mounting ears are a great improvement over the cases and frames required with older models Less good is the non-replaceable lens cover and the silly battery door which frequently detaches itself whilst attempting to plug in the cable. The latter is, I understand, to allow a \u2018mod\u2019 device to be attached although this removes the waterproof rating of the camera rendering it somewhat pointless for my purposes. If you own a Hero 7 (or perhaps 6) maybe wait a year and see what the 9 brings.",

The cam also does slow motion and supports lots of codecs and while it can't compare with my Panny GH5 it costs a fraction of the price while offering almost as good stabilisation too.

Never update the firmware via the app/wifi, it will look successful, but the horizon levelling won't work properly.Put the memory card into a pc,and load it.The horizon level is great,makes it virtually like a gimbal.So far so good.Update-strange pulsing in and out on some shots,sometimes the app horizon levelling doesn't work,or makes it worse",

The function is very easy to use and I am in love with this camera. Just a quick thing to note is the battery. Make sure you have few extra pair of batteries coz I believe of it\u2019s high resolution media the battery doesn\u2019t last long. But it\u2019s a small device with small battery.
