But my son...well when he gets in Lego mode he gets real upset when pieces are missing, but he is waiting for the replacement package, impatiently. That is why I only gave it 3-stars, because of the missing pieces.",

There are so many cool and nifty tricks to get those angles and curves on the cockpit, and I like the way that the engines are built. I don't really have any complaints on this, except that the Y-Wing pilot is exactly the same as the pilot that comes in the U-Wing. Which is kind of sad, since I'm trying to amass a whole fleet of Rebel pilots. And the fact that I dropped an engine during construction and completely lost a piece. But ah well, that's on me.",

But I know the new X-wing lego (75102, Poe's) is orange and black, yuck. The Y-Wing Starfighter has the light gray color scheme that makes Star Wars what it is (was): the gray ships fighting on a background of stars. I was hesitant to let my son get this one, because how can a y wing be better than an x wing? But once he built it, I had a change of heart.",
