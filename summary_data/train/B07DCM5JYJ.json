So, I thought this would be a cute sweatshirt for him. It did not disappoint! The quality is amazing! Which is great Bc I like to consider my boy my equal! Lol he deserves only the best and this seller delivered!!! Definitely will buy anything they sell in the future! PS the last photo I snapped mid him licking his Puppy Scoops off his nose",
