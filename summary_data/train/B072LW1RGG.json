Some USB powered products do not like long cords. This is the reason I chose a powered USB hub. So far all of my accessories are working flawlessly. Previously, my gaming headset was losing connectivity at times. Highly recommend this product and am purchasing another one.",

This feature saves wear and tear on the ports, so the device should last longer. This was definitely a good purchase!",
