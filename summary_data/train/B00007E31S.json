I had to quit using because somehow the prices went up to over $60.00 a can so had to look AT the ingredients and found good substitutes that I still use. Just a year ago found they dropped the price so it is affordable again now I still buy it but give it to my husband because the substitutes of collagen and gelatin (there are differences) I found are working great for me and my husband has been taking it and at 71 has no joint pain still working over 40 hours a day.

The trick is to disolve it and leave it about 2-3 mins so the cornflour blends with the smoothie and you can hardly know its there.",

      "text": "The finger nail ridges and splitting nails are still there but I haven't finished the container of Knox. It will likely take the time to consume at least the whole container and perhaps even a second container to make a difference, if a difference can be made. I use one scoop of the Knox product in either V-8 or citrus juice each day. Sometimes I miss a day. There doesn't seem to be improvement at the base of the nail where the new growth occurs yet either.",
