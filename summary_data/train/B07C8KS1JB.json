You can't really see the compass heading however I believe if I were to use the film I probably could. You can see it at night. The GPS syncs after a few seconds.i ran the power wire to a spare fuse under the dash so no wires to see. Great product! Thank you. Jk",

Uncluttered display omits the usual useless engine data. Needs no car connections except 12V DC Can be viewed directly or reflected from windshield. CON: Windshield reflection is not visible through polarized sunglasses.. Displays other than speed are too small and dim for most daytime viewing. Badly translated instructions will take a while to figure out. Complicated and counter-intuitive controls. OK once you figure it out.",
