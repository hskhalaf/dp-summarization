I found this reduced the number of bedbugs, but even with regular applications, we were not able to fully rid ourselves of the obnoxious, persistent creatures.

The tip barely lets any product puff out, made it very difficult to use. I can't speak for the effectiveness of the product as it hasn't been that long that I've used it, but its been very difficult getting the tip to get any product through",

      "text": "Thank you for your products. You know, I can't tell really how good it is, because I just started the treatment, and so I may have to wait a while to see if they are still around or not. I noticed the presence of these bugs early, which makes it easier to get rid of before infestation sets in. Hopefully with all the good stuff I purchased and following the instructions given, the problem will be solved! Thank you",
