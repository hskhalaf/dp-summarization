Dreadful. I used the supplied \u2018starter\u2019 roll of 1 inch D1 tape. It\u2019s unusable - the barcodes won't scan. I can't find any examples online of what the D1 tape barcodes are supposed to look like, so I'm not sure if this is just a faulty unit or not. Very frustrating!",

I think that is pretty good amount of time / use even though I damaged it. I might have been able to fix with out damaging it I am not sure. I have not used this new one a lot yet, but I am sure with the brand name I will again get many years use out of it. I highly recommend this to those of us that like to label things, have businesses etc (are OCD) LOL Thanks all. :)",

      "text": "Please... save yourself some aggravation and DO NOT purchase this printer. It will print labels but if you are wanting to print stamps with it, you will be immediately trapped into having to upgrade the printer. This is a rip-off. If you believe the description that you are able to print DYMO stamps, you will not be able to. You will either have to pay a monthly subscription fee or pay for another upgrade and who knows what else. Endicia support line is very sarcastic and rude. Please do not deal with DYMO/Endicia/Newell Rubbermaid. You will be very sorry that you purchased from them.",

      "text": "I think Amazon received a bad batch of these. I just received my second one which has the same problem. Put the tape in and it feeds out a little and won't cut. Now the tape is stuck and you can't cycle the cutter or anything to get the tape cassette out. The factory is going to send me another one. We have a 400 Dymo Lable/Tape writer Duo and we like it very much. Hopefully the 3rd 450Duo will work for us. ??? I'll follow this up when I receive it. I JUST RECEIVED MY REPLACEMENT PRODUCT FROM DYMO AND IT WORKS GREAT. AS I SAID I THINK AMAZON HAS A BAD BATCH OF THESE.",
