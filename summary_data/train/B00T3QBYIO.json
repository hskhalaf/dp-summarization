Was using the tomahawk today and the head sheared off at the first rivet. The steel inside was of a different consistency on each side of the rivet. Currently awaiting help from Amazon to see if SOG will repair and/or replace this hawk using its \"Limited Lifetime Warranty\". More to follow....",

The head is cast which is how they got the logo in, I find that interesting. It is indeed tough, I threw it bad once and it bounced on the road twice, but I couldn't find any damage or even a scratch. Overall, it's a good buy in my opinion you get more than you pay for at the $38 I paid.",
