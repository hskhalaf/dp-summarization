She'll eat it by itself, mixed with liquid, or with meat and vegetables. If you have a picky eater and worry that it's not getting the nutrition it needs, you might try this. The ingredients are super healthy. It's expensive, but my little girl doesn't eat much in a day so it works out for us. Don't know about a big dog though. One could go through this package in a day or so. It lasts me a couple of weeks.",

Word to the wise, it's only $19.99 at Mud Bay in Portland, so check your local boutique pet store. That way you can squeeze the cubes for freshness. Sometimes they're super dry and hard instead of soft and crumbly.",

Simply put warm water on the amount you are going to feed and you could break the nuggets apart with a fork (I use a fork). And it is good to serve.",

She will not eat her kibble alone, we crumble 2-5 pieces into her kibble each day and she licks the bowl until its all gone. When we are on a go with her, she will eat the cubes alone without a mess. They are healthy for her and make kibble more appealing. Also I noticed that it helps her pooping. I do wish it was a little less expensive but it is high quality. Also .. my dog will only eat the lamb or turkey flavor. The chicken and salmon gave her diarhea and the beef flavor cubes are too hard.",
