Not great for a party unless you make a bunch beforehand. After reading reviews, that's what I did. Stored it in a cooler and let the girls go for it. It was a big hit. We've used it many times for snocones. Definitely recommend for the price.",

You can freeze liquids such as orange juice, root beer or kool-aid, or you can shave plain ice and add syrups later. This is a fine product and works like a dream. The only problem is that the sharp blade inside the hopper is exposed and you need to be VERY careful when cleaning.",

The two ice molds that it comes with are perfect, and the ice shaves really well. We got this as a staff 'perk', and everybody is loving it, especially now that summer is here. I highly recommend it!",

( I am pregnant and have been craving sno-cones!) I have used regular ice and also have made ice with the containers that it comes with. Both work - but the ice in the containers it comes with works better. It turns ice into a consistency similar to freshly fallen snow. Can't wait to make margaritas with it next summer!",

This machine works as well with ice cubes as it does with ice made from the tub that comes with the machine. While the snow from ice cubes may not be as fine as the snow shaved from the ice made in the tub, it is not like its bits of broken ice either. What is best is you are NOT depending on a little bit of plastic to make the machine work (as in the case of the Rival Ice Shaver).",

It takes about a minute to make one cone so it isn't fast like the industrial ones. For a family of 5, it is perfect for impromptu treats. We bought all the syrups and make rainbow sno cones. You can also buy sugar free syrups for a treat that won't make your kids so hyper. Love it, it is worth every penny.",

    "description": "Ice Shaver makes sno-cones and frozen beverages. 2 molds included for freezing water or juices. Also uses regular ice cubes.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nOn hot summer days nothing beats a scoop of snow--to eat! This delightful Snowman churns out bowlfuls of shaved ice in just seconds. Kids can slurp flavored sno-cones for a birthday party and adults can sip frozen daiquiris for evenings on the deck. Two 4-inch round plastic molds with lids are included for freezing water, syrup-flavored water, or fruit juices. Simply place the frozen round (regular ice cubes will work, too, but not as well) in the blade unit, cover with the motorized top, and press down on the palm-size operating button. A bowl placed underneath (not included) catches the instant snow. For safety the sharp blade is completely internal and not accessible to fingers when the Snowman is operating. The machine measures 13 inches high when assembled, with an 8-inch-square base. A one-year warranty covers the Snowman against defects. --Ann Bieri",
