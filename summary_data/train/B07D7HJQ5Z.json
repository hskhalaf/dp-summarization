This is a tool I\u2019ve been needing for years and I\u2019m glad I finally pulled the trigger on this one. The adjustable depth gauge makes it really easy to do a ton of holes around the edge of a panel quickly and accurately. I like that this tool came in a hard case with a spot for each of the dies. I would reccomend this punch to anybody who is looking to save time in their fabrication process.",

      "text": "I was a little worried about how inexpensive this tool was. I was worried that it wouldn\u2019t punch through 16 GA steal sheet. But it worked like a charm! (Had to apply some decent force in order to puncher it, but I\u2019d imagine that any adult could achieve this) The only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars was because the offset bracket wasn\u2019t as easy to precisely set as I Had imagined. Not that I necessarily required such a high tolerance, but I would definitely recommend using a measuring tape when setting its position. Nevertheless, I was Extremely happy with this purchase...especially for the price!",

If you're using this to punch sheet metal thinner than 16 gauge, it'll probably do fine. It worked good for 2 days of punching 16 gauge. I decided to double up to line up the sheets, and then added some steel pipe to the handles for leverage. That's probably where I messed up, it broke.",
