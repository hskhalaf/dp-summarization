      "text": "I purchased this at the same time as my Agri-Fab Dethatcher (Agri-Fab 45-0343 Tine Dethatcher for all tow lawn sweepers \u2014 which also had manufacturing defects). The sweeper had holes that didn't line up, so I had to drill them out myself to fit the piece through them. Also, 2 nesting poles did not fit until I re-shaped them with a vice. My experience with Agri-Fab \u2014 while limited as I've only purchased 2 items \u2014 is that the products are not given proper quality control and are sloppily manufactured. I would only suggest purchasing if you have the tools and patience to fix items prior to using them.",

Now you have to deal with a cheap pin and clip assembly that you have to line up. Also the multi-height hitch setup is understood but I can easily see how many people will never do that correctly. At least print a ruler along the side of the assembly page for the hitch to make it simpler. An easy improvement. Worked well on its first run but as I said a pain to change heights or put in transport mode compared to the prior product which I sold before I moved 3 years ago. Wish I still had it.",

I have 4 stars for durability only because the bar the the handle attaches to, to dump the leaves is bent. Aside from that, I can clear about an acre an hour with this sweeper. A MUST BUY if you have a lot of leaves and a larger yard. I cannot recommend it\u2019s enough!",

I took care to make the tow shaft level when hooking it up and also took care to adjust the brush height to give the proper overlap on the grass (the instructions recommend 1/2\"). It sweeps well, both cut grass and leaves. If the leaves or grass you pick up are dry it is very easy to dump one-handed without leaving the tractor seat. However if the leaves are wet it might require using both hands (I was still able to remain in the seat).",

I have to stop fairly often and push the leaves back so more will go in. I sort of think it might be easier to just mow the leaves and pine needles up into rows, pick them up with a rake and use the sweeper to haul them to a dump site. I've used it on leaves, pine needles, and grass clippings.",

My only complaints are: 1) The instructions were pictures only. If you're slightly mechanically inclined, it's easy to figure out. 2) The handle to dump the hopper could be a bit longer. It's a slight reach to get it from my mower seat (John Deere D140) Other than that, it's a great product. And Made in U.S.A. to boot!",

Have lost two and had to fabricate new ones. I bought this to replace the exact same model I purchased three years ago. The axle that the sweeper brushes are attached to broke in half due to metal fatigue.",

It still works and does a decent job but I wanted a newer one that was a little larger and had the ability to be pulled offset instead of directly behind the lawn tractor. Enabling pick up as you mow. The new design is a pleasant surprise . The tow bar can fold out of the way as well as the hopper arms and the hopper can collapse. All making a much smaller footprint, when storing, than my older , smaller unit.",

Does a great job on grass and an OK job on pavement since it sweeps forward and pushes some of the debris along the ground instead of sweeping it into the bag. Once the volume of grass or leaves increases, it becomes more effective. If you don't have a huge area to keep clear, this is the ideal tool to use since the cost is only about $300 compared to well more than a thousand for a pull-behind unit that sucks up leaves and has a separate motor.",
