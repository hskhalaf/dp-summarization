      "text": "I often hear that buying makeup on AMAZON is a bad idea. But i decided to take a chance anyways lol. I\u2019m a HUGE Fan of Revolution Makeup. I fell in love with these Blushes the moment i saw them. The price is great, very reasonable. It arrived perfectly in tact. The product works as expected, actually no; it works even better.......the colors are gorgeous on. They are not overly pigmented. Nor are they dull. They don\u2019t flake or break etc when you go to use them. I will definitely be purchasing this again. And i would also recommend as a gift. Color selection is really good as well.",
