He loved it. Great pain relief! I would recommend this to anyone who has neck pain or back pain. It provides immediate relief. The only downfall is once you remove the device and some incidences the pain comes back. But in my case the more I used it, the pain eventually subsided. All in all, this is a great tool for pain relief. It sure beats taking a bunch of pain medication.",

This theracane has indeed proven terrific at alleviating those spots: find a point that's tender, and apply a little bit of pressure on the cane, and the cane will transfer the pressure to the point of interest - much easier and more effective than using a lacrosse ball against a wall. It's easy to use and well made.",
