When you make a product that is supposed to improve comfort and protection for a sport, but it increases discomfort, how does that help the kid enjoy the sport?",

They aren't \"true\" cycling gloves in terms of having gel padding (there's no padding at all) but there is good, reasonably thick faux leather on the palm that has survived several spills for us without tearing or wearing out. We bought three pairs, and the quality is consistent.",
