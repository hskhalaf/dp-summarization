How awesome is that? i love the lines on the mat, it gives me right angles to check my alignment. I absolutely love the extra bits that come with the mat. they can add breaks, also the stopper helps preventing the balls from running away if you accidentally hit a strong putt. On my living room is tilted slight to one side, and adding tiny break to the mat \"straightens\" it out! (of course it makes a small sneak to the roll but it helps end up in the spot where its marked as the hole!",

We played a lot during the last rainy weekend at home. Time passed really fast with it. Overall this is my favorite putting mat so far. One small thing to point out is the guide book needs to be updated with the steps on how to train with those accessories.",

I like that there\u2019s grain to the mat and it comes with a brush to smooth out the grain and dial in the speed. One note is that the grain can develop grooves after a few putts so you need to brush it to keep the ball rolling true. The markings are also helpful for dialing in start line and pace. The different cup options are also very helpful for different kinds of practice and it works well with my putt-out. I\u2019d highly recommend it as a convenient and affordable option.",
