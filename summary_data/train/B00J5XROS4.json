But the one I received from Amazon was in a different bottle, more runny and it makes my face break out. So I believe it is an out of date/fake product being that it is so different from the one purchased from Target. Not impressed.",

I have used several different kinds of bb creams. Expensive ones. Estee lauder. Kat von dee. Urban decay. All of them never impressed me enough to purchase a second time. Most of them still sit in my makeup drawer more than half full. I am truly surprised by this bb cream. Really. I am. And I will definitely buy it again.",
