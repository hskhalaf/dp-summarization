The first time she shot it no one knew to be extra careful and she almost took her sister's head off. Definitely have to make sure no people, glass or expensive electrons get hit with these. So I'd only recommend for a child who can be trusted to play by the rules.",

The shooting disks are really cool but three were lost in the first battle with their cousins and based on other reviews not the most easily replaced. Detracting a star for the lack of discs. This is a great buy, a lot of fun, seems fairly sturdy, shoots well without issues, shoots FAST & HARD so not for inside use. Even if your daughter isn't a big WW fan but likes to have Nerf wars this would be a good addition to the arsenal.",
