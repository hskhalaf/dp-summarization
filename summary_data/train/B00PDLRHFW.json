I received a shipping label to return my old router a few days later (it's free) and received my new router a few days later. Sometimes we overlook service and warranty for price and performance.

I had Comcast come out and they did extended testing of our lines and their service, and everything checked out. I contacted TP-Link for warranty purposes. They asked a mulititude of questions multiple times. After jumping through those hoops, I got an email stating my case had been sent to senior staff, and then I got another email requesting I allow remote access to my computer so they could help me reconfigure my network environment. Umm... no. I'm done. No more TP Link anything for me.",

Wireless range also seems improved, using the device in a ~2,700sqft single story plan, router is in a corner room, but coverage is not an issue throughout.",

Furthermore this is a long standing issue, with many support tickets opened, only to be closed by TP-Link without offering a viable solution.",
