For single gals like me, I'd suggest cutting the box and bringing it inside piece by piece. It's sturdy and looks great in my kitchen. I love the extra storage space! HINT: If, at first, the door doesn't close correctly, loosen the screws on the door, readjust it, and tighten when adjusted correctly.",

Sauder products are much better quality than some of the others out there. This pantry looks great. I assembled it on my living room floor, but I plan to move it to my travel trailer for extra storage of food and kitchen items.",

The images in the instructions are not the best quality but after comparing the picture on the box, it is easy to tell where everything goes.

It's very versatile and I love the finished product! Also, I had an issue with some peeling going on in the door jamb. I called the company to see what glue they would recommend to hold it down but instead she immediately said she would send me a new door! I was extremely pleased and surprised, I haven't dealt with a company that has such awesome customer service in a very long time!! I will definitely buy from them again.",

Otherwise, very happy with purchase.",

Only con was that it was very time consuing to put together. it took me just over two hours (and I've had to furnish an entire apartment in the last week, so I've done a lot of furniture assembly recently). I used an electric screwdriver, I don't know if I would have been able to do it with just a traditional screwdriver. I think it's worth it, but definitely a personal choice.",
