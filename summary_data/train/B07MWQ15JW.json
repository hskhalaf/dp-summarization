I have now tried all of the zelda games and this was the only one I didn't like nor finish. I know it has a rabid fan base, but it was not for me with constant timers and starting over.",

It\u2019s no wonder why it is acclaimed as one of the best Zelda games in the series. 8/10, would recommend.",

I can say that Majoras Mask is probably my favorite title out of all of them. It's characterized by being a quirky or dark game. The game play and theme of the game is genius. I won't spoil the story since there might be people who have never played the game. This is a game I can go back to and never get bored of since there's so much to do in the game.",
