      "text": "I was looking for an inexpensive treadmill walking desk and was inspired by someone on pintrest. This table works very well. I purchased four 5 ft 1\" PVC pipes, cut to suit (mine was 41\" in length) and slipped them over the folding legs of the table. I also added the PVC end caps so the total was about $12 in materials + the cost of the table. FYI, I used electrical tape to wrap the table legs near the top to shim the PVC pipes so they won't slide off when removing the table from my treadmill. I hope this is helpful as I had a hard time finding suggestions or solutions online!!!",

I'm sure we didn't do that, since we collapse and open the table every few weeks, and know how to do it (the legs won't move unless you do it right), so there must be some issue with delicacy of the legs.",

Underneath the resin top is cardboard which will probably deteriorate over time esp. in humid environments. I'm using it for a guest bedroom so it'll serve its purpose well.

The thicker plastic top doesn't seem any more robust than the older style, but it adds unpleasant thickness to the table that makes it harder to deal with when folded. Overall, it's sturdy enough for the price and works, but I'd rather have the old vinyl top version.",
