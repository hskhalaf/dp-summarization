If you use them without the spin-lock they can come loose too with heavy plates. However, if I use the spin-lock and the clamps, they keep the spin-lock from moving. The spin-lock is metallic so it can stand the pressure from large plates. It\u2019s seams to be a good idea to use both with heavy weight. With that said, I like them and they work for my needs.",

One more note; when I first put these on my curl bar, triceps bar, and my six foot straight bars, they went on tight, but after removing them a couple times and replacing them they seem to loosen up just fine. My guess is that the tolerances are very close. I have four sets of these collars.",
