Everyone should buy these! You'd never have to buy straws again. I especially like the angled ones because my husband drinks a lot of fluids in the night, so I fill his thermos with ice water before bed, put in the straw, and he's set til morning. No spilling on himself or fumbling around for the opening in the lid!!",

I squirt some soap onto the brush and run hot water through it while using the brush. I also like that they offered straight and bent straws. Great price for the item, too!",

But they do allow me to use low pressure to pull a liquid out of a cup and into my guts, which is what it needs to do. And I never throw them away. I prefer the straight ones.",
