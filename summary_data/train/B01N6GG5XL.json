I pinged customer service and they replied promptly, although the reply was less than ideal: basically, use DLNA, not NFS - but then why advertise it? In any case, that's a minor nit AFAIAC. SMB worked from a Windows machine - I have not tried to set it up on Linux. Overall, I like this machine very much.",

I see why the price went up though. Oppo digital doesn't make them anymore and the supply is low and demand is high. I definitely recommend the Oppo 203. Buy one now while you still can, if you can afford to. They will be gone soon and then it will cost you even more if you can even find one.",

If I pause a show, the audio and video go out of sync. If I change my selection, the screen starts to flicker nonstop. I have to turn the machine off and on again to correct the issue. I wish I could give this device a higher rating, but it is a dud. Maybe the problem is because it has been modified by the third party I bought it from.",
