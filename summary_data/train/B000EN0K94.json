I then purchased another SD700IS for my wife because we both loved mine. I have since purchased three others \"used\" because we have wore them out over the past seven years and as well as purchasing the same thing for some other family members and close friends.. Every one who I have purchased this camera for LOVES it!! It is not THE PERFECT camera, that does not exist yet, but this camera is one of the best \"low buget\" all around cameras that I've experienced!",

I have dropped this camera multiple times and it kept on working. The thing that finally did it in was sand. I was able to open it up and blow the sand out the first time around, but the second time, it wasn't meant to be. If it didn't break, I would have probably been shooting with it for another 3 years. Great camera, lasts forever (almost), takes abuse well.",

My favorite features on the Canon SD700 are: *The one-touch flash turn off (my old camera required me to go through a menu to do this) *Lightning-fast turn on and turn off speed *The rate at which I can snap sequential pictures (my Kodak made me wait several seconds between photos) *The rechargeable battery. I also love its slim size, and the fact that it has a viewfinder, a disappearing feature on today's cameras. Fantastic product all around. I'll definitely buy Canon brand again.",

I have absolutely no bad things to say except one. If you want to take shot quickly in succession on moving things, this doesn't refresh fast enough. After taking 15,000 shots, the lens stopped moving out and I had to get a new camera. I sure got my monies worth. I bought the SD powershot 960 now and love it even more.",

There's alot of features to work with, but read the advanced feature book that comes with the camera and after about a month you will take some amazing pictures. But of course, you can get along fine without ever reading book. I take it everywhere! I recommend getting a 1gb or higher High Capacity / Fast memory card. Specifically, I have a SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB and it's a huge difference, especially when shooting video and pictures back to back. I initially used the standard SD 2.0gb card and right away noticed the difference in the performance.",

The only down side is that for night time pics, the flash is kind of weak and it does not have a battery meter, and eventhough the baterry last for a good number of pictures, it doesn't let you know where you stand. I also suggest that you buy at least a 1G memory so that you can get many high res. pics and good video.",

(this is an important quality to me.) it is also small enough to put in a jeans pocket or purse and have pretty much everywhere you go.

Battery lasts really long at least as compared to my sony dscw7 which was stolen recently. Probably the best advantage over the sony is the fact that I can now take pics of my toddler without having the flash go off 3 times before the pic is taken thus ruining everything...",

This model camera, Powershot SD700IS works great and it fits into my housing used for snorkeling and SCUBA diving. The exterior on this used unit is pretty beat but the camera functions just fine. I am happy with this purchase. I had earlier purchased a refurb of the same model camera. If I were to compare the two, I would have to say that the refurb was in far better condition. Alas, I am most concerned with the functionality and the used camera works just fine.",

The camera is very easy to use and while it is very small, it has some weight to it so I don't feel I'll break it. I've taken several videos and I have absolutely no noise in the background. Crystal clear sound and the video quality is great. I'm so glad I got rid of my Kodak DX7630 -- this Canon is so much better!",

In all cases, the sizzling sound and scratchyness was present. For comparison, I recently took a few video clips with an SD550 at a wedding.

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe PowerShot SD700 IS Digital Elph sets a new standard. The first Digital Elph equipped with Canon's Image Stabilizer technology, its sleek, tri-color body is loaded with high-end features that make taking great pictures more stylish and convenient than ever.\n\n Get close, stay steady\nEngineered with Canon's sophisticated Image Stabilizer technology, the SD700 IS Digital Elph gives you the \"shake-free\" performance that makes your pictures sharp and clear. No matter how close you zoom in, the SD700 IS Digital Elph keeps everything stable. All you have to think about is your subject.\n\n High performance, high style\nThis is a camera that could make it on looks alone. But wait until you see its performance. The 4x optical zoom brings you in for intimate close-ups. The 6.0-megapixel CCD produces images of impressive quality with resolution that lets you create big prints.\n\n Canon innovation enhances your experience\nThe PowerShot SD700 IS Digital Elph features new ISO 800 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater flexibility for shooting.\n\n Advanced imaging technology improves every photo\n\n DIGIC II Image Processor\nCanon's DIGIC II Image Processor is designed to improve processing speed and image quality, so DIGIC II provides markedly faster startup, autofocus, and playback, plus it assures that every image is more colorfully vibrant.\n\n iSAPS Technology\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC II Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance.\n\n Shoot and view wide images\nThe PowerShot SD700 IS Digital Elph includes a 16:9 widescreen resolution option, producing images and film clips that are perfect for your widescreen TV or computer monitor.\n\n Superior movie quality\nFast Frame Rate Movie Mode allows you to record extremely smooth, full-motion movie clips for up to one minute in QVGA at 60 frames per second (fps) (320 x 240 pixels). With a highly flexible movie mode, you can create the movie that's perfect for any application. Select from VGA (640 x 480 pixels) and QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) with frame rates of 30 fps and 15 fps for recording up to one hour or 1 GB. Plus, Compact Movie Mode (QQVGA; 160 x 120 pixels) records at 15 fps for up to 3 minutes.\n\n Shooting Modes\nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions \n\nAuto: The camera chooses all the settings so you can concentrate on your subject. Manual: The ultimate in creative control, you set ISO speed, exposure compensation and white balance. Portrait: The camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject \"pop.\" Foliage: Capture brilliant shots of autumn foliage, greenery and blossoms. Snow: Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unatural bluish tint. Beach: Get clear shots of people at a sunny beach without darkened faces. Fireworks: Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Underwater: Capture underwater images with reduced backscatter effect. (Note: Optional Waterproof Case WP-DC4 required for shooting any underwater images) Indoor: Reduce blur and improve color accuracy when shooting handheld indoors. Kids and Pets: Reduced focusing time freezes fast-moving subjects, so you won't miss those special shots. Night Snapshot: Get natural-looking pictures with brighter backgrounds and subjects lit by flash. Color Accent: Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome. Color Swap: Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects. Digital Macro: Shoot larger-than-life close-ups with one-button simplicity. Stitch Assist: Build awe-inspiring panoramas by neatly aligning sequential images. My Colors\nVivid: Yield vibrant shots with dramatic high-contrast.\nVivid Blue: Emphasize the sea, sky, and other blue areas.\nVivid Green: Add vivid dimension to greens for extraordinary nature shots.\nVivid Red: Charge up red objects in your images for extra impact. Neutral: Produce images of subtle, elegant tonality. Sepia: Recreate the look of vintage photographs. Black and White: Deliver enhanced clarity--especially useful when shooting text. Positive Film: Combine \"Vivid Blue,\" \"Vivid Green,\" and \"Vivid Red\" to achieve a positive film effect. Lighter Skin Tone: Make your subjects' skin tones lighter. Darker Skin Tone: Darken skin tones a shade. Custom Color: Finely adjust brightness and vividness, and set your preferred balance of blue, green, red, and skin colors. The complete print solution\nThe PowerShot SD700 Digital Elph's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD700 to a Canon CP, SELPHY, or PIXMA Photo Printer or any PictBridge-compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button, and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh).\n\n Connect the USB interface cable to your Canon digital camera and a PictBridge compatible photo printer. Press lighted Print/Share button. You'll have long-lasting, professional-quality prints in minutes.\n\n Print your own ID photos in 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer. (Printers not included--must be purchased separately.)\n\n What's in the Box\nPowerShot SD700 IS body, Lithium battery pack NB-5L, battery charger CB-2LX, SD memory card SDC-16M, wrist strap WS-700, Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM, USB interface cable IFC-400PCU, AV cable AVC-DC300",
