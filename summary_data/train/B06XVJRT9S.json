Reattached the sleeves in a way that'd cover my bra straps. 4. Removed the slip (it's VERY short and see through) and attached the bottom of a white tee shirt instead. Voila. All did not use a sweing machine and stitched everything by hand. It took me a couple of hours.",

Fabric seems thin but isn't see through, not sure how easy it'll be to wash but we shall find out. No strong odor after unboxing and not too wrinkly either. Seems like a decent affordable dress",

I've returned both. My chest is a bit large but arms are proportionate to body, so I'm surprised other reviewers haven't encountered the same issues.

For me, if I'm spending more time standing up the dress is fine, but sitting down left 90% of my upper thighs uncovered which for church or a wedding left me feeling indecently exposed.",

It fits SO PERFECT! The top part is the very stretchy material so that\u2019s awesome. As mentioned in other comments, the sleeve elastics are tight for sure but not to the point of being extremely uncomfortable. I\u2019m super excited to wear it out! I also want to say that I feel the dress itself is not tight fitted, I wouldn\u2019t say it runs too large but if you can fit in a small in some dresses, you can def fit in a small for this dress!",

I am 5'3, 135 lbs with toned arms and D cups. I ordered a size small. The dress was too long with too much fabric in the midsection for my taste, yet the arm holes were SUPER tight. I also didn't like how much of the dress was that scrunchy fabric, which went down well past the bust which kind of made my chest blend down with my middle. Awkward. I would order a size up, but then the midsection would definitely be too big. So disappointed.",

I was skeptical at first because the price was too good. But when I received it and tried it on, I was blown away! I'm 5'2, 120lbs. Ordered a small. Fits great! Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is bc where the bottom of the dress meets the top in the mid section, it ruffles up and flares out making my hips look bigger than they already are. But that is not a deal killer.",
