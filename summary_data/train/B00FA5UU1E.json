      "text": "This product is sturdy and easy to assemble. Our 13+ year old precious Labrador still Loves to get out and walk but can\u2019t do long walks anymore so this wagon is perfect. It is super easy to push with her in it. It steers easily and is also easy for her to get in and out. I purchased a wedge pillow for it so she can look out easily while laying down. The wheels and handle come off easily and it fold quickly if you need to put in a car. Great product and well worth the price for the quality.",

He has to be tied down with a short leash to prevent escape. It's a smooth riding trailer. Easy to pull. Very light. Awesome excuse to go for a ride!!",

My dog likes to sit way back and when i leave the back upper flap open so its a little more open, the lower flap is really low and she pushes back on it. Doesn't look like she is going to fall out, but just wish it was higher. Overall a really great trailer and can def tell it is well built, def worth the extra money over the cheaper one in my opinion.",

He is 25 pounds, and the trailer held all of his needs (food, blankets, food, water), as well as some of our necessities with room to spare. The pockets are quite handy. Know that a smaller dog can get out of this trailer quite easily, we took our BT on several rides with someone following closely behind to admonish him to stay put, if he stuck his nose through the back cover. He got used to it quickly and loves it! Highly recommend!",

Installing the steel hitch to the trike resulted in decreasing the number threads engaged by the Quick Release Skewer nut. I effectively remedied this by purchasing and installing the appropriate Burley hitch adapter. The OEM tires did not appear to be very durable or puncture resistant so I replaced them with Schwalbe Marathon Green Guard RLX 16x1.75 tires. While I was replacing the tires, I also replaced the OEM Schraeder tubes with Schwalbe Presta tubes so that all the tires on the trike and trailer use Presta tubes.",

    "description": "The Tail Wagon is the perfect way to include furry family members in your outdoor adventures. Flex Connector allows bike to lay flat while trailer remains upright\n\nAMAZON.COM\nTake the dog or dogs along--the Tail Wagon by Burley provides versatile and safe pet transportation for your bike. With a maximum capacity of 75 pounds, the Tail can carry one large or two small/medium dogs wherever your bike goes. Designed specifically to make man's best friend happy and comfy on the ride, the Tail is equipped with 16-inch quick-release alloy wheels and a suspended floor to lessen the impact of bumps in the road. Side battens prevent the dog's weight from shifting from side to side during the ride for maximum stability. The Tail has a flip down tailgate for easy loading and unloading with a stabilizing kickstand and you can protect your pet from the elements with the 2-in-1 weatherproof cover option or let him/her enjoy the breeze and the view with the four-sided heavy-duty mesh cover. For additional convenience, the Tail has a removable floor for washing and optional securing tie-downs.\n\n One of the most easy to use and versatile pet trailers on the market, the Tail folds down quickly with a fast-action folding system for transport and storage. Use your Tail Wagon for skiing with the We Ski Kit--get additional storage with the Critter Compartment--or even use your Tail Wagon as a stroller with the Stroller Kit (all additional accessories sold separately). Finally, the Tail Wagon will keep you and your dog safer with its high-visibility fabric, reflective material, and safety flag.\n\n Specifications:\n\n * Trailer weight: 23.25 pounds, 10.5 kilograms \n * Capacity: 75 pounds, 34 kilograms \n * Heavy-duty mesh on four sides of cover \n * 2-in-1 all-weather cover \n * Waterproof zippers \n * Cargo pockets \n * Side battens \n * Tailgate flips down \n * Removable floor for easy cleaning \n * Floor is suspended above the axle \n * Kickstand \n * High-visibility fabric \n * Reflective material \n * Safety flag \n * 16-inch quick-release alloy wheels \n * New wheel guards \n * Fast-action folding system \n * Folded dimensions: 35 x 23 x 13 inches (89 x 58.5 x 33 centimeters) \n\n Compatible Accessories:\n\n * \n\n Five-Year Warranty:\n\n * Forged standard hitch \n * Handle bar assembly \n * Tow bar receiver kit, (front and rear tow bar receiver, tow bar guides, bolts, nuts) \n * Frame assembly, front (tube, frame locks, hinges) \n * Frame assembly, rear \n * Lower frame kit (main frame left and right), cross frame (front and rear) \n * Wheel guard tube \n * Brake assembly \n * Axle receiver kit with handle receiver \n\n Three-Year Warranty\n\n * Wheel (quick release, reflectors, axle, tire) \n * Flex connector for square tow bar with safety strap \n\n One-Year Warranty:\n\n * Safety flag \n * Front side panel \n * Cover \n * Tailgate \n * Floor and covering \n * Sunscreen \n * 2-in-1 cover \n\n Burley Trailer Limited Warranty:\n\n * \n *  Burley neither assumes nor authorizes any person to assume any other liability in connection with this Burley product, and there are no oral agreements or warranties collateral to or affecting this agreement.
