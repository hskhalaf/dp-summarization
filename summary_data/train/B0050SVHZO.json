So i kept trying and suddenly disc began to read but ...it would freeze completely after. Didnt want to return it even though i called amazon to do just that because my daughter was so happy to see it. So i called nintendo and now im going through the process of getting it repaired by them smdh. So christmas was ruined for her and sad for me. 150.00 for a dead system. Buyer beware",

The set up for the Wii U includes programming the touch pad to be your television remote. This was excellent for us cause we don't use cable or satellite television, so this provided us with a universal remote. The Touch pad works when the console is turned off, great for energy conservation. Best of all the console has amazing potential and I am looking forward to seeing how Nintendo unlocks its potential.",
