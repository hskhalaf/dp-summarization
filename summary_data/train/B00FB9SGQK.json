Or used it to move biscuits to the baking pan. Whether you are moving a layer cake or bread dough this will help to keep your product from losing its shape. Or you can move pie dough to a pie plate. I like the larger size and it can easily handle a larger cake layer to the smaller top layer. The offset handle makes it easy to hold. Highly recommended.",
