If you slather it on too thick, it will never dry right.",

I have not tried staining it to know how it takes stain, but it takes paint just like the wood I'm repairing. It's nice that you can easily reconstitute it with a tiny bit of water and dried out bits return to a workable state after mixing with the good putty and letting sit over night. My only complaint would be that a square container like the elmer's products would be nicer since putty knifes are flat, not curved.",

This filler is easier to sand, and doesn't stink like solvents. It says it is only for water based stains but it works fine with oil based stains that I use (professional/high quality pigmented stains). It will dry out if you don't press the lid very hard when closing the container so keep that in mind. Great product!",

This will still not be utterly invisible when staining, but it came the closest. I recommend cleaning up the edges where fill isn't needed with a wet cloth for the best result and cleaner sanding.",

I restored this wood patio table that had loads of cracks and gaps. Due to the amount of filler needed, about half the container, I will probably just paint it instead of staining. Great product.",

I just added a little more the next day. I did let it dry 24 hours before painting. All and all, I liked it though. It was very hot and humid the days I used it, and it was outside, so that my have affected the way it dried.",

Had to redo the entire porch with a different product. We have no idea why on earth this product was rated #1 by several woodworking sites. It is worthless.",

It required a little deep plastering with this product and had to wait overnight (16hrs) vs the 30 minutes recommendation from the manufacturer. Initial application showed a crack after hardening but I reapplied more into the cracks and that fixed the crack issue. I painted over it and about a month later it looks good. If this does not hold or I start seeing cracks I will update my review.",

So if you\u2019re going to use it on a piece of wood that will get wet, make sure the putty dries fully before painting it, and make sure the wood (and the putty) is primed and painted on all sides.",
