      "text": "I have all kinds of back trouble and try all kinds of weird tools to help. This is a nice simple, but helpful device for creating some traction in the spine. Honestly, sometimes there is so little motion in my back that the very first level is too much, but it does help. Generally, you can move it up and down the spine to encourage some extension in different places. I really like that, when I place it a little higher up, just below the shoulder blades, I not only get extension in the spine, but it perfectly pulls my should blades apart and creates some movement in the muscle and other surrounding tissue.",

When I went to place it on my chair I noticed that the retention strap was more or less useless because it failed to keep tight. Luckily it isnt necessary because the product just rests on the seat of the chair anyway. The needles were a little bit hard to get used to, but over all it kind of feels nice to have some pressure points on the back. Overall im very pleased for what I paid for. I only use level one for now, which is the least curved, and that seems to be more than enough.",

Slowly started to feel comfortable and with a month, it helped a lot to overcome by back pain. Worth every penny and helped me sleep peacefully at night.",

      "title": "Solid Back Stretcher - May be hard to put together for some.",
      "text": "The Back Stretcher Device by Bodyease is a solid stretcher. Pros Price, not too expensive. Construction - Can take some serious weight. Does what it says it does, stretches your back out. Cons Will be hard for some people to adjust/put together. The bumping pattern on the board itself can be painful for some (I personally like it, it's not bad for me) You can always throw a towel over it to help with that. All in all not a bad stretcher, does what it claims but takes some force to put together and or adjust levels. If you need to stretch your back out, this is not a bad buy.",
