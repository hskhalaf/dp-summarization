Although this reformatted model is no longer fitted for running, it will keep you literally on your toes for several hours without getting foot discomforts.It may feel tight straight from the box but the synthetic leather detailing is forgiving, which makes it a bang for the buck. You can wear this with strings of casual wear, from jeans to scrubs.",

I'm not sure if it's that a lot of newer shoes seem more cheaply made, but these were the most UNCOMFORTABLE shoes I've ever worn.. I've literally worn cleats that felt better, right out of the box. I normally wear a men's 9, but took people's advice to get a half size up. A 9.5 was perfect. But the sole.. so damn hard!! And zero arch support. After only an hour, my feet were pissed off, veins flaring, and calves cramping up. Returning them \ud83d\ude41",

Update, after 1 week the left heel collapsed and is noticeably lower than the rest of the footbed. Disappointing. I'm not sure if this is a one-off fault, or if other people have the issue.",

It's lite, has good traction, would buy another in fall.
