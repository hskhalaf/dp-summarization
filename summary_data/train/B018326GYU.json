Brackets are spaced 16 inches apart on the back of tv and slots on the back of cover are 28 inches apart. I like the design and quality of the cover - it just doesn't fit correctly. Be sure to check your tv bracket spacing before purchasing. I could not find the dimensions for the slots in the listing - description just stated that it fits standard mounts.

We live in the Seattle area and haven't had any big storms since we put it up, but did have a few days of heavy, constant rain. It also protects it from the sun. Easier to put on with two people.

It is not a 30 second thing, especially since I need to climb a step stoll to reach the top of the tv located over an outdoor fireplace. I think the type of mount you have makes a difference. I have a sanus tilt mount. I could not get it to fit perfectly in the back. All that said, it does the job. It is not a snug fit but it does work. Some of the more tailored ones are quite a bit more expensive",
