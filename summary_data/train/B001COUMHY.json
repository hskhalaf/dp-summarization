The material is firm but not too hard, so we have seen no damage to the mouth for repeated retrieval. This set comes with plenty (three white, two orange, and one black and white). I would note that the black and white one is called a \"flasher\" though this does not mean it lights up or anything, so I am guessing it must be a terminology thing. That said, my black lab loves these, they chuck far, float well, and retrieve well. A great training tool.",

They are a perfect size for him (he weighs north of 100 pounds) as they are designed to fit in their mouth comfortably and the rope on the end gives you the leverage to twirl them a few times to build momentum so they can sail through the air a long way. They last for a very long time!! This is a great product! I am not compensated in any way to review this product.",
