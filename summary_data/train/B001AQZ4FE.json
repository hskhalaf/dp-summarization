The orange one lasted only a few hours. While we were frustrated and bummed, the dog was really even more so as this is the highlight of boating for him!",

However, the last time we went to Dog Beach, our youngest dog got very sick from injesting too much salt water. Apparently you\u2019re not supposed to use a ball or ball shaped toy to play fetch in the ocean. When they go to retrieve the ball, saltwater gets in their mouth and the ball shaped toy \u201cplugs up their mouth\u201d so that the water has no place to go, so it gets swallowed. With this toy, the shape allows for the water to run out of their mouths. The bright color allows for it to been easily seen.",

Even though he just sort of mouthed the item, and we never let him have it outside of the pool after about 250 retrieves ( each of about 30 feet) the bottom rubber would fall off. Then the canvas would ride up towards the rope end, and finally a rubber covered spine would fall out of the foam. Got two of them, both done in less than 3 weeks. Great at first, but kind of expensive if I need 3 a month",

It's easier for the dogs to see, find and grab in the water than a tennis ball. They're well made and hold up to rough play from big dogs. My one issue - at $10 each they're a little pricey and I've already had to replace one that floated off never to be seen again!",

      "text": "These are much better than the typical bumpers for a few reasons. First, they can withstand a few minutes of chewing without coming apart like other rubber bumpers ive used in the past. The other reason is the shape. They float high so the dog can see in rough water. They are also flat, channeling water away from the dogs mouth. Other bumpers allow water to go into the dogs mouth (if they're fast swimmers). I will forever be a customer.",

But for water fun she loves it, it was the envy of all the dogs! Every chance they got another dog would try and steal her toy! The design is simple, I don't see the appeal but then again I'm not a dog. There's something about it that draws them too it like a moth to a flame! If your dog loves playing fetch in the water don't hesitate for a second to get this toy! 100% Highly recommended!",

      "text": "While my Welsh Terrier loved playing fetch and tug of war with this, it met an early demise. Not from my terrier, but we live adjacent to an open trail area that is a highway for coyotes at night. One night we left this in the yard by mistake and the next morning it was laying in the open area on the other side of our split rail fence with the rope chewed in half. Apparently this item is also enjoyed by coyotes. :-)",

However, the fabric wrapping the thing, will easily unravel thread by tread. My Border Collie chomps on it as he swims back to shore and it was enough to puncture some holes in the fabric, the seam let loose, and in a short time it fell completely apart. It was only used for water retrieve as intended and didn't last but a dozen swim sessions. I won't purchase again. We'll stick to Kong's Wubbas.",

It's also 50% cheaper here on Amazon than in Petco, which is why I got it here after seeing it there.",

If your dog is a chewer, make sure you don't give them free access to this toy. This is the kind of toy that is best used only for supervised retrieving.",

My dog doesn't like to open his mouth wide in the water because he doesn't like to get water in his mouth. The rope would be easier for him to grab.
