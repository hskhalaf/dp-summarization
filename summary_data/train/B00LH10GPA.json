I bought 2 4-packs and use them to help keep my guinea pigs cool during the summer months (I wrap them in a layer of cloth so they can stand/lie down on the packs if they get too warm). They're filled with water only and not that gel, so if for some reason my pigs do get under the fabric and chew on the pack, the contents inside won't harm them. One pack only lasts 2-3 hours before the ice has melted, and about 5 hours until it's fully warm, but when I put two packs together it lasts a little longer.",

So, we opted out for these. Although we were concerned about the longevity of the coolness because of the size, we bought these anyways because of the size and weight. However, these ended up surprising us with how long they stay cool! It keeps our 4YO's lunchbox cool until she gets home when I take them out to put back in the freezer (9AM-230PM)! Cute shape, great durability, keeps things cool, and lightweight!",
