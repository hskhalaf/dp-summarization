Looks sturdy enough and with the lock on the inside, people would have to drill through the lock on the top or saw through the side to break it open. Then again, the key also seems a little generic. Don't know how hard it is to pick it or obtain a key \"replacement\" from Honeywell to open it, so caveat emptor, I guess. For its price, it stores stuff and prevents people from looking inside, which in my opinion, is good enough.",
