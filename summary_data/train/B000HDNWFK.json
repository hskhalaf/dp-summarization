The standard footbed may seem hard at first, but it's secretly not. There's this subtle spring to the sole that supports your foot in unimaginable ways.

I wear a size 8W and ordered size 38 regular. The fit is perfect. It did take a few days, less than a week, to become accustomed to the shoe, but now, they fit like a glove...with socks or without. The color here is a nice golden oak brown and does not appear to be the orangish color depicted online. You will be happy, I'm sure.",
