The finish shows some wear and tear as Ive only used silicone, nylon, and wooden utensils but the finish has held up nicely. The chips and scrapes haven't flaked or enlarged in anyway. If you like to cook stir-fry or anything really it's definitely worth picking up :-)",

This wok is the exact opposite - I feel it's surprisingly light for its size, and cleaning it has yet to be a problem. The measurement guides in the middle of the wok are also surprisingly useful, and a nice decorative touch as well! I hope to use it for many years to come.",

It also browns evenly when I used it to toast some bread slices. Only time will tell if the coating is going to peel over time.",

Now, several months later, I can't even fry an egg on it without first spraying it thoroughly with a Pam type product. Very disappointing for the money paid for this product.",
