I use it when my hair is wet before drying, and also anytime my hair getting frizzy at the ends. You can apply thru out your hair, even scalp and it only moisturizes never looks like you added an oil. Pricey compared to other products who promise the same results - but, for me, worth it !",

Towel dry your hair, mix the small amount of product between your hands and rub through your hair. I stay away from the scalp and focus on the ends. My hair is shiny, lasts several days without shampooing again. This product tames the fly-aways and is good on fine hair.",

I purchased the Moroccanoil light to put through my hair before I put it in a ponytail. I ran it through my damp hair about 3\" from my part as is recommended by other reviewers to keep hair from looking dirty. I let my hair air dry and loved the way it looked. And it's soft and smells great.",
