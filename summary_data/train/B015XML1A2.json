The company changed the packaging, but did not make it clear that these are not the same as before (it should state it clearly on the package). There are cats with food allergies and sensitivities and customers should be able to trust that a brand will be forthcoming with ingredient changes. The ingredients are very different and some amounts/doses have changed (I've attached a side-by-side of the old (left) and new (right) ingredients). I am not going to buy these again.",

Since this was the only thing that had changed I didn't feed another one to her until two weeks later and again she pooped blood the next day. Took her to the vet and she was perfectly healthy otherwise, they suggested watching her and discontinuing these new treats and she has been absolutely fine since. Could be a coincidence but she only pooped blood twice in her life and it was after eating these treats both times..Cannot recommend these less and I would give them negative stars if I could for making my cat sick.",
