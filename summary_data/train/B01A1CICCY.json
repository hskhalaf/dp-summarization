This is Sony quality and sounds great outdoors. It also has a Bass feature that give speaker a lot more bump as well. This speaker works best if you download the app and run it thru there, very easy to download. Gives you many more options for the party light feature as well as a sound equalizer. This speaker is a little more expensive than the off brand speakers that sell around $100 but it's well worth it....",
