      "text": "On paper, it looks great. In reality, it is hot garbage. It overheats on all games that are even a little demanding (CPU overheats for Planetside 2, GPU overheats for Warframe, both GPU and CPU overheat for Destiny 2). I have to manually manage GPU and CPU temps to make sure that it isn't overheating. I SHOULD be able to pay these games with graphics at max but no. CPU overheats without VSYNC on, and I needed to download MSI Afterburner and manually set the GPU fan to ensure that it wasn't overheating with games like Destiny 2. This is an overpriced piece of crap. Do not buy if you are looking for top-end gaming.",

It's quite small and I think it's generating a lot of heat, especially without any heat sinks. Tried to save some time and hassle of putting together a custom gaming PC. Sending the PC back to Amazon to have it repaired since it's still under the manufacturer's warranty. Hoping they'll fix it, but my faith in Acer's quality has gone down significantly. Wont be buying anything Acer anytime soon or ever.",
