I don't want this to sound like it wouldn't work for a big guy like myself - you could tow a small trailer with it. All-in-all, it's TRX quality through and through. She loves it.",

There is a learning curve with becoming comfortable with it but there are so many videos to help it was a quick process. It's very sturdy and comfortable to use. We started by using it on a door which was okay and will work if we take it when travelling but did mount it on the ceiling. Awesome product!",

Too tall...well, you\u2019d have some wiggle room with adjustable straps, but at some point, it would be too high off the floor to use effectively.",

It is durable and effective for our weights. My partner and I both weigh around 140 lbs. Would recommend.",

Grateful for this product. Amazon is unethical and has horrible customer service. My recommendation is to order directly from the merchant and cut out the middle hussler that\u2019s taking over the world.",
