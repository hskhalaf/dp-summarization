This kennel was suppose to be a safe place for our puppy. I hope no other family has to experience a tragedy like this.",

Nothing has happened so far, but I am not taking any chances as I inadvertently passed my fingers across that section while straightening up his bedding (towels).

I did the same with our last dog's dog bed and am glad I did because while it seemed enormous when she was a puppy she filled it out by the time she was full grown. The movable interior grate to gradually expand the area as the puppy grows is necessary and having 2 opening doors so you can position the crate in various ways against a wall depending on the space you have is a great benefit as well. Very well made for the economical price.",

When this arrived and we put it together, it was soooo much easier than the existing crate we had. As our puppies continue to grow, we decided to get rid of the older crate and get a new, larger one. So, I bought the 42\" and, right now, both puppies fit inside. They're mixed breed but they both weigh 30lbs and 27lbs if that helps. We'll soon probably need to put up the 36\" again so they can have their own spaces once again. This crate is super easy to put up and take down.",

We have never had any incidents with it nor has our cattle dog. We have had it since she was a puppy and the divider got us through the potty training stage smoothly. She loves her \"room\". She has space to stand and stretch out. I would definitely buy it again. My aunt got the largest one for her dog at the same time from the same seller, and she loves hers too.",

Using this wire crate in the car is working great!. She can see out and she can't damage my car. The whining has decreased dramatically. She sleeps in a larger wire crate at night, so she may associate this smaller one with the night time crate in the house. I just know it makes car rides so much better now. I did have to bend the latch a little to keep it closed and tight.",

Overall I recommend it. It's a good value - and some of the little pups keep growing out of them - so you can collapse it and get the next size.",

Quick and easy portable bed for the pups. The kennel is a sturdy interlocking connection that I feel completely comfortable using with my pups inside. I definitely recommend this product!",
