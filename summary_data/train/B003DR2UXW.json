The blades are razor sharp and it is perfectly balanced. When it comes to performance: It's a three-bladed broadhead. These things are rocket science. As long as the blades are sharp and the accuracy is good, there's little reason to think that one quality fixed broadhead is significantly better than another.",

Fly great and extremely lethal. Expect short blood trails. Deer usually drop within 40 to 60 yds. Big hogs maybe 100 yds. As long as I Bowhunt I will shoot grim reapers. Try others if you want but you want find a better broadhead.",
