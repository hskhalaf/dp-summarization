It's soft and lovely and the sounds are very nice. Our colors and sounds are lined up. Some of the other reviewers mentioned that the sound that says \"brown\" isn't actually on the brown tentacle. This is NOT the case with ours. They are all accurate. I think this will be a favorite of ours for quite some time!",

We have had it for a few months and she gets so excited when she sees it. I\u2019m not sure why but I think it\u2019s the octopus\u2019s grin. Plays some songs. Tells some colors.

Word of advice, avoid even considering buying any of the Vtech baby toys. those things break in less than a week. you will regret spending your money on it.",

I did not have any trouble understanding this toy. Product Dimensions: 7 x 11 x 11 inches I don't agree with the product dimensions, mine was more like 5x9x9, I guess they stretched the legs as far as possible to get these dimensions.
