In movie mode, the 7.1 system does a great job of creating a surround effect without the need for rear speakers. When watching a TV show, the clear voice is phenomenal, and music rivals my high end Yamaha receiver/1000 dollar JBL combo. The bluetooth pairing is fast and easy, with no noticeable lag when playing music or listening to a podcast from my iPhone. This system checks all of the boxes; you can't go wrong.",
