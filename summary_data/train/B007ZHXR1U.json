Why a Gibson cost more... \"I will never know\" This is my 4th Epiphone: One day they will be worth twice the price. Get yours now before it's too late. The Set up it comes with is top quality. This model \"Standard Plus-Top Pro\" is worth bragging about. My friends that Paid $$$ for their Gibson are covered with Envy.",

This thing was packaged with great care from the manufacturer, and then boxed up again. It arrived in pristine condition, out of tune obviously but without a single blemish. Bought alongside an Orange Crush amp with a built-in tuner it stays in tune very well and only requires to be re-tuned every once in a while. My only regret is that I wish I'd bought it a few months ago when it was on sale and $150 cheaper but still worth every penny at the higher price.",

I decided to go for it but then after reading the great Epiphone reviews I pulled the trigger on the Plus Top Pro. Beautiful guitar. Set-up by Gibson and then sent to me. I have 7 guitars and a couple are fairly expensive. This is my favorite after playing it for a few months. I will say that the treble/rhythm switch was not working properly when I received it but a call to Gibson and they sent a replacement guickly. I doubt you can buy a finer guitar for the money.",

The guitar came set up, but the action was a bit high for me so I took it to a local Luthier and had it lowered. I also changed the strings to a lighter gage. It chords so easily and is so sweet to play. The sound it puts out rivals any Gibson I've seen. And the sustain - it goes on and on. Epiphone has upped their game and the guitars being made today are not your father's tinny sounding Epi's.",

This guitar was assembled in China and then inspected and set up in the U.S. It is lovely to look at but the range and power and beauty of its tone took my breath away. I never imagined it could be so sensitive along with being such a powerhouse and sustain monster. It is everything I ever dreamed of having in an electric guitar. I recently bought a MIM Strat from Amazon as well and both guitars are superstars. Highly recommended!",

I contacted Gibson, and they took six days to reply. At this moment, I am requesting a replacement at Amazon. Besides my negative experience, the guitar looks excellent for being only $549. I bought it because of its nearly-perfect reviews here. I will update this review after receiving the replacement guitar.",
