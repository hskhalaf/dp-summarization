I did the job in my driveway, and this saw did great. Chain tension wasn't an issue, as I checked it after each cut, and the chain just ripped through the tree limb like a boss. No chain oil comes with this saw, but any hardware store will have it. I considered a Stihl gas chainsaw, but couldn't justify paying that much for something I won't use very often. This was a great buy.",

Within 5 minutes the chain was falling off and everytime I tightened it back on (and yes it was being lubricated) it would last for only a moment. Lost my return window as well. Big bummer.",

The chainsaw struggled to get through limbs that the less powerful polesaw cut off easily. Then the chain slipped within 20 minutes of turning it on. When I reattached it, I noticed that the guard is secured by a single internal peg which makes it wobbly and prone to slipping the chain. It slipped off again a few minutes later. Then a third time, then a fourth, all within the first 30-40 minutes of opening the box. I gave up and returned it.",
