Update November 2014: Amazing that an electronic device that hit the market in 2006 is still useful in late 2014. Pressed this into service on an old Hackintosh that didn't have it's internal sound card working. Paid only $20 for this in '09 on closeout. Still comes in handy. Update May 2018: They still work! Glad I bought two of them. Still works on Windows 10, Mac OSX 10.13, and Raspbian Jessie.",

Bought this USB external to plug in the speakers/sub woofer and boom, music. It has a couple of cool features to modify the sound, and overall it is excellent. Solved a problem for little money. I also like the fact I can now plug this into any computer, and have sound ( you still need your speaker system). Took a little trip, brought the macbook pro, the Creative Labs and small speakers, and we had music!!!",

All pretty lights went on as soon as I plugged in the creature but all sound went to the laptop's built-in speakers, not to the shelf speakers. It later revealed (or maybe it's in the documentation?) that Xmod does not work with old (slow) USB ports. Then, I tried my desktop, which has only a basic sound board. It removed vast majority of white noise. I can hear them only when no music is played.",
