Either way I love the ease of use, each day with writing space and information on warm up's, cool down's, accurate workouts per muscle group guide, and WAY more, measurements before & after photos areas etc. What more can you ask for out of a book!? I was concerned about it being a spiral bound & not hardcover but now that I have it I prefer the flexibility of the book and have had NO issues with how well made the plastic Spiral is! I highly recommend this for anyone on this lifestyle change!",

I don't need a book that has room to log my food intake, I really just want something where I can plan my workout in advance, and then be able to review past weights/reps. I also need it to be big enough to write in, but not giant size. Surprisingly, there are few options out there. This journal works perfectly. I took off a star because 1) the cover is very ugly and 2) there is a misspelling on the cover. I'm not the grammar police, but someone really should have at least proofread before sending to print.",

Seems like they've thought of everything even capturing your overall mood for the day as well as your activity and sleep. I'm really enjoying it so far. I know from experience that when you use this type of tracking method, it helps tremendously in keeping you accountable for what you eat and do throughout the day. I would highly recommend this product.",

It has a little section to write down measurements and goals, a very small chart with workout suggestions for each body part, and a little list section for whatever. All of that only takes up the first few pages and rest are all about the workout! Perfect replacement for the bullet journal.",
