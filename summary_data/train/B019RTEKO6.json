Wash face 2. Use product 3. Toner 4. Moisturize The product comes with little pads. one side has little cotton ridges that is the smooth side- the other is exfoliating. Do the smooth side first then flip it over and exfoliate. It leaves a little bit of sticky residue on your face which I wash off with water about 5-10 minutes later then do toner and moisturizer or serum. And the smell - it is glorious. It\u2019s called a peel but doesn\u2019t really make your skin peel.",

      "text": "I'm in love with this product. Not only is it a great exfoliator but it also smells amazing! I use it once or twice a week, meaning that this will last me several months. This is a great addition to my 10 step korean skincare routine, I use it after double cleansing and it leaves my face super smooth and ready for toner and essence. I love the fact that international shipping was free as well, as it was shipping directly from South Korea. Another plus was that the price was way cheaper than i've seen from other websites, so all in all this was a great buy!",

Other than that, if you are fine with moderate chemical exfoliation, this is great to use a couple times a week to get clean skin.",

I recommend doing this at night and sleeping in the serum so your skin can absorb all the benefits. :) my skin feels smoother and dark spots are lighter by morning.",
