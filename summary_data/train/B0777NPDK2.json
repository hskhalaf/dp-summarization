      "text": "I really liked these headphones, I have small ears and the ear buds sizes provided, included a small size that fit my ears perfectly, (which was not the case when I bought Sony ones where I had to order a seperate pack of earbud tips to get correct size for my ears). As well as these earphones fitting perfectly, they were very comfortable and sounded great. The problem came when I moved around with them, the sound would break up. I think it was something to do with the mmcx cable provided (not the earbuds themselves) Ultimately I decided to return them, if these were \u00a330 headphones I would have put up with it, but not at \u00a3109.",

I had invested in custom molded earpieces from Pilot Stuff for my E-500s. Using an Exacto knife, I enlarged the holes so I could insert the Aurvanas. Man, am I glad I did! With the custom molded earpiece, the Aurvanas catapulted to the best sounding listening device I have ever known, and that includes the E-500s and top of the line Sony over the ears that I purchased 20 years ago for an absolutely ridiculous price. My quest for over the top audiophile sound has finally ended!",
