I wore them all day and evening and they were very comfortable, no sore feet at the end of the night. I usually buy all my shoes with good arch support, these do not have any but I had no problems at all. I would definitely buy these again.",

I really wanted to love these boots but I'm disappointed.",

However, the bottom of the shoe is as flat as a pancake, so especially for those of us with high arches, the arch support is lacking. However, this can be fixed with arch support inserts, though it would be nice not to have to worry about that. The button closures are adorable and secure. Highly recommend!",
