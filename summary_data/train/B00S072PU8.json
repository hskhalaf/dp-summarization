Unfortunately, the English that's presented in this book is the everyday English that we native speakers speak to our friends. There is just to much slang, dropping of letters, and other shortcuts that are unsuitable for the beginning ESL student. I will have to look for another book, which is too bad as I had high hopes for this one. Take care.",

It is a really good book and useful for non-native speakers, it can help us speak and understand what the native speakers say. Thanks a lot",
