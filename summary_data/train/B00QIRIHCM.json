But I simply cannot run more than a mile in these without getting severe heel blisters. I have tried several times now with different socks, heel lock lacing, lacing tight and loose etc and each time I end up limping home in pain. I am a fairly experienced runner and have never had this problem before with any shoe. \u00a340 down the drain as I have no choice but to bin these/give them away.",
