      "text": "Im a water fitness instructor and I go to conference with AEA and we try all kind of equipment to use in the water. I have the opportunity to try the cuff and they work great. I have clients that they can use it as a water belt; put it on the arms, ankles, just depend what kind of exercises you wanna work with. The good thing is you can open the cuff and take away one of the foams to make it little bit less buoyant. Material quality is good.",

      "text": "In the water, Aqua cuffs are great tool to facilitate stretching, and flexibility. I have had two knee replacements and these help me keep a good bend at knees, as well as, overall muscle stretching and strengthening. They are also wonderful for resistance when water walking... but pay attention, and keep your legs under you when you get over your head otherwise they will flip you up like a buoy. I won't be living without these for the years to come as they help me walk and feel great.",
