      "text": "Bought this sugar dispenser for my mom. It is really cute but (as many other reviewers have noted) the sugar granules gets trapped in the sides of the spout, making it very hard to open and close it- impossible for arthritic hands. The dispenser Itself is quite small so it needs to be refilled often. If you are looking for a glass dispenser then look elsewhere. My mom threw it out after a couple of months. I think this is a case where I should have stuck with the good old-fashioned $4 dispenser. Another reviewer commented that this would be better suited for a product like sugar in the raw and I think that was a fantastic idea.",

It's very easy for sugar to get caught between the pourer and the wall of the lid, so it gets stuck closed or becomes a little hard to open/close. That's a tad annoying but it isn't inoperable, just requires some wiggling sometimes. I'm satisfied with it!!",

It's just a regular screw top - there's no rubber gasket to keep moisture out. In addition, sugar gets caught in the spout so it does not close 100%. Without good seals on the openings it's just another sugar dispenser - nothing special. Would not recommend unless you live in a very low humidity area.",

      "text": "Added this glass creamer after I had to replace my OXO sugar dispenser. The plastic sugar creamer jumped out of my hand, hitting the floor, and the bottom blew out. I was very happy with the OXO glass sugar dispenser that I added this creamer. The only thing I would change about it is for it to hold a full pint of half and half. It\u2019s a minor inconvenience at this point. Beyond that, I love it!",

The way it is it looks nice, but something seems missing when you pick it up, and it's a lot lighter than you would have expected, for it looks like glass, but is not. One might say that not having any mechanism for measuring standard quantity each time is a drawback; perhaps, but (a) if you read the reviews on such sugar dispensers you'll notice complaints about these same mechanisms malfunctioning, and (b) most people still use a teaspoon to stir the sugar after having added it to a beverage, so you could pour sugar directly into the teaspoon for measurement.",
