This two tone horn is as loud if not louder than the ambulace it mimics. The last star is left off due to Cheap chrome Solenoid with British Pipe thread. Yes it will reverse thread but before you jam a npt into it, tap with 1/8\" fine thread so you dont have to do 3 adapters to get to push in style. I have a Viar 2 gal combo at 150psi with push in connectors, 1/4\" dot line. Video outside gopro underpass",

Since they are on a 4wd truck which hammers across gravel roads, I added a strap to support the front end of the horn. They are powered with a 120psi onboard compressor with 3 gallon tank used for air bags. I left the OEM horns in place and connected since that are inside the front passenger fender and they sound together. Sounds great! The first 'victim' was a compact car who thought he would squeeze from the right lane, in front of me on a merge. NOT! He got a nasty surprise.",

The other wire just run to a momentary push-button switch, then to 12v source and you're in business! Lots of people mention having issues finding a mounting location.

Big punch of a screaming oir horn power just by touching the steering wheel cover.

An extra step but it keeps it from overheating so it works.",

      "text": "These were easy to install. I already had an air suspension system with an air tank. Most air horns are either just \"loud car\" or sound like a locomotive. These split the difference with an 18-wheeler type of sound. I disconnected the factory horns and spliced in the solenoid for the air horns, ran an air line and was done. Installation took way less than an hour. The horns are long, so the hardest part was just deciding where to mount them. I have mine behind the lower grill on an aftermarket \"RanchHand\" bumper/grille guard.",

I have a 5 gallon tank, filled from an onboard service compressor which is powered by a PTO driven generator so I cannot refill the tank on the fly. Truck has to be stopped to use the generator. I figure I have 30+ seconds of loud horn. I have backup electrical horns which switch on when the tank runs below 60 PSI.",
