      "text": "This backpack is perfect for picnics off the beaten path. There are four convenient compartments. The largest insulated compartment (bottom) is not quite tall enough to hold wine bottles vertically but they fit sideways or in the drink pockets on the outside. The top compartment has a zippered mesh pocket on the inside and a hidden pocket that can be accessed from the top near the handle. The larger front compartment has three inner pockets that I store utensils and a small cutting board in. The outer front pocket holds flat items like napkins. The straps are padded and adjustable with a bottle opener on one and a stretchy zippered pocket on the other (big enough for iPhone).",

The insulation is also much better than my old cooler bag and I love all the extra pockets!!",

BTW, the food is still warm after going through the long journey at freezing temperature for about 1 hours. Highly recommend!",

I added a container to the bottom insulated section, not sure what the dimensions are, but it fits in perfectly and it creates a lot of rigidity. Not needed- but adds to the perfection. Highly recommend off of first impressions.",

The compartment on top is very useful for dry goods while the main compartment below helps to keep it cool with my ice packs and drinks/cooler. The only drawback for me is the liner, once the ice packs start to thaw out the condensation/moisture tends to seep through to the bottom of the pack making it wet.",

I love that there are extra compartments for dry items.. phones, wallets, keys, plates, napkins. No issues with leaking and the bag survived Hawaii :) hikes, beaches, and all the fun stuff.",

My only drawbacks are I wish it had a drain at the bottom or side of the bag where the cooler part is instead of having to turn the entire book bag upside down to drain. And it would be nice if the outside bottom was made out of a different/smoother material than the rest of the bag. I set it in sand and it got sand in every little crevice, I imagine it will do the same with dirt, dust, and everything else.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve had this backpack for around 7 months and it\u2019s been fine up until now. The zipper broke off today so now I have to be careful with the other zippers so they don\u2019t break as well, they seem like they will break easily. Also, if you have an ice pack or ice in here, it won\u2019t leak, but the bottom will get super wet and will get whatever the backpack is sitting on wet.",

If flipped it will leak out of the zipper, which was expected but found out by accident. There is plenty of space to store other items not in ice. I have stored some water and other beverages with a few ice packs in this on a very warm day,90-100*f, and they remained cool all day.",
