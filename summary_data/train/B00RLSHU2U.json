I live in Montana and work outside at times during the winter. My feet were warm and completely dry; thru snow all day. They arrived on time and have exceeded my expectations. I have received many compliments on them, and have noticed many others looking. They just might be the first ones in Gallatin County. I highly recommend these boots.",

The fluff trim looks cute but I worry it will just be an extra way to store water in wet conditions. If you wear shorter socks it feels like the side zipper may rub. They are extraordinarily comfortable (like the targhee) and attractive. When I say fits as expected I mean it fits as you would expect your keen to fit... so order a size up!",

Also, the biggest issue is there is NO CUSHION inner sole, and since the boot isn't too large no room for a nice gel cushion inner sole, it's not easy to wear a long time. Boot is stiff around the ankle, the leather is strong so the boot doesn't flex too easily. It's it WARM and keeps feet dry, but not as comfortable as it could be for the $$$ price.",

These boots have been great for simply trekking around & running errands, walking my dogs, etc. I'll be testing them out in Iceland in March for hiking, too. They're warm, waterproof, and comfortable. Two tips: 1) Plan to wear high socks. The stitching toward the top of the boot sticks out a bit where the boot laces, and it rubs a bit on my lower calf. 2) I normally wear an 8-8.5 M in women's shoes. 9 M works perfectly with these boots because I like to wear thick wool socks.

The sole is grippy like many of Keen hiking and utility shoes. Lastly this boot is a bit slender and fitted at the ankle with fur on top which makes for a more curvy sleek style.

      "text": "So comfortable to wear from casual walks with the dog to hiking on challenging terrain, they are warm, waterproof, and easy to get on & off with the side zipper. The laces can be used to tighten the ankle support once the boots are on. I love KEEN shoes & boots and I love these. I purchased & returned several boots, including the KEEN Durand Polar boot, until I found these.",
