This is my first all-in-one and I love the fact that I can move it from room to room easily. I also like that it is white--HP really does have a wide variety of colors and choices. I like their customer service as well. I rated this deal 4 stars because I had to do a TON of updates that took hours to complete and even went into the following day. OVERALL A GOOD DEAL. I recommend buying a refurbished computer on Amazon.",

Now, for the other news....because I went from Windows 7 to Windows 10 there were all kinds of issues that I did not have the experience to remedy. I strongly recommend the purchase of the HP Smart Friend Service. It's $15.00/month and worth every penny of it. Having a problem with the 'puter? Just call them and they go into your machine and fix it. They are very good at what they do and there is no issue too big or too small. Sincerely, Robert",

      "text": "Have had computer 3 weeks & had to call HP because a cd I put into the optical drive did not hold & fell into the computer. The HP representative told us how to get the back off to retrieve cd. Machine is the slowest computer I have ever owned & for me, I do not like windows 10 at all. Much prefer windows 7 or vista.",

It comes with a keyboard and mouse. It doesn't really say in the description. It's likely just assumed because of the picture.",

Yep it's really pretty which is great because you will be spending lots of time looking at it while you wait for something, anything at all to happen (see photo). Just logging in can take up to five minutes. The biggest waste of money I have ever spent. Don't waste yours too.",
