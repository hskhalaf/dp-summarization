Light up noise, cute songs, parts move when you pull the string, 2 sound settings and of course an off button! Numbers 1-3 on the spots with colors. Not only a great educational toy for your fast learning babies but inexpensive! Worth every penny. Owning now for almost 2 months with 2 babies that are not so gentle with toys and we have no issues with this toy. Batteries have and still holding up (we leave it on, never turn it off) no malfunctions. Recommended!",

The ONLY thing that I didn't like was the string. the string was too thin and too short and the toy producer does not even make it easy for you to fix it by replacing the string. Since my niece just started walking, gripping is also a new task and the thin string is hard for her to manage. Also, she has to hold the very very end of the string so that's also very annoying.",

The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they really need to make the string longer. I saw someone post that same comment before I purchases and after seeing her with the toy, the string is not nearly long enough. Because its so short, she ends up dragging it on its side rather than on the wheels, which isn't great but thats my only quarrel about the product. Otherwise great toy for the price!",

I would have rated 5/5 but the pull string seems to be a safety hazard. She tried to put the string in her mouth so we tied a large object to the end so she would not swallow the string.",

      "text": "Love the toy itself, but the string is only about 1 foot long causing the kids to swing it because the string is too short to pull it. Seems like it should be long enough to pull behind a child. Currently my grands are 2 1/2 & 1 1/2 and it isnt long enough for either kiddo to pull. I realize the company is worried about it wrapping around a kids neck, but maybe just not add a string then. We ended up having to cut it off because they were accidentally swinging it around.",
