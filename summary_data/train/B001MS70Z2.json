You can't just adjust in from minute to minute because there are 4 screws that are not easy to get to in order to make the thing raise and lower. I'm pretty mad about this and would maybe like to send it back but I have no idea how that would work.",

Because of this, I'm getting a tenkeyless keyboard, which I kinda wanted anyways... but damnit, I wanted the option!",

I'm giving this item 3 stars because the colors do NOT match the picture. I ordered the \"Cherry\" option, and the picture shows a cherry wood desk with gray/steel sides. What arrived was black siding. If you look at the photo of the \"Medium Oak\" option, that is the siding you are getting. This is a bit disappointing because I really wasn't planning on doing black for my office. But it is just too heavy and too much of a hassle to send it back, so I'm making it work.",
