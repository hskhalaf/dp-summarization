This machine has different color combinations and it has an option to move around the room. I would definitely buy this product for a birthday gift or baby shower gift. The only thing that doesn't work sometimes is the off button, but then I just unplug it, so I wouldn'treally say it's a downside because easily fixed.",

In addition both the green and white lights have stopped working. Given that we bought this in July, we had expected it to work a bit longer. I guess you get what you pay for. Additional update: company offered full refund or new product which I found generous given the product was not new. So I have increased my star rating.",

That seemed quite time consuming for a phase that might not last. He likes the light, and the phase is not as fleeting as I thought. As he gets a little older and the more he's into the space and science, he may become dissatisfied because the constellations are not accurate. Not an issue yet, and I'm happy with the purchase.",
