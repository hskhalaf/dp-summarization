I read other people's reviews about being concerned with damaging the CD player, maybe they secured it too much? You have to screw the adjuster just enough so it fits snug, if you leave it too loose then it will wobble around and if you make it too tight then you can obviously damage the CD drive. It was pretty simple and it looks great! I would recommend this to anyone.",

      "text": "I really like this. I'm not a fan of vent-mount phone holders, because the vents can easily break with the weight of a phone and they also block the vents. You fasten this to your CD player slot and provided that you don't use your CD player (who does, with smartphones/bluetooth/streaming/etc.?), then you have a permanent mount which evenly distributes the weight of the holder and your smartphone over a larger area. I used to use a mount with a flexible gooseneck shaft and a suction cup attached to the windshield, but this holder is a much simpler and smaller implementation which I don't mind leaving attached.",

The little feet at the bottom give it more stability, but allow for a charging cord without any issues. The arms hold snugly, and release slowly so it doesn't just fall out when you are removing it. The ball joint means I can swivel it to any location, to me or to the passenger if he wants to look where the GPS is sending us. It also means that facial recognition works for it. It's secure in the CD holder, and has an adjustment to tighten it up so it's not going to come out. Very happy with it!",

Perfect fit in our 2017 Subaru Outback. Was skeptical that it would work with our large screen in our Outback and using our backup camera everyday BUT this holder is designed to pivot on a ball and can easily push out of the way. Fit snug into the CD player, no issues so far!",

I can't even begin to express how handy this thing is, espcially for navigation while driving. I don't have to look down anymore to find out where I'm supposed to turn, because it's right on level with my dashboard. Very pleased overall! Does block my stereo system a bit, but that's of little consequence and a small sacrifice for the convenience of having my phone in front of me. I never want to live without this again!",

Why is there no way to hold your phone to the dash in a stable way without ruining the dash? This is the first mount that is pretty close to flawless. It\u2019s not going anywhere & the phone isn\u2019t going anywhere. Started with 1 in sports car & ordered a second one for my truck. Works really well & worth 2x the price for sure.",

If you don't listen to CDs in the car, then this is the way to go. It is the perfect spot for it, doesn't take any space from your cup holders. It can be adjusted to any position that you are comfortable with. It fits all phone sizes, you put the phone in, secure it in place and then there is a button to release it when you are done. I bought a second one for another relative as well.",

It just needs a little tightening, and it is going to bounce around some on really bumpy or rough. It is minimal movement, I can still see the screen clearly with no issues. I highly recommend this CD style holder for your phone, it is well made and great quality.",

When you assemble the thing the instructions are odd on where to put the foam tape (which helps the mount grip when tightened, but you don't actually put tape anywhere on your vehicle). It is easy to assemble and disassemble. It holds an iPhone without problem. I use it mostly on longer trips when I'm using Waze. The only real downside is the fact it blocks the radio screen. So if you change channels, you can't really see what's selected. If you're like me and rarely change stations, you should be fine.",
