She slides that thing all over the house, also the lack of weight could be a safety issue if you don\u2019t pay attention and the kids put more weight on the back rest since it could flip... I believe the manufacturer could put heavier \u201clegs\u201d and if the concern is the price increase in shipping then I do recommend sand fillable legs ... I don\u2019t know, just my 2-cents",

If it was made better, and the cushion was fixed onto wooden supports, this chair just might be perfect. As is, I wish I had paid a bit more for something higher quality.",

Now his baby sister loves to sit on it and we may have to purchase another one. We also have a small dog who likes to curl up in this chair at night after we all go to bed, I just wish they sold slip covers for it as things tend to be dropped down the sides and not recoverable.",
