I hooked them up to my TV and everything sounds full and clear. I do professional sound and projection for a living. I own pro Bose, EV, Mackie, Peavey, Shure gear. In my living room, Audio Engine made the Rock Hall of Fame Induction show ring true. These are in a different class than my old Logitec 2.1 System with the big sub and separate tweeters. It was always missing the rich integrated mids. These AEs hookup easily and look great. I\u2019m not sure why I was living with bad sound at home.",

      "text": "If you're looking for new speakers, buy these. I don't regret forking over the 400 bucks. They're articulate, musical, and have a surprisingly nice low end for speakers this size. They won't make your living room rattle, but there's definitely a clarity and oomph to bass lines that you wouldn't expect from relatively small speakers. The thing I can't quite put my finger on is how smooth these speakers sound. I wish I had a better way to describe it. There's just something pleasing about them no matter what is being played. Like bits of music that might otherwise sound harsh just come through like butter. Plus, the bamboo looks killer apart from the great sound!",

(OR plug in my laptop to play lossless audio files, you can actually tell the difference between file quality on these!) SO do I recommend you buy these? Hell no. Go buy a cheaper pair and spend your money on something more important... but if they magically arrive on your doorstep, you should definitely keep them.",

I bought this as an early BD present for myself. listening to my favorite music from Corrine Bailey Rae -Trouble Sleeping , Emma Louise - Stainache, Zoe Johnston - Alchemy, In Search of Sunrise Dubai - Richard Durand, w/ Lange, Bon Iver (Blindsided , For Emma) , Shakey Graves (Alejandro Rose Garcia) -(Only Son, House of Winston) , and finally Porter - Athemahawke -bailando con..,Cuervos, etc.) . Great Speakers, really did an outstanding job reproducing the acoustic-electric- mix of highs and lows in Shakey Graves and Porter's music. Emma Louise's vocals were nice and separated from the synth pop - acoustic music.",

These are nowhere near audiophile quality (sorry, AudioEngine, but that's pure marketing hype, i.e. a lie), but where else can you get a decent sounding preamp, amp, and a pair speakers for $400? I'm tickled with these, and perhaps even more so with the A2's.",

Even at less than half volume these guys are more than loud enough - anywhere near full volume on a bass-heavy track and my room is shaking! Straight out the box they give you fantastic punchy bass and clear, sharp highs. I've only had them a little while but I'm sure the sound will change a little bit once they're burned in too. Can't recommend enough.",
