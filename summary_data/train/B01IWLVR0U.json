We took a chance on this boot, and were pleasantly surprised. The boot is comfortable, warm (he works in temps well below zero), and comes in his size! You can't beat this book for the price. We will definitely be repeat customers. Thank you for making such a great product at an equally great price!",

Well insulated to keep your feet warm even without socks. I had the pleasure to take a vacation in South Lake Tahoe and I never slipped or fell. No leaks. Water never got inside the shoe. Most snow boots do not look good. This one looks great and I enjoyed wearing it out in the snow and the Granlibakken Tahoe site. This is a great alternative to brands like Columbia. I highly recommend these. It looks and feels more than it is priced.",

For the number of times I wear these in a year I cannot justify spending that much so these fit the bill. The padding in the boot seemed comfortable. I would have preferred a removable lining but for the number of times I wear them, and in a $60 boot, this was acceptable.",

However, this is my second pair because the previous pair I bought was 8 (M) US and was definitely too small even though normally I wear 7.5 (M) US. Got 8.5 instead and it fits well, so you might want to get 2 sizes larger if you ever want to buy one. If you are wearing fleece socks however, get at least 3 sizes larger. Tried wearing this with fleece socks and I wish I had gotten the 9 (M) US instead. Was dying on the plane wearing these with fleece socks.
