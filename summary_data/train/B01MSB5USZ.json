I feel this should just have the high low speed of the other model as the spinning dial does take longer to get use to. I love the metal front. Just not the way the motor runs. No leaks like my other model had. A good unit. Just wish they would have stuck with simple on the power of the motor. If I had to do over, I would have got the cheaper none commercial one do to the simplicity of its usage.",

I have found that it takes several applications to smoke meat adequately, but smoking cheeses and other things works very well with only one application. Obviously it is not going to provide the continuous smoke flavor that you get with a big green egg or other grill, but it works for the purpose for which it is intended therefore I gave it five stars.",

    "title": "PolyScience Breville Gun Pro Smoke Infuser, Commercial, 0.5 Oz, Black",
    "description": "Size:0.5 OzThe Breville | PolyScience Smoking Gun Pro hand-held food smoker is ideal for quickly cold smoking meat, fish, vegetables, desserts, beverages and classic cocktails in just a few minutes. Smaller and more versatile than an outdoor hot smoker, it's the perfect alternative for adding big, smoky flavor and aroma with very little effort. No soaking of wood chips or cooking food for hours for that smoky flavor. Cold smoking gently infuses a measured amount of natural wood smoke to enhance flavors without cooking or preserving foods, or changing textures or temperatures. With enhanced performance and greater longevity, the Smoking Gun Pro's 1-inch 18/8 stainless steel burn chamber loads easily and holds more smoking material than the previous model. The easy-turn dial allows total control over airflow and smoke intensity. No electricity required. It's battery-operated for portable, versatile use anywhere, both indoors or outside. Compact and lightweight with integrated stand for comfortable, single-handed operation. The 17.5-inch silicone nozzle extender hose places smoke with precision. The device works with a variety of wood smoking chips, teas and spices, hay, dried flowers, and herbs. Approved for commercial use, the cold smoker is perfect for professional and home chefs, as well as mixologists. Smoke salmon after plating, serve smoked cheese or butters, cherry tomatoes for salads, sauces, chocolate, meringues and fruit in a flash. Elevate bartender classics to modern interpretations such as smoky Negronis, Old-Fashioneds. Simply fill the burn chamber, light the combustibles, and apply the smoke to the food or beverage. Includes replacement smoke screens, wood chip sample pack (1/2-ounce each apple and Hickory flavors), 4-AA batteries, complete instructions, and 1-year manufacturer's warranty. Compact for easy storage and transport anywhere. Disassembles easily without tools. Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Detachable burn chamber and smoking barrel are dishwasher safe for easy cleanup.",
