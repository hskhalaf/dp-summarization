I don\u2019t understand people that spend $12 and expect the durability of a $50 set. You get what you pay for, and this will work FINE for a few light repairs. No heavy prying and stuff like that.",

The quality of the metal is so cheap that it cannot withstand any sort of repair and will ruin any attempted repair. Do not buy any of this companies products, they are untrustworthy.",
