Tgey are very roomy in the toe box which is good if you have wider feet, they are also very flexible & comfortable. Buy with confidence and always remember to buy a half size bigger than you normally wear. Just to add they look stylish too.",

Very comfortable boots; I have had to use an orthotic insole with other boots but so far haven't needed to do so with these. Also brilliant turn-around service on the relacement pair from Amazon - handed over the original order to the courier on Saturday, the repacements were delivered on Monday!",
