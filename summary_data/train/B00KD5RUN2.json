Also a plus that it comes with free airplane wifi passes, 2 months of Google Music and free Google Drive storage. Personally, I really like my other Chromebook (the HP Chromebook 14) with built in LTE since I can use it from anywhere, but this has a better screen and is more portable (ironically, since it does have LTE). Of course it's a Chromebook, so it books fast and is great for certain tasks but lacks Skype and full office, though the web version of Office is getting better for basic edits.",

To me it looks, Bay Trail is slightly faster than 2955U, for tasks like loading a javascript intensive web page, viewing youtube video etc. The build quality of this chromebook is much better than the Acer. Wonderful keyboard and tracking pad, good smooth display for watching videos. Also, Acer C720 had some reliability issues like trackpad won't work while charging. Decided to keep the Asus and returning the Acer C720.",

With Google Docs it's handy for homework or office tasks. That said, for more involved tasks this machine is severely under-powered. Open too many tabs and some will crash due to memory exhaustion. Complicated web pages will get it bogged down. It has a built-in SD card reader, but don't even think of using it to view photos from your camera.",

For the price, you get a very functional device that can play videos from our class's lecture software with no problem. Pathoma also works with no issues. Its long battery life, and good keyboard makes this a good laptop for a student. I recommend pairing with a samsung note tablet to take notes.

I love the look and feel of this laptop it's battery life is great, I can usually go about 2-3 days on a single charge. I haven't experienced any issues with lag or stuttering. I think as long as you use this machine as it was intended to be used (as a secondary device and not a desktop replacement) I think anyone will just as happy as I am. Well done ASUS!!!",

If planned usage is simply email, shopping, and IM, it's decent value for an under $200 laptop.
