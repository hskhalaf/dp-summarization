I had to go through extra steps to process the return, but their chat option for customer service was helpful and the rep helped me process the return quickly. My rating for the bowl remains; my rating for Amazon's customer service is 5 stars. The bowl arrived broken and is unreturnable. There was a chunk of the top missing and when I turned it over the whole top lip fell off. The bigger issue is I tried to return it but returns were NOT accepted. Do not buy. The money is wasted with a bowl I can't use.",

I\u2019m not able to use it where I originally intended, but it\u2019s too pretty to return. The seller had the exact measurements so that\u2019s totally my error. This would also make a wonderful gift for anyone that likes wood items.",
