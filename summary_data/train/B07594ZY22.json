This gadget just fits down in to the neck of the bottle and you just pour the wine into the glass. You can hear the aeration happening as you pour. They are very easy to clean just by running them under warm water and setting them to dry. They don't have to be taken apart and reassembled to clean. Super convenient. We have not experienced any leaks or when using these. They seal very securely in all the wines bottles we have used them in. They work very well and are highly recommended.",

    "title": "AeraWine Infusion Premium Wine Aerator/Pourer, 1-PACK, 100% Made in the USA",
    "description": "Package Quantity:1Using The Variable Aerating Feature\n\n\u2022 The Aerawine Infusion aerator is unique in many ways. One of the features that makes it more versatile and a \"one of a kind\" is you can vary the amount of aeration by simply changing the tilt of the bottle. As you red wine lovers know, not all reds need the same level of aerating. Now if you're a bit uncertain about how to determine how much aeration is right for your favorite reds, don't worry, just use the Aerawine Infusion aerator like you would any regular pourer and it will provide satisfying results you will enjoy immediately. If you have a more sensitive palate you can take that bold, full bodied red that needs to breathe a bit before you drink it, and tilt the bottle up for maximum aeration and you will immediately enjoy the results. For the lighter reds, such as a Pinot Noir, less tilt will provide just the right amount of aeration. The great thing is you can decide for yourself. A custom pour every time. \n\nAerating Your Wine\n\n\u2022 Now you're probably wondering how and why a little oxygen will make your wine taste better. It's important that wines are allowed to \"breathe\". By allowing the contents of the wine bottle to \"breathe\" you are actually ensuring a smoother taste. \n\n\u2022 The AeraWine Infusion Aerator achieves this by infusing air into your favorite wine as it is poured from the bottle allowing its flavors to develop properly. \n\n\u2022 Aerating allows the wine to mix with oxygen and come alive. Wine \"wakes up\" outside its original vessel. Using the Aerawine Infusion Aerator is as simple as pouring your favorite wine or spirit from the bottle into your glass. No waiting for enhanced taste and NO MESS",
