I wish I could review other aspects of this tv but I was too frustrated to move further along in the set up process. The box was slightly banged up, but on the opposite side that the screen was showing damage. So... not happy with this purchase right now.",

Did try a mouse to scroll up and down on internet. Didn't work, but keyboard space key worked. I love JGLM TV. Some menus have multiple messages in them. Couldn't scroll down, with remote, it doesn't allow dragging. Great set, great price.",

Fire tv is a fluke, its program is fine if you like commercials. rokue has it beat time over time.The only enjoyment you can get outof this tv is watching prime,you be watching a show and the commercial will break in a middle of a sentance,you think you are watching a movie and you will be watching a commercial and not even know it. If there was anything lower then (0) I would rate it at that. An the same old commericals over and over and over, what a disrespect to the buyer,a piece of garbage I threw it in the trash can,let some other fool use it.",

It won't even recognize or see our neighbors wifi. We have to restart through settings EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Then it'll find ours (and surrounding neighbors wifi) and I have to re-enter the password, again every single time. I have a message into Best buy to see if they'll send a tech or let us bring it in to fix the tv. So I'll update later of there's any progress. This tv is for our child's playroom so ease of use is necessary. So far it's pretty annoying.",

This was especially true when the scene being rendered included significant motion. The resulting pixelation was severe and unusable. Operation with an external decoder into an HDMI port was good, but the unit is marketed as a \"Fire TV\" and so it failed to accomplish its primary mission.",
