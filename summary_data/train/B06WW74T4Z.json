Everyday I'd run my sneakers against the nap to gather hair in between major vacuuming, bend over and pick up the hair a debris and walk it to the garbage. Now I can vacuum it up per sections that I know this dog hangs about the most. I also am able to vacuum my dryer vent, and the door rug that the dogs and toddlers are in and out of all day.",

The regular vac I have just takes too much time to set up with a constantly shedding puppy. This Bissell is a god send, I'm able to manage the large amounts of fur being shed without having to constantly set up a vac. It's super easy to use and extremely straightforward.",

I don't care that it doesn't have a wall mount charger because I store it in a small inexpensive zippered tool bag which also carries the attachments and charger.
