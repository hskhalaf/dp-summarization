The 5Ghz constantly drops out, so I ran everything on the 2.4, but then it randomly decided to slow down. Each firmware update made both problem worse, and now it has been over 18 months since they bothered to update it, so the current firmware is apparently their best effort. I scripted another machine to just trigger a weekly reboot, and that was the closest to stable operation I ever got with it, but that was on the previous firmware. As a long time Linksys guy, I will never buy another product from them.",

The wireless connection is unstable and does not get good speed. I tried to tweak the settings on this thing but I had no luck with it. I get around 80-90mbps with direct connection with an ethernet cord but 3-19mbps on wifi. This is unacceptable. I've tried to get close to the router and the distance didn't change the unpredictability of the wifi speeds. I've also tested my modem so I know for a fact it's not the modems issue. So if you're looking for good wifi speeds with this, be warned..",

I have one complaint - the design is not very good. cat 5e and 6 cables hang several inches out of the back and the only way to mount this device is flat on a table top which diminishes the coverage directly below the device especially on something metal like a file cabinet or even a heavy wooden desk. Not sure why this style is designed only to be placed on a flat surface. I would like to wall mount and have some basic cable management, but this must not be considered for a \"consumer\" product. Miss the external antennas and wall or ceiling mounts.",

No problems whatsoever with this one. The guest wi-fi option is awesome as well.

Unfortunately, most routers pick the same channel when you use their auto setup feature. If your new router drops signals unexpectedly and you have many Wi-Fi signals in your area, change the channel through the router - this should help you to maintain connectivity.",

The advantage of this router is the 2.4ghz and 5ghz dual band setup and the guest account function. I can let my visitors to use the guest account instead of giving them my secret password. It is very stable and giving constant signal when streaming online video with either 2.4ghz or 5ghz band. A wider coverage function is important to me so I deducted one star.",

For the price, I am finding this to be an excellent wireless, dual-band router. It was very easy to setup (with the software) and yet you are still able to change more detailed settings. The speed seems to be quite good on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.

Shortcomings: 1) If you plan to use it for wireless backups through its USB port,it works but it is SLOW, and I mean slow. 2) Does not have DNLA support (E4200 does or E3200 with dd-wrt) 3) If you plan to use dd-wrt, the Wi-Fi driver does not support the 5GHz band, so you will only be able to use the 2.4GHz band",

Right now, I'm about 30 feet away with only 1 wall, using N-mode, and my cell phone still only gets about -70dBm (about half of the bars shown for wifi on my android phone). My Thinkpad shows full signal. Both are on my desk. Obviously a cell phone will have a worse antenna than a laptop, but I still expected a bit better signal. Otherwise, I like the router, although I wish it had feet for vertical placement too.",

      "text": "I've only had the router connected for about a week, so I'm still not convinced about how great this router really is. The first days it was hooked up it seemed to be about 3 to 5x faster than my old router, but ever since then it seems to be maybe 2x as fast as the old one. So, if performance continues at it's current level I'd have to downgrade my rating, but if it improves then I'd give it 5 stars.",
