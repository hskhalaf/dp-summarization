One thing to note - the particles (for exfoliation) are somewhat large. It is not a fine scrub, more of a sugar scrub with those plastic beads in it (which are terrible for the environment, if that is something you are trying to avoid!) I would buy the face cleanser from this same line and use that every day (exactly what I did), and use this scrub a few days per week. I do not recommend that this be used every day, especially for acne prone skin.",

Special tip: Adding brown sugar to whatever facewash you already use once or twice a week with a light touch is the best exfoliator you can get. It is gentle, no bad beads for the environment, and can be used with any face product you use. I use the plain neutrogena face wash with brown sugar and its amazing.",

Both my husband and I use this product--in fact, we had it on auto-order (until too many began piling up!). Be aware that this is not a particular moisturizing product, but I don't think that is really what it is aiming at anyway. The scrubby beads feel nice and eliminate the need to use a wash cloth to wash my face.",

I use it in tandem with the Pink Grapefruit Scrub, and overall I can say I am very happy with the appearance of my skin; it's clear and I am definitely less oily than I was before I started using it. The only thing I am not too crazy about is the scent; while it's nice, it's a bit too strong at times. But I guess if the smell doesn't appeal to you, just opt for the non-scented Oil-Free Acne Wash.",

So, I decided to leave the face bar soap alone and go liquid. Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Facial Cleanser was my first choice, and I'm glad I chose it. From my first wash, I could really feel a difference. I could tell that it was working. I use it twice a day--morning and night. I would recommend this to anyone.",

After I use it my face always feels super clean and refreshed, even slightly exfoliated due to the small microbeads. It has definitely cleared up my acne a little bit. This is by no means a prescription medication. My acne has not magically gone away. However, when I use this regularly it is definitely significantly reduced. The smell is also pleasing, due to the citrus scent, which smells really clean and nice. I would recommend this to anyone, particularly people who have sensitive skin, for a once or twice daily facial wash.",
