There is definitely no comparison between the bags found at a gym (which I would not expect), but for the cost, ease of having a bag in my home and not having to drive to the gym, I can deal with it. The reason for 4/5 stars is the pain it took to fill the base. It\u2019s a very small hole. I used a funnel and very fine white play sand, that made things 100x easier.",

I've boxed for several years and wanted something other than the wall mounted heavy bags due to my space constraints. This unit was way to easy to knock over, and the plastic center cylinder which holds this in place just is too wobbly. For a young person learning, or someone looking to tap on it, great. However even using a light more high speed scenario sequence, it just doesn't hold a hit well. I have ordered the Wavemaster XXL, and upon the first workout was overly impressed and will be keeping that one instead.",
