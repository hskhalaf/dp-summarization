Maybe this disk was designed for larger kitty food than we feed our cat, but changing our cat food is not an option. Others reviewers have pointed out that eventually, your kitty will figure out how to get the food out of the bowl. However, even after navigating the side lip, the bowl has a channel around the perimeter that once again traps the food. All in all, this design is more trouble than it is worth. I do not recommend this product, and suggest you look for something else.",

Plus it solved the filling it too full problem I had. I am really impressed with this product. It is perfect for cats who need to slow down their eating.",

Needless to say since getting this feeder she has stopped throwing up. Highly recommend it!

She would clean her bowl and then eat the other cats' food. She was really food centered. Since purchasing this, she will eat, and then she will actually walk away with food still remaining in the bowl!!!! She also doesn't nag me for food all day anymore. I love watching them eat out of it. I would recommend getting another one if you have more than 2 cats.",

So in the end my dog ends up licking the kitty food out before my kitty does. And also, this probably would not work as well with declawed kitties. Watching my cats eat out of it, they seemed to use their claws mostly for helping in getting out the food.",

We've saved so much money on cat food, and my fat cat is starting to look a little healthier and more active. I highly recommend this for anyone with a needy cat, a fat lazy cat, or dogs that keep eating the cat food. :)",
