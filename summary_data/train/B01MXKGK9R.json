Although the camera quality isn't crystal clear, it gets the job done for what I am looking for in a cellphone camera. I would definitely recommend this to others looking for a great phone at an affordable price.",

I really like how convenient it is to come with a soft phone case too. And if I don't use the second SIM, I can just put an external SD card to increase my storage. The phone is really useful and would recommend this to my friends and families!",

I have enjoyed watching videos on the crisp display. The fingerprint scanner is a new feature to me and I don't know what I did before it! Makes the experience even better. Finally the speaker has been strong and enables me to listen and enjoy my music. I highly recommend the Conjr to anyone looking for a phone with fantastic features at a great price.",

I knew I had to have this phone. I went in blind to the Coolpad Conjr. I have been using the phone over a month now, and I have to say I absolutely love the phone. Every day I learn something new about the phone and it surprises me. Worth the price for a sleek Smartphone with Fingerprint and selfie camera that deserves my full five stars.",

I find myself scrolling through facebook and then skipping an entire days worth of posts because my palm was touching the corner of the screen. After a months use, the phone started to break. Live wallpapers won't work anymore. You can't type too fast or else the phone won't pick up your input. Despite renaming the device, all Bluetooth devices see \"coolpad conjr\". Battery life is nothing to brag about. The fingerprint unlock feature is nice. And that is all the good things I have to say about this phone.",

In comparison, my daughter got a 120 page guide with her Apple Smart phone. I hoped to find a Coolpad guidebook to download on the internet but no luck.
