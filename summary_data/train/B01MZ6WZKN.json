The colors are dull and ugly, not nearly what they appear to be in the photo included, and I wish that I\u2019d bought different wrapping paper with the money I\u2019d paid to this company. The paper tears easily when you try to fold it and all around feels like cheap craft paper. And on top of it, I tried to contact them and received no response.",

This suits my need perfectly as I am dressing it up with a nice smokey blue bow or purple bow depending on the recipient. Nice paper for non-seasonal wrapping needs. Can be masculine or feminine depending on the accessories. Opaqueness is sufficient to not show the package details underneath.",

It would also be great wrapping year round and any type of accent ribbon color works. Also nice for a man's gift wrap.",
