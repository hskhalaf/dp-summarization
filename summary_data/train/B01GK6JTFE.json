Lift the item to release some of the weight off the blanket. Otherwise, the blanket will tear. In otherwise normal use, I had no problems with them.",

The tape was so tight, I couldn\u2019t get a straight edge into it to cut. They are a little flimsy and must tear easily. One came out of the wrapping with a small tear.
