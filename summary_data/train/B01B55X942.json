They are sturdy and can hold quite a bit of weight, and I really like the hangers on the top instead of the velcro attachment I've seen on other styles. The only thing keeping me from giving these shelves 5 stars is that the shelves are a little too shallow to hold t-shirts without them hanging over the edge, and I wish they had 1 more shelf at the bottom. However, the mesh pockets on the sides are good for holding scarves or other small items, and I'd still recommend these to a friend.",

Hats are stuffed in the side pocket in case it's a cold or hot day according to the weather report. The quality is great.

I didn't want to get bulky furniture pieces for my walk-in closet, so I opted for this alternative. They proved to be a great decision because I had less to transport when I moved recently. They are great for clothes and the pockets on the sides are useful for the small things like socks and gloves.",
