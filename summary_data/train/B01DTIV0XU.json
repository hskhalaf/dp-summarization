Only to find out it\u2019s not functioning when you desperately need it!!! Battery dead after one month in the box. Purchased, never used. Took it out of box to look at it and start carrying it. No way of knowing if battery is charged. This can mean life or death!! No refund apparently since I bought it 45 days ago and they only allow returns before 30 days. Don\u2019t risk your life by depending on this. It\u2019s NOT reliable!!",
