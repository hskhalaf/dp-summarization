Have used Powerstroke 3 and also the Powerstroke 4. IMHO, the Remo Pinstripe Clear is the more appropriate choice for these drums.

The sound is great, that isn't a lie, but it does require a pillow to be put in and shoved tight against the bass head for a good rock-n-roll punchy sound. Without a pillow, it still has a decent sound, but it's open and pretty ringy. Better for a genre like jazz, maybe. I've had mine for 4 months as of today (July 6th, 2012), and it is already starting to split. With the low durability, I will not be buying this head again.",
