It was very easy to unscrew the hardware with a drill and then reposition them in the way I needed them to be, but since the picture shows the board horizontal I was expecting it to be able to hang that way out of the box.",

The wood is this lovely, dark, deep color. It seems to be way more expensive than it actually is. I put string lights around it and got some cute magnets - definitely happy with my purchase and with the delivery",
