This is more than enough and it has to have copper to offset some of the overpowering affects of Zinc. Copper helps with the absorption of zinc as well.",

This form of zinc is much more bio-available (absorbed by the body) than the regular zinc salts. Zinc can help clear up acne by increasing the production of RBP in the liver.
