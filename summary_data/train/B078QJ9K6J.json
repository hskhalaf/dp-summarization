My only complaint is that I can actually ear it and it makes my head hurt if I stay too long close to it. For me, it's not a problem as the patch is far enough for my house that I can hang out in my yard without hearing it, but it prevents me from putting another device in my raised beds, where I also have a lounging area. Maybe it's just me that's sensitive to sounds? No idea!",

      "text": "We tried setting 5 and I extensively tested the motion sensor using a broomstick. Although the frequency is audible to younger people with better hearing and MAY work on squirrels and other critters, it is unlikely due to its limited motion sensing range. I placed the device on the ground and it cannot detect motion even two feet above it. Same story when placing the device at chest high and it cannot detect motion two feet below it. Range is approximately 10 feet straight line distance. However, I really didn't see any improvement for keeping animals from eating fruits in the backyard.",
