He crawls to it and tries to use it to steady himself and stand and has had several spills. We are hiding it until he is able to walk and push it.

I bought Little Tikes 3-in-1 Activity Walker but exchanged it for this one do the the activity center and being removable but it was the wrong decision. I should've stuck with Little Tikes 3-in-1 Activity Walker. It was much sturdier and my twin daughters weren't falling on that walker.",

It\u2019s a must have for me. The bad: Be careful using on slick floors. The wheels have two settings to increase drag, but it will still slide extremely easily depending on the floor surface and your babe might not be able to keep up. Also, the phone does not have a cord so it can be easily lost.",

It plays a variety of songs and jingles, along with cute noises for baby. There are locks on the hind wheels however these are not very strong. The front panel is removable which is great because you can remove the play portion from the wheels on back if you want it to be stationary or on the floor.",

There are various versions of the Sit-to-Stand walker available.

He's just now pulling himself up, using Mommy's knee or a table; this not only allows him to stand, but even take some tentative steps by himself. He had been taking steps, holding Mommy's hands (fingers) or his big sister's, but now he can do it himself and this toy is boosting his confidence and independence. Truly a wonderful gift, making Grammy a hit once again. I highly recommend this wonderful learning toy.",

He isn't walking yet but when I assist him and put his hands on the bar of the toy he enjoys walking with it. Its easy to move around and I haven't had a problem with anything falling off or being cheap. It has a couple sound settings so its not super loud either.

      "text": "Before she could walk, my baby daughter loved playing with the buttons/lights/music. As she got older, she used it as a \"walker\" (I kept the brakes on so it would remain locked and sturdy). Once she learned to walk, the brakes came off and she used it to walk and run on her own. Now that she's 16+ months, she runs around the house with it all the time. One of the best toys we've gotten for her - consistently plays with it and continues to do so!",

The walker operates with or with out the toy on the front. Very great item for the money. I can't say my baby is walking with out it, but he does feel comfortable crawling up to it and it's sturdy enough that he can pull himself up and it doesn't roll off and he uses it to push and walk.",

We replaced it the Fisher Price Laugh and Play with this VTech (had the same one when my boys were little) and love it. It is very sturdy and the best feature is that it has 2 roll settings. It has a slow control lock for the wheels and a regular roll setting. I also love that it comes in pink. There are also plenty of activities on it that are cute. Best Walker EVER!! I would highly recommend for any new learner",

The wheels are too slippary and I think they can improve them with rubbers or silicone type.",

Also the activity center comes off for when baby is sitting down. I love it! Very interactive and catches babys attention right away :)",

The only negative as some of the reviewers have said is that the wheels, although \"locked\" still allow the product to move. Once my child started pulling up to stand, I had to sit with him while he was playing with this toy so he didn't hurt himself falling trying to stand with it. Once your child can balance standing/walking on their own, I'm sure it can be used to be pushed around, but before then, keep a close eye. Still worth the money though for how much my child likes it.",

My wife bought this without consulting me. It is absolutely perfect for one of our great grand sons.",

For an infant learning to walk, the second speed is perfect (she stays on the carpet which also provides needed friction). It gives her the opportunity to take one step at a time at a pace she is comfortable at. The activity tablet will also keep her entertained with all the noise and buttons. Overall happy with the purchase.",

Locking the back wheels doesn't really prevent it from moving since the front wheels aren't lockable as well. And the phone handle isn't attached with a cord like the other removable items on the toy. We just removed the phone handle and put it in a drawer so it won't get lost, or used as a \"weapon\" by a curious toddler who often visits. So I'm giving it 4 stars because baby enjoys it. If the other items were addressed, it would easily be 5 stars.",

I understand this is a walker, but it does say \"sit-to-STAND,\" so I was expecting a bit more of a resistance to be one of the options (it has 2 resistance options). Other than that, my daughter enjoys playing with it, especially the phone & opening/closing the little \"barn door.\"",
