If you scroll way down you'll notice in the comparison chart it says \"native resolution 840x400\". This projector inputs 1080p (1920x1080) image from your PC, so in your computer settings it seems like a 1080p display, then compresses the image to display on the 840x400 pixels it projects. The image is so choppy you can't even read text on the display because each letter is only a few pixels. DO NOT BUY if you're looking for even half-decent image quality. Edit -- bringing up to 3 stars for good customer service.",

The support alone will keep me as a customer in the future! Good customer support is hard to find.

For their excellent customer service I am bumping to 4 stars. 7/23/2020 Unless your viewing in almost total darkness this is a waste of time and money! I even attempted it in the living room approx 4 feet away from the wall....it was daylight outside - not bright inside - a faint image on the wall. Pitch black viewing is better. Screen adjustments are minimal at best. Save your money and put towards something better.",

Mine arrived with scuffed black marks right out of the package. I don't believe it's affected the functionality, but could be due to rough factory handling. Sound quality will work well for indoor use, and using it to project an image less than 100\" would be most ideal. It's a decent option for something on the cheaper side for indoor use in my opinion. I'll definitely be purchasing something different for a larger outdoor projection in the future.",

I hook up my Chromecast too it and just stream from my phone. If there is a downside, it\u2019s just the noise that the built-in fan makes.

It was definitely my experience with this projector. I saw no options for projectors with names with which I am more familiar. And as a result, I rely heavily on the reviews. This one had over 6K positive reviews. But within minutes of opening the box, turning it on, it switched on and then it did not come back on. So, I'm returning...... Amazon, it seems, has outgrown itself. I don't know what to trust anymore.",

With all the movies being released on streaming services, it actually felt like we were at the movie theater.

Only direct front alignment of the projector to the screen will allow for the whole image to be in focus. The throw distance to get a 100\" image is over 10 feet from the screen so this is more of a medium/long throw configuration, but the lumens are not high enough to support the distance and have a decent picture. At about 8' you get a pretty bright picture and nice color saturation. Works best in a light controlled room without any keystone correction.",

      "text": "I purchased this projector after several days of research. I read multiple reviews of this projector and several others. I was looking for an inexpensive projector that still had a quality image. This projector has a picture that makes our family movie time entertaining and fun! Setting up was easy and navigating the settings for the best picture possible was simple enough. Our living room is narrow, so the projector sits 8.5\u2019 from the screen. I was still able to adjust the picture to fill the screen and have a crisp image. I am incredibly happy with my purchase.",

      "text": "I was just looking for a basic, occasional use, inexpensive projector for movie watching. After seeing the reviews I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. It has decent brightness and clarity. It is a budget projector, so the native resolution is not what a $1000 projector would be, but certainly way adequate enough to watch a movie with family and friends. VERY easy to set up and my firestick works GREAT with the projector. I had it set up and watching a movie in just 3 minutes. Recommend. It came well packaged and comes with a great carrying case too!",

I had to crank it down because it was too saturated. -The remote had issues making good contact with the batteries, took me awhile to really sit it in there, after that it is good. The bad; -The cord is like 3 feet long. Get a cord extender. -The screw that tilts the unit up is about an inch tall, so you will not be using that.",

I also used an auxiliary cord I already had to connect to my wireless stereo to amplify the sound. No lag with latency, picture quality was great. Family is enjoying this so far.

The down side is if your trying to use it at any range past 9 feet the fouse won't go any further. So you may get just under 120\" with good picture focus but not any further. In short the whole projecting over 120\" is clearly inaccurate. Also I would suggests using some kind of amp or surround sound system cuz the build in speakers just don't do it justice.",

Hooked up small computer speakers to get louder sound for outside the garage. Very satisfied with the projector. The price was great for our purposes and it seems even cheaper now. Seems like it would work for great showing videos inside your home. We were very happy that this projector met our expectations for our Halloween night show.",

      "text": "This is an impressive little projector, especially for the price. This is my third attempt at getting a small, but affordable projector and hoping for acceptable quality. This projector definitely exceeded expectations. It gets a pretty clear picture. The sound is good for home use, but if you plan on using this outdoors or with a lot of people you might want to connect some speakers. It gets the brightest and clearest picture in very dark spaces, the darker the space, the better the picture will be. I was able to hook up my Amazon Fire to it and watch NETFLIX without any problems. This has basically allowed us to turn our spare bedroom into a movie room.",

      "text": "I am an educational trainer. I purchased the VANKYO LEISURE so I could practice my training at home due to COVID-19. The set up of the projector was very easy. I like the fact that it comes in its own bag with a remote control, power, HDMI, VGA, and TV connection chords. It\u2019s compact and lightweight. The projector can be displayed in day or night but works best in a darker room. The quality of the picture is not the best, but was awesome for the purpose I used it for. For the price, it\u2019s worth the purchase! I\u2019m very pleased with this product!",

      "title": "Great for the price!",
      "text": "First, you have to keep in mind the price. I paid less than 70 dollars with the coupon. For that price, this is great! A few years ago I would not have been able to imagine a projector for under 100. It is not bright enough to be usable during the day. But bright enough for night time viewing. It is fairly quiet and the fan nose is not distracting. The video quality is great for dvds. We used ours at about 12 to 14 feet on a 120 inch screen. It has a LED bulb, and so will hopefully be long lasting. Overall, I would really recommend it.",
