Manage your stress ina healthy way. 4. Eat healthy. Nobody\u2019s perfect, so if if you miss 1-4 for any reason see below... 5. Use Herpecin-L lip protectorant. 6. Keep a pack of Orajel on you at all times! Very important because as soon as you have the slightest inclination that a breakout may happen use it! 7. Take Lysine supplements daily. If you act quickly you can take something thatwould last weeks, down to one -three days.",
