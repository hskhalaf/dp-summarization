Now a few years down the line the mic has a fair amount of wear and tear on the ear bit and the microphone barely works. Picks up way too much half the time and now the mic has too much hissing. Was it worth the near \u00a380 at the time? Probably not. I would expect a Razer product to last more than 3 years, especially for such steep prices; I suppose that's why they halved the price over time.",
