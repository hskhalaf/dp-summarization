No worries about any part bending or breaking no matter how large a batch you\u2019re mashing . This is a hefty tool, but its well designed handle makes it comfortable to grip. Heartily recommend.",

When it appeared to be on its last leg, I spotted an OXO brand compact masher that I thought would work great (I have been a fan of OXO products for many years). The very first time using the OXO, the masher bent on me (plus the design puts your knuckles too close to steaming potatoes). I reported this to OXO and they sent me a new one. In the meantime, I had already replaced the OXO with this Jamie Oliver masher... very well constructed, good grip and your hand is a safe distance from scalding steam. Trying to figure out what to do with my OXO spare???",

    "title": "JAMIE OLIVER Stainless Steel Masher",
    "description": "Style Name:Potato Masher\n\nMASHER\nBY JAMIE OLIVER\nCreate a just-right texture with the Masher from Jamie Oliver. This sturdy, classic kitchen tool is reinvented with two sizes of holes for quick mashing without leaving any lumps and a built-in silicone bowl scraper to remove everything you mash out of the bowl. Constructed of durable brushed stainless steel with a soft-grip handle for comfortable use, the Masher can be used for a variety of everyday tasks in a wide array of recipes including mashed potatoes and other root vegetables, guacamole, bean dips and more. The Masher includes a hanging hole for convenient storage and is dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. The Masher measures 11 inches (28 centimeters) long.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n * Built-in silicone bowl scraper\n * Two sizes of holes for quick and effective mashing\n * Durable brushed stainless steel construction\n * Soft-grip handle for comfort\n * Hanging hole for rail storage\n * Dishwasher safe for easy cleaning\n * Measures 11 inches (28 centimeters) long\n\nUSE YOUR JAMIE OLIVER MASHER IN THESE AND OTHER RECIPES\nSMASHED ROOT VEGGIES\nThis simple recipe pairs perfectly with roasted meats and other seasonal dishes\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n * Sea salt\n * 1.6 pounds of potatoes, peeled, cut into large chunks\n * 3 large carrots, peeled and cut into small chunks\n * 1/2 large rutabaga, peeled and cut into small chunks\n * 2.6-ounces butter\n\nMETHOD\n\nPut your potatoes, carrots and rutabaga into a large pot of boiling salted water and boil hard for 20 minutes or so until you can slide a knife into the rutabaga easily. Drain and allow to steam dry, then smash them up in the pan with most of the butter. If you prefer a smooth texture, add some cooking water. Spoon into a bowl, cover with tinfoil and keep warm over a pan of simmering water.\n\nDish in to a bowl and serve at the table.\n\nFOOD & HOME PRODUCTS\nJamie's passion for fresh, honest and delicious food forms the basis for his brilliant range of food and kitchenware products, which ranges from oils and vinegars to kitchen spices, and gadgets to must-have tools.\n\nABOUT JAMIE OLIVER\nJamie Oliver is a phenomenon in the world of food. He is the author of best selling cookbooks including \"Jamie's 30 Minute Meals\", operates multiple restaurants across the UK, provides training for young chefs through the Fifteen restaurant group, and is one of the world's best loved TV personalities on multiple series including The Naked Chef (BBC) and the Emmy Award-winning Jamie's Food Revolution (ABC).\n\nAs a chef and teacher, Jamie has inspired people to spend more time enjoying being in the kitchen--and even start growing their own food. Jamie lives in London and Essex with his wife, Jools and his kids, Poppy, Daisy, Petal and Buddy.\n\nSMASHED CELERIAC\nDELICIOUSLY TASTY, ALMOST-MASH\nWhat a surprisingly simple and comforting veg dish. Unfortunately everyone seems to be completely baffled by celeriac, but it's beautiful in soups or thinly sliced into salads. When roasted it goes sweet and when mixed with potato and mashed it's a complete joy.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n * 1 celeriac, peeled\n * Olive oil\n * 1 handful fresh thyme, leaves picked\n * 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped\n * Sea salt\n * Freshly ground black pepper\n * 3-4 tablespoons water or organic stock\n\nMETHOD\n\nSlice about 1/2-inch off the bottom of your celeriac and roll it on to that flat edge, so it's nice and safe to slice. Slice and dice it all up into 1/2-inch-ish cubes. Don't get your ruler out \u2013 they don't have to be perfect. Put a casserole-type pot on a high heat, add 3 good lugs of olive oil, then add the celeriac, thyme and garlic, with a little seasoning. Stir around to coat and fry quite fast, giving a little colour, for 5 minutes. \n\nTurn the heat down to a simmer, add the water or stock, place a lid on top and cook for around 25 minutes, until tender. Season carefully to taste and stir around with a spoon and smash up the celeriac gently with your Jamie Oliver Masher. Some people like to keep it in cubes, some like to mash it, but I think it looks and tastes much better if you smash it, which is somewhere in the middle. You can serve this with just about any meat you can think of.",
