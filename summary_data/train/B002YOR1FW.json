I have used several different popcorn brands including the all-in-one package that Great Northern puts out. All of it turns out chewy and nobody likes it like that.",

It would leave a lot of un popped corn left and I mean a lot. I had to jimmy rig this to make it work. I expected a lot more from the way they blast quality all over. It\u2019s still Chinese comes from China along with all their lack of quality on everything. Just completely let down",

I have the 8oz machine and use the 4oz prepackaged bags but it literally only pops about half the bag. I don't know if this is an issue with the machine or the popcorn itself. It's very frustrating that it won't just work like it's supposed to.",
