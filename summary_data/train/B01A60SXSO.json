      "text": "Camera worked great excellent zoom and image stabilizers. I'd love it but less than 1 year unit will not hold a charge even when plugged in. 1 year warranty is false Panasonic will charge you for labor on broken parts after 90 days and also charge $75 for diagnosis. I've used the camcorder maybe 5 times never been neglecting. My question is how would you even get a 1 year warranty as they will charge you over the units cost for any work after 90 days. It false and misleading advertising. I will never buy another Panasonic product again! Just so you know if you buy this your rolling the dice. I would strongly recommend purchasing from another manufacturer. Junk!",

So i got a universal LED camcorder light to attatch to it. A small one. It works PERFECT. completely fixes that problem. It recently snowed at around 3am here in texas (rarely happens), i took the kids put with it and turned on the light, PERFECT shot and beautiful video to show the kids when they are older. I couldnt be happier! And the stability is incredible! It also allows you to take pics while recording! Too cool!",

If you are looking for decent quality for a great price, this camera fits that bill. I adjusted some camera setting to improve image quality.",

I normally have it plugged in to a power bank and it keeps going even in 100deg direct sunlight, the entire day, never overheated once so far. It's not waterproof obviously and I've worried once or twice about it getting splashed, but for the price it's a risk I'm willing to take for the superior image and sound quality vs an action camera.",
