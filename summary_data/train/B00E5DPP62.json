I was a little worried about trying the sample at first because I do have oily skin. Don't expect a lathering soap, it's not like that. You need very little of the product to work, so use sparingly. The product line is pricy, BUT the product will last quite a while.",

When the oil barrier of our skin is compromises, from harsh stripping cleansers, etc., it makes you more likely to react to products and experience negative symptoms on your skin. Camellia oil = great. I trust this skincare line. Can't wait to try their exfoliant!!",
