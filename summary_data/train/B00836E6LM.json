For the people leaving reviews of it walking my guess is they are trying to leave the wheels off. They must be on. As for a couple reviews saying its cheaply made they must be expecting a industrial grade $700 fan for this price? It's easy to roll around and comes with a nice thick cord. My only regret is waiting to buy it.",

Upon closer inspection, I noticed the fan blades weren't mounted to the motor! They were loose inside the drum! I unscrewed the front wire guard and noticed bent wires, bent drum metal at the seam, and a black rub or impact mark on the bottom of the drum! Once inside the drum I was easily able to mount the fan to the motor and tighten the side screw. Once reassembled I tried again and the fan ran fine on both speeds. I'm concerned about the arrival condition. It's like the whole unit was dropped hard or involved in a wreck.",
