Love the glass for easy cleaning and the stainless steel filter is easy to clean and looks great! I will be ordering more for gifts!!",

I've tried so many different strategies to decrease the amount of coffee dust that seeps into my brew, but I just can't manage to avoid it with this system. From what I hear, the Penguin brand system has a more fine mesh and reduces this problem. If you want to save 5 bucks and get this, I'm sure it'll work out fine. It's annoying, but not a total deal breaker, to have the dust in your brew.",

You have to be really careful not to pour too much water in or the water will come out from the spout. But it's not a big enough deal for me to be unhappy with the product.

I used 14 tbsps of coffee and about 6 cups of water. 1 cup I poured over the grounds, then waited 5 minutes to let the coffee bloom. Then I poured the remaining 5 cups. I let it sit on the counter overnight. It is a little strong for my taste, so I added a little water to the glass, cream and Splenda. Sooooo refreshing!
