Yes, you may want to gently iron it or spray water on it. It's quite wrinkled because it's folded very tightly and compact. I would recommend a towel between a warm iron and the felt so you don't melt the graphics. The bad: There were imprints from the iron-on graphics on the mirror folded sides (see first picture). So either they folded it before the graphics were cool, or it had been exposed to heat (while folded) at some point. The Blackjack side is now disfigured. :(",

This mat should've covered the entire area with extra material hanging from all sides. The mat I received was 36x70 inches. Two inches less than what I purchased. That might not seem like a big deal but now there's an area of table exposed. Not cool.",
