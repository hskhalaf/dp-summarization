This is a \u201cnear\u201d replica of the Hario Mini Mill, has big ceramic burrs, and is better than the standard $15 silver hand mill found everywhere. However there is a design flaw: the grinder arm needs to be attached with a nut, therefore each time you add beans you will need to disassemble the crank arm, nut, and lid...then reassemble. Seemingly no big deal, but it\u2019s enough of an inconvenience that I felt like I needed to write a review. Spend the extra bucks and get the Hario.",

The plastic cover for the beans compartment comes loose, it is supposed to stay in place by pressure, I guess, but now doesn't fit tight anymore which causes coffee beans and bean fragments to fall off while grinding or even while moving the grinder around. After a few weeks of finding coffee beans all around the house, I decided to bite the bullet and write it off as a (moderate) loss.",

I like others have said have to say that the two cup level on the grinder is actually more like four or five tablespoons.",

The disadvantage with this compared with the Hario is the plastic lid on this requires a full dismantling of the top screw and handle to add beans each time, and you can only really store about 2-3 servings of beans.",

It has backed off on the grind size while I am grinding. All I have to do is tighten the nut and go at it again. Can't complain about that either because it does keep a uniform size as long as I keep that nut tightened.",
