Yesterday a blob of dressing from a sandwich wiped right off and the shirt came through the wash with no spot. Good stain protection and no wrinkles from the dryer. Fit is as expected (just right for my XXL torso) and finish quality is good. Very happy with this shirt!",

The sleeves are nice and long and the material is a cotton blend, which makes it lightweight. The length of the body is long, so if you're long waisted this will fit. It's almost too long for me as it comes down to the tops of my thighs. Great product, I'd definitely purchase this again.",

Whatever it is, the smell lingers on other clothes stacked on or near the shirts. That alone will keep me from buying another copy of this shirt.",

    "title": "Jerzees Men's Spot Shield Long Sleeve Polo Sport Shirt",
    "description": "JERZEES Spot Shield men's long sleeve polo sports shirts are great for everyday wear and for jobs that get messy. Water and most oil-based liquids simply bead up and roll right off the fabric preventing staining. The magic behind these incredible shirts is our stain-resisting technology is designed to be long lasting and provide protection over the life of the shirt. Plus, the 50/50 blend reduces fading and shrinking for an even longer lasting look. Long sleeves are also a great option to protect you from the sun in warmer months, or keep you warm in colder temperatures. Available up to 2XL in a variety of great colors.",
