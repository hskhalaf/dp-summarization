On month 4 and no accumulation of nasty smells; washes up great. Cons: because they are grey, you can see them inside some lighter diaper outer shells. We have to run them 1.5x through the dryer on gentle to make sure they get totally dry. Net net: worth the extra expense to replace your liners with these. No more doubling up liners.",

I definitely prefer the flat inserts, it's more effective to have a double gusset pocket diaper or cover. If you purchase these, remember that the absorbancy with charcoal/bamboo inserts gets even better after 5-10 washes. I prepped them by washing twice prior to use, and that was sufficient for prep.",
