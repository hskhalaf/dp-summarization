      "text": "I purchased this case/keyboard combo as an early Christmas gift for myself and I have no regrets. It was between this case and the Logitech Zagg aluminum case. Ultimately I chose this case because in looking at the Zagg case it appears that there is quite a lip surrounding the keyboard. I could see that getting in the way of typing. Also, the reviews for the Zagg case indicated that the aluminum dented easily. The fold-away keyboard is a nice size and the key spacing is perfect. Couple that with the convenience of folding the keyboard away when you don't need it and this is the perfect case/keyboard combo.",

Yes...but you're going to pay a lot more for it. This connects great and feels like a good quality keyboard. I've had it for 2 years now and have typed all my notes in school with it. The battery lasts long. My only criticism is that it's hard to charge the iPad because of how they have the port so I usually take out the iPad.",

Its stupid and not confortable design. So the case went directly to trash can, because its was poor quality and it stinks. This was my worste purchase that I made from Belkin. Go look for other cases that has flexible design and made of good quality materials not some kind of chinese chemical crap.",

It functions so well as a keyboard, a protective case and a kickstand. I have used this day in and day out for 2 years now and it still functions and appears (for the most part) like it did the day I got it. It links up easily through Bluetooth every time and I'm always amazed at how long the battery lasts. I think I charge it once every 2 weeks for a couple of hours. If you looking for an iPad case & keyboard, look no further... this is certainly the one.",

I am not a traditional typer and I find the keys easier to use than a standard keyboard.",

On the whole, I would recommend this to anyone who needs a keyboard and needs to bring their iPad around. Protection wise, it is minimal but does a pretty neat job.",

I have an IPAD 1 and IPAD 2 - and as an IPAD cover it really doesn't work with the original; the fit being too tight and frankly at this price it should do. The cover doesn't close very well so thats also a bit of a pain. But overall as a bluetooth keyboard it does the job but its an expensive one.",

The folio has a soft exterior and a smooth inner lining, making it pleasing to the touch. Its stiff, durable construction helps protect your iPad from scratches, scuffs, and other types of wear. It even features a camera lens cutout that lets you snap photos while your iPad is in the case.

To connect the keyboard to your iPad, simply switch the keyboard on, and it will connect to your iPad via Bluetooth. In addition, the keyboard's rechargeable battery is able to hold a charge for up to 60 hours of active use or up to 2,000 hours of standby. The battery can easily be recharged using the included USB cable. \n\nThe Belkin Keyboard Folio for iPad 2 is backed by a one-year limited warranty.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nBelkin Keyboard Folio for iPad 2, USB charging cable, and user manual.",
