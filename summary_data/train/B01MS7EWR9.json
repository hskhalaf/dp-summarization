      "text": "Bike was fairly easy to setup for its size. The seat is okay, but it kind of causes you to slide down it a lot. It could probably be engineered better. Recently my bike has stopped working and I'm waiting for a replacement part from Nautilus. Hopefully that resolves it, but kind of sad that it broke in 7 months. I haven't used any of the advanced features like playing music, or syncing with my pc, or anything like that. I just hit quick start and up the resistance and bike for 30-40 mins.",

I contacted Schwinn customer service by email but never got a response. The bike is built too lightly; I returned it to Amazon. There are good aspects to the bike. Assembly is straight forward. It peddles smoothly and quietly, and the electronic display is easy to understand and operate if you read the directions first. But if you are larger and/or ride vigorously, you need to spend more on a better exercise bike.",

It is functional but not as good as the larger Schwinn recumbent I had which was lost in a house fire. It should be OK for general exercise but nothing too involved.",

It does work smoothly, but the readout is not very useful: no mph, no indication of resistance level (just \"beeps\") and no explanation in the manual of the \"programs\". To add insult to injury, the price dipped considerably just after I bought it, such that you can now get the better model the 270?) For what we paid. With that one you get color lcd display and ability to use Bluetooth to \"ride along\" on beautiful routes around the world. So still feeling a little screwed over by this purchase",

Also their registration page has issues. Very frustrating, don't know what someone without tools would do.",
