It'll say 2 bars left on batteries & it'll die every time you use it. So we replace almoatvevery 2 weeks now. They do come with a cord to charge rechargeable batteries, however everytime we go to buy the size, there isnt any in the store. So not sure how that feature works! Which is why I give it 4stars!",
