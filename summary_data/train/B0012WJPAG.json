      "text": "These hiking shoes are rugged and actually a little stylish--with the lavender accents. Although they provide firm support, I really find Keen footwear comfortable as they have a wide toe box and are contoured well around the ankle/heel. I have slightly large ankles and they don't cut in like other hiking shoes that I've tried. They are a little heavy as they are made with a very durable exterior but I can see that they will hold up for a very long time. I actually had a similar design about 15 yrs ago but my foot grew a little so I gave them to my mom. They last forever with minor care.",

But they go right up to my ankles, and after walking around the house with them for about a half hour to an hour, I couldn't bear them. Plus they left a bruise on the top of my foot. I tried thick wool socks, 2 pairs of socks, loosening/tightening the laces, nothing helped. They were a half size up, as a lot of reviewers suggested. My daughter noted the same ankle issue with hers. Sadly returning both.",

I am very unhappy that the heel material is starting to peel off. See the pictures where I inserted a card below the material. For this price I would of expected these shoes to last a lot longer. I will be contacting Keen. Don't know if I can just super glue this back and if it would last when it gets wet. This is my only issue, the shoes are comfortable and waterproof.",

She still wears them to work in the yard. The only reason she bought a 2nd pair was because the other didn't look nice anymore. We did find that this pair doesn't seem to have quite as high of an arch as the original pair, but overall she is very satisfied and recommends them to all of her friends. Prior to buying Keens she would get lots of ankle and calf pain when walking. Now she can walk all day on any type of flooring or ground and no pain. I'd say that's a win!",

I like the fact that i can tighten the back with the laces, as my right foot is smaller as I have a titanium big toe as i had a melted bone from overuse i guess its kinda weird when your foot doctor says i have never seen that before...lol.

I took the inserts out and replaced with my Merrels and that helped significantly. They are also very ugly.

The laces are very hard to tighten and tie because the shoe is so stiff and the tongue gathers in the middle. The tongue causes so much pressure on the top of the foot that it cuts off blood flow and makes my feet go numb. I'm thinking it will be almost impossible to endure the ankle rubbing and pressure from the gathered tongue to break these in.",

I definitely needed the larger size with heavy socks but decided I'd most likely wear thinner socks for comfort, so kept the 5's. I wore them around the house doing chores, up and down stairs, etc. to wear them in. They stayed comfortable, fit comfortably, nice wide toe box, but the laces loosened easily. I guess I'll need to double knot them when out and about. They are light weight and fit to size. Nice looking shoe, too! I have yet to see how they do in wet weather. I now own 5 pair of Keens. I obviously like this brand!",

The shoe is also very heavy. It does provide enough room for a wider foot and grip is excellent but I prefer my Keen boots to this shoe.",

Keen's run big in the toebox so know that when you order. The idea that they are waterproof proves perfect for New England winter weather which can be messy and sloppy. The shoe itself feel like a sneaker and keeps you warm. I am looking forward to wearing them on warm day hikes as well as general daily use.",

I like the extra room at the toe of both pairs. I'm not certain if both pairs were seconds or if Keen shoes are inconsistent in their manufacturing.",

    "description": "Targhee II Trail Shoe Available in shoe and boot styles, Keen Women's Targhee II is the ideal hiking partner. The rugged Targhee II gives you the comfort and support of an athletic shoe and the resilience and protective features of a rough-and-tough hiking boot. This style keeps your feet dry and your step steady thanks to a waterproof nubuck upper, 4-millimeter multi-directional lugs, and a Keen.Dry waterproof membrane. And for exceptional support mile after mile, the Targhee II combines an S3 heel structure with a dual-density, compression-molded EVA midsole and a Keen Metatomical EVA footbed.\n\nFeatures * Sporty lace-up shoe with waterproof upper\n * EVA midsole and removable footbed for exceptional support\n * S3 heel support prevents ankle injuries\n * Keen.Dry liner wicks away moisture\n * Multi-directional lugs for dependable traction\n\nSpecs * Weight: 13.74 oz/390.22 g\n * Upper: Nubuck and textile upper\n * Lining: KEEN.DRY waterproof membrane\n\n Waterproof membrane offers an additional barrier against moisture.\nView larger.\n\n S3 heel supports the foot on impact.\nView larger.\n\nRUGGED STYLE WITH A WATERPROOF NUBUCK UPPER\n The Targhee II offers a sleek-and-sporty style and a lace-up front for a custom fit. This low-profile shoe stands up to any trail conditions and looks good doing it, thanks to a durable, waterproof nubuck upper with stitching accents and pops of bright color on the laces and around the heel.\n\nBREATHABLE MOISTURE PROTECTION WITH KEEN.DRY\n To keep you treading comfortably on all kinds of terrain, the Targhee II features a Keen.Dry insert. This waterproof membrane offers an additional barrier against moisture yet is breathable enough for all-day comfort.\n\nS3 HEEL SUPPORT\n S3 stands for Shock, Suspension, and Stability and refers to Keen's unique heel-support structure. S3 is engineered to support the foot on impact, which dissipates shock, helping to prevent injury to the ankle.\n\nKEEN METATOMICAL FOOTBED AND EVA MIDSOLE FOR SUPPORT\n For comfort and support that won't quit, the Targhee II features a removable, dual-density EVA footbed that provides arch support by hugging the natural contours of your foot. The compression-molded EVA midsole extends the benefits of the footbed and adds an extra spring to your step.\n\nESS SHANK REDUCES FOOT FATIGUE\n To keep you going longer, the Targhee II has a torsional-stability ESS shank in the midsole. This shank helps to stabilize your foot as you move, minimizing fatigue, so you can enjoy every moment as you push on to the next crest.\n\nMULTI-DIRECTIONAL LUGS FOR GREATER TRACTION\n To give you a steady grip on all kinds of terrain, the Targhee has 4-millimeter, multi-directional lugs on its non-marking rubber outsole. These lugs are spaced wide apart to \"bite\" into the terrain, giving you more dependable traction on slippery and uneven surfaces.\n\nPATENTED TOE PROTECTION\n Because rocky objects and debris can trip you up on the trail, the Targhee II includes Keen.Protect, patented toe protection that wraps up and over the outsole for thorough coverage of the entire toe bed.\n\nKEEN: A STORY OF HYBRID INNOVATION\n Keen began in 2003 with an inspired sandal design that combined comfort and toe protection. This radical design departure for sandals spawned the overriding Keen philosophy of hybrid innovation--striving to create new possibilities and to discover and implement original ideas.\n\n Keen products put an emphasis on the joys of play. At the same time, Keen believes in the value of working hard to give back to the community. To that end, the company has partnered with non-profit organizations around the world to help get youth into the outdoors, protect land for its environmental and recreational value, and to give bikes to kids in need.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n Keen Women's Targhee II Waterproof Trail Shoe.\n\n\n\nFrom beaches to mountains to city streets, Keen believes the outdoors is anyplace without a ceiling. Keen believes in living a HybridLife, which means being part of a greater community that is full of people who create possibilities, play in the outdoors and care for the world around them.",
