Sometimes they leak a little if they're laying on their sides and the contents are not frozen. In all, though, I don't find it hard to prop them up in the freezer while they freeze, and we love being able to make healthy frozen desserts! Also, it say's \"100% Silicone\" on the bottom, and the tubes don't turn white when doing the \"pinch test,\" so I am hopeful that they don't have dangerous fillers in them. We will buy this high quality set again.",
