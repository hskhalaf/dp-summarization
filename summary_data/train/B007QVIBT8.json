For the crybabies who complained that these sprays did not work for them is why sinus buster is no longer available. Via a class action lawsuit, the crybabies got thier $10 and the lawyers got thier thousands. For the rest of us who gained relief from years of dealing with cronic allergies and sinus congestion, we got screwed. If it doesn't work for you then just ask for a refund.

I am addicted to afrin and wanted to try something natural and so far this stuff works. So if you can handle a little fire up your nose give it a try.",
