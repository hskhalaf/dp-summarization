If you Crossfit though avoid these for rope climbs- no grip and the rope is like soap against them. It tears through the fabric too :(",

They definitely a warmer weather shoe though. There is nothing there to protect feet from the elements so they're great for people with sweaty feet in the summer. One thing to caution though: one of my friends bought the same shoes but had foot cramps because her feet needed more arch support.",

That was not necessary as these run a little larger. I do like the shoes but the insole is not as comfortable as that in the glove 3. I cannot use them on trails.",

This she in particular is roomy in the toe box and has great air flow. The sole reminds me of my last pair of Vibram five fingers, which is just what I was looking for.",

I don't often order online but I was so happy that these turned out so well. I feel great contact with the ground in every step - and they kept me going for a really long convention with almost no foot pain at all. I really recommend trying these! Make the step towards strong feet! NOTE: if you're looking for a shoe with super padded arch support... stop! I have high arches and there's nothing better that you can do for your feet than to make them stronger.",

They do run narrow as I normally wear a narrow and did not have to do a lot of snuggling to get them to fit. No blistering or break in period. I think these are better than the pair they replaced.",
