All you need to do is remove the 4 bolts, washers and wing nuts, raise the handle and reinsert them. A large flat screwdriver is needed. The empty cart is not balanced and tips backward. Just put it by a wall or tree. When using for lawn or garden debris, I put a cardboard box in the cart so I can empty it easier. Otherwise, you have to turn the cart upside down. My favorite discovery is that I can move my wide seat kneeler from place to place on top of the cart.",

I\u2019m only 5ft and find it\u2019s easy to push or pull. It only tips over if it\u2019s empty and not on a level surface. It\u2019s not been an issue for me. I love it and would buy again.",

Primarily bought this to use in the garden for peat moss, topsoil, etc. But that will have to wait until the spring.",
