It's true that the E is not mentioned as being supported, but I was told otherwise. Because I'm using Linux and the probs took so long to resolve, I can't return. I can't resell because I don't know if it's not simply broken. Palm says something about \"vcard\" not working with some 3rd party infrared devices for E. Make another choice if you don't use Windows/Mac and/or use Tungsten E.... Beware.",

If I put the keyboard close enough to get a signal, I could use a keyboard. That means I should put something beneath the keyboard to make it close with a PDA. I will return it tomorrow.

My Dell has the IR port on top and any movement throws off the beam so that I have to readjust the mirror or move the keyboard. In addition, the manual is woefully inadequate. It does a cursory job explaining short cut keys, functions and screen rotation. Look at other solutions - Belkin failed on this one.",
