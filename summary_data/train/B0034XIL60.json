The pictures are perfectly acceptable to me... I am not a professional by any means, but almost everything I've photographed has come out pretty well. Camera snobs would probably turn up their noses at this little camera, but for anyone looking for a compact and easy to use camera, I'd recommend this one.",

I don't expect it to replace my Nikon D90 or My D3100, so I can accept it's limitations, but this is an amazing pocket camera that will take perfect pictures straight out of the box in minutes, if used correctly-(which is super easy). This camera cannot be beat for the money-the technology is awesome and the Nikon quality is there. So if you're looking for a great SMALL pocket camera that will take perfect pictures, the L22 is a great choice.The price is fantastic, so I purchased the oops protection plan in case I fumbled and dropped it-(it's pretty tiny for large hands). Enjoy!",

The screen, resolution, flash and battery life are much better on this newer model. The navigation button aren't as user friendly, easier to hit by accident, harder to switch modes. The buttons feel very flimsy and plastic - I'm worried they will break before the actual camera mechanisms do! But overall very satified. The pictures turned out well and it's a great camera for a teenager. I need a new camera too and think I will invest the extra 20-40 to get a slightly nicer coolpix that feels sturdier.",

Lots of picture options, zoom is AMAZING, and the screen is a very good size for reviewing images. I've had my fair share of accidental droppings, and this camera still runs smoothly. The only problem i've EVER had with this camera is the batteries. Do not use cheap ones. Rechargeables, or Duracell, or even Energizer are the best ones. Cheap batteries only last for a few minutes, therefor shutting the camera off mid action.. Overall this camera is worth every penny. 10/10 would buy again.",

So far she's been very happy with it and has begun taking photo's with this instead of using disposable cameras. For the price you can't beat it. For those who want any advanced controls and features this camera might be a bit of a dissapointment. It is definately tailored as a simple automatic point and shoot.",

We used rechargeable batteries in it and that works well.",

Nikon doesn't install sub-par lenses. The versatility of digital cameras has enabled new snapshot artists to grow into accomplished photographers much sooner than in the film photo era..

Recently it started eating batteries and the battery case pops open at the most inconvenient times. The lock is not broken but it is not strong enough to contain the batteries. It is a real nuisance trying to take a photo and have the batteries fall out. Buyer beware.",

The camera's Easy Auto Mode with Scene Auto Selector simplifies your picture-taking experience by letting camera automatically select the best setting to get great pictures. Nikon's Smart Portrait System will; fix red-eye, detect faces, fire the shutter when your subject smiles and warn you if they blink, to get you great portraits. \n\n\n\nCarefree operation and high performance combined for consistently great pictures \n\nCombining the precision optics of a Nikkor lens with the image quality and performance benefits of Nikon's innovative EXPEED digital image-processing concept, the Coolpix L22 is a quality compact digital camera that combines high performance with outstanding operating ease. \n\nIntuitive and automated operation ensures carefree command over the high performance features of the Coolpix L22. Activated in Easy Auto Mode, Nikon's Scene Auto Selector makes capturing special moments as easy as turning on the camera and shooting without worrying about any settings. Electronic VR image stabilization, Motion Detection, Nikon's BSS (Best Shot Selector) function and ISO 1600 capability help ensure sharper results in lower light, or when capturing fast-moving subjects. \n\nThe Coolpix L22 is powered by AA size/R6 batteries, for the added advantage of being able to pick up a new set in virtually any corner of the world.

Activated in Easy Auto Mode, Nikon's Scene Auto Selector eliminates the need to manually select a scene mode to match the shot, making it faster and easier to capture the moment in beautiful fashion. The Coolpix L22 and L21 use this intelligent function to analyze the subject and its surrounding settings and automatically select the most appropriate scene mode to achieve optimal results. \n\nAdvanced image stabilizing features* help ensure sharper results Nikon's Electronic VR image stabilization and Motion Detection compensate for subject movement as well as camera shake.
