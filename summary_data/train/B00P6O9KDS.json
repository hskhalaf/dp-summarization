Not being one for the scent of peppermint, this product's scent is ultra pure therefore I don't mind it. It is rather pleasant. Three weeks later, after multiple sprinkled applications around the garage, there are no visible signs the mice are around, I believe this was the best humane method of getting rid of them. There is a lingering scent that will dissipate in due time. In the meantime, the scent is refreshing. I may keep the scent going to discourage any more field mice. Highly recommend this pure pleasant scent.",

The fragrance is not overly strong or offensive, it just cleared my head and left a slight peppermint fragrance. I actually was told this help relieve mild depression. I am under the care of a doctor and take a low milligram anti depressant 1 x a day. Does anyone know about the effect of peppermint oil on depression?",
