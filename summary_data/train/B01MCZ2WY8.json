      "text": "I purchased this to help provide some additional light during Facebook live videos that I was conducting indoors, mostly at night. However, you have to be extremely close to your phone in order for it to provide any noticeable light. Settings two and three are so bright that they would be hard to look at for any length of time. The ring also would have gotten in the way of me being able to see viewer comments during the live video as well. I guess if you're just going to pull it out for a quick selfie at close-up range, then it does the trick. But if you're thinking of using it for video, I'd advise against it.",

      "text": "I bought this for zoom calls, as I\u2019m often seated with a window behind me, making my face in shadow. It\u2019s not as good for that purpose as I had hoped. It does add light and helps, but it\u2019s an odd, unnatural light, like a picture taken with flash, and doesn\u2019t make as big of a difference as I expected. It\u2019s hard on the eyes to have it on through a whole video call. You will see a purple ring of light everywhere you look for awhile after turning it off. It\u2019s probably better for it\u2019s main intended use of just taking selfies.",

Fits well with my notebook PC however, for my mobile phone I have to take off the protective cover; but I am okay with that. The button for the power is also the same button to adjust the brightness. There are three settings for the dimmer and that works really good. There were a lot of ring lights to choose from and I am glad that I picked this one.",
