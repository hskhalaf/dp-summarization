It's design is pleasing to look at with its black and red color scheme, and the added, adjustable, red backlight to the keyboard is also a great touch. The build is solid, and the speakers sound great for laptop speakers. Overall, this is an incredible buy, and the opportunity to pay this off in monthly payments is just another great thing to include. For anyone who's looking to invest in a gaming laptop, or even just a nice laptop in general, they should most definitely consider this!",
