This cover has an elastic bottom, and the cover extends completely to the ground. Although I do not have a front box mounted, there is no doubt the cover would accommodate it with room to spare. No way the wind would blow this cover off. Figuring out fore / aft was a bit of a pain due to its large size (there is a tiny label sewed to the elastic hem which indicates front) so after installation I used a silver Sharpy to conspicuously mark it Front / rear.",

They have a heavy duty bungee cord sewn in around the exterior of the cover to make it took under it just nicely. Each cover comes with its own storage bag and is easy stored when in use. I was a little worried about the cover fitting over my lifted 420 with snorkels but it more than handled the job. I would recommend this cover to anyone looking to protect their ATV in the off-season or between rides.",

I now roll it carefully over the ATV starting at the front and rolling it back to the rear - and reverse that when recovering after use.",

I put the cover on my ATV expecting it to be larger than I needed and it was, but a nice elastic band at the base to keep it snug to the wheels etc. I guess I will see how it holds out thru the winter. So far I think this is a really good buy. Thank you",
