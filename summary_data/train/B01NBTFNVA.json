I have a Samsung TV hooked up to an Onkyo receiver, AT&T U-Verse cable box with several other gaming consoles and streaming devices.

Often you'll hear audio but a different video output is on or the other way around. I had a hard time making things work the first time and am still running into problems several weeks into the install. Today is Prime Day, I wouldn't recommend buying one at this time.",

I've seem additional wonkiness when I ask the Fire Cube to turn off my AV receiver and TV. When they come on, the audio is not right and the input may not be last used. This device might be salvageable with updates, but why buy now and deal with it all? Get the regular 4K and call it good.",

While some of the basic commands work (\"Alexa, Turn On TV\"; \"Alexa, Watch Netflix\"), it is really hard to navigate within the app. So far, here are the commands that DON'T work while watching Amazon Prime videos: - \"Turn On Captions\" - \"Turn On Subtitles\" - \"Show Options\" - \"Return to Episode Menu\" I really think that these commands should work. They don't seem too difficult or outrageous for a smart TV device to know. Hence, only 3 stars.",

The TV would turn on every time but the soundbar would only turn on after I asked multiple times. I called customer support and some adjustments were made, which fix it for a day but the next day I was back to asking numerous times. This was a deal breaker for me, so I sent it back. I will say that once the soundbar was on Alexa did her job of muting and turning volume up or down, but that is pointless if she cannot consistently turn it on.",

Would recommend this for everyone. - Also, with the additional features coming soon it will allow for even more flexibility and independence",

      "text": "A little disappointed since i am a huge echo fan. I have 3 dots, 1 echo show, 1 echo spot and 2 original echo towers. I purchased the fire cube to upgrade my fire stick and when my volume on my tv is up alexa has problems hearing me. This defeats the purpose to lower the volume by voice. I know this product just came out and i will be patient but its annoying. Also the blue light looks like it got dim its not as bright as it was when i set it up. I will continue to be dedicated to amazons echo products because i believe they are far superior than their competitors.",
