My experience parallels that of another user who wrote that this product has a different impact on skin when used in a humid environment than when used in a dry environment. Having now used it in a mid-western state with high humidity, my experience was entirely different from using it in a desert environment. My conclusion is that its effectiveness seems increased in humid conditions...so customers living in an environment with low humidity should consider looking for help from other products.",

I dont want to throw it so I will mix it with moisturizing cream .. just in case it has some king of benefit and just not working for my dry skin type.",
