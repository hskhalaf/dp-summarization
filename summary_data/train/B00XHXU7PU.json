Works excellent, I am sorry for my first bad review. Totally worth the purchase.",

I\u2019d cut it 1/4 inch bigger than measurement. What\u2019s great is that you can\u2019t screw up when hanging it on the window. It\u2019s just water so you could redo it 20 times and it\u2019d be fine. Make sure you don\u2019t cut it too small though. That\u2019s about the only way to screw it up. Just cut it a little big and use a razor and a putty knife to cut it perfectly. I just got done with the transom in the picture shown.",

I then turned the paper over, laid the film on top with backing facing up, traced the shape onto the back of the film, then cut it out. Perfect fit for each piece!

Sprayed lots of soapy water on the window, then applied the film and used a window squishy combined with a credit card to get rid of all air bubbles. Only have a few bubbles that I missed. But honestly I blame that on the fact that I did it in the evening time in the dark and not on the product. Otherwise a perfect result.",

Its definitely not a simple install (I had to perfectly measure, make a stencil, mark the material with pen, use a cutting board and exacto knife very meticulously, then try to place perfectly). Takes a little time and effort but looks great! Fyi there is no adhesive on this product. Fill a spray bottle w water and GO TO TOWN. Seriously, i soaked the 4 little windows and it still dried up when applying. All in all couldn\u2019t be happier (hopefully it stays like that). Both side look great and diffuse human and object silhouettes.",

Use a fresh new razor blade 3. Trim to a slightly larger size than needed, then trim to fit 4. Use lots of water and slide to fit",
