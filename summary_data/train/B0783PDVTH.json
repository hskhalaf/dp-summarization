Assembly wasn't complicated at all but did take time as assembly always does. the only problem I ran into was with the wooden pegs since, as I've always found with them, if they are not shoved in alllll the way they can cause the boards to not line up quite right so you really have to jam it in (manually-no tools or you will destroy the board). Also important to not twist in the cam locks in the order depicted in the instructions. I was worried but all my sides lined up neatly with no gaps! Totally worth the price, super happy.",

I have to completely disagree. They definitely took a little time to assemble, but everything fit just the way it was supposed to. I understand what people meant about them not fitting perfectly together. They just need a little extra push (mallet or hammer with a towel barrier) to knock the pieces into place, but once they fit, they fit perfectly. Don't tighten the screws until they're in place!!

It's almost like they didn't use enough glue in the process of making the material. While putting one of the dowels in I pushed it straight through the other side, using just my thumb. It knocked out a big piece of laminate and I noticed how flaky and soft the material was. We ended up just taking it apart and sending it back because I couldn't fix the hole. Again, if you're careful, and you really like the look, it's fine. Just know what you're getting is very cheaply made. For the quality, they're overpriced in my opinion.",

Got all the pieces together and the very last screw will not thread in due to a manufacturing defect. I cannot finish putting it together and now have to take apart to ship back. I\u2019m super upset because we both really loved this product and I was planing on adding more pieces from the line to her room and my sons. We live over an hour away from any town that has furniture so I was stocked when we fell in love with something online. Shipping was super fast and product is beautiful, just can\u2019t finish it.",
