Visually speaking, I love these things, they\u2019re my ideal shade of blue, and they\u2019re infinitely more attractive then the awful textured wall paint you seem to find in every apartment. I\u2019m probably going to buy more of these just for aesthetic reasons. You can\u2019t really beat the price for these things either, they\u2019re only 1\u201d thick, but if you\u2019re like me and just trying cover as much surface area as possible on a budget, these are a great and visually appealing option",
