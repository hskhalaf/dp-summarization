It is also not an aesthetic failure. For its $140 price tag, it performs incredibly well. Buyers are hoping that when future signature releases, specifically the D Rose 10, it will be as good as 7th model.",

        "For most buyers, these Adidas shoes look good not only on the court but also off it",

On the heels there are these thin white cloth hoops, I suppose for hanging or pulling on when taking on and off. But they are so thin II feel like they'll rip right off, and one is slightly bigger than the other. I think the shoe looks amazing without them, and I'm not sure why they decided to add it. I plan to cut them off with a razor blade. Also, the shoe is fairly narrow. The length and size fits good, but the width is a little tight. They sure do look nice though. Will be great for b-ball.",
