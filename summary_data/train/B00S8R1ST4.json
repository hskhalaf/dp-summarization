Great for fixing random stuff, or just playing around welding random stuff. The 035 wire is great for this and feeds pretty well. If you need a deep weld, this thing set to 10 will easily weld the 1/4 inch steel they say it will.",

Never opened the manual. Purchased some Forney consumables with M6 threads and work fine. Have a 10lb spoil of flux, easy feed, runs great. The torch it comes with looks and feels of high quality, which was my deciding factor between Lotos and Lincoln. The stock torch for a similar level Lincoln looked like it could fall apart at any minute. Great to use on lighter gauge steel, I will still probably use my arc welder for the thick stuff. The MIG is much more fun to use. Thanks LOTOS!",

It's a workhorse, and has lasted over a year without even a hiccup. The only thing I had a problem with was feeding the wire into the actual lining when loading new wire. I had to unscrew the lead, bring the wire through and manually insert it into the lead, then reconnect the lead. This is not a big deal at all, just a note. I've used other more expensive brands without being impressed by them as much as I am with this one. Enjoy it!",
