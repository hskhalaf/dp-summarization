      "text": "I do a lot of walking and have lugged about heavy, professional Nikon full frame dslr's. I needed a lighter, more compact camera and this model fits the bill perfectly. The picture quality easily matches that of my 'professional' cameras. It may not be as robust as my other cameras, but I don't tend to misuse my cameras. Having said that, this camera, although very light, feels extremely well made and was an absolute bargain.",
