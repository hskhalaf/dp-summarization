I managed to get the thing open enough to clear the drive and reinstall the belt but the brush is not as strong as original and must have stretched. It slips and the brush stops turning with just a small amount of pressure/resistance. It is very, very hard to self-replace the belt, and they tell you that you have to return the unit if the belt breaks. WHY CAN'T SOMEONE ACTUALLY MAKE A GOOD PET HAIR REMOVAL HAND VACUUM???!!! This is the second kind I have tried.",

I tried to contact Eureka but their main email listed on their website it's not working. I then emailed their Parts Dept., they said they can't help with my issue. This vacuum is a fire hazard!",

Apparently the warranty is not good from the date of purchase, but from the date they put the serial number on it. Neat trick: make them, put them on the shelf for months, sell them when the warranty is no longer good. Word to the wise on this one.",

I tried to replace the belt, which was very difficult. And the bar still does not rotate. I believe the motor may have gotten damaged when I tried to reassemble the thing. Now I cannot return it, and it is useless.",

I ordered this and when it came in 2 days later I re-did the stairs and could not believe how much it picked up. Much more suction than my old model. Two nice features are the ability to do the riser of the step without being a contortionist and having the hose to do crevices in couch cushions. Very happy with this product.",

One, the cord doesn't stay on the cord wrap - unless you are able to attach the plug to one of the first wraps it will easily loosen and loop off. Two, hair works its way in to an inner bearing which causes the brush-roll not to spin.

It has a decent length power cord as well and stores compactly. There are options for vacuum with or without spinning brush, and there are two options for adjusting where the vacuum opening is - on the bottom or at the front (again, great for stairs).",

The hose cannot be removed from the body, and the clog is near the macaroni bend, so it cannot be unclogged. Turn it, pull it, twist it, doesn't matter--the hose ain't coming off. This is an unacceptable design flaw for a vacuum. It boggles the mind that this cleared R&D for approval.",

I could only do one flight of stairs before it overheated. Also you have to keep checking to make sure the hose is connected. But all in all, it works for the purpose that I bought it.",

I suggest reverse vacuuming the dust filter with another vacuum (if you have one) to keep it from clogging. Note, if you want a light weight vacuum for whole-house floor cleaning, this is not the one (unless you like moving around on your knees).",

      "text": "This thing is simply amazing. I rent a single room, so having a full size vacuum cleaner isnt really the practical choice. This seems to be as strong as any normal vacuum yet it's handheld. It can do anything a regular vacuum can do, with the minor problem of bending over a little bit, but i just simply kneel every couple feet so it's not really an issue. Capacity is great and can easily handle several vacuuming sessions without emptying. The cord is nice and long so I dont need to change outlets at all.",

Got tired of the first one, and its filter was probably done, so got the same one to replace it, because its perfect! - powerful - small and handy - easy to use - easy to clean (although, one should regularly clean the brushes of any tangled hairs, etc. - perhaps after every 4-5 uses - will make the product last much longer) - long enough cable - ok noise pollution, its not quite but manageable - long lasting, sturdy and durable guess one downside is that you cannot wash the filter.. but one can use some sort of bristles or brush to clean that periodically",

I really like the attached hose feature to get under the radiators and use on stairs. I use my large upright mainly for carpeted stairs but this is great to get in the corners of stairs too.

In contrast, this Eureka has a cord and plugs in directly to either shore power or to our boat's small inverter (the truth is, we only clean up when we get back to the dock).
