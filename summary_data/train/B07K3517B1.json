I got the 3x based on the measurements, it is snug around the gut, if you are a true 3x this will probably not fit. Jacket construction is solid and it seems like a quality product. Packaging was very professional and instructions were clear. Seller is awesome, a true professional who values customer satisfaction, it is not often I get a real email from a vendor, usually it is a standard form thanking you for your purchase, ITIEBO is a company I will use in the future.",

The hood is snug and can be adjusted to fit a hat underneath. The heating element works well so far (he has had it 10 days). The only downside is the instructions were not written in clear English, but easy to figure out anyway. He would highly recommend this jacket. My husband is 70 and uses it to go running and long walks with his beloved dog in cold Michigan weather.",
