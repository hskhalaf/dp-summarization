      "text": "Been playing this guitar everyday for the last year and 1/2 or so and have loved every moment with it. Survived many a hike and has taken on a warm tone. Really love this guitar and its pure utility. I don't have much to compare it to, but the intonation is great and the strings have died back into a really warm sound. It has been dropped and had all manner of crayons and food shoved into by my kids. It also helped me survive my way through a cattail marsh. I hope our fellow people making these guitars in Indonesia are getting payed a fair wage. I love this guitar.",

My fingers and hands are stressing but its a good stress. Great guitar, beautiful. Highly recommend a strong stand. No pick came with this one, so be aware. I do not care because I wanna use my fingers, not a pick.",

      "text": "For the price, this is a good beginner's bundler. I like the accessories. Early on, my beginning learner broke a string, so it was handy to have spare strings included. Also, the tuner is a nifty little item (wish I had that when I was learning). The gig bag is unpadded, and the guitar sustained a few nicks right off the bat, so I upgraded to a padded bag with backpack handles. That system works MUCH better. The guitar itself has so far been adequate for my beginner 12 year old. I'm happy with the purchase.",
