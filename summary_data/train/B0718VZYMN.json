Flexible silicone makes it easy to turn over baking \"pan\" and pop the stubborn donut out if it's sticking. Soaked to get rid of baked on batter, wiped clean. I placed these on a baking sheet because they are flimsy and are hard to put into the oven and take out because of the flexible nature of the silicone.",
