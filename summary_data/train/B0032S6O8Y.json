If you have that configuration and don't want to make plumbing changes, purchase one of the update kits that does not include a tub spout and then purchase the appropriate spout separately.",

Apparently Delta had changed their mounting style at some point (the older style uses a thicker diameter mount which was sweated on to the piping). This required me to cut the old mount off with a hacksaw, and sand the pipe down to fit the new style mount. Delta should include some kind of adapter instead. But otherwise, I highly recommend this kit, especially if you have the newer style spout mount already - within an hour you'll have an amazing bathroom transformation!!!",

If you stand underneath the shower head, it's a drenching \"waterfall\", but there is no wide cone spread with high-pressure like my former Delta shower head. Overall, nice looking product, good price on Amazon, hubby loves it, I like it, but I can also see how others may be disappointed with its performance.",

Definitely advise you get the valve that goes with it as unless you have installed a second tier Delta product recently you are going to need to open up the wall and put in the new valve.",
