I wanted a DIY unit (no electricians involved or hanging wires or timer leading to nowhere if I took it down) and more floor space. If you screw it into the studs, only another screwdriver will take it down. It's solid! The on/off button at the bottom lights up when the towel warmer is heating. I just broke down and bought a plug-in programmable timer, so if we keep on schedule, the towels will be warm.",

Plus, there are no measurements provided or an installation template like you'd get with a Delta towel rack for example. Not a big deal but you have to measure the holes in the threaded pieces on the towel rack center to center and top to bottom to get the mounting pieces to fit exactly where they need to be installed. Just carefully measure and level where the holes in the wall should be and you'll be ok. Works great though.",
