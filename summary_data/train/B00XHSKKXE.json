Nice selection of stuff for a reasonable price and allowed them to be ultra creative between the tripod, water float, long selfie stick, and arm, body and head mounts they got a bunch of different shots and had a lot of fun. Everything works with standard gopro connectors so it is easy to attach and remove. Comes with some sticky pads as well so you can put some mounts in semi permanent locations (maybe above the basketball hoop this spring).",

The pieces that I have used seem really sturdy and dependable so over all I am very happy with my purchase.

The three legged flexible mount is kind of flimsy, especially at the camera connection and was not very reliable for time-lapses due to susceptibility to wind. The extended handle works fine even if it's a little cheap and the float mount is pretty much a must have if you're bringing your GoPro into anything besides a pool. Not everything in here is really well made but for the price, you're offered a wide variety of choices you aren't too worried about breaking. This is a great deal for a package.",

The selfie stick is flimsy, the wrist straps on some items seem like they'll bus;, just not worth the risk on a GoPro. I would definitely recommend this for cameras that are under $50, but not for $300 cameras.

      "text": "So many parts for such a small price! Seems like every conceivable accessory you will ever need is in this pack. Haven't even begun to use everything, and I can't see ever needing anything not in this pack as a occasional user of a goPro. May not satisfy a vlogger or super sporty goPro user, but for us everyday folks it's a great buy.",

With a little digging, I'm sure I'll figure it out, it just would have been nice. I'd recommend this to anyone who just wants to mess around with their GoPro and doesn't have the means to purchase the \"serious\" gear.",

The only issue I have is that my GoPro brand quick release buckles do not fit in the suction mount, chest mount or anything requiring the quick release buckle.",

The suction cup also stuck to my car's sheet metal, but I was able to remove it without flipping the release tab. For the most part, this is a decent accessory kit (especially) considering the price, but I would buy the official GoPro suction cup mount as well if you'd like to utilize suction cup mounts.",
