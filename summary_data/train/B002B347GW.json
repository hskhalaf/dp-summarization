These headphones break like nobody's business. Either one headphone goes out and ceases to work, or they both go out. I have literally had twenty-five pairs of these headphones over the last four years, so do the math. Some only last for a few weeks, some come broken out of the package, and a few I've managed to eke out some performance over a couple of months. This is a toxic relationship I have with these headphones and I have to give it up.",
