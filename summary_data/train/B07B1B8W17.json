      "text": "When it works, it words fine. No problem accessing the camera in real time. The problem is that often it - or, really, the servers on the Tend website - fail to record events for long stretches of time. Look at the picture I attached. These were the recorded videos of my family room on Thanksgiving day, when it was full of activity all day long. After 10am no recordings for the entire day. These recording failures are common. It useless to have a security camera that can't be relied on to record events.",

Very easy install and app setup. 4. The product guide is very easy to understand and has good instruction pictures. 5. The two year defect return warranty is more that fair. A couple of things we would like changed: 1. More camera color options to choose from would be nice. 2. Not sure if possible but if it could run on a long life battery too that would give more location installation options. Overall a very good buy, can't go wrong by buying this camera.",
