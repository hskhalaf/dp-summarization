One person does a crunch with the ball and throws it to the other partner, They throw it back for another crunch. My sadistic trainer loves this exercise and interestingly enough, it's very effective so I love it too. Now back to the bosu ball - it is a tad bit smaller than the ones you see at the gym but I find it perfect for home use. The perky pink color is the icing on the cake. :o)",

I resorted to my electric air pump! The Bosu did rise with air..but mine does not inflate all the way as instructions state it should. It inflates with little air rising only to 5\". Instructions say inflate to 7\" mine won't budge anymore than barely 5\" TRUELY disappointed !! RETURNING",

I was able to use an electric tire inflator, because my inflator had the appropriate nozzle adaptor. Otherwise I am not sure how it could have been inflated.
