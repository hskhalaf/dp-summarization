The one I received was packaged in a small box with styrofoam. The KB does have a flat/stable base, with a sticker that reads \u201cMade in China\u201d. I can comfortably grip the handle with both hands. It is smooth throughout and I did not have any issues with any odor. All in all, I am happy with this purchase- I will definitely update later if I run into any issues :)",

I searched all over the place for reasonably priced KBs that don't have the CA Prop 65 cancer warning, and it was hard to find one! This one doesn't have the warning, so I'm hoping that means it doesn't have toxic chemicals. Very pleased with these!",

Anyway, it is defective and unusable. On top of it I can't return it because the return shipping is more than the kettlebell is worth!

If that's what you're looking for, I recommend it. Adults will usually want kettlebells in the 20-35lbs range.

It has a very nice to hold handle, it isn't lopsided/uneven on any side, the texture is very smooth all around, and the color is very nice. This feels rock solid, pun intended, and a fantastic value. Edit: After a couple weeks of use, I've noticed that the black coloring of the kettle bell is starting to wear off all over the place. If you're unfortunate, then it will stain whatever it rubbed off onto but it can be cleaned off with little effort. Dropping this review to 4/5 stars for this as the value is still fantastic.",
