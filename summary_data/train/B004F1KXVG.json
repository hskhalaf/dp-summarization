The RCA ports are poorly installed and cheap quality. Both of the chairs' RCA ports fall out almost every time when disconnecting them.",

I can't rate the speakers on the chair, because I didn't really buy it for that feature. I may mess with them in the future, but as of now it's not something I'll be using because of my surround sound and Turtle Beach headset.",

Wouldve given 5 stars if there was a power adapter provided alongside the wireless transmitter. I had to buy them separately. It has a dc supply through aaa batteries too but the batteries Wont even last for 3 days.",

If you are plugging directly into the chair, make sure wireless is OFF. Recommend the wireless as it is fewer cords going to the chair to get tangled up with.",
