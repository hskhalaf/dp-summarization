While they do use preservatives, they don't have the additional \"human health food\" junk in it that causes too much fiber in a cats diet. Too much fiber = messy or sloopy poop. Everyone has nice firm poop on this food. They have great coats, energy and do well! Until the pet food manufacturers get out of blueberries, carrots, cranberries, peas, etc. for their food ingredients, Iams will be one of my primary foods. It's stood the test of time very well.",
