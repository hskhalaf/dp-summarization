      "text": "I just got these today. I'm listening to some awesome \"Yellowcard\" right now. I just love these headphones. They fit over my ears very nicely. I think they're very light weight and comfortable. They sound is just fantastic. The music sounds rich and full. I get great bass tones which I love. I can wear these for extended listening as they don't pinch my head. They look really cool too. I can't speak for the phone function. I got them for my laptop which has the crappiest speakers you could ever almost hear when turned up full. I'd say grab a pair before it's to late.",

      "text": "Very good. Better than good considering the price. I also own jvc ha sz1000s and these are much better. Clean at insane volume with way better bass. Better than the 1000s at any volume level. Put a fiio e12 on these and you won't find a better headphone that can do what these can, period. If you listen to demanding classical these will also do a good job of reproducing full orchestral works while still having nuance. Jazz? They can do that too. Closed back design so buy these AND some sennheissers or hifiman planars if you want it all. Bang for the buck champs!",

The bass is just ok my beats mixr do better in this category (using galaxy s3 as mp3 source). But that's with out a headphone amp I think these definitely need one to bring out the full bass potential because the impedance is fairly high to medium (46 ohm). You can pick a cheap one up on amazon for $27.99 it's called a fiio e6. Fairly good for the price and will bring the quailty of bass and sound up.",

I showed a friend at school who likes beats and he admitted they were possibly better than beats, I recommend this to all My fellow metal/techno/Rap listners",

I was expecting a lot, specially heavy bass, and I got disappointed.
