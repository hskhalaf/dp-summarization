The tubes are rather small, and I went through two full tubes of white on my painting, but I suppose that is to be expected. For the price, you can't beat what you get. I'm so glad that I purchased these to try oils with. I am going to keep stocking this for when I try new techniques and such. It is a great selection of oils!!",

Here is how i would rate overall: Quality : Very Good Quantity: It is okie i believe, but yes wont mind if it would have been few ml more. Packing: Very nice and compact. Recommendation: Yes i do recommend this product. Note: If you are going to use these oil colors, you will need some thinner to work with these. So consider ordering turpentine oil or linseed oil. I did not order it initially and end up ordering at more price. It would be nice if you get combo somewhere. Thanks DV",

Three or four tubes of white in place of peach or other colors that I could have mixed on the pallet would have been a better value. It seems to me that were too many obscure colors that took up space. If you want to do a \u201cone off\u201d painting. This seems like a decent value.",

But the consistency is for someone who is not looking for super-expensive paints and is starting out as a beginning painter. Overall I would definitely recommend these paints for students or for casual painters.",
