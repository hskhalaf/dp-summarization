It is very padded and very warm-- It is true to size-- and my daughter said \"it looks very cool\", but the coach called them 'different' so perhaps they may not be the first choice from that perspective.",

      "text": "As I first time skater and one with ankle problems ,these skates gave me the stability and comfort to go out on the ice. As for what happened when I went out, it wasn't the skates that caused me to fall, and not gracefully on my knees. Well it could have been the skates ... I had no problem the first 10 minutes and then I got too brave and tried to keep up with a seasoned skater. A hockey player , who had no toe pick on the front of his skates. Trying to imitate him, down I went.",
