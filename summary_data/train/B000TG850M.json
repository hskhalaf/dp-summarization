      "text": "This conditioner REALLY hydrates hair! I am placing 3 stars because it altered the color of my highlights. My polar blonde highlights went terribly brassy with this product, I was very disappointed because besides that, it works super well, it does what it says. I have tried many different hydrating conditioners containing oils (argan oil, coconut oil, macadamia nut oil,...) because oils are definitely effective hydrating agents. When used at maximum strength (in a mask for example) the results are fabulous, my hair becomes silky and full of body, but the counterpart is that they naturally oxidize hair and therefore create awful brassy tones in blonde highlights.",

      "text": "This works fine but the bottle is not very ergonomic, so it can be difficult to use. You can't turn the bottle upside down and leave it sitting that way so you can get the last bit out when it gets close to empty. Also the plastic is not very flexible. I have some fairly minor arthritis in my hands and really have difficulty squeezing the bottle hard enough. I don't have a problem with other shampoo/conditioner bottles. When combined with the fact that you can't leave the bottle sitting upside down, a lot is going to waste.",

Some leave my hair a little greasy, which simply serves as a staunch reminder of my mortality. This conditioner leaves my hair smooth and healthy, and I love the scent. Unfortunately, it does nothing to fill the hole I fear I'll always have in my heart, the empty void that can't be filled by anything purchasable. Perhaps one day I will find a hair product that makes me feel whole, but for now I'll make do with a conditioner that makes my hair look and smell good.",
