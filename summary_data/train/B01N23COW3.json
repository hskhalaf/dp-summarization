There\u2019s no excuse not to take the plunge from merely buying cookbooks (not judging!) to actually using them! There are lots of gadgets out there to help in creating exquisite sushi! This is a very sweet, well-made little gizmo that shapes the sushi rice so you can dust them with poppy seeds, or lay a very nice nice piece of fresh salmon across the top. It is attractively made from natural wood. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Rice doesn\u2019t stick. Thanks to Amazon for books like: The Japanese Kitchen, Momofuko and Washoku.",

Maybe grande version is better which I was hoping to get but as I wrote it was impossible to tell which one you buy from The description. I did one roll, and after took out my old bamboo may to finish making the rest of sushi. I can\u2019t see any child be able to handle this tool.",
