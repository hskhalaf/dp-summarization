Yes, it is a remake of FC3, but so much added and done well that you will think of it as a new game where, for the most part, the failings of 1,2 and 3 have been corrected. The addition of the single person helicopter is by far the best addition to a mode of transportation that could they could have done. Fun, fun, fun!",

The only downside ,(if you can call it that), is the recycled story line. However, if your playing a FarCry game you should expect the FarCry story line! If you hate first person shooters, I recommend you purchase this game solely for the amazing scenery. I have the PC version so perhaps our experiences may vary. Get this game, you won't regret it.",

I have to say that as with Far Cry 3, I don't care for the trippy, drug induced moments in this game. Kind of annoying to me and not so much fun.

      "text": "Mechanically it's an improvement in pretty much every way on 3. I like Pagan Min as a villain, but felt that the storyline felt...rushed and thin,, not giving things proper time to develop. Not bad, just maybe needed more fleshing out. It's a pretty good way to spend 30-40 hours, I enjoyed it and will probably play it again sometime.",
