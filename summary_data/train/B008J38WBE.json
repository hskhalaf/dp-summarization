I've now tried 4 different fin sizes, 2 of which are the Pluma. I wear a women's 5 and a men's 3, so I ordered a 2.5-3.5 in this fin. My feet are 8.5\" long and 3.5\" wide at bunion (pretty standard size 5). These are at least a size too big and my foot walks right out of them. The fins themselves seem like good ones, but I can't give Cressi 5 stars when their sizing is erratic and difficult to decipher.",

I'm going to try the cressi Lycra socks and see if they fill that little space and maybe give me some protection from blisters from long snorkeling adventures. The fins performed great in the water and are easy to kick with. I can move pretty fast with these and they have good control. Definitely a quality item and made in Italy.",

They appear to be well made, and are actually made in Italy. The fins are black and have flecks of silver - they are good looking. I'm about to head to the Carribbean for 10 days so I will be using them extensively. Once I return I will update this review with how they performed. My only complaint, and it's petty considering the price point/quality is that you do need to purchase a bag to carry them in.",
