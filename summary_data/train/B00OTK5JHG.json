      "text": "#1: The polisher does not come with a backing plate. You will need to order one. #2: It does come with tools and an extra set of brushes for the motor. #3: It uses a soft start feature so it will start slowly. This happens every time you let off the trigger. Even if just for a second, so you will need to expect this and re train yourself if you are a trigger puller.",

We had to dive and go get it, we ended up frankensteining the two units together to get the job done and then ended up sending both units back. I would never buy this product again.",

I used it again this past weekend and all it does is vibrate and will not rotate. It also shuts off after ten minutes of use. After twenty minutes of cooling off it runs again for only ten minutes and shuts off. The vibration on this polisher is terrible. It will somewhat rotate if I lift it off the paint. Even just resting the machine on the vehicle without any pressure the polisher will not rotate, it just stops. It was very easy to use when it worked the first time.",

They soak up wax and are basically trash after a couple of uses. The old larger pads were much much better, giving me monthly usage for almost two years out of each pad (ylw, mrn, and blk). The best thing about this is the locking trigger button. Get the older model, it's much better.",
