I've been adding a capful of Costco Mouthrinse to my Waterpik for years with no issues, so I'm going to ignore this advice. Secondly the handle is held in place magnetically, so don't try to push it down into the guide ears. Just keep the flat side against the device and the magnet will pull it up into place.",

In addition, it superseded my expectations of removing the access food out of your braces and brackets that couldn't get caught just by regular brushing. I would recommend this product.",

My daughter has braces and an expander and this comes in handy not only to keep her teeth clean while she has the braces but to catch the stuck food pieces and help her not have to stick scrapers in her mouth. The different adjustable pieces that it comes with help too. From the tongue scraper to the different size tubes to help get at the gums and in between teeth. It does squirt water all over the place but so does the dentist or hygienist when they clean your teeth. It is easy to use and easy to clean up. Great Product.",
