My son saved up his allowance for a month to buy this, it came in the mail on Friday, he played with it for about an hour before dinner, then after dinner he took it out to fly it again, and in mid-flight it went down and now no longer flies. It still powers on, the rotors still turn, but now it makes a high-pitched grinding sound as if the mechanism is encountering some resistance in rotation, and it does not lift off. Poor kid. A month of patience for less than one evening of playing with this shockingly bad toy.",

The control scheme is totally open loop, so you have to control everything (what I mean is for example the vertical control changes the rotational speed of the rotor, not the height of the chopper). Not recommended for kids due to the control nature (my kids are 8 and 5 and they have no chance). Pretty durable, I've crashed it many times accidentally and it still lives. IR control works just fine indoors. Susceptible to any minor indoor breezes, which makes it tricky in hallways or near doors. Really just surprised how well this thing works for the price,",

Still for a couple minutes of fun worth the $20. Spare parts are listed in the manual and very popular on eBay for as low as $1. Their website (Syma) has spare parts for cheap too.

The blades are super flexible, it has taken many collisions with our walls and chairs and no damage or cracks to our home or the helicopter.

I wouldn't trust it with children. The blades have hit my hands while grabbing it in mid flight. It did not hurt or draw blood, however if getting hit in the face, I would act differently.

My daughter and I have a blast with ours. They excel for beginners as they are forgiving and easily mastered, but they're great for those who aren't new to RC helicopters as well. Just not ideal for outdoors except for still nights.",

This is a hall of fame toy and the most fun you can have for less that 20 bucks:) It takes some care to keep these helicopters running but if you're careful with them, they will give you many hours of flying fun. This is the best entry level drone because it's easiest to fly 3 channels indoor. Once you master a 3 channel indoor heli, you can try your luck at a 4 channel quad. Walk before you fly, or fly indoors before you fly outdoors:)",

Also easy to learn and there is a way to adjust the trim so it doesn't spin. Cons: Slow (to me) recharge time, you have to remember to point the controller at the helicopter, and rarely the power dies and and your bird drops like a stone.

The distance you can fly it from the the transmitter is about 15'. After that it loses connection and literally shuts off and drops to the ground. The left stick is throttle only - no rudder, so your control is limited making it unnecessarily hard to fly. I do not recommend this copter. Spend a little more for a quality beginner copter is my advice. Blade brand is good.",

I even submerged it in water accidently when the switch was off and it works perfectly after being dried out.

I'm fairly certain the next time I play with it, the batteries will need to be recharged soon after playing with it.
