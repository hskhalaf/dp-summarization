A life saver to be sure. Since adding the recommended amount to my dog's food he's has gained all of his weight back , and then some, and his stools are formed and firm. This product is indeed a miracle. Thank you so much for saving my dog's life.",

So we are back to 1 teaspoon per cup of food. The tiny dosing spoon provided is ridiculous- they tell you to use a heaping scoop, but that is inexact & variable.
