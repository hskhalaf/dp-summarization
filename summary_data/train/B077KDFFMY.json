      "verdict": "A part of Keen\u2019s lifestyle footwear lineup, the Keen Elsa II Waterproof Chelsea pleased a lot of people because of its cute style. It is considered an excellent cleat for walking in the rain and light snow.Though the rounded toe box allowed for toe splaying, it was deemed too clunky-looking by others.\u00a0But overall, this sneaker was generally well-received because of the comfort it offered.",
      "pros": [
        "A majority of owners lauded the comfort offered by the Keen Elsa II Waterproof Chelsea during long periods of walking in wet and cold conditions",
        "The Chelsea style was deemed fashionable by numerous shoppers",
        "The fact that the cleat was easy to put on or remove resonated well with many wearers",
        "Plenty of users who bought their usual size claimed that it was true to size",
        "The rounded toe box offered the right amount of wiggle room for the toes, others noted",
        "The rubber outsole provided excellent traction while walking on wet surfaces, said a lot of reviewers",
        "Though the interior lining was not thick, multiple folks were satisfied with how this pair of Keen shoes kept their feet warm",
        "Several purchasers were pleased with the arch support in this model"

      "cons": [
        "A significant number of critics described the Elsa II Waterproof Chelsea from Keen as clunky",
        "According to a minority of consumers, the heel of the footwear was too wide and caused the hindfoot to slip",
        "Although it fits true to size, several testers had to return their purchase because the opening was too narrow",
        "Some buyers were not fans of the rubber outsole because it squeaked on wood or vinyl floors"

Not even really thick socks made a difference. I ordered my usual size in Keens a 9. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be any better a size smaller.",

      "text": "I've owned several pairs of Keen shoes, so I had high expectations for these booties. My expectations were met for the most part. Great color, well-made, comfortable, sturdy sole. However, these boots are really difficult to slide on the first time! Therefore, I gave them four stars rather than five. After wearing them a couple of times, they've loosened up a bit and are easier to get on. I suppose this is why zippers on boots are handy - much easier to get on and off!",
