With a hammock, underquilt and this bag, I was fine with temps well down into the lower 30\u2019s and upper 20\u2019s. The bag worked exactly as advertised. The zipper is one of the best I\u2019ve used as far as functionality goes. Top notch material and not too heavy. I\u2019m 6\u20195\u201d 235lbs and the long version was a good fit for me. The compression sack it comes with could be better but that\u2019s my only negative critique. If you\u2019re over analyzing and want a quality bag- pull the trigger.",

Marmot makes the best stuff and this bag does not disappoint. Super high quality.
