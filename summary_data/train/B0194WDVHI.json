      "text": "I\u2019ve been using the Anker PowerCore 10000 for 3 months now (July 2017). It has performed admirably. The PowerCore weighs 179g (6.3oz) & measures 9cm x 6cmx 2cm (3.5\u201d x 2.3\u201d x 0.75\u201d). There is a small button on the side of the charger that when pressed, lights up 4 LEDs to indicate the level of the charge. It charges up & charges my iPhone as well today as when I first received it. I was able to charge it when I was traveling around Japan w/out any issues as well. Overall I am very happy w/the Anker PowerCore 10000. For the price, it is well worth buying.",

This unit keeps him going for a full 6-7 days on the trail. For the 3-4 day hops he uses the smaller 10K unit. The only negative is that it takes many hours to recharge the Anker. The weight to mAh ratio on the Anker is quite good. That's important for an ultralight backpacker. The recharge time for the battery pack is not an issue because we swap Anker power bricks at resupply points (we have multiple units). Very pleased!",

The only drawbacks - you cannot put them into checked luggage, and they aren't set up to run laptops. If you don't check luggage, the first drawback is a minor inconvenience (unless you are using them as the charger in a carry-on bag with a charging port and you have to gate-check your carry-on - e.g., on a small flight). As for the second drawback, you can pay more for a charger that will run your laptop.",

The Anker is lightweight, quick to charge, and will keep a cell phone charged all day. We have two of them. When camping we charge one with a solar panel, and take the other hiking. Then switch them out the next day. So far very durable. The Anker 10000 is a great value in terms of storage capacity, weight, and price. Pros: Value, capacity Cons: Can get more storage but costs more, might be worth it for longer periods between re-charging",

Only reasonable consequence of that would be having the charger be charged for five hours but honestly, thats less time than for a laptop to go to 100% soo yeah. Highly recommend this.",

It looked like the USB inside the charger was broken. The warranty for the charger is 18 months, so I contacted the seller with my complaints. The seller was very responsive and admitted the charger was faulty based on my description alone. They sent me a replacement promptly. I didn't even have to send my old charger back.",
