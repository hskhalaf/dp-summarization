At first, it was just causing issues with the ethernet connection so that my macbook did not recognize it. Then it started causing my keyboard which is connected via usb to be disabled because of too much power being generated. Currently I have to disconnect the adapter every so often to bring the temperature down in order even make it usable. I will be replacing this product immediately.",

It worked fantastic for about a week but suddenly the network adapter stopped working altogether. I work in IT and am therefore not new to fixing issues. Everything else on the hub still works but since it no longer works for its intended purpose I\u2019m pretty disappointed. UPDATE Seller was very nice about the issue and offered replacement or full refund almost immediately. I chose to get a refund as I already purchased the Apple official USB-C Gig ethernet adapter.",

      "text": "I purchased this particular hub primarily because it included the Ethernet port. Unfortunately, unless you run power to this hub, the Ethernet port does not work (confirmed by the seller.) (And if you do run power to this hub to make the Ethernet work ... then your 15\" MacBook will go dead because there's not enough juice left to charge it, as many other reviews have said and the manufacturer agrees with.) So basically I'd need to spend another $50 minimum (third-party) to get a charger just to power this hub to make the Ethernet port work. No thanks. Great, quick response from seller, and outside of the charging/power limitations, it seems top-notch = 4 stars.",

I regularly unplugged it to cool it down because it ran too hot to feel comfortable. After about 18 months it has started to fail, and it regularly cuts out. There is a momentary disconnection of all devices throughout the day. I do wonder if this was a faulty device out of the box as it ran very hot. Unfortunately, it is out of warranty, and I will need to buy a different hub.",

So if that happens overnight, the battery is dead by morning. So overall, good for short-term use (up to a couple hours), but not for all-day use.",
