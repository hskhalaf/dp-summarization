I was skeptical reading the reviews about the product being oily and heavy - I disagree. I usually start my daily facial routine with the Mario Badescu moisturizer with spf 28. I reapply supergoop \"over my makeup\" throughout the day if I am out and about in the sun. I've used it hiking, swimming and playing tennis! I will be purchasing a second bottle. I live in San Diego so I carry this in my purse everywhere I go! \ud83d\ude06",

And works great! The scent: it smells wonderfully like a suncreen should. and the size is a generous size for a travel or your purse! I use other supergoop products and this one will be another repurchase!",

What is worse is that this is not an item you can return on Amazon.",

Cons: Like others mentioned, if it gets in your hair it makes it stiff. I thought it would be fine if I try to cover my hair with my arm but it still gets it.

The coverage is very poor, and I wouldn't trust it for UV protection because of that. Doesn't do much as a setting spray, either, but again - hard to say how it would do if it misted properly.
