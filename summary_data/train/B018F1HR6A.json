I was hoping something along the lines of a pocket knife, easy to flip open, locks open and locks closed. But this is just a hinge, nothing to keep it in place, or help it swing open. The plastic case is also flexible making it very tough to open and close. Also a little short for my liking, both in length and depth of the teeth. Updated to 1 star as they do not accept returns, makes me really disappointed as I wanted a beard comb wouldnt mind this for a mustache comb, but its just not large enough for a beard.",

For a $14 comb it feels like a dollar store piece of junk. 2 of the teeth are stuck together from a bad mold, the gold paint wore off in less than 6 hours and the joint where the the comb folds is loose. For a Kent that is supposed to be the best, I\u2019m HIGHLY disappointed. Almost makes me think this is a counterfeit it\u2019s so bad. Only thing nice is the size, just wish it had some quality materials and workmanship instead of obvious Chinese junk.",

    "description": "Size:1- PackABOUT KENT'S HANDMADE COMBS: Kent Handmade Combs for Men and Women Range are of excellent quality. Kent hand sawn combs are cut from large sheets of cellulose acetate rather than molded, producing a truly gentle comb whereas molded combs often snag and damage the hair. This material is tactile, flexible and strong. They glide effortlessly through hair without scratching to damaging the hair or scalp. Kent combs have rounded teeth which ensure a smooth and comfortable action. The range includes designs for thick and fine hair, in varying sizes, for both men and women.
