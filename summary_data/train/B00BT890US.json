As with any vest, they get hot but I was able to do a 5k with the vest (with 10lbs) and have done several hikes (yesterday 12 miles) and getting more and more comfortable wearing the vest. For crossfit, i have used it with pushups, pullups, squats, box jumps and works well and doesnt move during the WODs. Overall i would recommend and several folks at our box have purchased",

If you have any sort of neck or shoulder problem the shoulder straps are very basic with no padding. I had to modify the straps to add some padding to distribute the load so they didn't pinch my impingement and make my arms, shoulders and neck go numb.",
