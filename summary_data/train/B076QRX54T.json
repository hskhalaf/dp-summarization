This thing is so cute I want to be a kid again so I can play with it. Lol. Its eyes are huge and cute, it makes the cutest little coughing and kissing sounds ever. It coos and you can hear her heart beat. The doctor check-up part, stethoscope and thermometer my son kinda lost interest in after a couple days. But even after those things get lost, (kids always lose that stuff right away), they can still play with the monkey.",
