New one arrived within 48 hrs, included good set of name brand batteries. The click on snap is a bit sticky but I assume this will smooth out with some use. Action seems faster and more precise with the new one. Expensive mouse but it\u2019s not some piece of junk knock-off. I\u2019ve had no problem moving back and forth between the arc mouse and regular mouses (mice?) but I\u2019ve had one for years.",

My old arc mouse was slightly smaller which made it fit my hand better, this arc mouse is a bit bigger and with my palm resting on the end, the buttons were not reachable because the active part of right and left click buttons is towards the tip. This resulted in having to reposition my hand to work the mouse. My old arc mouse was also half the price of this Microsoft version. + Elegant design + Touch scroll wheel + Flat position for suitcase storage - Buttons too close to end of mouse - Price",

Another definite plus is the fact that flattening the mouse also turns it off; no more forgetting to switch off your wireless mouse. Even though this mouse looks really nice and has some great features, it is literally a pain to use. If I handle it more than an hour or so, my wrist and hand start hurting.

Unfortunately, the controls for this are hardware based, not software based, so even when you're not scrolling on screen, the mouse is still clicking in your hand. It's rather annoying and defeats the purpose of feedback. The optical performance was average at best, and I often found myself shaking or lifting the mouse to reset its position.

      "text": "I waited a few weeks before writing about the mouse. It has taken some major adjustment, and I'm still not completely comfortable with the scrolling. I've been using a notebook mouse, so the size has also taken some getting used to. That being said, it is growing on me. My favorite function is the on/off. When flattened, it slides into any pocket, and as I have the memory of a sieve, it helps me with battery life; I don't have to worry about whether or not I remembered to turn it off. However, I don't know if I would be as pleased if I had paid the full price.",

Seriously they actually think you can let this thing stick out from the side of my laptop and not get lost, oh and that magnet, again seriously, that is supposed to hold it on? I will give it a week and then probably send it back and buy a normal mouse, with bluetooth. Great mouse, works very well, still think the transceiver is stupid and it should have been bluetooth.",

The shape reduces the amount of hand motion that basic mouses require. Just remember to flatten it out after every use, or your batteries will drain...yes, you do have to snap it up to turn \"on\", and push down to flatten to turn \"off\". I would not recommend for a household with little kids because it is an attention getter, similar to how little kids HAVE to play with your cellphones once their eyes target in on it (parents and grandparents you know what I mean!)",

The design and operation is completely new from a traditional mouse so it will take a while (probably all of two hours) to get used to it. Has this cool vibrating feeling during scrolling. The double taps and double tap plus hold features are also new.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nMICROSOFT ARC TOUCH MOUSE\nA revolution in mouse design -The perfect companion for your mobile PC. PERFECTLY PORTABLE-AND AWARD-WINNING-TOUCH TECHNOLOGY\nStylish and eye-grabbing, Arc Touch Mouse is more than a pretty device. It's reliable wireless freedom plus Microsoft touch technology, on the go. Use it just about anywhere, even on a rough wood surface or carpet, thanks to BlueTrack Technology. Plus you can retain wireless control of your computer up to 30 feet away. \n\nCURVE IT FOR USE, FLATTEN FOR STORAGE\nArc Touch Mouse's innovative design allows for quick use and storage. Curve it comfortably to get started. Then smoothly glide your finger up or down the touch strip. When you're done, keep the tiny transceiver plugged into your computer's USB port, or attach it magnetically onto the underside of the mouse. Then flatten Arc Touch Mouse to turn it off, and slip it into your pocket or bag as easily as a cell phone.\n\nPRECISE VERTICAL SCROLLING BY FEEL, NOT WHEEL\nThe Touch strip on the Arc Touch Mouse responds precisely to the speed of your finger movement, using Haptic feedback (light vibration that signals scrolling speed) to scan through documents or web pages as quickly-or as cautiously-as needed, entirely by feel.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n 1. Flexible Design - Curve for comfort, flatten to pack. A perfect fit for your hand and your mobile lifestyle.\n    \n    \n 2. Power On and Off - Curve to turn on. Flatten to turn off. No button to switch. A green light flashes to show the battery is working, and then turns off to save battery life.\n    \n    \n 3. Touch to Scroll - Click. Tap. Flick. Control. Quickly brush up or down with your finger to flick into hyperfast vertical scrolling for smooth, intuitive navigation. Scroll slowly with a gentle swipe or quickly with a flick of the finger, then tap to stop.\n    \n    \n 4. BlueTrack Technology - Take advantage of BlueTrack Technology, which combines the power of optical with the precision of laser for remarkable tracking on virtually any surface.\n    \n    \n 5. Plug-and-go Nano Transceiver - Leave the Nano Transceiver (USB) plugged in when you're on the go, or stow it magnetically in the mouse.\n    \n    \n\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS\n * Flatten for ultimate portability, curve to use\n * 2-way touch scrolling for smooth, intuitive navigation\n * Works on virtually any surface with BlueTrack Technology\n *  Touch scroll tactile feedback\n * Mini transceiver (USB)\n * Design is suitable for use with either hand\n\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n * Computer/Operating System\n   Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP (excluding Windows XP 64-bit)\n * Hard Drive\n   100 MB\n * Other\n   USB only\n   2 AAA alkaline batteries required (included)\n\n\n\nFIND THE RIGHT TOUCH MOUSE FOR YOU\nFeatures Touch Mouse Wedge Touch Mouse Arc Touch Mouse Sculpt Touch Mouse Explorer Touch Mouse Wireless\nWireless freedom with a USB dongle or no dongle 2.4 GHz Bluetooth\nNo dongle needed 2.4 GHz Bluetooth\nNo dongle needed 2.4 GHz Vertical Scrolling\nScroll up and down for smooth navigation in long documents Horizontal Scrolling\nScroll left to right for smooth navigation across wide documents Multitouch\nNavigation with natural gestures Specific thumb, one, two,\nand three finger gestures\nexclusively for Windows 7\nand Windows 8 Designed for Portability\nMice designed for travel",
