The light mounted very easily and quickly and adjusts just as easily, if needed, which is pretty much never. It turns on and off with a touch, but has never turned on or off when it wasn't supposed to. I don't know how it would stand up to direct weather, because I cover my grill, but winter and spring cold and rains and such haven't caused any problems. From my experience to this point, I would certainly recommend the Grill Kindle.",

The water had gotten inside and corroded the the connections. I tried to fix it but the little cheap wires inside broke. Don't get this one or ones like it if you want one that will last.

Perhaps, moving the button to the side or changing the power method might aid this. I understand that the design promotes a more weather tolerant build, but can also lead to a lot of waste.
