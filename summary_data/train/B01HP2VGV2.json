Some sticky tape on the tops of the slats is supposed to hold mattress secure. It does not...........As soon as tape gets lint on it, no more sticky. Plan on a Surprise if you sit on edge of the mattress. I am looking for a better platform bed frame now. It will have raised edges deep enough to catch and hold the mattress in place.",

The artificial leather material is soft and pliable. The embedded bolts all lined up perfectly, and the steel frame base is very secure and strong. Excellent engineering and quality control. Headboard is sturdy and there's very little back and forth flex. I've used this frame under a heavy mattress for several weeks, and still am very pleased with the purchase.",

This bed is just fine, but you might as well throw the slats it comes with away, they're like a trampoline when you push down on them and aren't much better than cardboard. Get some 3/4\" material instead, also there were a few complaints about the legs, so you can drill an extra hole in the frame on them and add a bolt as pictured. The bed does seem pretty nice, I got a full size for my daughter and it seemed full size doesn't require the extra steps for support.",

My only complaint is the headboard had some kind of oil on it that smelled bad. I finally washed it several times with warm water and dish soap to get it out. It made my pillow case and top of my comforter smell. After several wipe downs I got it out. I suggest if you get this bed, wash the headboard first before you put it together. For the price it's a nice looking bed and I'm happy with my purchase.",

This is how it comes packages as well. Every single piece needed for the bed fits perfectly in the zippered hallowed out area in the back of the headboard. Convenient and quite thoughtful! This will make it much easier to keep track of all of the pieces if I ever need to disassemble and move the frame.",

That said, given that its slightly higher, if you don't like high beds, I wouldn't recommend a 12 inch mattress to go with this cause the bed is super high now, especially with a mattress topper.",
