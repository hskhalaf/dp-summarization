      "CONTOURED DESIGN - Fedmax's high quality skimboard is engineered perfectly to achieve the best possible glide on the beach. Each board is slightly curved at the nose which allows for longer session times and prevents the board from diving when going in deeper water.",
      "IXPE FOAM TRACTION - IXPE is a higher quality foam than EVA. EVA foam has a cross check pattern which does not create a full seal at the edge of the board, which is why so many EVA foam boards detach after 1 season. IXPE foam has a crocodile pattern which makes a full seal at the edge of the board and will last many seasons.",
      "HIGH QUALITY WOOD - Each skimboard is made using Poplar wood, a highly resilient and lightweight type of wood.",
      "PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS - Anyone can use this board to learn or perfect their moves. Stable and maneuverable thanks to the crocodile foam textured grip and light weight poplar wood, you\u2019ll be gliding around on a sandy beach with ease.",
      "90 DAY GUARANTEE - Try this skimboard for 90 days - if you don't love it, you can return it."
