    "description": "AMAZON.COM\nThis Curious George car may as well have come off a toy shelf from the 1950s. It has that sturdy, old-time quality workmanship, with carved wood in brightly painted colors of red and yellow. Plus it has the nostalgia of Curious George himself, now experiencing a well-deserved revival. The little monkey, with his gleeful, innocent smile, is driving this hot rod. Perhaps his curiosity led him to accidentally borrow it from the \"Man with the Yellow Hat.\" Or maybe he was investigating a car race when suddenly he found himself careening down the racetrack, having the time of his life. The possibilities are endless, just as this beloved storybook character and toy are timeless. --Gail Hudson\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nSee Curious George go whipping by in his fabulous wooden car with rubber wheels.",
