In this compression bag, I can get it down to about 9\" x 10.5\"/11\". That's a ton of space gained. Well worth the money and surprised it's so affordable considering it's from an established brand with quality materials and strong stitching. I also recently got an ALPS tent and sleeping pad and have been quite impressed with this brand. Very happy with my purchase.",

The zipper isn't double-sided so my guess is this isn't what the manufacturer intended, but it works very well.",

This clipped onto my pack with ease, though it would be nice if there was a clip on both ends rather than on only one so that I could clip this on easier. It worked really well though. Now to think about replacing this sleeping bag.",

The straps seem sturdy and the sack compresses fairly well. The handle on the closed end is nice for when you're trying to unstuff your sleeping bag.",

My boyfriend had the medium size and was able to fit the same sleeping bag in there but with more effort. When determining size it's important to consider what shape will pack easier in your bag. Larger size is more round while smaller sizes are smaller in radius but relatively longer. Also important to consider sleeping bag material and how compressible the sleeping bag is. Ours were synthetic material and not the higher end down ultra-light bags so took up more space and required larger compression sacks.",
