Placed a return and received a 2nd monitor, but again had another pixel sized defect in the matte finish. Quality control seems to be a bit of an issue. Will keep this monitor though for the defect is in the very bottom center of the screen.",

The nearly 32\" makes for a nice size for gaming, but a little big for working on (at least in my opinion). What I haven't really gotten yet though is the curved screen. I do not feel more immersed in the game, nor do I see anything more than I would on a flat screen. if anything, my peripheral vision is worse. I don't know, maybe I'm old school, but I prefer the flat screen. If this happened to be 3D, maybe it would be another story.",

While the resolution/sharpness is slightly poorer (compared side by side) to a 27 inch diagonal 4K monitor the overall viewing and usage experience is better on this monitor. Color saturation in particular is better than my 4K comparison monitor and the curved surface also seems to be a plus for viewing videos. Great job BenQ",

      "text": "TL;DR If you need a monitor to serve as a high quality computer monitor and to be used for gaming and video watching the get BenQ\u2019s higher end monitors which pack more pixels. Large monitor, photos don\u2019t do justice. IMO the curve actually enhances the viewing experience. The monitor comes with a hdmi cable as well as a DisplayPort cable, allowing use with MacBooks. The screen is a matte finish, not glossy. Good as a 1080P video monitor but the 1080P resolution and pixel density make this mainly for watching movie/tv show and/or gaming monitor. It lacks enough pixels to be used as a high quality computer monitor.",
