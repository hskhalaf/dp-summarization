You have to use their app, but it allows you to estimate your charging costs based on your provider and track your charging trends. The mounting design for the plug-in version is poorly designed. I attached a picture of the provided mounting layout. You're supposed to mount the charger above the plug, with the center of the charger anchored in a stud. You cannot put an outlet in a stud! This layout is impossible to achieve. I had to install a piece of backing plywood that was secured to the studs. I suggest that you skip the plug-in version and get the hardwired one.",

We had the outlet installed before the charger arrived and the length of the cord is incredibly short so make sure you have the charger first if you need to install the electrical outlet. Additionally, the charger must be mounted on studs which further limits the location of the outlet. We\u2019ve had it several months with no issues.",
