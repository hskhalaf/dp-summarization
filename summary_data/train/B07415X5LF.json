I was a little skeptical at first as I thought it was more of a gimmick/marketing device, but what I've realized is that it make it a lot easier to massage and roll out the muscles without lying on the floor and using your body weight which makes it convenient for use at home or at the office. Just be advised that to turn it off you'll need to go through the higher settings which gave me a little shock, but it's not a problem.",

I knew about vibrating foam roller from before but didn\u2019t know there was a peanut ball shape that vibrates. The peanut shape really does massage deeply on topical areas where I have my muscle knots. I see why vibration is good because it just massages me without even moving or rolling onto my body! Rolling on it is also pretty fun. Very content with my purchase and really enjoying it! Definitely recommended!",

Use it above a cushion so that it doesnt vibrate your floor or bed.",

It was awsome for my daughter to make a massage from my neck to my back, specially lower back after my tennis game. I bring it to my office and do it for my back when I seat on my chair, putting Tractec between my back and seat back, good for long time. I recommend you after sports and sleeping with wrong position. Kids like it to do a massage with it. If you want a big favor from your kids for a good relationship, take it....",

What I also love about it is that's it's small and doesn't take up a lot of space in our apartment. It's easy to store and totally worth every penny!
