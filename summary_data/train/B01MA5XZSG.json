I only got them to replace the headset that came with my pkay station so I can talk to friends in parties while gaming but now I can actually hear everything in the game which helps a lot.

This item was great for the first five months then out of the blue the mic doesn't work anymore. It wasn't abused just normal use. Before it stopped working it was great.

I would give the actual headset 4 stars because the USB is very short and you are unable to have that lights on and have the aux into the PS4 remote. It works perfect other than not being able to utilize the cosmetics.",

So not only do we have an excellent set of headphones, we were also treated courteously and were helped quickly. Thank you Bengoo!",

With the mic down other game players can hear me breathing and I wasn't breathing heavily at all. So the mic has to be left up and ends up being rarely used. I would not recommend this item for frequent gamer that play with others online daily.",

The headphones had such good sound quality he wanted to keep them even though the mic was broken. The were built to last very heavy hard plastic.

The medallion with mute and volume wheel are convenient during use.

They don't really cancel sound unless you put the volume all the way up. The sound quality is actually pretty crisp and there isn't a echo that you would find in super cheap headphones. This is the best way you can go for 30 dollars. The mic is good, I like how it has the switch to turn it on and off. And the volume adjuster to lower the volume without moving anything on the tv or pc is a nice feature as well.",

      "text": "I was looking for a relatively cheap headset so I wouldn't have to keep using my in-ear monitors I use for playing music in my band. I found this, and thought it looked good enough to buy. When I opened it and tried it out, I was surprised by the quality and comfortable fit of this headset. The microphone also picks up my voice well. Overall, if your looking at getting a headset without spending a lot of money, this would be a good buy for you.",

One day, I plugged it in and out because it stopped working, and it never reconnected, so i bought the camo one. Within one hour the same thing happened, the wire didn't connect!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL!!!!!!",
