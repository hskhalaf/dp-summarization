Luckily when the strap broke it didn't fall overboard. You can tear the strap with your hand. It will cost more to have repaired than to just buy another. I'll probably look at other brands or I'll be replacing this every year. If you keep it out of the sun you may be okay. But you want it to be ready to use. In a cabin or drawer may take too long to get to in a emergency .",

Restuffing the line into the bag is a little more effort because it is more of a tube than a bag, but it is still a very useable product. Buy it and have it ready when you need it!!",
