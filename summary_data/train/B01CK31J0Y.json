Research showing positive results from oscillation platforms is compelling. Of course, one actually has to USE it to get results. Don't be a fitness closet person. Keep this out where you can conveniently get on it multiple times per day for 3-5 minutes of squats, toe raises, etc., done with very slow movements. Hold squats at 90 degree knee position - you will feel your muscles responding. Improves balance, too. Make sure to have a handhold within reach and/or use canes, crutches or walking sticks to aid balance if you are unsteady.",

The machine itself seems sturdy, it's noisy and it has all sorts of different vibrations, thumps, bumps and jiggles, which I guess is what it's suppose to do. I have yet to figure out how to do more than one setting, but have hopes trial and error will work.
