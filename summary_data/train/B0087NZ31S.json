Bottom Line: Using this item by itself is giving me as good a range as my old router coupled with this as an extender, if not better. (I couldn't get into some rooms in my house with just the previous router, which is why I bought this extender, but this Almond gets me into all the rooms and down the drive by itself)",

My only complaint is that the set up instructions and wizards do not tell you how to use it as a wireless access point. I'm no tech dummy, but I had to figure it out by poking around and using the forum. By the time tech support got back to me it was a snooty \"just go to settings\" reply, but I'd already figured it out. Overall an excellent product. Using it with a netgear modem/router.",

      "text": "I'm 66 years old and hardware is not my thing. But I was being plagued by neighbors stealing my bandwidth so I looked for a new device that I could operate. Setting it up was a breeze. I connected to the cable, Directtv, 3 TVs, my cell phone and my kindle all by myself!!!! I've only had occasion to contact support since then and their assistance was fast and responsive to my problem (which turned out to be a cable issue unrelated to Securifi). Highly recommend.",
