Terrible issue to have especially since it was working fine! But some sensor shuts it down!!",

I am afraid that if I dropped any part it would break. I don\u2019t care if I can get replacements. I saw this model when I was in Germany. It was not so cheaply made. Not satisfied",

The \"fixed\" machine sounded like a lawnmower, with loud rattling and vibrating. On the first cup brewed, the machine still leaked - coffee made it to the cup, but now water spilled everywhere.
