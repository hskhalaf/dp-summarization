My grandson is rough and tough. Plays hard and these trucks (dozer, crane & dump truck) passed the test. Not some plastic junk.",

I think where this truck is a bit of a letdown is in being labelled a \"steel bulldozer,\" which likely makes people think of the old Tonka trucks that were 98% steel. This is around 40% steel, so some folks might be disappointed in that. Still, even with plastic parts, this truck is durable, it's just not as tough as the old models. Given the construction of the truck, I think it probably should be 10 to 15 bucks cheaper to be considered a great deal. Still, as is, it's not a bad one.",
