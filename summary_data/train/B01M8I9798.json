    "description": "This extraordinary product is an inexpensive and effective device to prevent injuries at the handle-side of a door. This extraordinary product is referred to by various generic names, including a door finger guard, a door pinch guard, a finger pinch guard, a finger guard for a door, a finger door guard, or a door finger protector. Sometimes these names are preceded by the word \u201cchild\u201d - e.g., child finger guard, child door guard, child door finger guard, child door finger protector, or just child door finger protection. Regardless of the name, the objective of a finger guard for door is always the same - achieving child door safety. A finger door guard (also called a door finger guard) should be installed in any area where toddlers or young children come into contact with hinged doors. A door finger protector provides protection to little fingers, and peace of mind to parents. This product fits all doors and is an inexpensive and effective device to prevent injuries at the handle-side of a door. Installation takes only 10 seconds with no tools required. The slip-on design does not use adhesive. The foam bumper toggles on and off \u2013 enabling the door to close when desired. And, there is no danger of misplacing the device because it remains with the door, even in an \"off\" position. The plastic clip will not scratch the door, and the foam bumper will not dent or mar the door frame. Simply ingenious! Child proof your home today! Other descriptive terms include: door safety for kids, baby door safety, door safety baby, door safety child, door safety devices, door safety for toddlers, door safety for baby, door safety guard, and door safety toddler.",
