It is supportive, does not give you a uniboob and is very comfortable. It certainly does not give you lift or cleavage for wearing with a dress or form-fitting top. I have found that occasionally I need to pull it up as the top rubber grip rolls down. Overall, I like it and would recommend for casual wear.",

Seemed wise to test its structural integrity before wearing it at work, or something. My 38D funbagz are well-secured & contained by this bra. The elastic around the edges felt slightly annoying at first, but after washing it on the delicate setting, it softened up a little & now I barely feel it at all. Would definitely recommend this to any boob-having person.",

This bra is wire free, stretchy, with a wonderful full \"no roll\" back. There are little gripping strips around the bra's upper seam and it really helps slow down the inevitable pull of gravity! I would rate this bra 10 on comfort, 7.5 or 8 for support, and 7.5 for coverage. I layered this bra under a bandeau and I think it's good enough to wear out also. I'm ordering 2 more. SO COMFY!",

If you're looking for a wired bra that gives more separation, try a Wacoal, but they're pricey and less comfortable. But if you want wireless, this is the only one I've found. It is a TINY bit too small in the band but honestly I don't care because it's working and I'm working on losing weight anyway. I'm going to be buying more of these.",

      "text": "I love this bra. It took me a few days to adjust to it, as it has more structure and elastic than the stretchy tube bandeaus I've been wearing. I had to stop wearing regular bras because they were hurting my shoulders so much, but I can't go braless, so these are serving to make due. They don't uplift but they hold them down without smashing them too much and the bra feels secure all day.",
