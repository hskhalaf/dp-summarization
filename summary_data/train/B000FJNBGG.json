      "text": "I know that this harness is for climbing, but as a contractor im constantly looking for products that make the job easier. This harness was bought to use as a roofing harness on a very steep barn roof, and worked perfectly. Also the harness is clearly well built, with robust buckles, extra stitching, and easily adjustable waist band and leg bands. this harness lives up to the hopes and expectations i had. I put this harness through grueling paces and it worked flawlessly. Im approximately 160lbs and 6' tall, my father however is more in the range of 200-220 and about 5'-10'' he felt very comfortable in this harness! I would recommend buying this product!",
