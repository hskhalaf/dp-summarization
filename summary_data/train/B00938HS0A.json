The Trainer (100lbs) is a decent entry level gripper for those that are already accustomed to compound lifts and anyone going past 3 plates dead lift would probably find it mildly challenging or at the very least a decent warmup. I've read many posts on forums that to avoid tendonitis you should start with a gripper level that you can comfortably do for 10-12 reps and move on from there. Great product and I will be ordering the heavier sets soon. Decent way to improve grip strength and endurance while lounging about at home.",

The Hercules will obviously never be closed by a human. Warren retired from making them back in like 2014. So, the COC No. 4 and the GHP Level 10 are the hardest grippers left that you will likely be able to find on the market. I wish I knew about the Beef Builder Warren Tetting grippers years ago.",

I can hold it closed for 20 seconds on my right side and the left arm struggles to keep it closed for more than 5 seconds. Don't listen to the bad reviews on the knurling. If you lift moderate weights without gloves the knurling is perfect. Hopefully the spring doesn't snap but if they do there is a one year warranty. Will update review if any mishaps happen.",

The final gripper is the challenge gripper, it's the one that you want to get to and you do small reps with it after the real workout is complete.

These grip trainers are awesome. Much stronger and higher quality than the ones I grew up with from stores like Big 5. My only complaint-- and it's a small one-- is that they are pretty brutal on your hands unless you've got a lot of fat or callouses. The machining is good, but the texture is just a bit aggressive so be aware of that. I will be ordering the No. 1 (140lbs) hopefully soon.",

Really good build quality, I've close it at least a thousand times and it's holding up perfectly. The grip that people say hurts, is important to keep it steady in the hand.",

      "text": "I weigh 135 lbs and I've never felt so strong watching 180lb men be unable to close the 1.5. My job involves a lot of wrist strength and even so it took me about a month of using this every day to be able to close it with both hands. Definitely recommend one of these it will give you a confidence in your strength that most people don't have watching your wrist muscles develop so quickly, just make sure you watch a video on the proper technique so you're getting the most out of it",
