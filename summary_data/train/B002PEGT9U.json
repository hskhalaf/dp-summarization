Fortunately my husband is mechanical and is able to keep repairing the tractor. As for the trailer the cheap plastic pin that connects the trailer to the tractor broke. There was nothing in the trailer so it wasn't due to having too much weight.",

I highly recommend you buy a second battery so there is always one fully charged when needed.This tractor is plenty powerful enough for my grandson. He loves second gear because he likes to go fast. The only problem we encountered were the wheels. To help them move over any terrain, my son-in-law put duct tape around the back wheels and this made a world of difference. Eventually the duct tape wore down, so he drove screws into the back wheels around the circumference and this works great and is a more permanent solution.",

I like that you can control the speeds as well b/c I don't think he would have been ready for the fast speed on day 1.

Battery was almost full by the time I had assembled the rest it was fully charged. My son absolutely loves it and worth every penny just for that. FR fender was a bit deformed but I'm sure it can be adjusted no big deal. Biggest thing I wish I had put the stickers on first. Much harder once assembled. Will update asap",

Pieces and parts broke off. Cheap plastic. Throughout use the battery life window grew shorter and shorter. They were fun while they lasted ..but at $1,000 for two...not worth it.

      "text": "This is the perfect toy for my 3 year old!! He LOVES it and spent about 6 hours on Christmas driving around our kitchen island and living room couches (there's too much snow to drive it outside). You'll need some time to assemble, but it wasn't bad. I bought the John Deere toy horn that pops into the steering wheel and he loves that too. I debated between this and the Gator and am SO glad I went with this one that has the detachable trailer. He loves it so much and loads and unloads it, attaches and detaches it it all by himself.",

He was two when he first received the gift and drove it fairly well but we restricted his speed to one until he got the hang of things. Speed two is pretty fast but he handles the turns well. The little tailgate sold it for him! It does come off with a fairly good bump but my son is riding this tractor all around the yard up and down hill. The battery lasts awhile especially since my son only drives on the lawn which is indicated as a shorter battery life than driving on a sidewalk or driveway.",
