Because of the hard plastic by the wheels, the carrier cannot squeeze to 18\". Needless to say, it was a complete disaster at the airport -- an extremely stressful day for us and the cats. Luckily we were very early to the airport and one of us had was able to run out and buy cheap replacements, otherwise we would not have been able to fly. The description says refund of flight fees for pets if rejected, but there's no contact information to get to them to claim the refund.",

When you take out the bottom two linings there was plenty of room for my cats bed as well. Definitely worth the money if you travel with a pet often or have trouble carrying their carrier. Zipper closures and pockets are a plus to ensure they can't squeeze out like with velcro and so you can store a few things.",

It\u2019s easy to move around- the spinner wheels are a really great addition and that you can pull on the ground saves your back. I have an 18 pound cat and he can really be a handful. I have no complaints about this product; it\u2019s the best.",
