The only thing i will point out and this is not a fault of the extensions, is that when you extend you forks in this manner you will lose some of the lift capability of your forklift. For example my small Cat lifts around 4800lb with the supplied forks. By adding this extension it cuts that figure down considerably. You will probably have to consult your manual or call the forklift manufacturer to get exact figures.",
