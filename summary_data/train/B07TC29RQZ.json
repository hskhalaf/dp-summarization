The middle expands to fit your body that day and snatches it in for you without it being tight. Even when wet it keeps it's shape and doesn't give you the saggy butt.

The back fits directly under my back roll lmao and my boobs are way too small for it and I have the front gaping open and the sides keep scrunching up. its ridiculously unflattering and if I wear this on a water slide my boobs are falling out for sure. I hate it and I cried for 10 minutes when I tried it on because i need a bathing suit to wear to my daughters birthday party this weekend. still mad. :(",

I carry my weight in the middle. If I wanted to bother, I could have probably had to top altered to make it about 2-3 inches shorter in length of the cup material but not worth it sadly.

I'm about 155, and the medium fit perfect around and in the chest. Very flattering. However, it was stretched length wise to the point that the thigh line was super high on me, like the 80's style high cut suits. I know the large would be too loose around, especially for my small chest. It worked fine with a pair of little shorts over it, but I wouldn't wear this alone.",
