I would recommend downloading the DJI Phantom simulator app so you can practise before you take it for it's first flight. I also bought a hard shelled back pack for this which is an absolute must, and don't forget a spare battery for maximum flying time. I would highly recommend this product, it really did exceed my expectations.",

I have Bought some Guards for the Propellers, They fitted easily, Also an extra Larger Battery for that extended flight Time. The Battery supplied did Last 20 mins or so. Overall a Quality Drone, But does take Practice, and Time to fly.",

I\u2019m an X military man and I have some experience with drones but that was a different world.

This is a perfect drone with all the good features (auto take off, follow me, return home etc...). I would definitely recommend buying an extra battery. 1 battery = 20-25mins flight dependent on how rigerously you fly it. Camera quality is brilliant.",

After around 50 emails and many hours on the phone they returned it to me still broken and actually in an even worse state than when I'd sent it (had maybe taken parts off it). Please investigate the stories of people's experience trying to get problems sorted before buying anything from DJI. Personally, I've reported them to Trading Standards.",
