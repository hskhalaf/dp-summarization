The tower is 13\" tall, but only blows air across a 2.5 inch hole. With the fan sitting on my desk, about a foot to my left, I get blowing air on my shoulder. That's it. Also, for a fan billed as a QuietSet, it's just as loud as cheaper desktop fans I've had in the past. At least those fans moved more air. Incredibly disappointing, because I own a couple of Honeywell's large tower fans and they work wonderfully well.",

I just don\u2019t understand the poor reviews, you don\u2019t want a blast of air blowing on you when sleeping but if you do buy a BIG fan. It has four settings, sleep,white noise,refresh and power cool and also oscilltates . As I say I love it and it is just what I want and need an almost didn\u2019t order it due to the reviews. Again don\u2019t listen to the reviews. I bought it thinking probably will send it back. But no chance of that, it\u2019s a keeper.",

So, the motor is so small that in order to give you some air, needs to work at its fullest and, it's noisier than the regular fans they have. So, we returned it after 24 hs.

We received a replacement and are very happy with it.. small footprint for desk, reasonable circulation.. The timer, fan speeds and oscillation are good.. operation is pretty quiet except on Power Cool level..",

My only tiny thing that would be very nice addition would be a remote, (it would be worth the extra money too). I still love it so much, I almost never have it off so really fine without the remote. Thank you for making this fan and for having it on Amazon. I will probably get another so I am never without.",

As for the noise, mine is completely silent. All you can hear is the blowing noise. Some reviews said it had a ticking or burrddd sound, but mine does not do that. I highly recommend this fan if you have a small area and need it to be cooler. It works fantastically!!",

I wanted to use it to circulate air and keep the room consistently cool throughout the night without having to keep the AC continuously running. On the highest mode, you could only feel the air if you were within 2 feet. If you put it on any other mode, the air movement was barely detectable. It is remarkably quiet as the description says, but in my opinion would only be valuable if you\u2019re looking for a fan you can leave on your desk, facing you.
