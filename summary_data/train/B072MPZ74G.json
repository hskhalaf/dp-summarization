They work as a stand alone with their internal mic, as master and slave but ultimately the best with a dmx controller and your own programmed chases. Dont worry, programming DMX is not difficult and with that you can use the moving heads to the max. Crisp colors, brightness for such a small unit is incredibly awesome, gobos are on point. If you are looking for a small LED moving head fixture then this is your best choice to get pro light effects for small money.",

What I don\u2019t like about this product is actually the \u201cgobo\u201d or different designs you can change the spot to. I thought they were kinda wonky. I might feel differently if I used it with a haze machine but I don\u2019t know at this point. I mean, it moves, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s DMX controlled and it\u2019s a good product.",
