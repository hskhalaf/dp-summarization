      "text": "Needed a toddler table and chairs in a pinch when I was having a lot of moms with their kids over my house. It got the job done, in that I had extra seating for some kids to eat their lunch at, but the table is actually too small for 4 kids to fit with plates to eat at. They would need tiny dessert plates to all fit. Also, it's very cheap plastic and scratches very easily and doesn't seem very durable. It works for the time being though, and have gotten some use out of it!",

The box was very sturdy and tough to open, which was fine by me. And it took me all of 25 seconds to assemble. I love it already and have had it less than 24 hours!! Great product. Great price.

I am constantly reminding the kids to not balance their chairs on 2 legs as I'm afraid it will crack as well as putting to much weight on the table. I want this to last for awhile as they grow so if you are as watchful as i am this product should do fine. I do like it and the price was reasonable.",
