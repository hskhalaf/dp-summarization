They also seem to go with everything. Following six months of wear the only real difference from being new is the bits of white sock stuck to the inside of them. They stay plush for years and are very hard to damage.",

Although i have noticed the soles aren't particularly flexible, so it will be interesting to see how they wear over a longer period of time (I'll try to remember to update this after a year or so to let you know). - The UK sizing is spot on. Overall I'd say they are definitely worth trying out since they're reasonably priced and well deserve a 4 Star rating (which depending how the soles wear over time, may increase to a 5 Star).",
