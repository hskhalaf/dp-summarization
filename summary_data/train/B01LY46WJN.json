Also make sure to put the spikes on the top on there before you put the roof on the car trust me. Over all this is a great little car and both my little guys love it.",

The door of the car has a lock so your little one can't open the door and fall out while riding in it. Only one side of the vehicle has a working door. The \"horn\" of the car is a squeaker sound like a dog toy. Very good quality and we love it! Ordered it Saturday afternoon and arrived Monday at 11am. Love amazon prime!

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that it took a while to assemble. And the pieces for that are associated to the same part were found in different packages, which was rather annoying. There were many packages and they all seemed to be jumbled in some unknown fashion to me....",

Cup holders are a little deep and narrow, makes it hard for child to get drink out. Also cup holders are behind him seated, so he tries to turn around while in the car to access. Car door opens on one side, not both. Door does lock so it won't swing open. Package arrived missing ignition base so there's a large home in the console. Bummer.",
