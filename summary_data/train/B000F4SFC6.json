It has a stop button, and an open and close button that if you never had may not miss, but since this was my old remote that finally stopped fully functioning after 10 years I opted to get the same one again. Plus the backlight is another missed feature from the new one.",

TOTALLY not worth the money. I only use it to turn the game unit off after watching a movie so i dont have to turn the controller back on to turn it off. Dont get it.",
