I HIGHLY recommend ordering a full size small.",

He normally wears a 10 but other reviewers said it ran a little big so i decided to get a half size down and it fits great. His feet are a little on the wider side and this pair doesn't give him any problems. Definitely worth the money if you just bowl for fun here and there. Paying $5 per shoe rental does add up!",
