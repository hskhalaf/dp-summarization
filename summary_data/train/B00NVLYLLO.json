However, the boot\u2019s lack of breathability was a turn-off, especially for trips set in warm environments. As a whole, the Ariat Skyline Mid GTX is still a pair of hiking boots that offers a set of positive qualities for every adventure.",

I've worn these on two hikes and a week at work, but it still bothers (it has gotten a little better). I'll update the review if it becomes acceptable. However there are good quality boots which are super comfortable and cheaper than these, so I unfortunately cannot recommend them. But they look so good, I want to like them!",

I never did wear them on my trip, but recently began wearing them to work during the day, hoping they would maybe \"wear in\". No such luck. It became painful to wear them, and I actually have blisters near my ankle bones, especially on both inside ankles. Waste of $160!",

Of wear it made a mark, a days work would surely be very painful. I'm sure it's just a quality control issue.",
