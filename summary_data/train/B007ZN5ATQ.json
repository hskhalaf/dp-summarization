It says there is a 2 minute timer and I think a consumer would assume there would be the quad timer built in.",

The brush does a good job with cleaning, but wow, huge design flaw. Spend a little more on one that doesn't get black mold growing in it within weeks. Bleh! Oh yeah, and the replacement heads are highway robbery. Buy generic, there's no difference outside of the price..",

I don't feel the need for a beep to tell me to move on to the next quadrant of my mouth or whatever.

Oral B replacement heads are cheaper, so over the course of a year or two the Oral B electric toothbrush will become a better cost investment. Also i find the oral B circular head to do a slightly better job of giving your mouth the clean feeling similar to a dental cleaning visit.",

I did wince at the cost of replacement heads though. I guess I will worry about that when the bristles are worn out. The manual has instructions on how to remove the batteries for disposal when they wear out. Once the batteries are shot, you have to throw the toothbrush away. On line registration gets the warranty extended to 2.5 years, so I figure it will last at least three years. Even if it fails right out of warranty, having super clean teeth would bring me back for another Sonicare toothbrush.",

But be warned, even in the beginning, it brushes quite hard. Only downfall I can think of is that you must clean between the handle and brush head frequently, if not it gets a bit grimy and filmy inside after a few brushes. But it is easily cleaned.

      "text": "This is a great toothbrush I'm sure it cleans just as well as the more expensive versions. Sonicare toothbrushes do a great job of cleaning your teeth. Before getting this toothbrush I had used other electric toothbrushes, although I thought they worked fine it was not until I got my first Sonicare that I saw a real improvement in cleaning. Before I started using Sonicare the dental assistants cleaning my teeth would ask me if I smoked(no) or if I drank a lot of coffee(yes). Now I don't hear that anymore!",

      "text": "After my Oral B toothbrush finally gave up, I went back to the old manual brushes for a while. The Oral B was pretty expensive and I didn't want to buy another one that I couldn't service with new battery in the future. The manual brush really isn't as effective though, so I bought the Sonicare unit. WOW! This thing really works! After the first use, my teeth felt like I'd just come back from the dentist. I've been so pleased that I've bought one for each member of my family.",

Seeing as Im adult and I can typically brush my teeth thoroughly enough not to need this feature, Im okay that its not there. I just didn't think the newer models wouldn't have that.",
