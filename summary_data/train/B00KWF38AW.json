What he lacks in expeditiousness he makes up in sheer pluck. No jumping here! You will need to figure out how to kill enemies and change levels all without the usual help of jumping. Choose between a first person view and a third person view. Use the game pad to twist, turn, flip, move and explore levels. If you liked the Toad levels from Super Mario 3D World, you'll love this game.",

It also makes great use of The Wii u game pad. You can use it to find extra coins and items. Also, there are levels where you are on a mining cart and you use the game pad to look at your surroundings from 360 degrees. Highly recommended!",
