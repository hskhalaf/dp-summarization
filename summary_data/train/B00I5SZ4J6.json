With great regret, I can't trust this one. I'd pay more for durability.",

It comes with a diamond sharpening stone and ferro rod and the ferro rod is spectacular but the sharpening stone should probably just be used on knives. The handle is a really comfortable fit but a little big in the middle for people with small hands and it's very blade heavy. This machete won't break and the handle won't come loose or off, but the edge will roll or get a few tiny nicks in it over time. I've had it for over half a year now and it's the first consistently working blade/machete i've ever had.",

It is definitely a tool to be very respected on the farm, hunting or fishing and camping. The grain on the edge is very fine and close together so it is good, hard steel. I tried it out on an oak stump that would dull a good chainsaw. The bark was easily busted off, for example if I needed a spark base, and I could easily chop off small bits of dry wood for tinder. My outdoorswoman friend also likes it and I'll be ordering another.",

One swing will easily cut a living branch or vine etc up to 2 inches diameter, a bit of chop work for anything higher, the sharpner is not the best but gets the job done so I bought a diamond set, and that works awesome. Highly recommended for anyone needing to do yard work, extensive like I do, of all types of work really.",

The handle is a hard material and when wet really slippery, also the metal slip guard is really uncomfortable, and when chopping a lot can and will cause a blister. Other than that a really good chopper, the sheath is decent, I really liked the fire steel that came with it, the sharpener is crap might as well toss it if you know alternative way to sharpen.",
