When the tub of ice cream is full, it works ok with the pushing motion instructed, but once you\u2019re halfway down or more you cannot get the right angle and that ice cream will not budge! I held one side and tried to push and all it did was mangle the container, squishing the sides. The ice cream was starting to soften around the edges and yet I could still not scoop it with the pushing motion. I really wanted this one to work, but for me it\u2019s beautiful but not very functional.",

This scooper works almost as advertised- I say almost because it is better than expected! If you have a modicum of dexterity, this is for you. If you don't, buy this for someone who will serve you and they'll thank you...",

I have tried at least a dozen ice cream scoops and this is by far the best I have ever used! Beautiful design, perfectly weighted, cuts through ice cream like butter. Highly recommended.
