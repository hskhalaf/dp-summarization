      "text": "I love not having to bend down to scoop up debris, and for that purpose this works really well. The bottom edge is tight enough to the floor that you don\u2019t lose much dust as you sweep it into the container. I think that it would\u2019ve been better if the product was hinged where the scoop meets the pole. It can be a little cumbersome to dump the scoop into the garbage without removing the pole from the scoop. Also, it would take up less space in the closet if it could hinge closed. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it.",

I already had a very similar dustpan that has a plastic (instead of rubber) base that I like very much and keep upstairs in my home. I was looking for the same or similar product to keep downstairs. This one works but is considerably heavier, which makes it a bit harder to handle. I much prefer this design to those that fold up - this type is much easier to empty into the trash can, but the weight of this model means you need a stronger wrist to use it. If I can find another plastic model I am going to buy that.",
