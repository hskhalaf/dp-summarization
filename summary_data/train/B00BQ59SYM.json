Looks like a lot of stuff and directions say two people can assemble in 50 minutes. It took me 50 minutes to open the boxes and just look at it. Once I started putting it together by myself with a good sized Phillips screwdriver it did not take so long. Takes two people to lift burner into place as both cookers are one big piece. Looks like a big job but very good directions, most parts numbered and hardware, screws all packaged and labeled.",

If you you less coals then it takes forever to cook. This grill is only good for burgers and links in my opinion.",

      "text": "I am really unhappy with the fact that we paid decent money for this grill and when we received it there were 5 good sized chips in the porcelain which mean there will be rust forming in those areas. We would have returned it but unfortunately we need it for this weekend, so there is no time. I am so frustrated about the condition of the grill upon arrival. The grill overall looks like it will be decent but now we are going to have to deal with rust issues sooner than usual.",

Makes a lot of noise when you move it but that is to be expected since some parts aren't bolted down like the grill plates. Came in two boxes on the same day. About 100lbs. each. Lots of Styrofoam packaging. Easy to fallow instructions. Took about 3.5 hours to put together.",

It arrived in two boxes one on a Friday the other on Tuesday (stupid I know). My grill came with a section damaged but Amazon made good on it. After hours of assembly it wasn't worth the hassle to return it for a new one. Amazon save the say in the end. My advice is know up front you wont get this all in one day..... make sure you understand there is time between deliveries.",

I was not too fond of the delivery method however. My package was separated into two separate boxes, which was fine, but each box went through a different delivery service. I would have preferred for them to go together. Other than that this grill is gorgeous and I cannot wait for my husband to see it! I have not used it yet so that is why I am giving it 4 stars.",
