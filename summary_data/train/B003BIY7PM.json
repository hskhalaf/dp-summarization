If youre over 200lbs and taller than 5\"10 I'd just suggest getting double. You can lay on it at an angle. Comparing the double to the single was what I got a chance to do, and as far as I can tell the only difference is the width. The double has lots of wide room, whereas the single you couldn't fit 2 people in unless they were sleeping hamburger style. I'd suggest getting some woopy slings or ENO straps too, unless you want to stay ultralight. Then 10ft of paracord will do the trick.",

I bought this knowing they would need to be purchased separately, but in the mean time, I attached p-cord to the carabiners with bowline knots. It works, but if you attach anything to the hammock's carabiners, it won't fit back into the bundle. Just a thought. This wasn't why I docked a star.",

      "text": "I bought this hammock for my son to take to Sea Base Boy Scout camp in Florida. Great product! Worked exactly as expected and made the camping experience fantastic as he slept under the stars on an island for a week. Only problem was some defective stitching found at end of week. Contacted seller and immediately got hammock replaced...no questions. Liked it so well that I have bought another for myself. We used Kammock Python straps and these worked great. Next purchase is to get the ENO rain tarp. A friend used this tarp on island and stayed dry on rainy nights even with some wind. ENO product is quality and worth the price.",

In order to give 5 stars, I have to use something for quite a while and absolutely know everything about this product and know it's capabilities so that's the only reason I gave it 4. It is a great hammock and I feel it's definitely worth getting the slap straps rather than using some sort of rope or cord simply for the ease of use. Might eventually get a DoubleNest simply so there's more fabric to wrap around me and more space but the SingleNest has done just fine.",
