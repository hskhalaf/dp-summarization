You HAVE to download SONOS app and create an account to use the app and configure the sound bar, otherwise it won't work.

Sound is excellent, even better when you have other sonos speakers to group in and then you have sound throughout the house. We have Gen 1 5 series and it links perfectly. Great sound, dramactically different from basic TV speakers. We are very happy, then throw in the Alexa dynamic and we are truly connnected. Very happy customer!",

This year my husband bought Roku, and everything went wrong. WE CAN NO LONGER USE THE BEAM OR SPEAKER BECAUSE YOUR SONOS PRODUCTS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE. I CAN USE THE SPEAKERS TO PLAY MUSIC PERIOD, SO CONSEQUENTLY THE SOUND IN OUR TV WITHOUT SPEAKERS IS HORRIBLE. THE ROOM IS HUGE WITH HIGH CEILINGS. WE ARE NOT RICH. I CANNOT RUSH OUT AND BUY A NEW SPEAKER SYSTEM. I THOUGHT THAT YOU SOLD A QUALITY PRODUCT BUT I GUESS NOT. BUYER BEWARE DO NOT PURCHASE THE SONAS BRAND.",

I don't need surround or a big bass speaker as those are not needed to listen to conversations. Absolutely delighted with it. Strongly recommended. BTW: it also delivers great music sound. I am not a fan of the huge bass sound that youngsters love. Besides, when u live in a condo u must be considerate of others.",

So if you have the beam and speakers in one room primarily for tv surround sound and just speakers in another room, when you\u2019d really like music from just four speakers you cannot do that. The overpowering Beam is always connected. The result is a lopsided sound where one room has too much speaker power and volume. Not at all the flexibility hype we were sold.",
