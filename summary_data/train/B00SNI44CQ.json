The lows are fantastic on these, listening to audiophile quality tunes you could actually tell a marked difference over others. I might take awhile to buy another pair given the price tag but they were truly phenomenal.",

If you are looking for fully noise cancelling they may not be the right fit. But, again, the noise cancellation is sufficient to block out most office background noise.",

Also no app support so you can't change sound profile, also there is no update since last 2 years to its firmware. Volume up & down works but skipping tracks doesn't work after 1 year so button quality is not that good. Also there is no auto off feature, so if you forgot to turn it off, it is very possible next time you will be out of juice. Following things can be improved: a) Provide app ( for equalization & updates) b) auto turn off battery. c) Better button quality for skipping tracks.",

Boy, was I disappointed. The first pair had constant static. I sent them back. The second pair had a constant interruption in the signal. I sent those back and bought a cheaper brand. Much better. Even when the Sennheisers worked, the sound quality was disappointing although I must say the noise cancelling was superior. I would not recommend unless the seller had a good return policy (which Amazon does).",

There are few quirks though that might bother you. Sitting in a bus on a bumpy road I hear rather unpleasant clicks on almost every bump.

Sometimes it will also transfer all the vibrations around you like a closing door will come thru as a dull thump. It doesn't happen all the time but when it does it's really irritating.

Good mids and highs, less power in the base region compared to other headphones of a similar quality, but I would much rather hear a song clearly than be bass blasted.",

Sound volume not controllable between input sources (e.g. going from one channel of Prime Music to another or switching from streaming TV to music). All in a great disappointment.

The only small problem is that when you try to use wire to listen instead of the Bluetooth, you have to switch Bluetooth on first and then turn it off, or else the sound only comes out from one ear",

The person I bought them for was too particular. I personally have this model and in this price range you will not find a better set of cans. I tried the Sony 1000 ( the new model ) and the new Bose and these are definitely the best by a long shot.",

Far superior to the Beats Studio (or Solo 3's) for the money. The earcups aren't as soft as on other products though, and for an over-ear the cups are surprisingly small, so if you have huge ears you may want to try these before you buy.
