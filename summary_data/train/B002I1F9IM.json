I own a Rolex that I thought at first needed to be serviced because it did not recharge when first used this Box. After spending a few hundred dollars having it serviced it still did not work. I then placed my new Rolex in the machine and it still did not work. If I were you I would spend a little more money and get something that actually works. No setting and no amount of battery changes ever got this to work for me. Don't Waste your money!!",

      "text": "This watch winder is compact, cordless, & absolutely silent. We have not had to replace the batteries in the almost two years it has been in nightly use. Recently we inquired if we could purchase a replacement cover for the watch holder as the velvet sides had come loose. Even though our purchase had been 22 months prior, we were told a replacement would be sent free of charge by mail the following day! That demonstrates outstanding service on an outstanding product, which has proved to be much superior to our previous more expensive unit. Many thanks to Cart Wheel Deals!!",

      "text": "The last winder that I tried would not turn over my gold Rolex so it wouldn't wind it. This has no problem with weight. However, I have 9\" wrist and company provided support for the watch is too small and so band will not tighten on support. I have asked for help from company...no response yet...simple to fix, just ask people to measure their wrist. I shouldn't have to jake it ...too make it work, especially since it says it is for a Rolex",
