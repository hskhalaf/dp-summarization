It came within a week from the UK. There is a conversion plug as it's got a UK plug on it but it charges and works great. Very lightweight, works on hardwood, tile and carpet without changing any settings. Would highly recommend.",

The extra handle in the middle makes doing stairs quick and easy. And it's always ready to go. Perfect for touch ups or quick cleaning and great on bare floors. Once a month I vacuum the carpet with a corded vac with more suction. The rest of the time, I use this one. Easy, lightweight, perfect.",

      "Powered brush head The Gtech AirRam features the unique AirLOC system* that effortlessly picks up large debris from the surface as you push the vacuum forwards, and locks on the backstroke to suck up embedded dust. Its powerful rotating brush bar makes it ideal for removing stubborn pet hair.",
      "Compact storage Without lots of untidy power cords the Gtech AirRam is easy to store and ready to go when you next need to start cleaning again. For added convenience, the lithium-ion battery pack can be removed for charging if you don't have a plug socket nearby.",
      "Move effortlessly from carpet to hard-floors and back again, with no settings to change",
      "Long run-time Powered by a removable 22V lithium-ion battery, the AirRam gives you up to 40 minutes run-time on one 4-hour charge, long enough to clean the average house twice. A 4-stage LED display indicates how much charge is left in the battery",
      "Easy-empty bin We have designed the Gtech AirRam dirt collection system to be easy to empty. As you clean, dirt is collected and compressed into a capsule in the head of the vacuum and is emptied with a simple slide of the ejector arm."
