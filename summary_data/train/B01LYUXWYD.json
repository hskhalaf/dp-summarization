They also do NOT have a removable valve core, which is good for me because my thread-on inflator was freezing to the cores of other tubes and unscrewing them, letting all the air out.",

A plus for some but for most it doesn't make a difference. 48mm is to the end of the core when it's installed, the same way most valves are measured. A little long for your typical aluminum rim but the only downside is aesthetics. With a valve stem on the shorter side it can be tough to get the pump head to grip at times so I am more than happy with a touch long.. I've only installed one but it worked just fine.",

I have bike tools to help, worked at a shop in college and have replaced, installed repaired & probably dozens inner tubes over the years, so I know what I am doing but these were by far the hardest and tightest to get on. I ruined one tube even using plastic (I have metal as well) tire tools for bikes though I was super careful. once installed they seem to be fine, though I only have about 120 miles on them so far.",

Don't over tighten the lock nut that go over the stem, it'll cause it to leak from the tube itself. Also be careful when threading and unthreading the fill valve. They are pretty flimsy, but fine as long as you don't crank them too much. Pros: long valve stem makes it easy to fill. The price is right. Lastly, I wouldn't pump past 80 psi. I did and one began to leak at the valve stem. I'll try for 90 next week, but they're fine for now.",
