This means carb usage is at a premium. When I looked at the advertised nutritional content, it said 1 carb, and then 1 fiber, which is really 0 carbs as the fiber cancels it out. However, when I got the container, it does NOT match what was advertised. It shows each serving as 3 carbs with 1 fiber; a net of 2 carbs. This is not extreme, but still does not match what is advertised.",

If you want to compare this head-to-head with another powder, Dynamatize IsoPURE 100 would be a similar option. Dynamatize taste better to Nature's Best but I've seen more gains with Nature's Best than the latter.",

The sweetener they use doesn\u2019t really appear initially but the chocolate comes through which is nice. I don\u2019t recommend the vanilla as it tastes like infant formula. Cons: it doesn\u2019t mix super well without a blender bottle. The packaging is not very secure because they don\u2019t put a seal under the lid, only flimsy plastic wrap you pray holds the lid on. The cost is high, hoping this protein is as high quality as it claims...",
