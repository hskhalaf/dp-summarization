My husband works out of town 4 weeks at a time, so I love having the protection I need as a woman with 4 kids at home. I personally love having the sensors on the exterior doors and having the panel notify me when the kids go in and out, or open bedroom windows and what not. The kids set the alarm off by accident a few times, and had great response time from both the Cove representatives and the police. Great customer service!!! Highly recommended!!!",
