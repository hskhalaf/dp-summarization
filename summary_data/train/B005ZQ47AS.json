The unit is the best you can find at a low price. Your tech support is the best I have encountered of all the products I've bought on line. Keep up the good work, it's nice to know some company's care about what the customer need. Pete",

Have no way to check it if correct or working right. Most of my reading are between 9 and 17. So... I ASSUME that it is working. Now, batteries. They both go in the same way or direction.

I purchased this detector to help monitor for real-time Radon levels in my home. Unfortunately, I have found it monitors ambient radiation and not specifically Radon gases. If you are looking for something to monitor Radon gases you may want to look at a product specifically for Radon in homes.",

The logic and data display portions of the unit itself seem to work OK, but it doesn't even pick up background radiation and settles at 0.00 after a couple of minutes. I'd give this one star, but it's been a couple of years since it was new, and worked fine, so I'll give it two.",

    "description": "ATTENTION: As of August 1st, 2013, Quarta-Rad upgraded RADEX 1503 to RADEX 1503 Plus. Upgraded firmware, additional features, and cost the same as RADEX 1503. Don't be fooled by online vendors selling old and unsupported RADEX 1503 model as new. When you buy RADEX 1503 online, make sure it is RADEX 1503 Plus (Radex 1503+)\n\nNow there is a better, stronger and more advanced version of our best-selling workhorse \u2013 the RD1503.\n\nEver since the introduction of the original RD1503, customers have been asking for additional functions and requested certain improvements on the existing design. We have listened and incorporated many new capabilities into RD1503+:\n\n\nNew and Improved Features of RADEX RD1503+\n\n+ Graduated change of a threshold signal in the range from 0.10 to 0.90 \u00b5Sv/h with an 0.10 \u00b5Sv/h interval (available in individual settings).\n\n+ Value of the background dose rate is saved even when the device is turned off.\n\n+ Now displays the difference of the dose rate between the averaged and background values.\n\n+ Includes vibration signal and audio alarm (both adjustable).\n\n+ Added animation of the pressed command button (the icon of the button starts blinking on the display).\n\nThis new device allows a quick and easy way to check radiation background of top soil, non-edibles and interior premises.\nThe quality of indication of any dosimeter depends primarily on the built-in detector of ionizing radiation. RADEX RD1503+ contains a low-voltage SBM20-1 type Geiger-Muller counter of beta- and gamma-radiation which is found used in professional dosimetric equipment.\nAn expert scientific tool that\u2019s made for an average Joe. \n\nQuick, Simple, and now better than ever!",
