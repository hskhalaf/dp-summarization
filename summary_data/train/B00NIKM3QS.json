Very comfortable. The sternum strap when adjusted correctly makes the bag feel like it's giving you a hug it's very comfortable. The black stripes down the face are actually a bunch of 'loops' which are great for strapping things to the outside when used with a clip. As I bought the bag this winter, I also used it a lot while snowboarding and can say that I was surprised by how water resistant it was.",

He has used multiple times on trips and grocery shopping, Its heald up great. The front can be tied together to make more aerodynamic while riding when the bag is near empty. I love this bag it's big enough to fit alot. BUT small enough I can wear it while riding passenger and not look goofy on my small 5'2 110lb frame. Highly recommended",

It does come with a neat strap that goes across the chest so it doesn't go sliding off easily. Update: had for almost two months now and still no issues. It carries a lot of weight sometimes and no tears have shown. Padding still super comfortable!",
