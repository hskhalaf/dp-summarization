Kids aged 5 to 9. have all used it successfully, and have managed to learn to do spin tricks and drift turns. Works best on a smooth concrete surface, very difficult to ride up any kind of slope. Your propel the scooter forwards by moving your hips side to side and lean to turn and there is a front brake. Very durable, even with heavy usage I have not had to change out the wheels or replace anything after 3 years.",

One issue is that the brake has too wide of a grip for him to brake properly. We live on a hill and he isn't allowed to go downhill yet, because he can't brake. He tries to squeeze it and we've adjusted the break screw, but he still can't stop the scooter.",

She loves doing flying circles and loop to loops, she keeps up with her mom who is riding a bike. It was a very good investment. She gets plenty of exercise on it.
