As a disclaimer, I am not a squash expert, but the players I have played with who know more about this than I do seem to say that the racquet is pretty good, and if you are an occasional player, it seems that you get a pretty good racquet for the price. As a con, I have broken the racquet once every year, so had to buy a new one. Either I am uncontrollably strong, or you'll have to think of introducing this possibility in your budget.",

      "text": "After investing a fortune on high end rackets for the last 10 years, and braking most of them, I decided to look for cheaper alternatives. I tried many rackets under $100 and then I found this one. I love it, classic design, excellent power, decent control, large sweet-spot and good price. This racket is 140 grams the weight is balanced but it feels a little heavy and the grip is a little thick. If you prefer light head rackets this one probably is not for you. For some reason I feel very comfortable playing with this racket. Personally I cannot tell the difference from my previous favorite racket which is 3 times more expensive than this one.",
