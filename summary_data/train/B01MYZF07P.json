These Mitts are solid enough to protect my hands from the hardest puncher on our team, light enough that I can keep up with the fastest, and soft enough that no one scrapes their knuckles hitting pads in the little MMA glovezs. I'm so happy I purchased them, and so are the folks I hold for!",

I've had these about three weeks and absolutely love them! I take them to class with me and have even used them with doing mitts with my coach and even with his hard punches they absorbed the punches nicely and still didn't come off my hands like some of the other mitts at the gym. So far I am really impressed! I do wish they were a little more compact, but for the price they're great!",

The glove opening is a bit tight with wraps but is slowly stretching and will be fine after a few more uses. The glove-well however was a surprise as they put a curved backing to allow your hand to cup over it and reduce glove-spin. Probably one of the most comfortable mitts I own. Very little hand fatigue after running a few fighters through some rounds.",

That itself has made me a fan after spending big bucks on fairtex, combat sports, Adidas, rev gear, combat corner. None of these $60+ have held up as well. Will be back for more.",

I'm not trading them for my higher end mitts, but they're a great back-up pair for home (with my kids). I also think they'd be great as entry-level pads, if you're just getting started.",
