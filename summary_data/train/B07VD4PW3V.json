It's also just an updated machine. I chose to spend a little more than in the past. The machine has been exactly what I hoped for and is outstanding. Coffee tastes great, of course.",

I still cling to the grounds brewing method. I prefer this style instead of k cups so that way I can stir in spices like ginger and turmeric into the ground pre-brew.",
