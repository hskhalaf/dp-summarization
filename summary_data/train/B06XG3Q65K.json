      "text": "Surprised I feel compelled to write a review for a chair mat, but I am so far very impressed. It\u2019s much thicker and more firm than any I\u2019ve ever had before. I\u2019m 6\u2019 250lbs and the wheels don\u2019t dent it at all. Roll is smooth, almost too smooth as sometimes I roll off. That brings me to the next point. When i do go off the edge, I can easily roll back on thanks to the thickness and firmness on the edge. It doesn\u2019t roll up or feel like it\u2019s going to break at all. Only had this for a few days so time will tell on longevity but so far I\u2019m happy.",

That's a good point, though, because once in place it STAYS in place, and by design it won't roll up along the edges. On unwrapping, the mat didn't smell, as these products tend to do. Although the nubs/grippers on the bottom are quite sharp -- you should take care handling with bare hands -- the rug beneath shows no sign of damage. Also, about five months in use, the mat shows no sign of going brittle, cracking or yellowing.",

I'd say it would only last about 3-4 months of daily use. ( I don't use my desktop too often) Original: So far so good. It is made of thick poly-carbonate and grips to the carpet very well. I haven't had any problems with the mat cracking or forming any blemishes. Very good mat!",

It was soft and sank where the wheels were making it hard to move. When this mat was delivered it was in a large flat box. Parents said they like it since it was thick and now it make it easy to move around and protect the carpet. So far so good!!",

Worst of all, cracks have formed all over the mat to the point it is unusable now. It could not hold up to the movement with carpet underneath. If you have a hard floor it will probably be fine but don't waste your time if you have carpet. Total waste of money for me.",

I think this is because the spikes are very poorly designed and insufficient to the task. I am keeping it because I threw the packing material away so shipping it back would be more trouble than it's worth but this mat is one of those items where the positive reviews get it wrong.",
