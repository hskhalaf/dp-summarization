By mixing Healthy Weight, roughly half and half, with his usual food, we have achieved the weight loss. He always acts like he hasn\u2019t been feed for a week (looks up with pleading eyes), so I\u2019ve wondered if he\u2019s getting his fill. Since he would eat an entire bag of any type of Pedigree if left to his own devices, I will just have to trust that he is getting the amount of food he needs.",

Both are 13 years and they look to have many more with us - and I look forward to that. [We also have regular vet appointments, so that certainly is helpful as well.]",
