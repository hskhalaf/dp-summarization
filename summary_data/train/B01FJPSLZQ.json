Waste of time and money, I wont buy from their product line anymore. They do have good customer service, but you're still buying garbage, just with good service.",

During our very first use while we ran just water through to clean it, the plastic handle and metal band popped off of the decanter and nearly burned one of my employees. Amazon has already agreed to replace the item, but that's less of a concern to me than the safety of the decanter. The way the decanter is constructed is by pressure alone. There are no pieces that screw it together, so if something is off, even a little bit, the whole thing can pop off of the decanter and fall out of your hands. Test carefully with cold water.",
