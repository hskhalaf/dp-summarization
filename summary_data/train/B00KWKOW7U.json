This 2016 X Mission 2 runs small, about a 1/2 size. I do not know if this is across the board on all there shoes or just this model. I have worn in the past the X-Mission 2, XR Mission, X-Wind Pro and all were size 12 and they were perfect. So from now on I am going to order a size 12.5 and hopefully they are good.",

This style was on sale, but to go up a half size was about $25 difference, so I figured I would take a chance. The toe end was narrow and felt slightly uncomfortable. I actually stuffed socks in the toe for a couple of nights. And then I wore them hiking for about 6 miles. Now I can honestly say that they fit fine. I love the material they are made of and the quick laces. If these any length of time and survive playing disc golf. I will be buying more.",

      "text": "I only buy Salomon shoes because they fit my feet the best and are usually very high quality, but the sole pattern on these is garbage. The sole is comprised of small textured squares in order to provide traction. Within a few days of wearing them, a few of the squares were no longer attached and flapped whenever I walked. After a few months of wearing them I have had to re-glue every single square on each of the shoes multiple times. The shoes fit well like all Salomon shoes, but the soles are ridiculous.",

These particular shoes run a bit small. I will likely order a 1/2 size up to see how that works. I will let you know. Other than that, the tread appears to be more for hard surfaces than my other trail shoes (X-Scream) which will likely have better longevity on tracks and roads but will still offer decent off road traction.",
