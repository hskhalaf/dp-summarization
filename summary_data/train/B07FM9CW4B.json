If I hadn\u2019t brought a solar power bank I would have been screwed. I was often left literally in the dark after only an hour or so on the lowest setting. Also even in the lowest setting this thing is unbearably bright, which is really annoying when you are in a camp with a lot of other people, it is blindingly bright. Wish I had just brought my tried and true regular headlamp which has the right amount of brightness and lasts weeks and weeks with a single battery.",

I'll update this review after using it for a few months on its durability and run times.",

I feel like the company should improve this and give a steep discount for people who have already bought this model to upgrade.",

I would highly recommend these headlamps. Though they are a little more expensive than others, it's definitely worth the extra $$",

It dims so slowly it's almost imperceptible until find yourself needing more light. What is the point of advertising 330 lumin if you keep dimming it down.",

Charged fully prior to camping, used for each night about 2 hours each for 3 nights and still had battery when I returned home. Love how you can adjust the light beam to different angles, How it doesn\u2019t get too hot on your head, and it\u2019s light. Biolite also is a great company with great support.",

A third strap to go over the top of your head would maybe be nice too. All around good product though.",
