I ran a self-test through CyberPower's PowerPanel Personal software for Windows via USB, and the moment I clicked on \"Initiate self-test\" the CyberPower UPS made a loud pop noise, it turned itself off, and then smoke came out of the sides of this product through its vents. This product has filled my bedroom with a horrendous burnt-electronics smell. I do not recommend this product at all. I'm afraid of this thing igniting itself in flames and burning my house down.",

I searched and the CyberPower model was highly recommended with more options than the locally available models. It isn't available for 2-day shipping given the requirement for it to come by regular ground, no big deal. It is smaller than expected. It is clearly labeled with an adequate amount of outlets. I've only had it for a few days, but so far so good.",

Also in the event of a power outage, I can still watch TV uninterrupted for 20 minutes according to the built in LCD screen. I have a older CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD 900w model for my computer that is over 3 years old that still works great so it was another reason for a second purchase from Cyberpower.",

With my 55\" LED TV, Surround Sound System, and the Comcast DVR box hooked up, I can watch TV for about 35 minutes if need be, and the cable box alone would last for 6 hours in case I wanted to record something while the power was out.Lots of outlets for whatever you need in your entertainment center.",
