Don't be fooled, better software at under \u00a3100 is available, like Affinity and Luminar, lots of other offerings over \u00a3100 but a lot less that \u00a3700 are available which can seriously compete with CS6.",

At full price it is difficult to justify for amateur use but, when discounted, can be recommended for those taking their photography more seriously. The raw file facility integrated in this software now takes precedence over the Nikon dedicated program that I formerley used. To help take full advantage of all that the software offers, I recommend 'The missing manual' by Lisa Snider.",
