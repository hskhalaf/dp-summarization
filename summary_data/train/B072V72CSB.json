I don't know how I feel about the eye and laser being open and exposed when a CD isn't in it but that's not such an awful thing I guess.",

Remote lasted a week and then fell apart. To answer my own question, yes, it can be paired with Alexa for streaming. (I had read that some devices will not connect.) I also had no trouble pairing with an Lg V20. The remote seems quirky, though it may be the battery. The sound quality is satisfactory. Please note that my video was to show bluetooth cooperation with Alexa, not as a means to consider sound quality.",

WORST PART! My tiny $5 bluetooth speaker sounds louder and clearer. 5th: The stand for it doesn't secure the device. In fact, the device slips off easily. When you have children playing around & the CD is on it, one fall is all it'll take to crack that CD, because there's no protection for it. The stand doesn't secure the device in place.",
