He was able to sit alone and surprisingly he pulled himself forward and sat up in Hugaboo. He loves it and it keeps him laughing and smiling and us too! The Hugaboo is sturdy, soft, comfortable and can be placed anywhere he needs a seat. I would definitely buy again for gifts to others and recommend to others! Thank you Hugaboo on proving a quality product that brings smiles to our entire family!",

He is a little wobbly of course because of his age so I need to put a little pillow in front of him while he is sitting in this so he doesn't lean forward or lean to the side. Once he gets just a little bit bigger this will be perfect for him to sit up on the couch like a little man with his mom and dad. It feels super comfortable. It is very well made and the pattern is really cute. All in all I think this is worth the price and I am very happy with it.",

She was telling me how she sits her up against her boppy pillow and try to get things done only to hear LAILA crying and discover she slid down and was not sitting up. I went on Amazon looking for a solution. Voila, I saw this, ordered it and had it sent to her home. The call I got two days later was filled with amazement and gratitude. Seems laila loves it, sits straight, can reach over for her toys and plays on her own. I would recommend this as it's soft and yet supportive.",

She's still kind of small for it at 13 pounds so we put a little neck pillow around her waist. This is not like the bumbo seat.

Couple that with the small front and all he tended to do, mist often, was lean forward and grab at his feet instead of attempting to learn to sit up.",
