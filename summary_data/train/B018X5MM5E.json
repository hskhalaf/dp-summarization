I had used the wrong email address. As soon as I corrected that the company contacted me immediately and assured us they would replace the safe but carefully walked us through a self repair (checking connections to LCD) and it worked. Just a loose connection that was remedied by simple plugging it in. I suspect it must have been loosened in shipping or installing. Bummer yes but company totally backed up their product.",

The lower part of the safe door visibly doesn't even stay flush to the frame, so the \"no-pry\" claim falls a little flat.

The first safe the batteries lasted over a year. I am hoping Viking will replace the the electronics or send a new one. UPdate sent an email to the company via thier website and they replied \"Thanks for your email. We'll get back to you as soon as possible!\" on November 21 and I have not heard from them since.",

      "text": "Description was fair but this is obviously a cheaply manufactured mass produced safe. Shelves are thin plastic, outer casing looks like will break with a hammer, internal LED is cheap and didnt work at 1st, and finger lock is not instant, its a sluggish open. Wish would have mentioned that the key pad is not lit. How am I supposed to open this in the dark with a non lighting keypad?",
