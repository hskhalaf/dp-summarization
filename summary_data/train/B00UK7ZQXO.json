      "text": "Buy these now! Great sound and price. Adjustable bass ports are really handy for certain songs. ***Update*** The sound quality is starting to fade. My teenage son, loved these at first but the sound is definitely starting to get tinny and hollow. Even with the bass ports open all the way they just don't sound all that good anymore. His birthday is right around the corner and I'm probably gonna be switching back to Beats for him. As he treats his items with great care.",

      "text": "I purchased a like new pair of phones to replace a set of 30 year old Sony MDR series units. The construction quality and styling is very good, as is the fit and sound. Its true that the bass can be modified with two tabs on either side of the ear cups. The fit of the ear cups permit extended listing over more than an hour. Outside sound suppression is excellent as is imaging for the price paid. Interesting that a second set of phones can be plugged in so that a friend can listen.",

      "text": "Received these phones today and no sound out of the left earcup. They are \"refurbished suitable for resale\" but apparently not. I have no idea how something as glaring as no sound out of one of the earcups could be considered suitable for resale. I'd be curious as who certified them as such and missed such an obvious defect. In case the seller is wondering, I did plug the cord ends properly and did slide the notched end in properly to each right and left earcup individually. No change, still sound from right earcup only. They are going back to Amazon.",

The combination of them with a high quality device (I've been using them with my LG V20 smartphone, which is known for a great sound quality) will create an awesome experience. The headphones are of great quality materials and very comfortable and the supplied cable is long enough for any need that you may have. Bottom line, you'll get your money's worth with this product, guaranteed.",

    "description": "Color:BlackThe Custom Street is ideal with mobile phones, mobile players or a stationary PC at home. A special feature of this headphone is the changeable sound which can be selected in three stages from a clear, analytical sound to a rich bass via the \"CUSTOM Sound Slider\" bass reflex vents at the housing shells. Another property of this \"CUSTOM Sound Slider\" feature is the more they are closed, the more they attenuate ambient noise considerably. Vice versa no music will penetrate to the outside which could disturb people in the vicinity. The CUSTOM STREET features a high-quality microphone. Via the remote control integrated in the cable you can accept and end phone calls. Depending on the software of the mobile phone or player (e.g. MP3 player) the remote control can be used for other functions such as music playback. The versatile design with replaceable accessories gives the headphone a special individuality. By purchasing colored covers, rings, ear and headband pads the user can change the look of the headphone at any time. The single-sided detachable cable is provided with a gold-plated mini jack plug (3.5 mm). It is available in different versions and lengths for most various applications. The movable yokes and adjustable headband of spring steel allow a perfect fit for each head size. Soft, replaceable ear and headband pads ensure a pleasant comfort of wearing. When not in use the housing shells can be folded inwards and the headphone is stored in the supplied case.",
