When the package arrived I was a little worried due to how light the package was but wrapped it up and when my husband opened it up Christmas morning he was in shock. The product is amazing and so light weight. My husband loves the helmet.",

And, I like the solar panel that recharges the battery while you're welding......gotta love technology! The skull graphics is also pretty wild and definitely gives the helmet an eerie look, I like it. Highly recommend this helmet!",

This Metal Man helmet looks great, works very well, is comfortable and most important I can see what I am going to weld. The response time is instantaneous. I have been practicing and I am getting the hang of welding all because I can see the work. This helmet is a bit flexible and may not stand up to professional use, I'm not sure if that is important but want to put that out there. If it was more rigid it would be heavier.
