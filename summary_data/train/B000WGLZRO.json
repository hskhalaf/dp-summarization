The bass is lacking, so make sure you have a sub. It's definitely not on par with a complete surround system and you can localize, but I am very please with it. Music (depending on source) sounds fantastic. This is wife friendly and I would recommend it for sure.",

The sound quality is good, but I am not blown away as I had hoped. My room is not idea for listening and I do not have the option to install a real 5.1 system, so went with the sound bar. Set up is easy and using the speaker calibration capabilities of mywas straight forward. The manual is pretty thin, but you really don't need much more for a sound bar. If you can place speakers where needed, this is the way to go. If not, the sound bar does a credible job, but just barely.",

Not quite as good as a full 5.1 system, but a lot better than I expected one speaker to be.",

At around $400, it's a great price for a Polk product! Otherwise, consider the Polk Surroundbar 360, which is more expensive, but comes with it's own type of receiver. Enjoy the new sounds!",

    "description": "Color:BlackThe Polk Audio SurroundBar 50 is 51\" wide to offer an enveloping surround sound experience to anyone who wants better sound from their TV but does not want to install rear mounted speakers. It delivers surround sound from a single, multi driver loudspeaker located under or over the TV screen using SDA Surround technology. SDA Surround technology uses a patented combination of signal processing and acoustical geometry that complements the spacing between your ears to produce surround sound without the need for rear mounted speakers. It can deliver a room filling surround experience in nearly any location in almost any type of room with no special room characteristics required. The SurroundBar 50 is sized to match the width of 50\" Plasma and LCD TVs. In addition to using SDA Surround technology on the surround channels, the SurroundBar 50 adds SDA Surround image enhancing technology on the front Left & Right channels to further enhance the surround experience as well as produce a huge stereo sound field from a two channel source. New drivers and crossover design along with a larger enclosure produce far better bass performance than the original SurroundBar. The aluminum enclosure houses nine mid/bass drivers with Neodymium magnets, three dome tweeters and a four PC board crossover with over 60 components.",
