The results were pretty amazing. I had a big scratch that I worked on and got it looking much less noticeable. Then I worked on a panel that I had wet sanded the clear coat with 1500 grit sandpaper. The finish was very dull. After polishing it up, it looked shiny and new. Very happy with this product. Especially since it could have gone bad with me being inexperienced with using a buffer/polisher.",
