I am not sure if it is because these are lace-free, but I had to return my size 8s for a size 7 ( which fit great). They offer some arch support but are not as cushioned as the Ryka Hydro Sport shoes. I will still use Hydro Sports when I have to teach aquatics on deck, but in the water, I will use these Hydrospheres. Don't get me wrong, the Hydrosphere worked well when I taught my classes on the deck, but I would have preferred a little more cushion.",
