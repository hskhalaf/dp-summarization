It was great for the first 6 or so months. Then I got the same problem that everyone else was getting with the 'a', 's', 1, 2, 3 keys not working. You can search google for the problem, apparently it's pretty common. Unfortunately for me warranty already expired. I'm glad I only paid $50 for it, but for such light use and such short duration, it was very disappointing.",

Tremendous mistake by Logitech designers. 3.) After a year of limited use, certain keys on the upper left had corner of the KB just suddenly stopped working.

Alot of people have complained about the absence of a numlock funtion-however I find it less complex to have a simple numberpad-which is what this actually is. It is lightweight and does not have to be line of sight so moving around with my keyboard while my laptop is sitting on a stand does not result in a lack of reliability. It has made surfing from my couch much easier. I recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want their laptop actually in their lap to use it!",
