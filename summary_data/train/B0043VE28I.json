      "title": "Great kit lens",
      "text": "It's a wonderful lens, producing great colors and sharp pictures at every focal length. I also own the Panasonic 14-140 lens, which produces pictures with an unnatural, extreme contrast and sharpness when used in bright sunlight, almost painful to the eye and in need for reducing the contrast in post processing. Therefore, in such bright and high contrast lighting situations I prefer the 14-42 for its ability to produce more natural and balanced results with much more detail in shadows. But don't get me wrong, the 14-140 is also a great lens, perfect for using on cloudy days, also indoors and in low light situations. Using them on DMC G7.",

      "text": "This is a cheap, small and light lens for m4/3 cameras. It has built-in image stabilization that is active on Panasonic cameras and is inactive when using Olympus cameras (which is perfect, because Olympus bodies have in-body stabilization). The lens is a larger but lighter than the collapsible Olympus 14-42. It also costs about 1/3rd of the price and comes with a hood. In my opinion, it also looks better. I could discern no difference in image quality between the lenses, with both being very good. The Panasonic lens is also easier to remove from the camera because it has that wide gray area to grip it by. For the price, this lens is unbeatable.",

I am using this lens on a Lumix G1 and a PEN E-PL1 and it works very well on both of these cameras.",

This is not an ideal situation for filming (why allow the zoom to be used if the image goes out of focus and jumps when zooming). I come from a SONY NEX (5n) background and even though the standard zoom lens given with the basic kit is cheap and slow optically, it is butter smooth when zooming. I've ordered the 14-45 Panasonic lens as i hear this isn't an issue for that lens. It is twice the price, and hopefully smoother when zooming. For still photography, can't get more bang for buck IMO however.",
