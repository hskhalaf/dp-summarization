The arms and cups that hold the bulbs are \"adjustable\" and just take a little coaxing to get them level-ish. I probably spent just as much time adjusting it as I did installing it. Use an A15 low profile fan bulb in this so you don't see the bulb over the vase.",

Threading the electrical cord through the chain, cutting the cord and chain to length, and then installing the light into the electrical box in the ceiling (of course) are all required.
