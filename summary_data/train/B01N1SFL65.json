      "verdict": "What adventurers can get out of the Outmost Ventilator Waterproof is a gear that offers remarkable support and comfort. They can also expect a one-to-one kind of fit from this watertight shoe. A hurdle in the form of a lengthy break-in period needs to be overcome first, however, before wearers can gain access to its excellent capabilities. All in all, the Merrell Outmost Ventilator Waterproof has the potential to be the go-to footwear of many, especially once it is completely broken in.",

        "This hiker, thanks to its supreme lightness, received applause from a handful of consumers",
        "A few Merrell loyalists swore by the outstanding breathability of this footgear"

      "text": "Great shoes, I feel great after standing all day! If I had any complaint is that They aren\u2019t very breathable, which is understandable for a waterproof boot. The line is Goretex, but it still retains moisture so my stocks are a bit damp at the end of the day. Very comfortable and waterproof though, so not a big deal. I had the same shoe without the Goretex lining and they were good until you stepped in a puddle. I\u2019m very happy all-in-all.",
