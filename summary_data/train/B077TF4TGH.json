The company contacted me to try some options to get the system to work. All to no avail. Thus they replaced the system with a new one which has worked flawlessly thus far.

It stays connected most anywhere in my house. This unit has capacity for 6 probes and comes with 4 probes and a clip to attach one of the probes to a grill grate.",

The app works well and you can tweak what temps you are monitoring for. I used the included clip to clip the probe to the grill grate to measure ambient temp. Highly recommend...very accurate as well.",
