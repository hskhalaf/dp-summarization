The reason for the 4/5 star is the padding is very thin. but with everything strapped in and zippered, everything stays in place nice and tight. just dont throw it around. It does have some extra rubber absorbers on the bottom though. Has velcro handle. Adjustable shoulder strap. This is one of the best carrying cases ive found yet! Id definitely buy it again if i had to.",
