I will have my husband read through some of the reviews and see if he can fix it with a clamp, but that is extra work, time and expense. I would rather just have ordered one that works.",

Grandson has to reattach or readjust the tee every time he either hits any part of the tee RATHER than ONLY THE BALL SQUARELY. It encourages and improves his bat to ball eye coordination. Helps prevent chopping or scooping the ball off the tee. Tee height adjustments works perfectly for his lower or upper strike zone swing adjustments. Great teaching and training tool. Thank you.",
