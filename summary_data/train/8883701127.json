It's over 3 times the price of my piccadilly, but I decide the quality must make it worth the extra money. I was wrong. My gel pens that I used daily in my Piccadilly with no problems bleed through the pages. Even worse, there is a major smudging problem and I'm right handed! I have tried several different brands of pens and they all have this problem. I do not recommend this journal, especially for the price. I will not be repurchasing.",

Also bleed through/ghosting is an issue. I can even see pencil marks. The paper is very smooth, I prefer a little tooth personally. It was also very easy to tear while erasing.",

      "text": "I've been buying the same Moleskine notebook for years. However, in the last Molskine notebook I just bought, the paper and grids are slightly different in color than what I've come to expect from Moleskine and have become accustomed to. The paper has a yellow hue and the grid is lighter in color. I don't like it. It doesn't feel like I'm writing on a Moleskine product. In the photo I've attached, my old notebook is on top and the new one is one the bottom. I don't know if this is a permanent change or just a one-off.",

That being said, because the pages are thin, the notebook itself is very slim and easy to carry around, compared to my Scrivwell notebook (which is much thicker).",

      "text": "I've always been a fan of Moleskine, so of course I've been using the squared notebooks for my Bullet Journals. The Large is just the right size for what I've been using it for. It's a classic notebook with lay-flat smooth pages for writing ease. The lines are the perfect height for me since I write small with fine-medium point pens. I love the attached bookmark so that I can easily go to my \"Today's task list\" easily, while the elastic closure band keeps it closed so that it doesn't flop open by accident. The pocket in the back comes in handy to stash small slips of paper. The Squared Notebooks really are perfect for bullet journaling.",

Rhodia webnotebooks are my current favorite for use with fountain pens - heavy smooth nonabsorbent clairfontaine paper and built to last construction. The paper quality and binding on the moleskine are just lacking... for the same price as the others. Red and Black notebooks for a cheaper alternative.",
