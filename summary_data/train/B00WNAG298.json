I reduced the length of the mast. When I finish the ship I will take some pictures. Would you like them?",

This is VERY tiny so make sure you have proper tools to use, for example, a tool that can cut a hole through a toothpick. I would also suggest finding an instant bonding glue because the pieces are so tiny and difficult to hold and wait for glue to dry. I lose patience after working on it for a while, so it is not complete yet.",
