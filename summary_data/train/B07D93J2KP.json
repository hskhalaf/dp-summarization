These mid-top basketball shoes also have a 90\u2019s-inspired style that will surely make you stand out. The Pro Vision\u2019s only drawback is its hit or miss traction.All things considered, the Pro Vision is still a good budget offering from Adidas. If you hoop outdoors or frequent clean indoor courts, then this basketball shoe is a no-brainer.",

The shoes them selves are comfortable even with paper soles and lock you in with the ankle pillows. The herring bone pattern on the bottom is a little thin so the lose grip with dust on a wood court but but a quick wipe will keep you going. The bounce foam feels great and gives a small edge over regular sneakers. I highly recommend these shoes as they are fantastic court sneakers for the price",
