His advice, never wash the pan. when done wipe clean and spray oil on the pan, If there's stuff stuck to it heat pan on hi and them pour small amount of water on it and wipe clean. Put spray oil on it before storing. Before using it heat it up good to kill any germs.Over time it will build up a smooth nonstick coating. Just keep it well oiled when using. I use spray oil or butter when cooking.",

It is uncomfortable to use and just feels like an after thought. This is one thing that can and should be redesigned. Otherwise great product and for a great price.",
