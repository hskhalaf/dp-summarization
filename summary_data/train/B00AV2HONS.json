Given the performance and ruggedness I've experienced with these I would never buy a MaxTrax when Maxsa's are available at such a cheaper price. I would never go lower on price, either, from the cheap knockoffs now flooding the market. Maxsa's are a well-reviewed option to the MaxTrax's.",

They said they had been stuck there for about an hour and had tried shoving rocks under the tire to give it leverage. We pulled over, threw these bad boys under their tires and they easily were able to pull out of the mud. These were the best purchase I have made out of my offroading gear. I feel safe knowing I have these.",
