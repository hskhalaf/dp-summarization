In order for my system to work, I need to reliably receive what I order so I can consistently use the same thing. I won\u2019t sent it back because I\u2019ll use the multicat eventually, but I\u2019m frustrated because my cats have been thrown off and I can\u2019t find somewhere to reliably get Feliway classic single refills. It also sucks because the multicat is $4 cheaper, so I guess I\u2019ve been ripped off a little.",

In a multi-cat house this keeps them calm enough to get along with each other. Of course if you have more then two cats I have no idea what the results would be, but I have found this to be a very helpful product in my house whether it be one crazy zany cat or two active cats.

My only complaint is that they only last three weeks max. It may be because it's winter here and our forced hot air heat is running lots.

Giving rescues a home has been important in my life, but this did create a problem. This product does exactly what it says it will do. Life became much calmer (I did have to use 2 at a time because of open spaces), but it is well worth the money to have a peaceful home.",

One cat has maybe gotten friendlier towards us, but he never had any attitude issues to begin with so I can't say for sure. I really wish these worked.",

    "description": "Is your cat peeing outside the litter box, scratching your furniture and carpet, or hiding on a regular basis? These behaviors may be caused by fear and anxiety. FELIWAY products are a vet recommended, drug free, and clinically proven to help alleviate many of the unwanted behaviors cat owners deal with. FELIWAY CLASSIC provides \u201chappy messages\u201d by mimicking the natural feline reassuring messages (pheromones) to make cats feel calm and comfortable at home. This product has been found to reduce scratching, spraying, and hiding for 90% of cats, and many owners see results within 7 days. Cats are also very sensitive to change, so if you anticipate changes in the home (moving, renovation, recorating, new pets, new family members, etcs.), FELIWAY is very effective in helping your cats remain calm, and adapt to the changes without unwanted behaviors. The FELIWAY Classic Diffuser Refill includes one refill vial (diffuser sold separately). You should plug your diffuser in the room(s) where your cat spends the most time - each diffuser covers up to 700 sq. feet. Make sure your diffuser isn't covered by curtains, or behind furniture. Each refill can last up to 30 days. For maximum effectiveness, you should replace your diffuser every 6 months. Make sure to follow the instructions when plugging in your diffuser, and plug the diffuser in upright.",
