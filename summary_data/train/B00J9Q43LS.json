The instructions to assemble and mount the cabinet are very confusing and frustrating. Even after viewing you tube videos. I was still scratching my head. This is the same medicine cabinet as Jac**zi brand (Whirlpool tubs). They have downloadable instructions, videos and dimensions that may help. Looks great once correctly assembled and hung.",

    "description": "Size:26-Inch x 30-Inch - Double DoorThe elegant Halton cabinet has two mirrored doors open up to reveal abundant storage space to stash away all your bathroom essentials and five height adjustable shelves add to the organized look. The patented hang 'n' lock easy installation bracket from Croydex is a simple and safe solution to hang your cabinet or mirror. Hang 'n' lock provides the flexibility to change the level of your cabinet or mirror after having drilled your holes making it easy for a single person install.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe clean, elegant lines of this sophisticated cabinet would suit any style of bathroom and the many innovative and practical features ensure that the cabinet is functional as well as beautiful. The Hang 'N' Lock fixing system allows you to fix the supporting bracket to the wall rather than to the cabinet, so you do not have to struggle to measure distances and mark screw holes whilst supporting a heavy bathroom cabinet. This cabinet can also be surface mounted or recessed - depending on the cavity depth of your bathroom wall - so you can really optimize the space available in your bathroom.",
