      "text": "This is a very efficient cordless vacuum cleaner. We have about 1500 square feet of hardwood floor downstairs and got tired of hauling the Dyson downstairs as it seemed like overkill for hardwood. So took a chance on this thing. It's everything we hoped it would be - good battery life (~40-50 minutes of vacuuming per charge), lightweight, highly maneuverable, powerful enough suction for the application, easy to empty. But... very expensive and I must admit the reports here of poor customer service make me nervous. If it craps out after a few months I'll update and knock off a few stars, but for the first two months it's working out well.",

The charge lasts longer than the 40 minutes stated. With the Gtech glide, this makes my vacuuming easy without the back pain. Purchased another for my son in Zurich, Switzerland. Package was delivered to my California address, I then remailed to Zurich. My sons wife is also in love with the Gtech AirRam. After one vacuum with the Gtech, you will see what was hiding deep in your carpets, great on my hardwood and tile. Also, ordered the handheld last year, better than our ORECK get into every nook and cranny.",

The brush is next to impossible to remove, so hair that gets wound around it has to be laboriously cut out. I have long hair, and this has become such a disadvantage that I'm in the market for a new vacuum. If you buy this vac, I'd suggest getting a second battery. I've appreciated the ability to pop one battery out, insert another, and keep going. The customer service people aren't very helpful if you have a problem.",
