The ball that comes with it is solid quality. The fabric seems to be pretty sturdy on the actual hoop frame. It hasn\u2019t lost any shape. We have a rather large pool and the kids love shooting from the far end with success. We do not leave it floating in the pool or out in the sun. I think with proper care, it will last us into next summer.",
