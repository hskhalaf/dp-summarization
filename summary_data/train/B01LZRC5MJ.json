I checked the box, trying to see if it just fell off. Nope, it was shipped that way. If the seal leaked, that would've been a disaster, not just for myself but for other customers as well, since break fluid is very toxic and very corrosive. Now I have a half-empty bottle with volatile chemical, for which I have to improvise a lid. Pretty disappointed with packing services. As for the product, it was decent and did what it supposed to.",
