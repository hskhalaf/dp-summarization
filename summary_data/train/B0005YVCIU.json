A few weeks later I decanted the rest of the olive oil into the same glass bottle. It too tasted like regular Colavita olive oil.

It cooks clean and really enhances any dish I've made so far. Oh, and the bottle came sealed inside a bubble wrap suit, if you will. Secure enough I had to cut the wrap to get the bottle out.

Therefore, there will be variance. I will definitely enjoy the rest of the bottle but will continue my search for a more consistent flavor.",
