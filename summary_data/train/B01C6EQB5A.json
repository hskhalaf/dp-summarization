I have put the cover on every time after using this, never let it sit out in the rain. I am really, really disappointed by this product. --- ORIGINAL REVIEW 4/20/2018 Bought this just over a year ago and have used it 10 or so times. Coated inside of bowl and wire top with 5 coats of high temperature grill paint after unwrapping just to provide extra protection from heat and rust damage. Also bought nice heavy duty cover to protect it from moisture. Screen lid is cheap and fell apart after only 10 uses.",

The pit is deep. well ventilated, and can hold alot of wood for a really nice fire. The top is also large and can cover the pit well without being obstructed by the wood. The design is unique and sharp looking. I have had many firepits before, and this one so far has been the best.",

They design could work for a contemporary or traditional styled home. The screen is key in a tight dry setting to prevent any chance of fire. You can fit a good amount of logs in it for a sizeable fire. You'll likely want to get a cover if you plan to keep it outside.",

Wasn't quite wide enough for the existing space so filled in around the edges with decorative boulders for an economical solution. Now it's my favorite place in our yard.",

It is lightweight and easy to move in case you want to store it in the garage/shed to prolong its life. The coloration on it was more yellow gold vs bronze-ish gold as it appeared on my monitor. Still looks awesome and works great. Highly recommend so far.",

It has 3 screws to support the screen topper, which are easy to miss when putting the top onto it, which allows the lid to fall into the drum. It could easily use 6 screws to rest the top upon. Also, since there aren't legs, the base captures heat, so be careful where you place this item to use. I have a circle of scorched grass in my yard.
