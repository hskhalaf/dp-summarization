Pick up a couple of bungee cords and hook them from the bottom corner grommets to the base of the frame. 2) It isn't very heavy so it will blow over. If you are going to leave it unattended then put something heavy over the back corner tube. If it falls over the screen will get dirty (of course) and can wrinkle. 3) Keep ALL the packing materials including the tube to wrap the screen around. It makes this all much easier to pack and carry.",

The screen had already ripped apart from the grommets in 3 different places. Do not waste your time with this product as the quality of the screen is either very poor, or the engineering of attaching it to the frame is faulty. Either way, huge disappointment.",
