Hihly recommended by this cook. I got this on sale for $80 so it was a great buy.",

I use All-Clad pots currently for cooking and have used an All-Clad non stick griddle in the past which we loved! I destroyed that griddle until the non stick layer started peeling off, it took about 8 years to make that happen (metal utensils, high heat...). This roasting pan has already scratched with one cleaning when I left a metal utensil in it to wash dishes. My best guess is this won't last a year with how we use our cookware. I would still buy All-Clad products, except this one.",
