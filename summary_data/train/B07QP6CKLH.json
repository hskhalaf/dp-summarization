      "verdict": "All-in-all, the feedback given to the Salomon Supercross has been positive. Many of those who have tried it are in agreement when it comes to the quality of the build and the efficacy of the design. The traction-ready outsole, the single-pull lacing system, and the foot-welcoming interior chamber put a spotlight on this running shoe. On the other hand, some complaints churn the opposite of satisfaction as runners note the smaller-than-usual sizing scheme, as well as the mud-attracting lacing system.The Salomon Supercross is made for fans of Salomon trail running shoes and those who have neutral foot pronation.",
      "pros": [
        "Several testers claim that the forefoot section of the Salomon Supercross allows their toes to splay naturally",
        "The Quicklace\u00ae system has gained some fans who desire a fit adjustment method that is effortless and barely-there",
        "Some consumers feel that the weight of this Salomon running shoe is lighter than other trail-optimized athletic footwear",
        "The outsole unit is praised for offering a reliable grip on soft and muddy terrains",
        "Most purchasers laud the padded collar and tongue, stating that these elements permit them to feel secure and locked in place",
        "The cushioning system is perceived to be highly comfortable and capable of maintaining a well-rounded heel-to-toe transition"

      "cons": [
        "The shoelaces were too long, according to some reviewers",
