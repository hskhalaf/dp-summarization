After I finally remembered to pack these bags with my shopping bags kept in the car, I haven't gone back to using the plastic ones. The tare is indeed written on the bags themselves. So weighing is easy (especially if you're shopping on your own/scanning and weighing your own produce). Once home, I placed every veggie and fruit in the fridge in one of these bags. They DEFINITELY have stayed fresher/crisper/heartier longer than before. I was happily surprised. Washing them is easy too, although hardly any residue on them because the food inside hasn't spoiled. Highly recommend!",

Most of all, I feel so much better about not having to use all those plastic produce bags just to get my food home.
