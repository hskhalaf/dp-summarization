Computer froze and made a loud constant noise so I shut it down manually. Tried to boot up again but just have a black screen. Searched online and found out this is a common problem and they have a faulty motherboard. Since I live abroad, the shipping costs and tax I would have to pay on my laptop coming back would be nearly 80% and Dell won't allow for it to be serviced outside the US or Canada even though we have a Dell support center next to my house. Complete waste of $1500. Buyer beware!",

Looks like it came without the heat sink for either one of the M.2 SSDs and the second slot doesn't even have a screw I can use to mount the drive, I had to buy one. Is there a thermal heat sink that can be used with this/should have been there?",
