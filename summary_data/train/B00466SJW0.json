      "text": "...for my 12 year old one my doctor prescribed. But that one I lost the \"molded to my back\" insert 6 years ago. So I bought this one and my back never felt so good. It has permanent stiff but bendable ribs in the back so it kind a molds itself to my back. It also has a \"pre\" velcro strap about 4 \" wide that you fasten around first. It is attached to the large belt that is also very secure. It easily gives me one or two extra hours of reduced back pain. as without it I get about 3 or 4 hours out of my back a day. Thanks!",

      "text": "Judging by other reviews, the Alpha Brace seems to work for some people - but not for me. The material is highly abrasive - requiring it to be worn over clothing - and for those of us who pack too much weight around, the brace doesn't provide proper adjustments and, after wearing it for a while, it eventually gets all out of kilter in front - it kind of rolls over onto itself. The Mueller brace works perfectly for me - and it is a \"one size fits all.\"",
