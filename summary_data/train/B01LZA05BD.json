They feel like stuffed animals on the crib, and they look so much nicer than my rinky-dink setup from before. Highly recommend!",

I had the best of intentions to later order the sides, but I didn't in time. Well my cute little monster ate her crib on the sides. The one piece that comes in the listing ended up having one of the ties rip off the first time I put it on after washing. So the sturdiness of this product was seriously lacking.",

Even with a simple tied bow our son hasn't been able to get it off and he is happy to chew on it instead of the front rail. I wish I had measured for size before purchasing since it is a bit long for the minicrib, but folding the ends worked fine and causes no issues. Great item.",
