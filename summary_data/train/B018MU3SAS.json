I used the table top mounts so I didn't have to drill through my desk, and it has a very small footprint, and keeps plenty of space available on your desk. Fantastic product, especially for the price. Can't recommend enough.",

      "text": "This is actually a pretty solid mount. The base is heavy and metal, the arms, tubing and monitor mounts are metal and not flimsy. So far its working well, just needs fine tuning to tighten the parts that can freely move around. My only complaint is there doesn't seem to be a way to tighten the rotation at the very last joint that connects the monitor to the stand. You can adjust the friction for X and Y axis rotation but not Z axis rotation, which keeps the monitors level with each other horizontally. This is OK once they are set, but if you bump it at all they can move out of alignment easily.",

The assembly is very easy, though that's true of most products like this one. The biggest problem is the design and weight of the base plate, it isn't sturdy enough to avoid tipping over. You have to keep the monitors pretty far back and relatively equally balanced to avoid the entire stand tipping over. It does the job with limitations, but spending a little more on a higher quality stand would likely yield a lot better result.",

The tube fastens to the base with 3 machine screws, and after experimenting with mounting it in different orientations I was able to get it to lean back rather than sideways and I was able to get the monitors level with each other. I\u2019m happy with the final result but getting there was inconvenient.",

Because my monitors aren't the same size, I realized it would be safest to install using the desk mounted option. This is not a clamp-on stand. I drilled a single 3/8\" hole to mount the stand, which uses a 5\" long screw to make it secure. The stand is extremely well-made. It's hefty, with a solid, matte-black finish that feels like cast material. The screws were clean, and I didn't have a single cross-thread, which is unusual for an imported metal item. The price point was about $35, and when I made the purchase there was a 10% discount/coupon offer. I highly recommend this stand.",

I used one of the three mounting option that lets you securely fasten the pole over an existing cord port in the surface of my desk. It worked perfect and so secure I could drag the desk around by it. The wiring control clips are great and the clip for the bottom of the post has little holders built in to keep the 3 Allen keys stored nearby yet out of sight, great idea! My 2 new Samsung 27\" monitors look great side by side. Just set up last night.",

The arms seem to be tapered as to not slide down immediately when bolt is loosened, but it will with the slightest downward force. For $30 I'm surprised. Sturdy and we'll crafted.

UPDATE ----------------- I contacted support and they informed me a piece was missing from inside the arm. They sent the missing piece right away and I received it the same week and now have the stand up and functioning. So support was very good. I have changed my rating to reflect this.",
