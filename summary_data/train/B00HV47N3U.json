      "text": "After researching LOTS of \"inflatable mattress's for my F350, I purchased this one. My 150 lbs. Lab and 26 lbs. Beagle love it. It fits perfectly in my 2012 F350 crew cab with the Plush Paws Pet Seat Cover. The inflatable part that goes on the floor is the perfect height for a truck. Several I researched are for cars and not high enough for truck seats. I sepulchered this so my dogs could travel in comfort and not fall off the seat but I think this would also be great for a person to sleep on if needed.",

My biggest complaint is that it doesn't actually go all the way across the truck. It's about 8-10\" short which leaves my feet unsupported and I'm only 5-10. I also wish they would have made the bed part a little thicker towards the seat so it would really sit level. Right now it leans towards the back because of the natural seat contour.Overall it's not bad though.",

In my opinion your be better off buying one of those foam mattress toppers and rolling it up when you are done.",

By half way through the night I was just laying on my back seat. It was completely deflated.
