However, when the ladder is fully extended, it is only 17 feet long. The two individual segments, if laid end-to-end, are 20 feet long. The \"maximum reach\" assumes someone of 5'6\" height is standing at the highest recommended rung (IOW, their height combined with the ladder). Why does Werner use such ambiguous specifications?

This means your hands are free to properly set up the ladder.\n\nEasy to Extend and Separate\nEach Werner D6200 Series ladder is easy to extend thanks to external guides at the top of the base section and internal guides on the bottom of the fly section. In addition, the rugged gravity spring locks operate smoothly.\n\nAlso, each ladder utilizes a smooth-operating, heavy-duty rope and pulley and features a rope clamp that ties the rope to the rung (the 16-foot model is not equipped with rope and pulley). For further convenience, the base and fly sections separate easily, so you can use the base section as a single ladder.\n\nHassle-Free Accessory Installation\nFor further convenience, pre-pierced holes on the rails make for easy field installation of accessories, including Pole Lashes, Cable Hook and V-Rung Assembly, and others.
