I needed an adaptor for my iMac but that was it. However, at my client off-site, it stopped working after about one hour. The motor just stopped running despite having power. I thought it may have overheated (which would not be great for only working for one hour) but a day later the motor starts and stops. This projector may have been a lemon. Other reviews about the projector were good so I was very disappointed in the projector.",

Don't be fooled, you have to be on Wifi to connect and show any pictures from your phone. I could not access some of the on screen menus as each time I tried, the screen went directly back to the main menu. I returned this item and will look for another.",

To sum: this is a low level instrument with poor support I see no reason for someone to buy it. A waste of money and time",

Lumens good, software terrible so unresponsive too. I would pay a lot less in order to put off with all issues and would use only for movies,because in order to use it with phones,tablets,is another headache and you need to buy cables about 25.00 and it does not work with all phones.",
