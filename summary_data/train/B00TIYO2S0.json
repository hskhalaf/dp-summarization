Love the fact that it is Bluetooth only issue is it never stays connected long enough to take advantage of the sunrise setting. It always seems to disconnect when my phone is left alone so I have to keep reconnecting to change the colors again. I assumed it was because I had an older phone (nexus 4) but even with my nexus 5x is doing the same. If they can work this out this product can definitely get 5 stars.",
