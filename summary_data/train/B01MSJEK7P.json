A bit pricey but I went for it and wow, what a result it does a terrific job and it's easy to use and not much mess when emptying it in fact none at all. The sofa came up magnificent and I'm chuffed to bits. This little machine is a star as far as I am concerned .",

The hose that takes the water from where you are cleaning to the unit is so short it has to be basically right by your feet so on doing car seats the thing has to be in the car with you..it gives off a fair bit of heat and is very noisy and it just shouldn't be like that. Maybe the hose is short because the suction is poor but you can't really clean a carpet with this especially as the wider cleaning tool makes the suction even less effective.

      "text": "can't praise this little cleaner enough! - it is perfect for small stain jobs. Buy something bigger if you are looking to clean a room size carpet, this would not be the right kit for that job but it is exactly the right thing for tackling spills/accidental stains on all types of carpet (synthetic and wool) and refreshing upholstery, the small cleaning head is brilliant for that. Afterwards, its compact size means that it is no trouble at all for storage in a cupboard - until the next time!",

Didn't try it on stairs and in the car yet. You won't see a colour difference like you see in the ads, but the water will come out DIRTY (I mean so dirty that light won't go through).

You get more of a workout from this than you do at the gym. The spray jet is behind the head instead of inside so only covers the parts your not cleaning. Just avoid this rubbish.",

I used the solution and a little zoflora to refreshen up. You\u2019ll want to use it on everything because no amount of hoover or scrubbing can clean as deep as this... & the colour of the water will show (gross but hugely satisfying!). Works really well on carpets too!",
