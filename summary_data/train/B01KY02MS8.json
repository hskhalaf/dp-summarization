      "text": "Bought LIFX bulb three times during 2018. As of now they are all beginning to fail. Despite multiple reinstallations they consistently disconnect from the cloud and fail to maintain Alexa control. LIFX recently \u201cupdated\u201d the LIFX control app. According to the overwhelming number of negative reviews of this app I am not the only user having troubles similar to mine. I\u2019m wondering if the problems are the result of very poor bulb control (by the new app) or the bulbs themselves. An integration failure perhaps? In any case I\u2019ve chosen to give these expensive \u201csmart\u201d bulbs one star ratings. These bulbs retail for $60 per unit so I think they should at least function properly and consistently.",

The Philips lights were super dim, had a hub that had to remain connected to your router via Ethernet, and the control interface was clunky. The Lifx system is the complete opposite. The bulbs are way brighter than any of the other smart bulb systems out there, there's no stupid hub, and the interface is clean and intuitive. The bulbs are fairly large and flat so if a traditional incandescent bulb shape is critical to you, these might not work. Otherwise, they totally lord over every one else's smart bulb products.",

Color is impressive and really saturates surrounding space. If a single lamp has multiple bulbs, can be tricky to synchronize the color changing. Installation works best when working with only one new light screwed in and paired to network at a time. Automated Dawn to dusk feature is a favorite in our house. If you want very bright and deep colors, and the feature of smart light control, these lights don't require an extra hub and are a great choice.",
