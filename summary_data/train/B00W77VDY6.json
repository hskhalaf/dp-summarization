      "text": "OK, I've had this comforter for about six months. I've always purchased premium comforters, believing that a good night's sleep is worth the extra money. I've always headed to Macy's during a home sale, and picked one up there. This is the BEST comforter ever. Unfortunately, the last gf didn't work out so I'm sleeping alone. I sleep with the windows open, and the low temperatures here are generally around freezing (mid 20s at the lowest) during the Winter.... not super cold, but cold enough that previous comforters were sometimes barely adequate. This one keeps me toasty. And the look is somewhat elegant. If you like the price, you'll be happy... my guess.",

I was hoping that the quilted squares would help the down stay where it\u2019s supposed to- thereby prolonging the life of my comforter. Well, I\u2019ve got one year with this product and despite shaking it every single time I make the bed, all the down is in the bottom two quilted squares. As you can see in the picture. We tried to displace the down again tonight, and it\u2019s pointless. I can\u2019t shake it back into place. Bottom line, don\u2019t waste your money. The comforter is a real bummer.",

      "text": "I've had this comforter for 3 years now and it has gotten thinner and thinner with each passing year. Every few weeks I have to turn the comforter because (what's left of the feathers) will bunch up at the bottom. The people who designed this comforter weren't thinking. They put 2 inch holes in each box so the feathers could move around. Why??? So half my comforter ends up with no feathers? It makes absolutely no sense. To say the least I fully regret this purchase. My comforter is basically a flat pancake at this point. I have already started looking into other brands. I will repost when I find something better (which shouldn't be too hard)",

      "text": "We've had our comforters for two years and love them! We leave them on all year round (Missouri). They are lightweight but very cozy. I always keep duvet covers on my comforters, so these still look like they are brand new. I fluff them when I change the sheets and they fluff right up. I don't know about the 100% goose down part, and really don't care, these comforters keeps us warm and toasty, and they look great!",

I sleep cold, and this keeps me nice and warm, eliminating the need for extra blankets. The weight is great, too! You feel tucked in but not weighed down. Love it so much I bought the same one for my daughter (just a different size) when she wanted a new comforter.",

Nicely fluffy to make the bed comfy, but not too hot at all, even with the use of a weighted blanket during hot California summer nights! This one has little fabric ties in the corners for duvet covers. Very happy.",

    "description": "Size:Full/Queen\n\n Benefits of Using Down Comforter \n\nSleeping is the only time you allow yourself to get some rest. So why not get the most of out of it, right? \n\nThe benefits you\u2019ll enjoy once you start using a down comforter include \n\nIncomparable and longer warmth thanks to the blanket's ability to trap body heat within the filling. \n\nComfort during the summer season thanks to its breathability, allowing sweat and moisture to pass through the filling. This prevents your body from overheating even if you are a warm sleeper \n\nHigh Quality Stuffing \n\nOur down and feather are selected and disinfected strictly. With its high fluffyness and softness, our product can significantly improve users' sleeping quality. \n\nStorage Method \n\nMany people store their comforters during off seasons. The key to storing your comforter is breathability. \n\nLetting the down breathe by keeping your comforter in a cloth bag will prevent any moisture or odor build up. \n\nIt should also be stored in a location where it is not compressed and has room to stay fluffy. \n\nGive your comforter a good shake when you take it out of the bag next season and it should be ready to go\n\nPackage \n\nDown Comforter is vacuum packed during delivery. Please allow 24 hrs to recover its full loft. We recommend that you have your down comforter professionally dry cleaned",
