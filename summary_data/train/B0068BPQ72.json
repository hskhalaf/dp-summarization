SLIGHTLY big but def still wearable :) so obviously they run true to size :)",

It has okay light padding, but I prefer to have gel inserts that will help with my arch and the back of my foot.",

I hardly walked in them around the house, but just realized it wasn't worth it to have shoes I don't even want to wear. They are cute, and they have no arch support (being ballet flats and all), but I like the elastic stretch around the top of the shoe. These are going back and I'll try a half size larger.",

Elastic around top is just enough to keep shoe comfortably on, yet not so tight that it cuts or causes shoe to curl. I anticipate purchasing more as I will wear these all the time.
