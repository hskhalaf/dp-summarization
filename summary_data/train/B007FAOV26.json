I also have roseacea and this covers the redness completely, except when it's really bad. I started getting chemical peels and even with my skin being dry and flaking, this covers it really nicely. I'm obscenely happy with it and will stay with NARS and this product in particular.",

But I do have a few leftover TMs to blend it with (the Balm, CoverFx). In general i recommend. But do bear in mind what one reviewer mentioned about being ok with a yellowish cast. that works for me as i have some blotchy redness around my nose (yay).",
