      "text": "I passed the state exam on my first attempt but I will recommend that you get right to the nitty gritty! Immediately start taking the practice exams and keep taking them again and again and again and those exams are going to kick your butt! To be honest the state exam was no picnic either. I think the state exam tries to kick your butt just as hard as these practice exams but if it wasn\u2019t for those practice exams kicking my butt there isn\u2019t anyway I would of passed. Thank you John A. Yoegel for writing the book! I am on my way to that first million dollars! Whoo hoo!",

I found each chapter well laid out and the points well explained, some multiple times, but that\u2019s a positive as repetition helps in memorization, so I thought of it as a positive. At the end of each chapter it had practice questions with complete explanations as to why that particular answer was correct as well as why each incorrect answer was not correct. I found this book well worth the money for someone who\u2019s new to the exam process and looking to start from the beginning.",
