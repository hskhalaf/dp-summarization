I had been using a more expensive \"felt-tip\" type liner but when I saw this product first at Walmart then on Amazon I had to try it. It's GREAT, for me at least. First, the tip is just firm enough without being hard; there is some flexibility. For finer lines I use the tip only. For heavier lines I use it in a more horizontal, laid down position. Secondly, the gray color is dark enough without the harshness of black. I've re-ordered and am trying the brown color. Won't use another eyeliner as long as I can get this one.",

That worked. Second, when I applied it, sometimes I got a nice dark line and other times it seemed watery or washed out, and I had to keep going over the same place to get the color even. Third, by the beginning of the evening most of it had faded out and I looked like I needed to refresh my makeup. Very disappointing for a L'Oreal product.",

      "text": "This liner is better than a liquid, but better than a stick also! Somehow, this is like a thin-tipped pen for your eyes. I purchased a more expensive liquid liner from Sephora (Sephora brand) not too long ago. I spent about $15 on that liner. It was smudgy and always left a crease on my eyelid throughout the day! The L'Oreal Super Slim Liner dries extremely quickly, which helps to avoid that creasy mess! Also, it goes on very smooth. I cannot explain how much this solves my makeup problems! Whether you are looking to very thinly line your eyes, or are looking for more of a large swiped Amy Winehouse type of look, you MUST try this! A+++",

This might be a personal issue, though, because the other parts of the pen tip draw great...except for the very very top/tip. I've switched back to pencil liner and will be saving this for formal events because it just takes too long without a working tip.",
