This compounded with the fact that the unit is heavy towards the front means that when you try to move it, it tends to slip off your fingertips. Not a good, especially if the unit is hot at the time! Most importantly, this unit DOES NOT HAVE A TIP OVER SWITCH! It is important to note that some states require space heaters with tip over function when used in the work place and public buildings.

I was careful at the beginning and used the low settings and gradually upped the temperature settings till finally it has my confidence that the center council is not getting hot and isn\u2019t a fire hazard. I\u2019m sure this is not recommended by the manufacturer and fire safety standards for everyone else. I\u2019m happy with the heater.",

I have it plugged into a power strip with a few other things. I haven't seen any of the issues some others had with frying the outlet. I haven't had to turn the fan speed or temperature up to the max though. I have it sitting on a table top. I'm not sure if I'd feel comfortable setting it right on the high pile carpet in the room, but that's probably just me being paranoid.",
