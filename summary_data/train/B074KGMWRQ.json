Once you unscrew it from the safe, its held only by the electronics cable dangling from the control board. All electronics and wiring are exposed and ready for tampering or possible hacking. 2. Battery is on the outside, should be on the inside with redundancy for failure. 3. The door doesn't shut tightly with about 2-3mm wiggle space. Not sure how it can be fire resistant! 4. The reset button is located in an unsafe location on the inside. Can be accessed while locked. 4. Like all safes in its class, it will not deter a determined thief.",

First, the battery can be changed without opening the safe. For storing things long term, without wanting to risk exposure of the contents of the safe, this was a must for me. Secondly, removal of the battery does not reset the combination. Finally, combinations can be up to eight digits long, as opposed to some (more expensive) safes that only have four or five digit maximums. Build quality seems fine enough that I'm confident it will serve my needs for many years to come",

The keypad has an unusual arrangement (i.e. not telephone-keypad arrangement). Easy to set your own combination.

I called Amazon customer service but they would not honor any warranty and I had to buy another safe. The bottom line: Don't buy. Cheap electronics that don't last.",
