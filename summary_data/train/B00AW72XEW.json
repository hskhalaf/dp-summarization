I am extremely pleased considering I never use a self-feeding weed wacker before. My old weed wacker I would have to manually cut and feed the line every time. It was all so much larger bulkier and heavier compared to this. What I really like about this weed wacker is it has a wheel to rest on when edging. Because of the ease of use I was able to Edge my entire yard within half the time he used to take me.",

Once the motor had snapped off the wires ripped right out of the motor. Three uses for this kind of money is the biggest waste I've spent on lawn care.

A two-in-one remedy would be to include a strap that work both as a shoulder sling and a hanging aid.

This is also a useful feature when using the trimmer in weed eating mode. Only minus is the lack of a safety switch to prevent you from starting the trimmer by accidentally pressing the trigger when adjusting or connecting it.",
