My laptop doesn't have a number pad and I didn't like the \"laggy-ness\" of Bluetooth number pads so I gave this a shot. It also has a single USB port of its own, so - if you already use a wired mouse - you can use this without having to sacrifice any additional ports. It doesn't weigh anything, but the buttons feel \"solid.\" Best of all, it includes a button we've all wanted to push from time to time (see picture). ;-) (nb. It's a backspace key.)",
