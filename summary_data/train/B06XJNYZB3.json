I am 13 and this is my first Babolat racket and I can tell this is my best investment yet. $99 is a lot to me but it gives a lot of bang for your buck. I would strongly recommend this product to everyone ready to step up their game. Update, I have had this racket for around a month now and it still is holding up great and worth every penny I spent. If you\u2019re thinking about this product you will be happy you purchased it!",

This racket hasn't been out of our house or hit a single ball. Just touched. So maybe I will start playing tennis now since I have a nice un-used racket.",
