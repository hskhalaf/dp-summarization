I was just hit by the HDMI/Network board issue - just google for \"TX-NR609 No Audio No Network\" Talking to the people at onkyo and via their website recall page, my specific receiver is not one of the affected; however, my lack of audio and all the other symptoms which are EXACTLY THE SAME beg to differ... Now this is another piece of garbage to throw out... Onkyo wants more than i paid for the receiver to fix it... will not be buying another onkyo again, their customer support is terrible.",

I haven't even received the capacitors yet, but will probably take them up on their offer. They could have taken the easy way out, but they seem to be standing behind their product. 01/16/17 - Unit was repaired and is still working well.",

The HDMI out is having issues, but from reading the forums, its pretty common for the NR606 and 609 to fail right after 2 years. It started with the HDMI going out for a few minutes. I'd turn it off and on and most of the time it would come back - terrible for watching a movie. This week though it just failed altogether. Sound was fine but no picture. Nothing could get it to work. It's just dead. There are some videos on replacing the HDMI capacitors and perhaps I will try that but what a pain for an expensive receiver that is 2 years old.",

Their second solution was that I ship the unit to a repair center; rather than live without TV and music for six to eight weeks, I'm probably just going to eat it and buy a receiver from a better manufacturer. My advice: buy a better-reviewed brand, like Yamaha. You don't want the static, trust me.",

I love the way Onkyos sound, but they just don't last at all. I am very disappointed.",

I would and have recommended this receiver to friends and family. The wireless dongle for WiFi was disappointing, I somehow missed that it only worked with audio files.

The unit gets extremely hot and I'm guessing that this has caused some components within the unit to fail. Sad, really, as I liked it.

These channels carry ambient, non-directional audio that adds a new vertical dimension to your movies and games. Audyssey DSX provides a similar front-height speaker option that likewise works to create a more enveloping home theater experience.\n\nCHANGE YOUR RECEIVER'S SETTINGS SEAMLESSLY\nThanks to Onkyo's overlaid graphical on-screen display (OSD), set-up menus appear on top of the video image you're watching, so you don't have to switch to a blank screen background.
