      "text": "I love these sneakers and so does my toddler! I fell in love with this style while shopping in the Puma store however they didn't have his size. He wears a size 8 but these are cut smaller than \"normal\" size 8 shoes for toddlers so I will be exchanging for the next size up. Other than that great design, vibrant colors, and we haven't had the opportunity to wear them yet to comment on the lighting up aspect of his sneaks.",
