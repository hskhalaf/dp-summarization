I included a shot of the moon I took yesterday (10-2-17) at 100x zoom and no tripod or anything to steady my hand. This is a great camera.",

What sold me on this camera was its zoom ability, it's stabilizer (more and more important since I'm aging and have a slight tremor now), and the fact that it had a viewfinder. I could never get used to not using a viewfinder. So even though it's a bit chunky and heavier than those cute pocket cameras, I made the right choice for me.",

A powerful processor reduces graininess for crisper, higher-quality close-ups. Say goodbye to blur Optical SteadyShot\u00ae image stabilization reduces shake and blur by countering camera movements in both horizontal and vertical directions.\u00b3 Active 3-Way stabilization adds digital rolling control that counters clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation, resulting in more stable videos even at long focal lengths. Pixel Power With a 20.4-megapixel Exmor\u00ae R CMOS sensor, capture high-resolution images that take full advantage of the camera's high quality Carl Zeiss\u00ae lens. Advanced processing technology reduces noise and graininess for incredibly crisp, clear images - even in challenging low-light conditions.

Since you can angle the LCD so it's facing towards you, you'll be able to frame the shot exactly as you want. It's also convenient for shooting subjects situated at a low angle - snapping photos of children at their eye level. Never miss the moment Capture full 20.4 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, a mechanical shutter helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects. \nProduct description and full feature list Explore the full range of features and options below. \nIntelligent Sweep Panorama\u2122\nmode-up to 360\u00b0\nIntelligent Sweep Panorama mode takes our Sweep Panorama function to the next level with the addition of motion compensation. Even when subjects are moving in the foreground of your landscape, these cameras can detect faces and moving subjects, intelligently stitching different widths together to minimize distortion. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and up to 360\u00b0 full circle, the camera can take a variety of panoramic shots.\n\n\n\nPicture Effects\nPicture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes.
