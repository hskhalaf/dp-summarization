      "text": "This is a great little speaker system for use with iPods or other mp3 players ( I use it with an iPod Classic 120 gig ). It's best feature by far is the 10 hour rechargeable battery that make this unit totally portable. They sound great and the battery life is wonderful! Recently took it on a trip to the coast where we had a great little cabin rented. With this unit I was able to have music by the hot tub, front deck where there was a great view of the ocean, in the loft, bedroom, kitchen .. You name it! Anywhere I wanted access to my entire library I had it! It was great!! Totally recommend this product!",

The remote is small enough to fit in your pocket or leave on the windowsill. The sound quality is good for such small speakers. Obviously not as good as Bose, but for the price very good. I didn't want to spend the money on Bose or the other high-end speakers. I am very pleased with these speakers, especially for the price. They even came with a carrying case so you can take them on vacation or camping or whatever.",

I thought the sound was great for the size and price so I bought the \"bigger brother\" in the Logitech lineup (the Logitech Pure-Fi Elite) for myself expecting greater things and I was very disappointed (except for the clock) when comparing the two. If I had to do it over I'd buy the 'Anywhere' for myself as well and I might just do that anyway. Great sound for the money (limited bass of course) and worth a demo if you are considering an iPod dock, especially when a comparable competitor for this unit cost 3 times as much.",

I am so glad that I spent the money. If you are even considering a set of speakers - look noi further. I am a very picky person - even more so when it comes to my music. They are amazing!!",

It includes adapters for all ipods, a remote control that works well, a charger that lets you wrap the cord neatly and a nice zipper case that holds it all. The internal batteries hold a good charge, so you can listen to your music for several hours. And the Amazon price could not be matched anywhere. This is one of my favorite \"toys\".",

It was the same result with every one of them. It works fine but forget bringing it on trips to the beach, pool,park, etc... which, in my opinion, is the main reason most people invest in these.",

We have tried everything, but after you turn it on, it plays the first song for one minute and then goes dead. Seems this happens with these, and logitech never responds. We've tried resetting the Ipod, recharging all of the batteries, etc. No luck.",
