I bought shims that were $50 bucks each and bed bath and beyond and I walked out thinking I can\u2019t believe I spent 100 bucks on 2 decorative pillow shams! So I got on amazon looking for something cheaper. Found these and bought them and returned the other ones. Ya maybe they are quite as great as bed bath and beyond. But for a decorative piece on a bed these are great! And it comes with two for this price! It\u2019s so great! In my photos they are the middle white pillows (between the red and the tan pillow shams)",
