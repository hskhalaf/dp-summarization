I had to take it off and put my old sheath on to finish the hunt. Snaps seem to be made of a soft cheap material. I hope to replace all the snaps and actually use this item for something other than looks.",

However your blade is the exact dimensions they give so when you slide your blade in the first time you cut the sewing on it and it's ruined and the first three in that you put it in.,... I will never order anything from them again and I can't return it because of their ineptitude and providing the correct information based on the exact size of the blade not what was made.... Totally pissed!",
