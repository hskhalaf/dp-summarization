The multiple probs are a must have when smoking, I use one to just monitor the temps inside the smoker and the others go into the meat. I set the temp ranges which is very easy to do either using the preset temps or adding your customer temps, then I go inside and monitor my iPhone. You will get alarms on your phone for high or low temp setting or when the desired temps are achieved; all of this can be modified very easily. Without this BBQ Grill Thermometer I probably wouldn't enjoy cooking outside near a much.",

I have not yet used more than one probe at the same time but it is accurate and well-made. I also love the temperature graph that tells you not only where you are but how quickly you are reaching your target temp which allows for adjustment of the temp if a longer cooking time is desired for tenderness. In all, I am very happy with it and I consider it hands-down better than the Weber (although the Weber was a great thermometer and served me for a lot of years).",

The claim of 200' outdoors and 100' indoors is false. I can be standing indoors less than 25' away and looking at my grill through the window and it constantly loses connection.

Live in AZ and in the summer this is a lifesaver not having to go out in the heat every 20 minutes to test. Wish the heat chart persisted the entire cooking time but I had to run to the store at some point and the chart reset when I reconnected. But highly recommend!",

Alarm sounds because the meat surpassed the stall and you are then blessed with a wonderfully cooked meat of your choice. No matter what size!",
