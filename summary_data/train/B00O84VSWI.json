The price you cannot beat, I will be purchasing this from the seller as long as they offer it. Truly an awesome option for the moderate to even slightly heavy shipper!

This product is wonderful. Pliable and easy to use, and the perforations work great. They don't tear apart unless you pull them, and then they separate quite easily. I would recommend this to anyone, and will definitely order more in the future. Plus it arrived super fast!",
