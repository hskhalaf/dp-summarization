It makes standard television shows burst right out of the screen with crisp vivid color and detail. For the price, this is a no-brainer buy, very pleased...",

It upscales normal HD to UHD wonderfully. I saw some negative comments about the stand quality, but in all honesty .. I didn\u2019t use it. I needed a pedestal type stand and ordered that separately (PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand - Table Top TV Stand for 23-49 inch LCD LED TVs - only $26.99). I\u2019m quite happy about that too.",

A week after, the signals from the consoles don't register but do work on my TCL Roku TV. Disappointing product from LG. I guess I'll get another TCL Roku TV. Once I get my refund.

      "text": "Great picture but setting up was bi\\ of a challenge. . I used the verbal assist while setting up which was awful. She sounded like a robot on steroids. Spoke 3 times faster than a normal human. Reminded me of those radio commercials where some legal stuff must be disclosed. where the announcer speaks fast at the end of the commercial. Awful! I finally figured out how to shut her up. I do wish that a manual had been included. The TV does so much but I will probably miss a lot. The least they can do is put a link to a PDF manual",
