Though the true plus point of this umbrella is the material of the canopy. It is extremely water repellant and does not take much effort to shake any excess water off of it. If you are being thorough, it actually possible to put the umbrella back in it case nearly completely dry. Last but not least, the material for the canopy is also surprisingly soft and easily to tie up with the strap; adding to the comfort and joy of using this somewhat large umbrella on raining days.",

Sure, you can get a cheaper umbrella, but if you want something that retains a more formal appearance, you can't get better than this. It opens/closes easily, and it just feels like a quality item.

If you need to give an attacker a solid punch to the gut/other areas, leave the bag on and push the button. With about 40 pounds of focused punch, you can take the mugger's wallet. That you push the button and the canopy folds is just cool. You better eat your Wheaties though, pushing the rod back down towards the handle required a little effort - unless you work smarter and not harder. Place the canopy against a desk or counter and use your weight to firmly press down on the handle. Problem solved!",

Nice size, enough for two people really close to each other, however, that makes it big enough to take some space in your bag. Is also not as lightweight as other models. Not a truly travel umbrella, I think, more like a city umbrella. When folded, the only way to hold it folded is through the loop in the carrying pouch, because the umbrella itself doesn't have any loop or strap to hold it directly.

I used it for the first time a week ago and I was showing it off to everyone that wanted to see but when I reached the store and pushed the button to close it nothing. It would not close. Got out the store and nothing it would not close. I am going to buy another one as I think the date has passed to return or exchange. I still love this umbrella and no one else has told me that they had any problems.",

It feels very well made, I hope it holds up to extended use over time. The handle feels nice; not some crappy plastic handle like most other umbrellas have. My only complaint is that the loop you can hold it from when folded up is on the umbrella's case. So unless you put it back in it's case after use, it's harder to carry since there isn't a loop attached directly to it. I miss that, but not a huge deal.",

If you plan on only using it in light rain, and are careful with it, it's not bad. If you want an umbrella that can handle more sever weather/strong winds, I would look for a more durable brand.
