I would rather have heavier duty kennels that can take a little more abuse than these because we do have little kids around from time to time and they like to lean on the kennels and look at the dogs and puppies and these kennels are already bowed straight out of the box.",

The bars bend so easily and the welding just pops off with minimal pressure. I swear this kennel falls apart if you look at it wrong and it ended up in the recycling bin after a month of use.

The only bad thing I can say is if you don't have a dog that is ok with being kenneled this is not the crate for you. It's pretty thin and can easy be gotten out of. My dog doesn't mind being kenneled so it's pretty much a formality so I know he isn't wondering around but if he really wanted to get out it would be super easy for him to break out. The tray is also pretty flimsy so count on replacing that eventually. I just use mine without the tray.",

This cage is very simple to fold up or down for transport and the three doors ensure that you always have easy access. My only complaint is that somehow my dog can get the bottom lock unlatched and squeeze himself out if he feels rebellious enough - but for the incredibly cheap price - that's a flaw I can live with.",
