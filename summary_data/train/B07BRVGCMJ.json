      "text": "I got the orange case, the color is bright and has lasted 10+ months since I purchased it. The rubber feet on the bottom have fallen off, but the case has gotten heavy use with daily travel to and from school/work so I was not surprised. For such an inexpensive case, I have been happily surprised and just recommended this brand to a family member for their new computer. I have had Speck cases in the past; I do not foresee this case lasting quite as long, but for the price ($14 compared to Speck's $50) I was happy to get a fun color and not worry if it doesn't last for years.",
