The touchscreen did not work properly during winter months and now it has stopped working completely.... and let's not even talk about the cracked screen. There are only 3 people at home who use this lock and the screen has tons of cracks, I am thinking it is from the sun but regardless of what is causing it, the look is not appealing at all. Please consider another brand.",

This model has a touchscreen that is very finicky. The least amount of natural oil on your fingers and it will not work. It has to be cleaned almost every day with a microfiber cloth for it to reliably accept the codes. In addition, the older and less costly models incorporate a slide mechanism for eventual battery changes. This model's rear housing has to be unscrewed for a battery change, and if your door happens to have decorative moulding near the lock, good luck with that!",
