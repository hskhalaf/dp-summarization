In the new project, the look of the weld makes a difference. With the new Auto-darkening helmet, I can make a great weld - an no grinding afterward! Love it!",

      "text": "I have owned this helmet for about 3 four years and as most have said, this is a very good helmet in most respects. My only meaningful complaint is the fact it has only two sensors. Most of the time this is not a problem at all, but I will say this becomes a real annoyance when I am in a difficult welding position working within close quarters on an assembly of framing for instance. The sensors become blocked from by the framing and I get flashed over and over again. Is also disappointing the helmet jumped about $50 from my original purchase price, I guess due to demand.",

That was replaced... 3rd helmet, remember I only bought one... now it\u2019s acting up again. Flickering like a strobe on off while welding. And getting brighter even though shade is on 13.",

As mentioned no cut or grind mode so if that is a big factor in your choosing, look elsewhere. Protective lenses are a bit pricey (just like Miller esab etc) however last about 10 times longer than standard protective lenses (more scratch resistant).",
