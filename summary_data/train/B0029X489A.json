While I was expecting the lint roller with a curvy handle (as pictured), instead I received a slim/straight handle lint roller. The design I received has a tendency to snag clothes or pull thread if the head of the lint roller comes in contact with the clothes. I feel the product picture is misleading and should be updated. Please see my picture for the actual product you will receive.",

She likes to sit on our bed and lay atop our clothing after we put it out. My husband's uniform is navy, most mornings I have to remove Pepper (cat) and her hair from his clothing. This does not get it up in one forward roll, I have to go over it several times, but the sheet does not stick after one complete roll over and back. Also, trying to get Pepper's hair off of black clothing, I use about 3 sheets. Very disappointed!",
