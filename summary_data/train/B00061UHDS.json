The look, the feel, handling, image quality and the many, many features are just what I was looking for in a DSLR. The focal plane dust removal system is unmatched by Canon and Nikon. The imager chip used is the Kodak KAF8300CE, a high performance CCD. Since one of my intended applications is astrophotography, I am interested in the ultimate in performance from my DSLR. I would recommend this DSLR to anyone interested in having the best! The purchase was from Adorama by way of Amazon.",

It is sharper than any of the others. There are minor complaints about color acuracy, but that is a lot easier to fix than lack of sharpness. Very powerful flash. Amazing for its size. Nice weight and balance. If you want a DSLR this is really the best you can get for under $1000 and that is with 2 lenses.",

Now the great thing about this camera is that you can pick the types of photographic scenes you'll be taking in automatic setup or you can customize scene exposures and other photography features like in the oldschool 35mm cameras did such as so you can get streak in lights and other effects that the old film cameras were able to do. The pictures come out superbly. The only negetive I have to say is, the manual could use a little improvement and their is a sound when you photograph that's it. If you can live with those two faults, then its an awesome camera to get. Merry x-mas",

    "title": "Olympus Evolt E300 8MP Digital SLR with Zuiko 14-45mm f/3.5-5.6 Digital SLR Lens",
    "description": "Style:E300 with 14-45mm LensThe Olympus Evolt SLR digital camera eliminates most photographic limitations. Advances in design make for a durable and portable compact camera you can trust and take anywhere. The exclusive, patented Supersonic Wave Filter automatically removes dust from the CCD every time the camera is turned on to reduce dust spots caused from changing lenses. Other features include 8MP FFT CCD; TruePic Turbo image processor for increased speed and smoother image results; 1.8\" HyperCrystal TFT color LCD for clear viewing of images up to a 160\u00b0 angle; TTL optical viewfinder; built-in pop-up flash; PictBridge compatibility allowing you to print without a PC; full-speed USB 2.0; Compact Flash Card (Type I, II); self-timer and remote control. Imported. 2-1/2Wx5-3/4Lx3-1/4H\". 20-1/2 oz.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Olympus Evolt E-300 is a 100% digital SLR camera that eliminates any photographic limitations. A powerful 8-megapixel CCD combines with interchangeable Zuiko digital lenses, our exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter, and other cutting-edge technologies to make for world-class images. Advances in design make for a durable and portable compact camera you can take and trust anywhere. It features impressively fast shooting and operating speeds that ensure you never miss a photo op, and the ability to switch lenses and add flashes so you never miss a beat. \n\n \n\nImage Quality \nAlong with the advantages provided by the 8-megapixel Full Frame Transfer CCD and Olympus's exclusive dust-eliminating Supersonic Wave Filter, images captured with the Evolt E-300 benefit from a number of additional technologies as well.  The included Zuiko 14-45mm f3.5-5.6 digital SLR lens (equivalent to 28-90mm in 35mm photography) is perfectly matched with the 4/3-type image sensor to deliver light more directly to each of the imager's pixels. Its 3.2x zoom covers a broad range, with close-ups coming out crisp and clear as near as 15 inches/38 cm. A new multicoating minimizes ghosting and flaring, while the sturdy metal lens mount ensures rugged durability. Features 12 elements in 10 groups and a weight of just 9.98 ounces/285 grams. \n\n Furthermore, the camera's TruePic TURBO image processor offers significantly improved image quality and combines with anti-blooming technology on each pixel to eliminate undesirable artifacts, moir\u00e9 patterns, and other aberrations that can appear. \n\nDust Free\nDust has long been an issue in digital photography. The Evolt E-300 features Olympus's exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter that dramatically reduces dust and other particles that settle on the image sensor. Located between the shutter and the CCD, the Supersonic Wave Filter uses high-speed ultrasonic vibration to cause dust and other microelements to fall off and be collected and held so they don't affect photographs. This filter vibrates at 350,000 times per second and is automatically activated upon powering up the camera (or manually via the menu) to render dust harmless. This unique technology provides both the freedom and comfort to shoot and interchange lenses with the confidence that your images won't be damaged or ruined by dust ever again. Built-In Pop-Up Flash\nThis new flash design allows close-up flash photography without the typical \"lens shadow.\" The flash housing pops up and then forward to better illuminate subjects when using a wide-angle lens at close shooting distances. High Speed\nDon't you hate shutter lag? Put an end to annoying waiting times with the high-speed performance of the Evolt E-300. Because it's equipped with our TruePic TURBO image processor, the Evolt E-300 is able to deliver fast image data processing for the files generated by this powerful digital camera. TruePic TURBO also has a huge impact on overall camera responsiveness as it accelerates the camera's startup time, decreases the shutter release lag time so you can capture images more rapidly, and provides quicker image playback for instant gratification. The Evolt E-300 also lets you capture fast-paced action with a quick 2.5-frames-per-second burst mode, and keeps you shooting fast for longer periods of time with its 64 MB image memory buffer and separate working memory for camera controls. Scene Program Modes\nEver wonder how to achieve the results you want without complicated and time-consuming camera settings? The Evolt E-300 lets you choose among 14 shooting options so you can concentrate on your composition and leave the settings to us.  \n\nDurability\nYou can't achieve high performance without a highly durable camera. The Evolt E-300 is built to keep you and your images at an optimum level no matter where or when you use it, due to its sturdy and reliable design. An aluminum top cover provides added protection for the camera while giving it a sophisticated feel. The die-cast aluminum chassis provides a strong foundation for a camera that can be used in all kinds of conditions. The metallic lens mount is further evidence of the camera's ruggedness while also supporting the use of interchangeable lenses, up to the largest telephotos in the E-System family. It boasts a durable shutter. And its exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter repels dust and debris from the Evolt E-300\u2019s 8-megapixel CCD so each and every image you capture is crystal clear and aberration free, just as you saw it through the lens. \n\nSize\nUtilizing new concepts and new technologies, the Evolt E-300 boasts a radical new body design that makes it incredibly comfortable to hold and impressively appealing to use. Most digital SLR designs are based on traditional 35mm camera models. But innovations in digital photography have enabled us to provide an innovative design that stands out from the rest. Eliminating the bulky pentaprism commonly found on top of traditional SLRs, the Evolt E-300 incorporates a new and exclusive Olympus TTL Optical Porro Finder coupled with an exclusive side swing mirror that enables the unique flat-top appearance to be realized and increased portability to be attained. \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n\n * Evolt E-300 body \n *  14-45mm f3.5-5.6 lens \n *  USB cable \n *  Video cable \n *  Lithium-ion battery pack (BLM-1) \n *  Lithium-ion battery charger (BCM-2) \n *  Audio/video cable \n *  Shoulder strap \n *  Olympus Master Editing software \n *  CD-ROM \n *  Manuals \n *  Warranty card \n *  System chart",
