      "text": "I love the product. Very well built and very sturdy. Caution when hanging though, here are a few tips: 1) The template did not exactly match the mounting bracket. It was off about 3/16\". Before drilling, put the unit on top of the template and mark through the holes in the mounting bracket. 2) If you are going into drywall, not a stud, use the toggle anchors that come with the package. Don't use the flimsy plastic anchors. 3) Add stainless steel washers - especially in the bottom two holes. It needs them.",

Since my laundry room is tiny, we inverted the rack and installed it above a doorway, using a step stool (also from Amazon!) to access it -- see photos. My husband, as always, ignored the template and directions yet easily installed it (without disassembling it) in less than 15 minutes including the time it took to grab some extra toggle bolts for security. One nice thing about installing over a doorway was that the studs were placed precisely right, which is hit-or-miss elsewhere in this 50 year old house.",
