I can count my pulse at 160 and the watch will report anything from 98 to 134 or so. Same throughout the aerobic and anaerobic ranges. That makes the watch useless to me. On top of that, it just doesn't provide anything really useful other than average heart rate (not your high and low in real time during a workout).

I tried all the tips to improve the accuracy but without success. It's not worth paying all this money for the quality, and last year it was about $185 if I remember correctly.",

When I used it to run 2.0 miles on a 400 m track, the 2.0 miles recorded about 50-100m past the finish line. I compared it to my friend's Garmin F235 and his 2.0 miles ended exactly on the finish line. Due to the error in estimating distance, my pace per mile was much slower than actual. I returned this watch as the most important variable for training and races for me is pace, not heartrate. My old Garmin F15 was very accurate in pace/distance.",

It was easy to use and had everything one would expect from a running watch--time, distance, speed, calories burned, heart rate, etc. The problem is the heart rate monitor does not function properly. It's sporadic, and oftentimes will not pick up your heart rate. I had to shut the watch off a few times just to get it to reset. I returned one watch because of this problem and got another. But I had the same problem with the second watch too, so if someone is looking for a reliable heart rate monitor, I would not recommend this watch. Everything else, however, functioned properly.",
