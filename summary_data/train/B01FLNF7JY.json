It works well for infants, babies, and young children. Gently slide this cute baby support pillow behind the baby\u2019s neck, make sure they are down to the bottom of your baby\u2019s neck, and pull the lower-end of the \u201cears\u201d to be slightly in front of your baby\u2019s shoulders.",
      "RECOMMENDED SUPPORT - There is no padding behind the neck so the baby\u2019s head isn\u2019t pushed forward, simply supported from the sides. The Baby Elephant Ears pillow gives gentle neck and head support for baby and infants.",
