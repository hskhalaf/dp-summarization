Perfect for 4 adults. I put the other two chairs away for later use. 6 adults on this table would be cramped. Super simple to put together. Seems sturdy. Finish is good as well as the glass top. I took one star off because I thought it would seat 6. I think it looks great for a small little table.",

Chairs are sturdy and easy to assemble, just follow instructions to not tighten screws until after chair is loosely assembled, balanced and pieces are aligned. Each takes about 8 minutes to assemble using lessons learned from first assembly. A cordless drill makes it even faster. Tom p.s. Ms Jennie G. the boxes are ready for pickup.
