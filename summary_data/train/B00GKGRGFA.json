      "text": "I have used it for more than a month. It helps me to maintain my daily activities while suffering from lower back pain. I could even drive for 2000 miles on a long trip wearing this belt. I have also tried another brand belt but I really like the flexibility and the just right amount of heat and support of this one better. I have got a nickname \"black belt\" master from my sumi painting students. Isn't that cool? I just bought a second one as a spare belt.",

      "text": "It's pretty good. It hurts on bare skin, and I have to wear it all day, so I use moisture wicking shirts under my clothes. By the end of the day (8-12 hrs) it hurts, but it has a broad area of support, and the support is evenly distributed. It's more supportive than the runner up, but I hope it lasts at least as long.",
