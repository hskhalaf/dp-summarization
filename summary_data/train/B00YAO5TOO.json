      "text": "Pro: Used for 9 days in Hawai'i shore snorkeling. Also purchased US Divers Fin leash (additional purchase) to reduce chance of losing these nice fins. The fins will fit in most 25-27 inch luggage. Glad I got this larger version of fin--allows comfortable snorkeling with a slow steady kick. With smaller travel fins you have to kick like crazy. Con: Getting in and out of the water, more cumbersome of course. Had to sand down rough edges and manufacturing bumps on the yellow plastic sides to reduce the chance of getting cut or abraded while handling and swimming.",

They work as intended and I've owned them for about 8 months and have had no issues with the quality or durability. I would buy more in the future and would easily recommend them.",

The scuba fins were too heavy for travel and the travel fins were too small for me the keep up with my partner. These are perfect.",

There were no apparent flaws, and the fin worked just fine through multiple dives and snorkeling excursions. They are light and easily strapped to a backpack for day trips. Very happy with my purchase.",
