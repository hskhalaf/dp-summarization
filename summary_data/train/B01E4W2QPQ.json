      "text": "Anyone complaining about the bass on this probably making some rookie mistakes: misusing the EQ on their media player and/or is playing poorly compressed low fidelity media. Download/stream HQ media and turn your EQ completely off. If you have HQ media then you shouldn't need the EQ unless you're trying to compensate/adjust in relation to your sound system's strengths and weaknesses. This is a general rule and not just for this item. I tested the bass on this with the following songs: Dead Prez - Hip Hop; The Fugees - Fu-gee-la; GZA - Fame. No distortion whatsoever. This product is louder and sounds better than my Anker SoundCore Bluetooth speaker.",

Thank you Aukey, 2 months in and the device constantly loses connection to our phones and the speaker is pretty much blown out. We never approached maxing out the volume on this thing. bummer....",

Don't expect a massive sound system, but it sounds really good. I put every genre I had on it. Rock, metal, rap, pop, country, classical. It all sounded good. I paired it with my phone and laptop (MAC) very quickly. For the price and quality, this is a 5 star purchase ! The only downfall is I'll have to hide it from my 15 year old so he won't take it over !",

So that was the 3rd. This last one is for my son\u2019s Christmas present because he likes to entertain and this is perfect for his need.

Usually I would think that would be a good thing but the sound quality on this speaker sounds hollow. The Honstek provides a rich full sound. It is hard to describe sounds into words but imagine listening to an AM radio, that it the Aukey, and then listening to FM radio, that is the Honstek K9. I returned the Aukey and bought a second Honstek K9.",

Doesn't distort and the bass is great for the size. Honestly, I'm surprised this speaker isn't going for 60 to 70 dollars.",
