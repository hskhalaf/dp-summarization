This knife has a little button, which is easy to push, and then you easily slide the blade back in. The \"case\" that comes with it is little small; but there is a belt clip which makes access MUCH easier anyway. The blades are good and sharp. Also, I like the heft of it in my hand...not cheap plastic; but not too heavy either. Definitely a great buy, and it works perfectly.",

This is contrary to traditional fixed blade folding knives, which has the locking mech in the handle of the knife parallel to the blade, which makes me feel uneasy when folding the knife back. Bought this specifically cause it can swap out blades but act as a folding knife. Feels quite durable and is a light knife, very similar to fixed blade knives of the same size. Should also not fail like utility knives with the spring mechanism, which I have seen with a few.",

The Fancii is a little cheaper, cuts a little better out of the box and comes with five blades instead of just one. I didn't expect much from the included blades, though, and also got someblades which cut at least as well and might last longer. They fit both knifes.",
