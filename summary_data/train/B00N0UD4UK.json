I was looking for something that was just a little lower cut, more 'hipster' style. This is not these...they fit almost like briefs. Second, because of the material mix, if you use any kind of panty liner/pad, they do not stay in place. The crotch area is not 100% cotton but rather a mix with nylon/spandex. This causes the adhesive strip on panty liners/pads not to stick or stay in place. They stick very lightly and eventually move around. They are comfortable but these 2 issues will keep me from purchasing again.",

Also, it's worth noting that they don't stick well to pantyliners and pads - they end up folding up and sliding around on the seat.

      "text": "These undies are made of very soft synthetic material. They are very comfortable. They are VERY HIGH and come all the way up to my belly button. Definitely granny panties. That is great for what I am using them for. I am wearing them with high wasted leggings while hiking and they are perfect. They stay put and stay dry. Highly recommend if you\u2019re looking for some high wasted undies for comfort. I am a size 12-14 so I ordered size 7 (large) and they fit perfectly",

Long story short, they were a pleasant surprise and I will probably buy more!!",
