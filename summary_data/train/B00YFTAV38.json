      "text": "I've owned a number of pressure washers, and never have I seen one this bad! I am waiting to get my return authorization so that I can send it back. Unit is very flimsy. Wheels are so loose they shake when you roll it. Pressure wand feels like it's ready to break at any minute. And it ran for only about 3 minutes before it smelled like the rings were burning up in the engine! Oil level is perfect, and I use only ethanol-free gas in my engines, so this is definitely a manufacturing defect of some kind. I promise it will be the last Wen product that I will ever buy.",

Vibrated excessively and sounded like engine was having problems whenever trigger was pulled for pressure washing. Water pump was leaking also and that would continue to get worse. Sending back for refund. Lot of work to drain oil, gas, and repack for shipping. Quite a pain for a well reviewed item. Won't buy a WEN product again.",

But after 8 weeks ,the machine just stopped working.I am sending it back for repair or replacement after trying what the Tech suggested . Customer service is good so far , so I will review again, when replacement comes in. No new warranty with new item... So new item gets only 7.4 months instead of a year like a regular new item .

It has more than enough washing power for sidings, steps and walks. It is easy to move around. It is easy to set up and tear down. It feels very well built and I expect it to last a long time before I need to replace anything.",
