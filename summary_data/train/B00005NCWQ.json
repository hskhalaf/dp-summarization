Second (and most importantly) is that the glass bulb does not stay tight and secure on the top of the pot. I screw it on until it feels tight and secure, but when I go to remove the lid, the glass just comes out and it is quite difficult to pry the lid off. It seems like the glass notch on the side of the glass isn't big enough. Too bad because I love this coffee pot.",

I call that really good customer service. My previous pot was fine for a few years, until the plastic knob broke off into the pot. That's replaceable.",

However there is a design flaw, the curvature of the top prevents you from fully rinsing/draining when inverting with the lid removed. That convex edge retains water and stray coffee grounds that escape the basket. In theory you should be able to pour this residual water/grounds through the spout, but the opening to the spout is ever so slightly flared the wrong way, again trapping what you want to discard. Frustrating to fully clean and I tend to avoid using it as a result.",

We wanted something practical and multi functional for the tiny camper and this fit the bill. We can use it inside or outside over propane. I watched a few videos on using one and all results have been amazing. I love that the coffee is really hot and stays that way. This unit is good quality and easy to clean. Just the right size for two of us to have several cups. I would buy this again.",

      "text": "This percolator makes a great cup of coffee and well worth the 15-20 minute total cook time! I\u2019ve had this pot for 7-8 months and use it only on the weekends, and just this past weekend the glass knob broke but not sure how. I was soooo bummed when I took it out to make coffee, I searched high and low for a replacement knob but could not find an adequate replacement so I caved and bought a universal plastic one and I really hope it works. Aside from that I contacted Farberware today and was told to file a warranty claim so I did, wish me luck cause I really really want my percolator to work.",
