The size is my favorite part, it's compact, but had the option of larger lenses, not just the one it comes with. It's light and I traveled around Europe with it and it takes amazing pictures! It was not a burden to carry around and overall I've been pleased with it. I even has small info things that you can read about each setting and what it is best used for etc. which as an 'amateur' who knows very little about camera settings, it's very helpful.",
