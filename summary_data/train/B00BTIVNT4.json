Just a few minutes into the cooking cycle the rice caught fire then the entire pot. It even burned a hole in the bottom. The entire house smelled for days and cleaning the microwave was a chore. There is no way I can return it for credit but I do have several pictures showing damage but there is not a method to communicate that to Amazon. All I want is a refund but there is no one to talk to.. I do not want a replacement.",

When it's hot, there's no place to really get a good grip on it, so the feet will loosen the glass tray in the oven if I tilt it slightly.

Rice came out perfect the first time. Love the rice paddle, easy to handle, stores inside. Update 10/18.... Still love this. It also works great for Quinoa and the pre-seasoned rice packets.",

I like using my microwave for cooking rice, but I don't want to have to worry about plastic tupperware types of containers that might leach. Before knowing about the possible drawbacks, I used to use old butter containers. Now I try to be more careful. This rice/pasta cooker is supposed to be safe for cooking, and it does cook nice, fluffy rice.",

I will say that it is a 5 star product, but I only gave it 4 because of 2 things. 1 it is plastic so I can't put butter or any other flavoring that is oil based in it. 2 It would benefit from a lid you can use to seal it for storing the left overs. Other than that this thing is great. It does take some trail and error if you use different kinds of rice.",

The best part is that it actually fits in the short hotel microwaves. Highly recommend.",
