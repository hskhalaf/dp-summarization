The fold is only sewed on one side, leaving an extra flap that has to be folded in after washing and is a problem on a pillow. On the subject of washing, the color faded the fist time I washed it, not the point of looking old and worn, but the color is less bright, muddy. Based on the reviews, I ordered three different colors: red,blue, green. I'm sorry I did. I should have only bought one to see what the quality was. I won't be buying more.",

These Nestl pillowcases are pretty comparable. My only dislike with it is that I thought the lines on the side were a bit more pronounced than they are in real life. Not a huge deal, though.",

These sheets felt great straight out of the box although I did wash once before use. I've had them about a month and they are holding up well so far, washing once a week. I purchased on the day of a special sale, but even at regular price it's a good deal. I'll probably pick up another set.",
