These covers slip over the tires and seem to be tight enough and slip resistant, not to blow off. They also have enough material to cover the bottom front and the lower tread of the tires from the sun. As far as durability, only time will tell. They seem to be heavy material to make me believe they will last a while. I am happy so far.",
