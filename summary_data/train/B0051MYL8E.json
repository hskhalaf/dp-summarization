I had to find something inexpensive, because they do get filthy and you can't wash the condition out--and, because they're small enough to fit into the cleaning pouch I received with my saddle. They are soft and don't scratch my saddle--which is easily the most expensive leather object I own. They are small enough to wrap around reins and other small pieces of leather for conditioning. I'll buy more when these wear out.",
