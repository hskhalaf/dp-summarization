I'm so so happy I upgraded to the 6d mark ii!! I would 100% recommend it! The more I use it, the more I love it. It has everything I loved about my 6D, plus more.",

I bought this with the included 24-105 L kit lens. But used mostly with my 70-200L 2.8 and 100-400L F4 for nature photography. It's a great camera, and I really can't find many flaws with it worth mentioning. I use it often for astrophotography with my Celestron NexStar 8SE. See included photo. The results are stunning. Best addition to the camera was the Canon extended battery grip for long shooting without having to worry about battery life. Overall, a great purchase.",

The 6D Mark ii has been amazing, it has everything I loved about my 6D but they finally fixed the auto focus issues! It still preforms great in all lighting, is lightweight. Full frame and a great camera! I love everything about it and I would buy it over and over. So glad I took the plunge to upgrade when it came out!",

And the focus is lightning fast and accurate. With the battery grip it's a little bulky (will take some getting used too) and coupled with the canon 100-400 \"L\" lens the rig weighs a ton!
