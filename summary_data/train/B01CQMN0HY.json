To reset, all you need to do is push on the ON/OFF button for 15 seconds and they'll instantly reset themselves. I was worried before a big race because I couldn't get them to turn on.

In mid-summer, my computer would no longer recognize the Walkman; I tried 3 different computers and 2 different operating systems. I contacted Sony and per warranty they replaced the Walkman. After about 3 months, I began having the same problem. Of course, the warranty has since expired. The Walkman plays fine but I cannot add music or change playlists. I swim weekly and have appreciated the comfort and easy of use of both models. I notice that there is a new model out, but with the reliability issue, I have serious reservations about buying another Sony as a replacement.",

No matter what choice of earplugs I used, and no matter what ambient sound setting I used, it was very difficult to hear most songs while swimming, with the volume set at max. The noise of the whirlpool spa was even too loud to hear music. The earplugs were a perfect fit, and no water got into my ears, so I was very disappointed that most songs were very hard to hear. On the other hand, it works well on dry land, and loads songs easily.",

These are light enough that I don't really notice them unless I need to take them in and out a lot. Unfortunately, using the ambient noise function while I'm at the gym, they seem to simply amplify background noise and I still can't hear my mates (who are standing close) when they are talking to me. The background noise is even louder than when I take the earbuds out. Because of that, I have to pull an ear piece out to hear them talking, which is very frustrating because that was a big selling point for me.",
