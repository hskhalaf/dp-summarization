It produces light like you have a 3 foot long fluorescent tube on your head. It doesn't throw very far but the even light works great for close up tasks. Great for working on cars, tying fishing knots, and any close up work where you don't want shadows or bright spots. Also works great for lighting up a tent. Battery doesn't last long and it abruptly shuts off without warning so you need a backup light or you could be stranded. This would be great with a replaceable 18650 battery.",

There is no fading of the brightness as the battery dies. When it uses up the charge it turns off. If you are in a dark area with no other source of illumination you could be in trouble.

The light is very slim and comfortable to wear - approximately the size of two chapstick tubes next to each other. Charges from any USB. 3 light modes. All the specs on the site are accurate so far as I can tell - runs for about 2 hours on high (and doesn't lose brightness, eventually just turns off). Takes about 2 hours to charge.
