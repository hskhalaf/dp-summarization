We are both mechanically inclined, so we didn't need the template to install them, and they hold great and line up great. We decided to order more, for the rest of our cabinets. However, this set doesn't work at all. The magnet unlocks it just fine, until it is actually installed. Our cabinets are not at all thick--they are old, crappy cabinets. Just disappointed that the older set worked great, but they must have changed the design just enough that they don't work now.",

      "text": "We've used these in two houses, and they are super consistent. The only failure we've seen is when they are over-tightened and the screw holes are slightly out of position. When that happens, the flipper will get stuck down--just loosen the screws a small amount to relieve the stress. This is a design flaw, and hasn't been fixed in 5+ years as I just bought a recent set, so that is why this isn't a 5-star. The design causes the mechanism to stick if the holes aren't perfect, and who with a small kiddo has time to make them perfect?!? Otherwise, i highly recommend, just would like to see products improve with time.",

Alignment was a little more difficult than I thought it needed to be, resulting in a few extra holes on the (not visible from the outside) inside of the cabinet.

Previously they had a paper template that you could reuse a few times which is helpful when you're installing several locks. However, the template included in this kit is one time use only so heaven forbid you stick it into the wrong spot. Additionally, the adhesive on side 1B is strong...so strong you can't easily peel off the paper to expose it which is really frustrating when the template comes off when your trying to peel off the paper. Tip, peel off a corner on 1B and fold it in on itself so it's easier to remove during install. Again, the product is great but the template included is not.",

Keeps the cabinet doors tight, flush on the frame, unlike the rattling noise makers that hold thru the handles. They create a game called \"Where's the magnetic key?\" It can be frustrating always having to have the key to get in a cabinet. We learned that from the previous house where all cabinets were locked. Forget that! Just the cabinets with chemicals, glassware, appliances....and the booze! And agree on THE HOME BASE for the key.

In the three magnetic locks I installed today 6 screws broke off at the head due to the super cheap quality of product included. It's all fine and dandy until you realize that once the body of the screw is in the wood you have to uninstall everything you've done so far in order to find a new area that doesn't have the body of the screw in it.",

I also am not sure why the holes on the locking portion are oval-shaped. We have a few that slide up and down as a result, which causes them not to lock in place every time. I would buy these again, because I think they're better than most other alternatives, but they're not a perfect design.",

These come with a stick on mounting template and mount entirely on the inside of the cupboard with 4 screws (2 for the lock and 2 for the latch). The magnetic opener is great, but unless you buy two sets of locks, make sure you buy an extra key (if you lock it in the cupboard you need a high power magnet or another magnetic key to get it open). My son has tried hard to get into these and he can't even come close. Highly reccommended",

The only negative thing (besides the high price) is that if they really want in that drawer, a bit of shaking bypasses the mechanism. It takes a year or two for them to figure it out though.
