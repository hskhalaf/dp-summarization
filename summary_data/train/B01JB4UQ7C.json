The BackBlade would come with a blade that was DEAD after one shaving, and to replace it, you had to buy replacement proprietary blades at like $15 or whatever they were. The Bro Shaver, despite its stupid name, does the smart thing of allowing you to buy REGULAR blades, therefore being able to replace blades a lot easier, and a LOT cheaper. The blades it comes with are flimsy, and they cut my back to shit in places, but they did their job. DEFINITELY buy this over the BackBlade, without hesitation.",

The middle nut is hard to get to, and the handle is hollowed out with ridges, which can be awkward to hold at certain angles.

      "text": "This was my first time using a back shaver, and I am very pleased I bought the BroShaver Back Hair Shaver. I've had it for several months now and my back is nice and smooth looking \"no hairs\" The first time is a challenge to get those unsightly hairs off, I recommend go slow the first time and depending on how dense your hair is, get in the tub to do this or put a towel on the floor to catch the hair. Depending on your hair growth, for me twice a week shaving is all I need to maintain a smooth back.",

Of course one must use caution with this and \"scrub\" gently all those embarrasing hairs away. I used it without water or soap, just the dry blades on my dry back and it worked perfectly. Took about 10 minutes to leave my back hairless and spotless, no rash whatsoever. I'm really happy with it!",

If I could change one thing about it though it would be that I would make it hinged in the center of the stick to better facilitate traveling with it. I'll make that happen to mine somehow.",
