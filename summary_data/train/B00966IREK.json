Running a 1920x1200 monitor and Athlon X4 760K, I can run games like Fallout 4 and Planetside 2 at 40-60 FPS easily, without too much compromise (I like turning off shadows and lighting, but cranking up texture resolution). Older or less intensive games like This card is still very good. It's roughly equivalent to a GTX 750ti, and requires 1 PCI-e 6-pin connector. It's not loud nor does it run very hot. My hard drives are louder than this at idle.",

I don't get quite the FPS they do, and I do have to dial back some of the more frivolous settings (certain shadows, NVidia hairworks, etc), but it gets the job done. If you've got the money for a more current gen card, definitely go that route, but if you're looking to game on a budget, this is a great solution.",

I installed the card in a new HP Pavilion HPE h8-1360t, i7-3770K/8GB/600W PSU/W7 Pro (from an OEM disk, no need for all that HP garbage!) that came with a woefully inadequate GT 630 card as the only option. I use Flight Simulator X, which while CPU-bound still requires a decent graphics card. The GTX 660 is a great match for the CPU, the sim runs as well as I've ever seen it run. Like the title says, performance and value, very pleased with this purchase.",

This is not the cards fault but I had to root around in the BIOS, disable intel's graphics driver ext. Also, and this help me greatly, be sure your not plugging your computer into a full power strip. If it powers on and off a few times to a blank screen, you may not have enough power. Hope this helps!",

Runs a little hotter than expected (80c under stress with fan @ 65%, which is the highest I found that was still very quiet) - I had read I should expect low to mid 60s.
