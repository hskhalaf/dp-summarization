I have also recently used it to attach to a graduation cap to record my friends college graduation. It gave a great POV of him walking across the stage, receiving his degree.

The plastic on these is also flimsier than the normal GoPro accessories so keep in mind you get what you pay for; if you're taking your GoPro on high-intensity adventures, you may want to invest in stronger accessories.",

The float tool did not come with the wrist strap attached, nor did the the one in the package even fit around my float tool. I've had two connectors break while in the carrying pouch as well, while not being used. What I do love though is the versatility it provides for the cost. It is much cheaper than buying each accessory individually through GoPro and things like the head mount, chest mount, and wrist strap work perfectly. It's worth the purchase price for that reason to me.",

The Garmin action cameras all have compatible mounting hardware. One feedback: the chest mount seems like too much material, all those thick straps and buckles and the big plastic plate, I wonder if that could be streamlined. Otherwise have used the wrist mount, float handle, selfie stick, and head mount (but it feels kind of silly wearing it), and various adapters. Been down ziplines into lakes, gully washer slides, diving platforms, water falls, high ropes courses, biking, skiing. The stuff has held up fine.",

      "text": "I was very surprised at just how great of a deal this was. I purchased the set for $17.99. I was skeptical at first because it was so much cheaper than its competitors, but the reviews were pretty good. I took the whole set with me on a trip to Costa Rica where I did some hiking, white water rafting, waterfall repelling and a ton of swimming. It held up through everything! I love the chest and head straps. I accidentally broke one of the clips when I was detaching it from a helmet. Luckily there's an extra one in the kit. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this one. Great deal and pretty decent quality.",

She has yet to make use of all the items that came with, but everything fit right. I had a fear that these were going to be knock off as I've struggled with that stuff in the past, but there haven't been any issues since. She used the helmet clip for zip lining, the floating stick for swimming, and she also used the chest clip. There have been no issues yet.",

Some of the attachments are obvious, like the head strap, car and bike mounts, but theres little pieces and screws that instructions would really help out. The pictures on the selection help a little, but one piece of paper would make this 5*. I haven't had a real full field test to see if the plastic breaks as many have said, but I did get the whole kit for less than just a head strap. Will update if everything breaks.",
