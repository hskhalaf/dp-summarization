The 7's feel noticeably more cushioned on the feet and more comfortable overall. The reason I'm still giving these 4 stars despite that is because they're still comfortable, nice shoes. I just happen to prefer the 7's after a side-by-side comparison. Also, while I liked the polished and very minimal look of these in pictures, in person this actually results in them being very boring looking on the foot, so that's another reason I prefer the 7's. However, these can be dressed up while the 7's can't.",

The leather in this blue shoe is slightly stiffer, dressier and the price was much more appealing. I bought a pair of cognac Soft 7\u2019s last year that I enjoy very much. I just noticed today when wearing them for the first time that the tip of one of the shoelaces is defective; see enclosed photo. I will take this up with the seller. If the seller will send me a replacement pair of round blue laces that match these shoes I will give this product 5 stars. I have had no luck with ECCO where shoelaces are concerned.",

The leather upper is pretty nice, although its a bit squeaky at first. Took a few days to get the squeak out. I also love the look of these particular sneakers. The brown leather and black rubber makes it look slightly dressier than a casual sneaker in my opinion.",
