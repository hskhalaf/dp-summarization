Her 7 year old sister wants one. I want one for myself. The site works really well. The arrows shoot very straight and far. It makes a cool whistling sound when you shoot them. I bought some replacement arrows as well as I also have a 2 year old who has already bent two of them. I can't wait until it gets warmer so we can shoot these outside.",

I noticed that it was not just the kids who wanted to have their turn. She said it was her very best present --- high praise as she received some very nice gifts.",

They were able to pull the bow by themselves and release the arrows but it did misfire more times then not and the arrows were easily bent. I suppose this could be a good starter set but it is not very durable. On the plus side, it did not hurt if an arrow hit you!",

Probably could still be fixed, but I'm not sure it's worth it. I guess they can't all be winners. Junk.",

    "description": "Step Up and Stand Out with the Agent Bow blaster. Your performance will be top-notch when you launch your arrows at targets up to 85 feet away with real bow action. When you insert one of the 3 arrows and press the sight trigger, the electronic sight lines up your shot for pinpoint accuracy. But you can also make your mark as a spy, because each arrow contains a secret message that can only be decoded with the included decoder. Give the decoder to a friend so you can send coded messages in plain sight of your opponents! Show your spy style with the Agent Bow blaster. Nerf and all related characters are trademarks of Hasbro.",
