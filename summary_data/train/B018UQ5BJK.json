It does not have some of the deluxe options like the more expensive ones (cannot set temperature and it only will brew up to 10oz with the regular-sized k-cups), but overall I really love this thing. We have had it for almost a year now and it is holding up great! I also love that it is more compact than other models, although you do lose a little bit of volume in the water reservoir, I feel like it is worth it.",
