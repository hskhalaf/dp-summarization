The best feature of this product is the ability to set the cooking temperature, which I did find to be accurate. In that regard this does an excellent job. The drawback, however, is that the maximum oil level is too low to cover thicker foods, something not experienced with the Fry Daddy despite each having similar 1 liter capacity. It's a matter of the rectangular shape which lowers the depth of the oil. Having only used it once I cannot comment on long-term reliability of the product.",

With that being so poorly designed decided not to go any further and boxed it back up.",

Otherwise, this is the perfect appliance addition to our kitchen.",

Cooking two breaded chicken legs only takes 25 minutes, fully cooked and crispy.....still experimenting with the French fries. Includes a nice stainless steel basket with handle and has a \"Ready\" light when the temperature of the oil reaches the setting. I really like this fryer and think it is well worth having.",

I hated it not because it wasn\u2019t good but because bigger wasn\u2019t better. This uses very little oil so not much waste and cooks evenly. It\u2019s not much that I fry top 2 items Cutlets and pastelillos a Spanish treat And now wings. I LOVE this little baby. I got rid of big and purchased it again. Look at the size it\u2019s perfect",

Would like the cover to lock from sliding side-ways when opening - have to pay attention when lifting cover when hot. Cleaning is a breeze compared to my large deep fryer. Good quality, the basket holds enough for 2-3 servings of French frys, and the heater is fast on recovering 375 degrees after submerging food.",
