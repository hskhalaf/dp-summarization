You have to run a brush up through the dispensing hole to clean out grinds and you never really know if it is completely clean because you can't disassemble the machine completely. I do the best I can and so far I haven't noticed a bad taste in my coffee from old stale grinds I couldn't get to. I've used this grinder for a month now, and overall I am happy with this product.",

With this machine the course grind is visibly consistent and the French press plunge is smooth (no more jamming). Best of all...the coffee is delicious to the last drop (no more chunks of coffee beans or sludge at the bottom of our cups). We're in a dry climate and there's no static issues with this machine (we only grind dark roasts which may help). Other pros: compact, solid construction, easy to clean and quieter than our previous machines. All in all...a winner for course grinding!!",

It would no longer stay on for the prescribed time. It would run for a one second burst. We contacted Amazon by E-mail and received a replacement less than one day later on a Sunday. We are hoping that the early electronic failure will not be repeated. If so, we would need to downgrade the review to one star for lack of longevity. Amazon performed well, the product design is good, the reliability of the component parts may be an issue.",

Our previous Baratza Encore grinder also has some issues with coffee grounds being scattered so it is inherent to the breed. Hopefully this one will last longer than the Encore.

I like that i can just grab a bag of beans from Costco or a local roaster like Zeke's and grind what we need for a fresh carafe each morning. The burr grinder is consistent. It does create static in the grinds, however, and I've yet to come up with a way to not make a small mess after putting the fresh grind into the pot. (a little grinds goes a long way on making a mess). Overall though, if you're on the fence for a decent, functional, grinder like I was, this will fit the bill.",

I use it with a Delonghi 15 bar machine. The finest setting was so fine it clogged my portafilter and stopped the espresso machine. I now use 4 settings up from the finest and works/tastes great. I was surprised how much the flavor of the coffee changed with just a single click of the fineness setting. The grinder sounds serious when it runs. No louder than my other burr grinders, just a nice solid sounding rumble. Feels like it will last (hope).",

But overall I'm very happy with this grinder so five stars it is, as I don't feel that the static is worth taking a star off.",
