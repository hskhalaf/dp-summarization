My accuracy is better plus I can use it any time I recommend to my clients in special my senior clients to improve their reflex and balance.",

This is just a warning to the other men/women who purchase this product. Overall I am happy with the product itself, just be aware of the sex appeal that comes with it.",

I found it was easier to use an open hand technique initially to get the touch and rhythm right, then advance to close fist tapping. It's fun to do and makes a good warm up exercise while improving your reflexes at the same time. I've only used it a short time so far so I look forward to getting good enough to try the red ball.",

      "text": "I had on and off rotator cuff injury and impingement, and ended up with physical therapy. I\u2019m still not able to produce force with my right arm, but I miss boxing and looked for something I can train my hand-eye-coordinations without needing a lot of strength. The reflex ball is perfect workout for my reflexes and coordination. Even my 11 y old daughter, which does Tae kwon-Do loves working with it. It is super easy to use and I love that it comes with two different balls for different speed levels.",

Hand and eye coordination for sure, I think better than an actual video game, because its not like pushing a button.. your in the game.. it's do or get hit with the ball.. I am 60 years young and I think it is a ton of fun, but I was around long before video games.",

I had an issue related to my shoulders last year and have not been able to get to physical therapy. This has helped a great deal and it's fun. Just be patient when you're first starting out.",

Additionally, watch out for when the 'elastic' string breaks--either at a weak point somewhere along the string or at the connection to the ball--as the resulting torn string may snap into your eye causing temporary or permanent pain/damage and frustration with the product itself. Moral of the story is: purchase a more durable product. Review provided by an experienced user of over two years. Have fun!",

It has helped with my hand eye coordination in the ring in my opinion, just because it does come back at you faster than some people can swing.

    "description": "Voices From Customers\nSuper fun to use and it\u2019s hard to put down once you get started (I train Muay Thai btw)\n--James\n\nA LOT easier to watch than to actually do it. Love the challenge and the guys I train and myself will definitely benefit from using this product.\n-- Joaquin Zamora\n\nGreat addition to my boxing gear! It's a little difficult to get used to at first, but as long as you start with the black ball, and start with small punches, (think tapping it with your fists) until you get the rhythm, you should progress quickly. After just under a week, I've progressed to the red ball. The headband adjusts well, it fits me without issue and I have a pretty large head. The material for the balls is soft and spongy so while it can come back and hit you, it's soft enough that it doesn't hurt.\n--Mike\n\nFun for all ages. Good workout without noticing your working out. Hand eye coordination seems to be improving with practice...\n--Joshua Holder\n\nI happened to see the reflex balls when searching items related to boxing for my son who is a boxing fan. When telling him about it, he said he would like to give it a try... Long story short, he likes it a lot since he received it.\n--B.Z.\n\nBought several for me, the grandkids and for my students. Everyone that tries it enjoys it. Easy for kids to use and practice their hand-eye coordination for any sport.\n--Viggi\n\nI loved this thing!! When I first put it on, I could only hit it 3 times consecutively. Now, after only a few days, I'm averaging over 30 hits. It's a fun competition for the three of us in my home. I recommend\n--A.C.\n\nI purchased the Boxing Reflex Ball for my father who had a stroke last year. He is really working on his reflexes and really enjoys the speed bag (?) and I happened to come across your product when I was looking for a \"reflex ball\"(lop-sided tennis ball thingy)...Anyway, He loves it! He is getting pretty good! Thanks.\n--Lori Nason",

      "LIGHTER, SOFTER and SAFER - We specifically designed it to be much lighter and softer than the tennis ball, so it is grove-free, and everyone can enjoy it without any worries about hitting yourself in the faces, eyes, noses, and fists as well, it's much safer!",
      "TWO STEP APPROACH LEARNING SYSTEM - Are you worrying about it's difficult to get the hang? The black ball is specifically designed to be much easier for novices. Once you could dominate it, change to the red ball. Watch out! The red ball is much more bouncy, and you may be knockout technically :)",
      "IT IS A PERFECT SOLO TRAINING EQUIPMENT- It can help train your reaction, agility, punching speed, fight skill and hand eye coordination while providing an interesting workout",
      "LOOKING FOR A WAY TO GET A NICE WORKOUT IN YOUR DAY AND STAY IN SHAPE? - Lifting weights and long hours on the Gym bike is not the only way to get fit! In fact, Fight Ball might be even better and far more compelling. The unpredictability of the rebounding ball, coupled with the intensity of your punches will burn out your arms, chest, shoulders and upper back, perfect for calorie burning and conditioning! Also, it's very addicting!",
      "PRACTICE ANYTIME and ANYWHERE - You don't have to go to a gym, strap the headband on, have fun and burn your body within 15-20 minutes! Perfect for work breaks or school breaks or even for the beach and the park, this focus punching bag will burn many calories and help you get fit!"
