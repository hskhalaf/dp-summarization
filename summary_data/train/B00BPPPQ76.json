But this is great for my home gym. I was a little hesitant to purchase because of the reviews about them smelling bad, however, they smell like rubber - nothing terrible my floor mats are rubber just made my gym more like a gym. I would totally buy again, wish I purchased 5-100.",

Otherwise, great option.",

I recommend setting it up in a garage at first, then once the smell has subsided, you can move inside the house",
