It's well made, I didn't feel like I had to worry about the dogs' nails popping it like I would with some more flimsy boats. The included air pump inflated it pretty fast, especially for it's size. If you are looking for a good deal on an inflatable boat that will last, this is it.",

      "text": "This is good product and a good raft. I have taken it down some 2 pluses and a 3 minus white water rapids and it held up just fine. I have bounced off rock and ran over tree branches and I am still floating. My only complaint is the oars and the pump. They are essential garbage. The oars more than the pump. Right? I know. Weird. The connectors on the oars will constantly brake, and you will end up having to order more which will break again or design your own from product acquired at home depot. Your better off buying your own Carlisle oars and pump than getting this combo kit. Just buy the raft by itself.",
