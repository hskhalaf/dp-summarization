It has exterior zip pockets, and comes with a bag into which the vest can be folded and stuffed. My only gripe is the base of the zipper. It is difficult to make the initial connection where the tip of one side goes into the zipper and base of the other side. Once you accomplish this, the zipper works just like it should, but if you don't get it right then the bottom can separate and \"strand\" the zipper itself. If the zipper was replaced by a better quality (larger toothed) zipper, this would be 5 stars,",

I only buy extra large because the fit is more comfortable across the shoulders. Maybe it was a fluke and got the wrong tag at the factory. Most others seem to be quite satisfied with the fit.

It occured to me however, that after 6 months of nearly daily pocket zipper jams (the pocket zipper gets caught on the fabric wayyyy tooo easy), perhaps there is a better solution out there. I recently purchased the Uniqlo version of this vest and it does NOT suffer from this pocket zipper problem. I should have paid the extra $10 initially and gotten the better quality jacket rather than try to save $10 for an inferior product. Lesson learned!",

It pulled apart several times I\u2019ve the few days I tried out the vest. Upside- it was warm enough for a 40+ degree day and super lightweight.
