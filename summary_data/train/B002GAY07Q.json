I had ordered some spoons that were super flexible, and although soft on the gums, they were difficult to use. These fit my hand, and my babys mouth perfect. Edit: Ive used these spoons on both hot and cold items...and found that I CANNOT trust the color change. I dont know if it was affected by shipping (I live in a hot climate), however it is not nearly sensitive enough. Ive dropped my review to 4 stars. I still love the feel and size of the spoon.",

I think the Spuni worked best for the first couple times as my baby was figuring it out but since then he seems to eat better with these Nuby spoons. These spoons also hold a lot of food and are soft. My baby loves to chew on them maybe too much. Agree with other reviews that they get discolored but it doesn't impact the functionality. Planning to buy more of these for my little guy who is 7 months now.",

Aside from those things, it gets the food into my baby's mouth.... But that's all you can expect.",

I think that the color indicator is very helpful- if the food is too hot, the colored part of the spoon becomes light or even white. If the color doesn't change, the temperature of the food is okay, and that's all the temperature sensitivity I've ever needed. The spoons do stain with orange food, but I've never been concerned with this- they just seem so much softer than stainless steel spoons that I don't think that a little discoloration matters.",
