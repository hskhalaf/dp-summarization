My husband installed it pretty quickly in a 46.5in space. (He cut it to fit.) Our only complaint is that we wish it was taller. My husband is 6\u20192\u201d and has to duck quite a bit to get in the shower. Also, some water splashes out at the bottom. Still, we would purchase again and we were thankful not to have to buy a $500+ custom door.",

I might have to get some splash guards as one door doesn't quite line up with the non-square opening. The door height adjustment has only three fixed points instead of the previous ones being an angled slot to provide any amount of adjustment. One hole was too high and the other too low. The glass is sturdy and heavy with no frame and looks great.",
