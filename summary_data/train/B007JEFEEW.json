I know I could purchase another seat, but they have been fine with the cracked one. The second one we have is fine. The only bad part was the box when we recieved it. It was LITERALLY out of the box when it showed up at my front doorstep on a late (9pm) rainy evening. I was afraid that I was missing parts but thankfully everything was there. Overall my kids LOVE this so that's all that matters.",

      "text": "My 8 year old had just destroyed the front wheel of his big wheel from use. We bought the 20\" model of the Green Machine because we thought it would last him a long time. The build quality is very good and definitely more robust than typical big wheels. However, the length and weight of this overall model make it difficult to perform some of the spins you see in the commercials. Perhaps the 16\" would be a little easier to handle. On the 20\", it is a bit clumsy, but he seems to like it enough. He does praise the traction the front rubber tire gives over previous plastic front wheel models he has had.",

Over all the product is quite heavy and well made but there have been reports of the seat and flags breaking. Took some effort to assemble correctly. Our younger than recommended grand kids were able to roll the trike in a full spin turn so be careful. At 5 and 6 years old they still had fun but could not pedal. It is rated for 8 years to adult which is why I bought it so I I could ride it too. Sorry to say I still have not rode it yet.",

As a matter of fact, it is rated for adults as well, up to 150 pounds. The seat adjusts to fit leg length. Assembly was not difficult, but awkward in some areas if you are short like I am. Fortunately I had help, which I highly recommend. The required assistance in no way effects the number of stars, though. Instructions were clear and concise. All in all, this is money well-spent!",

Then on Christmas day she rode the Green Machine even in the cold! But the adults rode it too! It handled the weight (up to 185 pounds) with no trouble! My 6 year old granddaughter was able to ride it as well, as the seat can be adjusted with little effort. She wants one now. I really like that it is not motorized. Kids need exercise, and they will as long as they are having fun. I gave it a 5 star because it performed as advertized and better!",
