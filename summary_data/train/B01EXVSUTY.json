Well, my only complaint about this is that it hurts REALLY badly when you hit yourself. That being said, the ball bearings make this jump rope the smoothest one my husband and I have ever had, AND the length is adjustable, so we can both use it without me having to wrap one end around my wrist to compensate for the height difference. On top of that, the company is super friendly and helpful (a rare experience these days). I guess the foot-whippings just give us incentive to get better, right?",

First, the rope cable cracked within 1 week (likely in the area where the cable makes contact with the floor, although I only used it on rubber mats and smooth hardwood floors). Subsequently, the swivel handles repeatedly jammed. I was able to pry them free with a pair of pliers, but after the third time, I concluded that this rope is just not built for heavy use. I have owned it for only about 1 month. ----",

For starters, it's super light and comes in a carry case that fits easily in my gym bag with the rest of my gear. The rope itself is thin steel cable and coated which is great for speed rope. The cable is simple to size, and you'll get emailed instructions on proper sizing. The handles are durable and will last forever. The best part is that you get 2 ropes, in the even that the first gets worn out. Definitely worth the purchase.",

Doubled unders went from 5 unbroken to being more fun, smoother, and I'm up to 15+ The rope just makes it more fun to practice and consistency has done wonders.",
