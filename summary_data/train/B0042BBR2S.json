I can take it as my spare mouse when travelling and never have to use the silly trackpad on the laptop. MUCH easier to use. I recommend grabbing the Logitech software and fully customizing the features as you can really get it to perform to your needs.",

I only wish it had more buttons and an integrated fingerprint reader into one of the buttons. That would make it worth 10x as much they are selling for.",
