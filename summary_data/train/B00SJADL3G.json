Mine started to read differently every time I closed they so I took it apart to clean and repair it. the gears and mechanisms were flimsy and cheap. I looked on YouTube and all of the repair videos had way better insides than these. I also found out this model is made in China. Seems to be another case of corporate greed. It is a shame because the slider and main part of the caliper is so high quality, its a waste of good materials.",
