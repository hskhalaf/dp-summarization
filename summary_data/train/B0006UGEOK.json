Though foldable, it's not very compact, but its design keeps two guitars very secure. No worry about removing just one, the other stays put. When I think about how much I've invested in my instruments, this stand is an incredible value. A small sacrifice in portability pays big dividends in securing your prized posessions.",

I keep one guitar tuned to DADGAD and one guitar with standard tuning, and I can switch back and forth with ease. The stand is heavyweight, and I have no concerns about it falling over holding my Les Paul. I especially like the locking mechanism that works based on the weight of the guitar headstock hitting it. That was a nice engineering twist to the stand design.",

Unfotunately the height adjustment broke, so I just jammed it to an approximate height for acoustic guitars, this stand does not travel so I don't need it to collapse. The rubber lever fittings became very sticky so it was time to update. This new one seems improved in design - it should last longer.",
