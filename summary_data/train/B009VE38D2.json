This set: the plastic seems a little more flimsy or flexible than what I remember. I think my set (~30 years ago) was made of plastic that is a bit more brittle and stiff. I'm worried that the ring shaped piece might get bent and not lay flat and render the set unusable. But other than that, it is everything I remember. A little tricky to keep the gear-teeth in contact, so frustrating for little ones. My impatient 9 year old is struggling, but she'll master it eventually.",
