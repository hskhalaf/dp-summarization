Maybe it\u2019s befause it\u2019s a base model, but I figure it shouldn\u2019t run THAT slowly. We\u2019re really unhappy with this tablet. It\u2019s very slow and confusing to use. We figured a little tablet for our daughter would be super fun for her but we can\u2019t operate it! Restrictions for the children\u2019s profile isn\u2019t nearly what it needs to be. Interface and design is clunky and unintuitive. We regret buying this and wish we had bought an iPad.",

I recommend only downloading the games that are for learning or you may find your child begging to play video games that do not teach. Young children can become addicted to electronics and allowing them to have a tablet promotes this unless you use it with your child.",
