      "text": "I have only owned 4 Hamilton Beach Blenders in 25 years. The last HB Blender, a housewarming gift lasted four months. This one I purchased last June but used less than half a dozen times. It has been a disappointment for all my smoothies, and I do not dare use it for any other processing. The part labeled collar is open and performs as a trap for food particles to lodge at the bottom of the glass jar below the cutting blades. Nut, Fruits, Vegetables, Seeds, and Ice are trapped never participating in the remaining blending process. After cleaning, those particles are usually still trapped until they are sorted and individually picked out. I do not recommend.",

The blades are driven by rubber sprockets which can put off a rubber-y smell when used for long periods. The rubber feet of ours stained out counter-top, even through a cloth oven mitt we had under it (see photos). It's very easy to clean and blades separate from housing easily. Does feel like a budget unit, light plastic, ours stopped working within 2 months, a grinding sound followed by the blades not moving anymore, blades and glass jar were intact, failure was somewhere in motor housing.

      "text": "Actually a great blender for the price. Blade attachment is one unit so a separate rubber gasket isn't involved to cause problems and wear out before blender does. That's a huge advantage. My main use is for a protein smoothie adding frozen fruit. I would like a little more power but this one works well enough because it circulates the mixture extremely well ~ much better than I've ever seen. I don't recommend easily but I am basically very pleased with this blender.",

HOWEVER my last blender was a gift and cost at least $150. This is a very decent unit and does what I want--pretty basic frappes, mixed drinks, smoothies. Nowhere near powerful enough for soup--but making soup in a blender isn't something I need or want. Just don't get a hankering for a Margarita in the middle of the night. It won't wake the dead, but you'll need to make enough for anyone who's asleep when you start mixing.",

Perfect smoothie texture for a reasonable price. Since I'm past the return window on this piece of garbage some poor sucker will likely buy it from the local donation store.",

I was amazed that I was able to churn one incredible well-blended smoothie after another--no ice or frozen food chunks to be found. The wave-action feature works well and is good at keeping the food moving towards the blades. Thanks to this blender, I have more than a dozen made-a-head smoothies in the freezer, which will provide a good, healthy, cool drink when the next heat wave hits.",

I also had a hard time getting pieces of food that became constantly caught in the crack surrounding the blade section. Over all disappointing.",
