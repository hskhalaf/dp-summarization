I also developed a problem with metatarsalgia and was hoping these more supportive sneakers would help. Alas, my condition requires an orthotic, and because these shoes are a tiny bit tighter than I\"m used to, the orthotic only seems to fit ok if I'm wearing very thin socks. However, it does fit, and it probably stays in place better because it is a little tighter. I do like the level of cushioning and overall support, I find them comfortable for walking and working out on the elliptical and some light weights. They are nice and stable, too.",

Overall, I\u2019m very happy with my purchase!",
