I can't give you any less than a one-star review, so I will also leave a comment in your seller rating. You cannot buy away the fact that you sold me a shi**y product that does not deserve to be on the market. --- Absolute garbage. Not only was it unable to learn the IR codes from my Onkyo home theater receiver, but after a month the USB dongle is no longer recognized by any of my PCs. Boo.",

TV functions programmed to buttons without any trouble (power, source, volume up and down). Media keys don't work in browser but pretty sure that's normal for any remote. Happy with purchase it works better than expected and more relaxing than using wireless keyboard and mouse.",

When you flip it to type on the keyboard, you have to flip very carefully and almost systematically so the remote knows it has been flipped. Otherwise it doesn't register it's upside down and it'll press random keys. Fantastic option for its price!",

It works great, no special drivers needed, and having a full keyboard is very nice compared to using on-screen keyboards. Moving the mouse pointer around with the air mouse feature works well enough for light usage, but hitting a small target like the X button on a window can be kind of tough since it's hard to be super precise. Perhaps with practice I will get better.",

I'm glad products like this are out there for those of us not entirely into the AppleSphere. Oh/ the picture shown is of one device, front and back, not two devices. Which is even better.",
