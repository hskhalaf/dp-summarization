This however is perfect! It's durable, soft, sure I have to tuck it back in before company comes over because the kids, dog, or husband squirmed a bit too much and made it a little messy. But I love it! No piling, no pulls, and soft - did I mention its soft. One of my dogs loves soft things and she's been so happy snuggling with me on these - got the sofa, love seat, and recliner slip covers. Oh and the price - total win!",

      "text": "Nicer material than I thought it would be. Still not impressed with the price, was more than I wanted to spend but I wanted to make sure it would fit the bigger chair I have. Very nice, will probably buy more for the rest of furniture in the future when I have the money. The only thing is it\u2019s a little confusing trying to get it on, not looking forward to having to take it on off to wash as I\u2019m the material is a hair catcher and I have 2 dogs and a cat. Overall I like it \u263a\ufe0f",

What a bonus! It is super soft and comfy. the only reason I took off a star is because when we got it there was a faded spot by the head. Other than that it's absolutely perfect! I cannot wait to get one for my couch to match!",

      "text": "Recliner cover is well made. The material is soft, plush and rich looking. It fits perfectly. My only complaint is that it needs to be tucked each time you get off of it. I don't think there's anyway to prevent this with any slipcover. It's just the nature of the beast! Anyway, it's keeping my chair protected and clean. With a new puppy in the house who likes to cuddle on the chair with me or my husband, this is a godsend!",

I can't say anything about durability because I just received it, but I think it will last a while. I used a few fabric pins and it made it look even nicer. One of the best purchases I've made on Amazon.",
