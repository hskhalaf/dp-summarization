However the video for this product on the Newair website clearly shows that each of the five shelves is deep enough to hold five bottles, 3 in one direction and 2 in the other. You can also see that the top and bottom shelves have more vertical room than the other 3, which allows two more bottles to be stacked on top of the five. That's 29 bottles.",

Since it is dual zoned you can chill your red wines and white wines at different temperatures. The wine cooler is also the perfect size! You could put it under a counter-top if you want to, but we just have it as a stand alone unit and we like that it doesn't take up too much space.",

      "text": "This wine cooler has all the features you'd want in an affordable and compact wine cooler. We are loving the duel temperature feature to keep red and white wines at the proper temperatures. The wood shelves are perfectly spaced to fit our wine and they are wide enough so the bottles don't fall through. We've had other wine coolers where the bottles fell through the shelves often. This wine cooler is also attractive and looks great in my kitchen with my other stainless steel appliances. It's a great addition to increase the value of your home too.",
