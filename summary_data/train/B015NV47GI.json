This residue appears to be the cause of my dog\u2019s problems. I would recommend NOT buying these dishes.",

These are SO much better. They don't feel cheap - they have a good weight to them. The bone is really cute and I did read other reviews that said it isn't attached well and might fall off, but both of mine feel secure and I really could care less if they fall off.",

When they said good for puppies, they didn't mean small dogs. Rather than return them, I will give them to someone with a larger dog or donate them to a shelter.",

      "text": "I like that they are easy to clean, resist scratching and hold enough food for a large dog. The rubber base serves a double purpose; (1) Keeps the bowl in place on any surface. (2) Reduces the chance of static discharge which is common with other metal bowls ( but it's probably best to keep both bowls on a rubber mat to be safe.)",
