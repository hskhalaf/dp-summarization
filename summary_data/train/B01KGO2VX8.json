Been using it consistently for a month with no problems. I bought a mat to go with it, I think my carpet will thank me. I like the mat too. This was a great investment for me.",

I am not nearly at the 400lb limit (only 120 lb) and I use it as recommended (I just use this for light cardio doing the regular twisting...not all the bs other workouts they try to sell). It lasted about 7 months, but when I called Simply Fit customer service, they said it is only guaranteed for 75 days. So, if you order this, just know that it will crack and if it doesn't do it before 75 days, you will just have to buy another one... Amazon customer service also did nothing to help. Do not buy this item...",
