However, even Plantronics most expensive model doesn't do a great job of noise reduction. the noise reduction either cancels out all sound or allows to much sound in. It was snug in my ear. I only had to be careful if something brushed up against my ear. The one problem for me is that I forget it is there and may not notice if it falls out. So, I moved to the headset with a round the ear type of unit.",

It was not packed very well at all when shipped to me, and I was surprised that it was not damaged by the other stuff rolling around in the box. But this is a great headset and it takes a licken and keeps on ticken. Great headset! Poor Packing.",
