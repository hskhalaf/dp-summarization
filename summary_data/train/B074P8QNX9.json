It looks like it is designed to grab the originals at the transition from the bottom to the Alcantara top, but on the aluminum it's a bit below the top and there is nothing to grab. I am keeping it as protecting the top is better than not at all, but they need to look at the bottom piece for the new laptops.",

There is a slightly less opaque square where the logo would be, but is still not really visible.. Also, it is very simple to clip on and fairly easy to clip off though it did immediately start to push and misshape the edge of the alcantara material on the keyboard. I removed it and would not recommend. Pretty disappointing.. Please comment on any case recommendations that will still keep the integrity of the laptop.",

The clips on the back of the bottom piece are not large enough to reach the edges of the laptop. The plastic is clearly sized to fit my 13.5\", it's not like they sent a 15\" piece, it just does not match the device's size. In addition to the bottom piece not fitting, I bought a matte black cover but only the bottom piece is matte black. the top was a shiny, smoked, translucent piece. Hard to put a positive spin on this product. It's terrible.",

As mentioned in previous review, the case doesn't quite go over the Alcantara unless you are really maticulous about putting it on, and 2. The bottom, even with the silicon pads, is a little slippery on my desk. Otherwise, this is a great case and overall, I recommend it to anyone with a Surface laptop which needs a little extra protection.",
