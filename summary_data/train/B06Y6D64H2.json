      "text": "Bought this for a canoe trip to the Boundary Waters and it worked like a charm. Was flat and light to carry along and was useful for toting things around the campsite, filling with water from the middle of a lake (for later filtration) and doing the washing up. As you can see in the photo, the container remained upright even when nearly filled. The mesh bag was handy for storing parts of our filtration system. The lid fits tightly and keeps the contents clean. We would highly recommend this product and the price is certainly right. Have had great luck with this seller, \"The Friendly Swede.\" We'll be back.",

I just stood there staring at my mistake and how I should have just went to Lowe's hardware to buy a $5 bucket that actually helps me. Now I wish I could return it, but it's past the return date.",

If you want to use it to hold water, for various reasons, like camp showers or dishes, it's perfectly fine, but just don't use it for drinking or drinks because the smell/ taste is really bad. I will continue using it for watering plants, with the hope that the smell will eventually diminish.",
