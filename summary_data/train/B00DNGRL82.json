      "text": "It is a small screen at 11 inches, but this is one excellent laptop that is absolutely rock solid with the Chrome operating system. No more anti-virus software, or all the nonsense of Windows. It only gives a browser but that's all that I need. Everything in the browser works great, video, displays, etc. Printing is an issue in that only a wireless printer can be accessed, and Java displays (which I find are few) are not supported. I rarely ever use my Windows machine but I did get a larger 14 inch Chrome laptop for my older eyes.",

The screen has given out and become all static-like. When the power chord is plugged in, the mouse lags. This is definitely not a computer you should use for travel purposes because the paint on the outside scratches off easily. Considering the amount of time this computer has lasted me, it was not worth the money spent. I will not be repurchasing a chromebook, and especially not from acer, because chromebooks lack many of the features which I find essential as a college student such as Microsoft office.",

However, there are apps you can download that are comparable to Microsoft Excel, word, etc. This is smaller than your average laptop so it can easily be carried in a backpack or bookbag. Very lightweight and the screen display is crystal clear.",

When i first had this I would have to restart it again and again just because the whole thing would freeze. I really don't know what happened but it's a lot better now. Although I still wish it could read files and it had a DVD drive, thinking about it, the price I got it for was worth it.",
