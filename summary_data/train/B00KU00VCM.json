      "text": "It was good at the beginning. But it lasted only one year in a Middle East country where dust wind and hot sunshine is common all year. About after 10 months, it started tear down on a small stretch while I am covering it. It became complete rags after exactly one year and I had to buy other one. However, I think other accessories such as underneath strap, bottom elastic cord, and vents are very good design. I recommend, therefore, it can be good if it is going to be used in a good weather conditions, but go get a better and heavy one if you want to keep it longer in a worse conditions.",

It seems to keep the cart dry, but traps moisture. Concerned that may, in addition to mold/mildew, facilitate rust. Would I buy again? For the price and to not have my cart completely exposed, yes.",

The cover itself is very good quality, easy on/off and protects our golf cart as expected. I think had we not had the cover in direct Florida sun it would have lasted much longer. We would definitely suggest this cover to others looking for a quality product with an excellent warranty.",
