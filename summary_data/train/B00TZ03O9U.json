I love the fact that it is moist, the pieces are small enough for my border collies to easily eat (no need to break apart), they're healthy, and!! NO poultry!! This is our go-to treat. As an extra bonus, the price compared to a normal bag of treats is fantastic!! (Think about the fact that even if you're buying a 1 pound bag of \"zukes\" you're probably paying at least $15 ($30 for 2 pounds) - but probably more. And this is better quality!)",

Also need to remember to remove leftovers from my treat bag because they dry out.",
