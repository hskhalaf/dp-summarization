One of the SIM slots has a plastic insert in it to prevent the insertion of a SIM. Even when this is removed and a SIM inserted it does not function. Neither the merchant nor Amazon has attempted to resolve this issue. I had to pay for shipping when the return wasn't possible because the phone has a security feature the prevents a reset. Bad all the way around on this one.",

Attempted a repair on the Moto Z2 Play but screen replacement is not as easy as it should be and now the phone is completely worthless. If it was not for this I would recommend the phone.",

Quick phone with enough ram and onboard storage never a hiccup despite it being a 6 series snapdragon. The front camera is fantastic and even with a real front flash! People are impressed how good it looks compared with a real flash compared to my wife's S7 and it's screen flash. Thin and light phone with moto mods make it a worth while experience. My last phones were a mate 9 and V10 and I don't miss flagships at all (except the new trend of phones with a high screen to body ratio)",

      "text": "The offer was for a dual SIM phone, but a single phone SIM was delivered - 2nd slot blocked in the tray and no 2nd SIM option in the settings. The previous Moto Z2 Play started randomly rebooting after 14 months or so. Since rebooting continued after removing SD card and unistallation of most user apps, the rebooting could be firmly attributed to the hardware.",
