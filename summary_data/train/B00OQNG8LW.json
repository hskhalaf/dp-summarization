This kind of brush isn't really made for that - it's designed for thicker and shorter hair that is being treated with a blow dryer. The same thin features that make it catch on long hair is what makes it effective at \"lifting\" thick hair so the blow dryer can treat it. I'll admit that this brush used to have larger red dots at the end, which made it more comfortable, but for a $12 brush you can't really expect this thing to do heavy lifting.",
