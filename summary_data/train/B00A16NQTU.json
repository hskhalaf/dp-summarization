Each level of this rack needs to be at least another inch apart to keep reels from resting on the reel or rod below it. If you use primarily bait casters this rack would work well for you. 2. The package came with no screws and 3 wall anchors. I assume that the unsealed plastic bag that was supposed to hold the hardware came open at some point and they fell out. No biggie, I had some old screws in my toolbox and the task isn't going to hold a lot of weight.",
