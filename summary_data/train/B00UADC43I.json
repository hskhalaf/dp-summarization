The EyeFi download of software took numerous attempts to install with constant messages about a C+++2005 version causing problems, which wasn't the case. Looking at the website this is not an isolated case and so people should be wary about purchasing this device. I wanted something to do a job and it failed in this regard. I have returned it for a refund but still disappointed.",

JPG files transfer in a matter of seconds, with RAW files (approx 25mb from a Canon 5Diii) the transfer takes around 20-30 seconds per image. It does drain a camera battery faster than a normal card - so make sure you have plenty of spares!",

This way your transfer shouldnt take that long. Generally I would suggest shooting away and then reviewing images later. Otherwise you will spend half of your shoot waiting for the images to load. There are still some issues with connectivity. Connection between the card and ipad can suddenly drop. Overall it gives you an option to preview images on a bigger screen but definitely wont replace tethering to a computer. Very useful on smaller shoots.",

The transfers over to my iPad are really quick (based on medium or small jpegs) - it makes such a difference being able to review shots on a larger screen. The only frustration is my iPad reverting back to my home wifi network when the camera goes into standby, but I believe this can be remedied by configuring infrastructure support via the desktop app - something I still need to do.

You can only do this by tapping each photo, no delete all function or to simply not import them in the first place.
