      "text": "Not \"if,\" but \"when.\" The micro-USB shell will stay firmly mounted to the soldered through-holes, but the plastic core and its five SMD leads will break loose from the pads. It's easy to replace the board which is marked with Nvidia part no. 180-81646-1002-A05, but there is no source for this little PCB other than buying a whole new tablet. Reflowing (i.e. resoldering) its microscopic 0.65 mm pitch pads might be possible, but so far I've had little luck with them. To avoid this, one could attach a short micro-USB cable extension or adapter and gaffer-tape the cable to the back of the tablet.",

Before the port broke the tablet was usually reliable, but it was glitchy and in need of restart every couple of days. I was in the process of getting used to the writing recognition software before it broke: I didn't have a chance to figure out if problems there were my lack of experience in using their editing shorthand, the app, or the tablet. Probably a bit of all three. I can't speak for others, but for me it was a waste of money unfortunately",
