Fit is great, support is great, cushioning is good, wish it was great as well. Hoping next generation of Triumphs has a better color scheme.",

About the time this happens is when I've bought the next pair.

    "description": "Saucony Echelon 5 Supportive neutral shoe which provides an accommodating fit for orthotic wearers. The latest increment in running perfection. Compromised with lighter materials whilst still remaining inherently neutral, the Echelon 5 combines durability and cushioning with equal aplomb. Upper The Saucony Echelon 5 Running Shoes breathable mesh upper is straddled by a series of synthetic overlays that reinforce its construction, to deliver a shoe that is simultaneously lightweight, breathable and robust. In an update from previous iterations a 5mm, antimicrobial polyurethane sockliner enhances support and cushioning, whilst ARCH-LOCK envelopes the medial arch and integrates with the lacing system to deliver a secure, adaptive midfoot lockdown that can be manipulated by tightening the shoe. A RUNDRY collar lining intelligently wicks moisture away from the skin and works in concert with the antimicrobial sockliner to encourage an environment that is cooler, drier and fresher. Reflective components positioned at the heel and toe preserve the wearer's visibility in poor light. Midsole A full length POWERGRID insert cushions the foot and attenuates impact shockwaves superbly, working with the primary midsole compound - a Saucony SuperLite (SSL) EVA blend - to deliver a phenomenally smooth ride. An added feature to an already elite running platform consists of a SRC Impact Zone, implemented to attenuate shock and disperse impact forces away from the shoe. The result...a more efficient run setting up the foot for a smooth transition. Outsole The shoe's outsole consists of an iBR+ and XT-900 compound blend - the former yielding 3 times more impact absorption than other comparable materials, albeit in a considerably lighter format, and the latter delivering consistent, reliable grip and traction with a superb longevity.",
