ASICS is a brand that has made extremely comfortable shoes throughout its history; it's hard to believe these are made by ASICS. Didn't anyone try them on before putting them on the market? Putting these shoes on is like stuffing your foot into a bicycle innertube, it bunches your socks up so that when you do accomplish getting your foot inside, your bunched up socks hurt your toes. The size is correct, but the elastic sleeve makes these shoes unbearable to wear.",

I walked around for a while and they stretched. I took several walks and short runs and these are quite comfortable. Very soft on my runs and very little shock, great soles. Great for my knees. I'd purchase another pair. Love the color too!",
