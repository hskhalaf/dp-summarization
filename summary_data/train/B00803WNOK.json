At the moment it is sitting in a bird feeder recording close up video of blue jays, cardinals and nuthatches going nuts on black oil sunflower seeds. It takes great video ans stills. I've used it under water and dropped it in the snow without any damage. I have 6 cameras from DSLRs to point and shoots, This one is the most fun and allows the most creative uses. When it dies I will replace it with the newest version. .",

When shooting video the focus will \"wander\" every now and then. Sometimes when fully zoomed in it will lose focus completely and you have to zoom out a bit for it to lock on again. Otherwise the video quality is pretty good and it takes great pictures. The waterproofing works well and I have used it with good effect both by itself in the in the optional housing on deep dives.",

I am not impressed with the high cost of the accessories but we are not to the point of needing them yet.

This camera takes much sharper pictures and doesn't have issues with being out of focus when there are water drops on the lens. Also on the lesser models there is a lens cover which tended to get stuck when you took the camera in salt water. There are no moving pieces on this camera to get stuck.",

Pictures come out very sharp super clear, Some functions i have not used but will keep updating once i use them.

I also have Canon SLR camera and I am absolutely happy that I made right decision of buying this camera instead of underwater case for my SLR because TG1 is more practical and easy to use.

      "text": "We were very excited to get such a good deal for our office on this camera. We were satisfied with the reviews about the seller so we bought it. When it arrived we charged the battery for the recommended amount of time, but the camera still didn't work. We took it to Best Buy to check the battery and they said the battery is healthy, the camera doesn't work. We are very frustrated that they sold us a broken camera and posed as a refurbished Amazon.com product. All I can say is BEWARE!!!",

      "text": "In video mode, the microphone captures an annoying clicking sound as the camera tries to maintain focus or adapt to changes in light. The clicking makes the videos sound like old 8mm films. The microphone also captures the sound of the zoom lens servo when you zoom in/out while taking video. Would be nice if Olympus included a screw-on lens cap for this camera so the lens stays clean. Gonna stick with my 2009 vintage Panasonic Lumix until they get the video issues worked out.",

This would have never happened with my TS4, which is made out of metal. I just don't understand why this is made out of soft plastic when it is supposed to be drop proof. Since I can see into the side of the camera now that the plastic is broken off, I'm assuming it's no longer waterproof too.",

    "title": "Olympus TG-1iHS 12 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom,Silver",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRO IMAGE QUALITY FROM A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE\nWorld's First f2.0 High-Speed Lens on a Tough Camera. Olympus' newest Tough model draws on their extensive history of creating rugged, durable cameras that take the worry out of life-on-the-go shooting. This revolutionary TOUGH model introduces the World's First Ultra-Bright, High-Speed f2.0 lens on a Tough camera allowing you to capture dramatically better images in low-light and fast action situations than any other rugged model currently on the market*. The combination of durability and outstanding image quality makes it possible to shoot in even the harshest of conditions. Just imagine: capture beautiful underwater scenes and aquatic life, snap photos of triumphant arrivals to dusk-lit peaks, record your ride down the rapids in dazzling 1080p Full HD Video. The possibilities are truly endless.*as of April 23rd, 2012\n\n\n\nSUPERIOR OPTICS\nHIGH-SPEED, ULTRA-BRIGHT F2.0 LENS\nThe TG-1 iHS is the world's first rugged camera on the market* to include an ultra-bright, high-speed f2.0 lens so you can capture scenes that were previously \"impossible\" with a point & shoot. This new lens strengthens the camera's shooting capabilities making high-quality images and blazing fast shutter speeds possible even when a flash cannot be used or when shooting fast action or in low light.\n\n3.0\" OLED MONITOR\nThis 3.0-inch high-resolution OLED display (610K dots) provides excellent visibility outdoors enabling you to compose the perfect shot even in direct sunlight. And several protective coatings help to prevent scratches and cut down on reflective glare from bright lights and sun. Awesome optics, both in camera and on screen.\n\n\n\n\nUNMATCHED RUGGED DURABILITY\nTHE PROOF IS IN THE BUILD\nWATERPROOF TO 40FT.\nThe TG-1 iHS crushes the notion that cameras are easily damaged by water and humidity. The Olympus-original complete sealing system and double lock construction borrowed from Olympus' long history of manufacturing underwater housings ensures that the TG-1 iHS is completely waterproof down to a new depth of 40ft. Even on land, the TG-1 iHS ensures that you'll never miss an awesome shot just because of heavy rain or snow.\n\n\n\nSHOCKPROOF TO 6.6FT.\nThe shockproof structure of the TG-1 iHS ensures that your investment is protected. Carefully sandwiched between two protective frames, the lens and camera unit remain unfazed by bumps, drops, falls and other impacts. Even after repeated drops, critical camera components and functions like the lens, shutter, aperture and auto-focus remain safe. Drop, pick up, and keep on shooting.\n\n\n\nCRUSHPROOF TO 220LBF.\nThe TG-1 iHS uses a double-layer construction, consisting of a tough yet lightweight polycarbonate resin and a metal frame. The crushproof construction ensures that your camera \u2013 and screen! \u2013 won't break, even under 220lbs of pressure. No more cracked screens because you've left your camera in your back pocket or suitcase.\n\n\n\nFREEZEPROOF TO 14F\nKeep shooting outdoors even in the winter. The TG-1 iHS is designed to keep operating at below freezing temperatures, safe from the two most common problems when shooting in cold weather: lens condensation and auto zoom malfunction. Hit the slopes, fire up your snowmobile, or break out the skates, because with the TG-1 iHS by your side, you'll never miss those awesome wipe out moments.\n\n\n\nDUSTPROOF\nLife gets dirty. Between dusty fields and muddy trails, sometimes your camera doesn't stay as pristine as you'd like it to. But even in less-than-spotless environments, the fine protective sealing of the TG-1 iHS helps keep out dirt and debris allowing you to capture shot after shot even in the harshest environments.\n\n\n\n\n\nWATER-REPELLANT LENS COATING\nSplash after splash, never worry about water droplets obstructing your images thanks to the water-repellent lens coating that prevents water from remaining on the lens surface. And because it's applied to the OLED monitor as well, composing shots in the rain or while riding the waves will be a breeze.\n\n\n\nDOUBLE-LOCK DURABILITY\nWith all the care that is put in to protecting the inner workings of your camera, it would be a shame for the system to fail because the battery door opens unintentionally. Thanks to the multi-directional, double-lock mechanism, your camera is protected from accidental openings under water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOUTSTANDING IMAGE QUALITY\nIHS\nA high-sensitivity, high-speed 12-megapixel backlit CMOS sensor combines with a blazing fast, DSLR-quality TruePic VI image processor resulting in high-speed autofocus, enhanced Intelligent Auto for spectacular scene and subject recognition, and 2x Super-Resolution Zoom to produce jaw-dropping images in locations that make even the most seasoned photographers cringe. This family of technologies conquers challenging shooting conditions with improved light condensing efficiency, less noise and quick response time \u2013 twice as fast as traditional cameras \u2013 for definitively unmatched image quality.\n\nSUPER SPORT MODE\nDesigned specifically to keep up with life-on-the-go photography, the new Super Sport Mode combines high-speed autofocus with extra fast shutter speeds \u2013 up to 1/2000 \u2013 to freeze the action. Conveniently located on the dial, this mode captures 5 shots in a high-speed burst to ensure crisp shots of even the most extreme action sport settings.\n\n\n\nLOW LIGHT MODE\nLow Light Mode is perfect for capturing the mood of low-light indoor scenes, beautiful sunsets, or late night outdoor festivities without ruining the ambience with a bright flash. Forget about subject blurring or camera shake ruining the shot \u2013 Low Light Mode has you covered.\n\nFULL HD VIDEO WITH HDMI OUTPUT & CONTROL\nWith the TG-1 iHS, you can shoot 1080p Full HD videos (1920x1080 pixels) at 60 frames per second at the touch of button, allowing for slow-motion playback. Thanks to iHS Technology, your videos will get the VIP treatment with excellent color reproduction and faster processing speeds, while Multi-Motion IS compensates for user movement creating smoother videos. Linear PCM Recording, an audio technology pioneered by Olympus for professional voice recorders, records your videos with high-definition audio for optimal playback results. HDMI output and control makes playing back videos on your HDTV a breeze.\n\n\n\nHIGH-SPEED SEQUENTIAL SHOOTING\nShoot like a pro! With 10fps high-speed burst shooting, nail the perfect shot by taking a quick sequence of images at the touch of a button. Still afraid you'll miss a moment? At 3MP, the frame rate increases to an astounding 60 shots per second. You'll have so many great shots, you won't be able to share just one!\n\nENHANCED IAUTO (INTELLIGENT AUTO)\nIn iAuto mode, the camera automatically detects the subject, lighting and situation to identify the scene you're shooting \u2013 up to 30 different scenes including Night, Sport, Beach and Snow, Underwater Snapshot and Backlight HDR \u2013 and adjusts the settings for ideal results. Leave it up to the TG-1 iHS to choose optimum settings so you can focus on capturing that amazing shot.\n\n\n\nSYSTEM EXPANDABILITY\nLENS ACCESSORIES THAT TAKE FUNCTIONALITY TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.\nFISHEYE CONVERTER LENS\nAchieve panoramic wide-angle shots without sacrificing the brightness of the f2.0 lens. Even in darker underwater scenes down to 40ft., you can shoot wider, more dynamic images that beautifully reproduce underwater scenery. Waterproof to 40ft.\n\nTELE CONVERTER LENS\nTelephotography of 1.7x extends your optical zoom from 4x to nearly 7x. Get highly artistic shots that draw attention to the subject by blurring the background, and achieve higher shutter speeds while zooming in close on a subject on the move. Waterproof to 40ft.\n\nLENS CONVERTER ADAPTER\nDon't forget the adapter for your Fisheye or Tele Converter Lens! Already have a stash of favorite lens filters? The converter adapter can accommodate any 40.5mm filter.\n\nUNDERWATER HOUSING\n40 feet not deep enough for you? Dive to depths of 135 feet (45m) with the new Olympus PT-053 underwater housing, designed specifically for the TG-1 iHS. Featuring a large, responsive shutter button, precision zoom lever and a tight O-ring main seal with safety lock, the PT-053 allows divers, from beginner to dive master, to capture worry-free images of unique underwater scenes.\n\nEXTREME VERSATILITY\nGPS & E.COMPASS\nThe ideal travel guide. With the GPS and e.compass functions on the TG-1 iHS, location and landmark information will be displayed and recorded along with the image. The TG-1 iHS is also equipped with a logging function so you can track the route taken from recorded images by using applications such as Google Earth and Picasa. And with the brand new LI-90 battery, you'll worry less about battery life and more about your next destination.\n\nMANOMETER\nMark your spot on the map with the built-in manometer. Records elevation & water depth and even displays a warning when the user approaches a depth of 40ft.\n\nAUTOMATIC UNDERWATER BALANCE\nThe Olympus TG-1 iHS boasts 4 different underwater scene modes -- Underwater Snapshot, Underwater Wide 1, Underwater Wide 2 and Underwater Macro -- each carefully calibrated to allow for optimal color balance, exposure and flash so you automatically get the best results. Beautiful underwater photos made simpler.\n\nLED ILLUMINATOR\nAn LED Illuminator is like a mini-flashlight on the front of the camera to enhance focus and exposure for macro shooting \u2013 great for underwater close-ups where light is scarce. The LED illuminator also works in conjunction with the flash to help illuminate your subject in low-light conditions.\n\nMAGIC ART FILTERS\nExpress your creativity with 12 different special effects for your photos and HD videos. Olympus' Magic Art Filters infuse familiar scenes with new and unexpected moods ranging from the excited to the serene and from the whimsical to the mysterious. Choose from Pop Art, Pin Hole, Drawing, Fisheye, Soft Focus, Punk, Sparkle, Watercolor, Miniature, Reflection, Dramatic and Fragmented. (Some effects apply only to still photos. Effects may reduce image size).\n\nIncluded Accessories : A/V cable, USB cable, AC power adapter and Wrist strap",
