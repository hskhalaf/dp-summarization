It is compact and the battery is good but I find my vacuum is easier and faster to use in the long run because this little thing doesn\u2019t have what it takes. I would return it if I could.",

Also the extension part does NOT have a gap in it like other reviewers said. You have to flip it out then push it in to sea up the gap. The others are not pushing it on, they must think it should out and automatically snaps into place - it does not, just flip it out and tap it on to seal up the gap. To put it back you simply tug or pull it out then fold it back into place. Be gentle it's all plastic.",
