I knew it had to be from having 2 inside dogs and all the dust that accumulates from them and everyone else. No matter how often I cleaned, I still felt bad. Constantly blowing my nose and taking sinus medicine almost every day. One day I googled and saw that an air purifier would help with all the dust and dog dander. We got this one based on the reviews and it is everything we hoped for! I can breathe again! And yes it also helps with odor!",

Within hours I noticed my room smelled fresher and I could breath alot better. I run it around 5-10 hours a day. It really moves alot of air fast. I have it in my bedroom which measures 25x22 and it cycles that air really fast. The only issue I have with it is small, when the fan is set on 3 it is quiet loud. But other than that I love it!",

I was really worried that he would be too allergic to stay here the entire time planned so I got these and ran them full blast for three days (night and day) before he arrived and he had virtually no issues.
