I got this because I wanted to start fishing with jug lines and this was a great way to extend my reach from the pontoon boat to grab the lines. My wife can drive the boat and not worry about being 100% on the spot close enough for me to reach the lines and I don\u2019t have to worry about leaning over and falling in. Over all gets my recommendation.",

      "text": "The only problem with this gaff is that the tip is not tapered. It\u2019s simply an aluminum hook with a 4 edge point, which makes it very difficult to get a good gaff shot without putting everything thing you\u2019ve got in it. It takes two hands and a very solid yank to puncture the scales of snapper, grouper, or other reef fish. This causes inexperienced fishermen onboard the boat to lose fish which would be easily landed with a tapered point gaff.",
