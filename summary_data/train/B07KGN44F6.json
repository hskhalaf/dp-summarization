      "text": "We are thrilled with this table - It was easy to assemble, and sturdy. There was a splintering of a top edge of our table upon arrival that we had to contend with, but we have solved any future issues by ordering a custom glass top for it from a local vendor to protect the easily-compromised tabletop finish. Otherwise, we are very pleased with it. UPDATE: Less than three months in, and two of the legs are splitting apart - I can fit a credit card in these cracks. We\u2019ve done our best to treat this table with kid gloves, covering the top with glass, and going easy on it in general. What are my warranty options, Amazon?",

HIGHLY recommend for the price! Only giving sturdiness a 4/5 because the center piece at the base bends a bit, so we just don\u2019t apply pressure to it. Otherwise, it\u2019s very sturdy! I read about how malleable the wood is so we are careful not to place any objects that could damage the wood. There are 3 staple-shaped lines in each of the pieces, which could have been storage damage or just product design, but I don\u2019t mind them at all!",
