There are days in which it work others, in which the volume is unpaired with the left speaker, and more frequently it just doesn't work. I've tried to connect them to the console both wireless and wired, and nothing change. I've tried to check if it was a sort of pan setting, but it's not possible to set the pan on the app. So I assume it;s a hardware issue. It's unacceptable that a Sony product that cost 130\u00a3 is so unreliable!",

For the price you are expected to pay, having it broken out of the box with a manufacturing defect is unacceptable. You wouldn't accept it for a \u00a310 headset so definitely don't accept it here.

      "text": "This headset is absolutely incredible, the best headset I've used, I'm not sure the 3D audio does anything for me, but the surround sound in general, crystal clear, superb quality of the audio is just fantastic, the way the headset works easily with any other device using the cable is also great. It is so light and comfortable and even folds away neatly. So very happy with this headset.",
