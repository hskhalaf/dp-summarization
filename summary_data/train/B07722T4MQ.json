I feel like Kim Kardashian in these... Kanye better look on out now! I ordered the grey in small, as you can see, they got me so excited, I was tucked in by 4pm. They definitely worth the purchase.

I was very fond of it until the day I realized it stains everything and anything it\u2019s in touch with. My skin, my bed, my robe, pillows... everything is now in black dye. Very disappointing. I still love it and wear it I wish it was a better quality. I def stopped wearing after I changed my sheets. This is just a joke. I have to trash my bedding and everything that has been stained. Who will refund me for everything this stupid pj has ruined ?",

I have learned to always size up when it comes to 100% silk or poly/satin PJ's and these are no exception. Even so, the bottoms are snuger than I'd like, but the top fits perfectly. The length is perfect, hits the top of my foot (I'm 5'10.5\"). I've ordered green, royal blue, and light blue and haven't had any color bleeding or staining issues. Shipping can be unpredictable. The first pair I purchased months ago took 3 weeks to deliver. I ordered 2 pairs last week and they came in 2 days. I've just ordered my fourth pair (red).",

Best of all, because of the slippery nature of the satin, I can roll over in bed more easily than in my flannel pj's, thus a better night's sleep. I've washed them several times and they've held up superbly, no fraying of the folded over seams of loss of elasticity. I am very pleased and will definitely order them again.",

Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to feel like their fanciest self when going to bed.",

The colors are very jewel tone and would make a nice gift for Christmas or any occasion.
