Im disappointed that the mic doesn't have volume controls (I wish this would have been in the product description), you can upgrade to a cord w volume controls via their website for roughly $8. Only major complaint is the little round discs on the size adjusters rips your hair out EVERY TIME I wear them. - people with hair over an inch long you've been warned!",

Also, the wires are annoying unless you wrap them up correctly for you, but otherwise if not an athlete or busy I would rate this a 5 star in the wired headphone category. Quality of headphone would be somewhere between Sole republics & skull candy",
