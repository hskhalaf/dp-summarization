They are wonderful, sturdy surfaces for organizing my space and providing room to spread out craft and/or sewing projects. The design of the folding legs is by far superior to similar tables I have seen. Although some tables may be less expensive, they all have struts and braces underneath that would interfere with a user's legroom and/or storage space. This table is designed so you could easily sit at the ends and be perfectly comfortable. They are well worth the price!",

The company was very quick to respond and thankfully refunded me all the money and I did not have to return the tables. I only had to send photos the first time I complained.

Not worth the energy to return and need it for Christmas in 2 days so will just live with it. That said it's very sturdy and should hold up well. I like it doesn't fold down the center so don't need to worry about things tipping in the crease.",
