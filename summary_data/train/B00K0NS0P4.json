Still it's great for travel, and in terms of speed it's the equal of my newer, larger primary phone. Those who like to tinker with their phones by rooting and upgrading to alternate ROMs will appreciate that this Moto G still has an active community of developers on the XDA website, where you can upgrade your Android OS months (years?) before Motorola gets around to sending it to you. It also works flawlessly with Net10, which runs on the AT&T network.",

Also, the LTE is faster with my tmobile service. As far as drawback, the camera is so so. However, Nexus 4 camera is not great either.

As one who has owned iPhone 4S, Nexus 5 and Nokia 925 (thanks to pre-paid T-Mobile), I think this Moto G strikes a good balance between value, performance and size. I am not a fan of large phones or 'phablets' and the Moto G is just the right size. The phone feels vastly superior in terms of build quality compared to Nexus 5. On T-Mobile LTE, I have measured download speeds in excess of 20 Mbits/sec! If you need an Android device without any strings attached or bloatware loaded by carriers, choosing the Moto G will make you very happy.",

In the case of the Moto G, the home/back button actually takes up the bottom of the screen . . . effectively shrinking your useable screen size.

      "text": "I think it's a great phone and at a great price, but don't expect it to be super fast and able to handle a lot at once. It only has 1GB of RAM and a fair processor (based on what I've read online) so it's not top-of-the-line. But I still think it's great. Almost no bloatware and a super smooth experience in terms of customization and finding what you need. I got the update to Lollipop also and it's awesome.",

Four stars instead of 5 only because I would prefer the phone had 2 GB of memory, not just 1 GB. I believe allocating more memory would have allowed the phone to better display the power of its quad-core processor. It is currently running Android OS version 4.4.4.",
