There was no distortion or problems with the glass. Happy with my purchase.",

After years of flimsy dime-store wall mirrors, we finally have one that provides a non-warped, smooth and perfect reflection (unless you are a vampire). The provided wall hook is adequate although some have complained that it seems a tad small considering the weight of this mirror.",
