I have rented inflatable paddle boards that are double the price of this, so I was pleasantly surprised to see what great quality this board has! It is sturdy when blown up and definitely big enough for me and my pup (plus it was easy for her to stay on). I love how it fits easily (with the pump) in the backpack which makes it convenient for throwing in the back of the car or in a closet at home. Would definitely recommend to others!",

I ordered a black board and the pictures show the sides black and the board that was delivered to me has white sides. 2nd, the adhesive or vinyl welding (not sure how it\u2019s constructed) shows through the outer layer. I\u2019m not too concerned about the structural integrity but it\u2019s a cosmetic flaw for sure.",

I\u2019ve taken it out on the lake several times and have had wonderful results each time. I also love the bag that they provide to carry the paddle board and all it\u2019s equipment. It has heavy duty backpack straps that makes it easy to transport. Also, deflating and rolling it up doesn\u2019t take long and is very easy. I would highly recommend this board.",

My kids loved it for just hanging out on the lake and my wife loves the workout it provides. Thumbs up!",

So not having it inflated properly made it unstable and difficult to stand on. Other than that it was a good buy.",
