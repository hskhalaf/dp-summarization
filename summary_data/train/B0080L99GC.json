SC Johnson is a huge soap company- they also own Pledge and Shout - and this company uses animals to test its products. They are now instituting animal testing for Ecover (and Method as well), so be mindful that the values of Ecover have changed. This seems to be yet another one of those previously sustainable and animal-friendly companies that sold out and is now just green-washing.",

The \u201ceco\u201d in your brand name is pure greenwashing.",
