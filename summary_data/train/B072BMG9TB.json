Anyway, this was a perfect solution being that I use an external DAC/amp for the my headphones. I used some double sided adhesive and set the unit right next to my DAC using a USB extension. I love it! Had an integrated mute and volume button. Sounds amazing! As other users have stated the input is only Mono which is fine for a mic but not ok for other audio inputs.",

This device allowed me to eliminate cable clutter from the controller, which is really nice. It's a niche application, but if you are streaming with a capture card/PC setup then this product may help route audio without creating a mess of cables plugged into the PS4 controller.",

It is not quiet but I can't get it to be loud either; therefore, the little volume mixer on the side is always at max volume.

This was a cost-effective, plug and play solution, and I like having the volume control close to my fingers so I don't have to reach all the way up to the touch bar (it's on a stand) and it's separate from the system volume control. The sound quality is good, but lacks a bit behind the built-in Mac audio a tad.",
