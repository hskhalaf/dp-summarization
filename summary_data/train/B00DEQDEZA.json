I tried soaking the interior with vinegar twice for 5 hours as well as washing and soaking in soap water but nothing removed the taste. I also had others taste the water to make sure that it was not just something to do with my taste buds but they all tasted the plastic as well. I am returning and purchasing an all stainless steel kettle instead.",

My 6-dollar similar white plastic kettle from Goodwill, an older, supposedly \"less sophisticated\" one with an external (not underneath the base) heating coil, lasted me much longer than that. I used it for a year or so and donated it, still working fine. And it was already used when I bought it. It makes this kettle look REALLY bad. And it makes me sad.",

Love the pop top easy opening lid that opes wide enough to fill without spills. After 2nd pot, I could not smell the plastic smell. Just to be sure, left the kettle sit overnight with the lid open to air out, and today there was zero, none, nada plastic smell. So overall this is a great kettle at a low price that delivers.",

      "text": "I bought this to keep in the office kitchen. It is perfect for it--inexpensive, simple, and does the job well. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does take a while to heat up the water. It has auto off so it's not a big deal, but more expensive models like the one I have at home do work faster.",

    "description": "Color:WhitePurifies Water to the Last Drop\nDid you know that most bottled waters sold in the supermarkets are reclaimed and reprocessed tap water? They have been heavily filtered to change the taste, and they are packaged in bottles that might contain BPA, posing a danger of plastic chemicals leaching into the water. Not to mention they are sold at prices that\u2019s 3000 times higher than tap water! That\u2019s a hefty sum of money for something that\u2019s not too far from the water you get from your faucet. With this Ovente\u2019s KP72 Electric Kettle Series, you\u2019d be able to purify your drinking water to its safest state. It runs on 1100W (120V) that boils water at 160 \u2109, effectively killing all pathogens and bacteria present in it.\n\nUncomplicated Operation and Cleanup\nThis kettle is crafted with a secure locking lid that flips back with just one push of a button! This button stays cool along with its cool touch handle. What\u2019s more, you can remove its spout filter for an out-and-out clean! Simply mix 3 tablespoons of vinegar or lemon with water then allow it to boil. Let it sit for a minimum of five more hours and dry afterwards. Storing this 1.7L kettle is easy as well: The 30-inch cord wraps neatly to its base.\n\nKey Features\n- 1.7L\n- 1100W\n- BPA-free\n- Stainless Steel Interior\n- Concealed Heating Element\n- Easy-to-Clean Removable Filter\n- LED indicator light\n- Automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection\n- Stay-cool handle and button\n- Measurements: 8.5 x 6.7 x 9.4 inches\nNOTE: The electric kettle might reach the boiling point faster at higher altitudes due to the fluctuation of temperature. Hence, the kettle might not shut off on its own.\n\nCAUTION: KETTLE BODY MIGHT GET EXTREMELY HOT DURING OPERATION. PLEASE BE EXTRA CAREFUL AND USE THE COOL-TOUCH HANDLE TO AVOID BURNS.",
