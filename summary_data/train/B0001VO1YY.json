Therefore, when a bike was placed on rack, there was quite a bit of sway. I ended finding a longer pin that fits through the main post and an additional plate, that pulls the rack up tight against the hitch. This has reduced the sway within the hitch, but not to the point where I feel very comfortable traveling at 70 MPH, or even turning. While a great value for the price, I just wish the rack sat tighter within the hitch itself (2020 Toyota Tacoma)",

As it is, the holes in the main part are big enough to attach a small padlock and you can hook a small cable to that - but it is cumbersome and sloppy. Also, someone could easily steal the other parts with no tools required. Basically, you can put a lock on the bike frame and attach it to the trailer hitch ring (which has nothing to do with the rack) to secure the bike but if you leave the rack itself (no bike) overnight, it is not really securable.",

No play in the extension to hitch connection. We will be using a tie down strap to the outer bumper to stop the sway. Our spare tire is on the back of the jeep and has a cover over it. We are unable to carry a 2nd bike unless we remove the cover or the pedal from the bike. The extension would need to be about 2\" longer on this application. Otherwise we like the bike rack. It is a good value and appears to be well constructed.",

      "text": "Met my expectations. Easy to assemble. Secures the bike quickly and tight (I do use an additional tie down for added peace of mind). I can have the rack and bike mounted in under 1 minute. Likewise have everything off in the same time frame. Very nice to load the bike, after a long ride, in seconds and be on my way. Chose this configuration over a frame secured rack because I felt the weight of the bike plus movement/bounce due to road bumps was better transferred to the tire and not the frame. Completely satisfied with this rack and it looks like it is durable enough to last for many years.",
