She gained about 15-20 pounds. And 2 of my 3 min pins are overweight because they too have been fixed. My doberman lost a large amount of weight a few months ago so I thought she'd be ok. So I put her back on the Rachel Ray they were all on. BAD IDEA...bought this again for my overweight pups and keep the other 2 on Rachel Ray by separating them while eating. They really like it!",
