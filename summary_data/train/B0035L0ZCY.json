I was a little leery going with a Wiimote by another company, but Nyko is the same brand that makes our battery chargers and rechargeable batteries for the Wii, and we've been using them since the same year Wii came out with no issues, so we gave this Wiimote a chance. This Wiimote is especially good for people who need larger buttons...or who can't see the markings on the standard Wiimote buttons. It does occasionally lose it's connection to the Wii...can't tell if that's more often than other Wiimotes do or not yet, but it doesn't seem to be. At half the price of a Wiimote from Wii, it's holding it's own so far.",

Where as original from WII is running with its original battery this Product has consumed multiple sets of Battery and still wants more. Also we have hard time to get it recognized by WII we have to press button 1 and 2 like ten times and keep it pressed I have no idea how to get rid of this, I am not recommending this product",

I returned the Sensor Bar Sensibility to default (in the middle) and made more tests in various shooting games (Goldeneye, Heavy Fire, Carnival King) the controller worked very good.
