      "text": "I have used micrometers for over 30 years. At one time in my career I taught proper use of precision measuring instruments to union workers in a high precision machine shop. There are better quality products on the market and you probably know the brand names. The Fowler is a great product for the price. I bought it for my daughter who is a school teacher that teaches technical subjects to her students. She uses the Fowler in her class to teach precision measuring to her students. It has worked flawlessly for her despite being utilized by many unskilled students.",

      "text": "I was skeptical due to the price but thought I would give it a shot before dropping $200 on Starrett etc. These are definitely not of flimsy construction like sporting good store brands. The first thing I noticed was their weight and rigid feel, just like high end calipers. I have been using them almost everyday for months and they are accurate and zero still indicates perfectly at twelve o'clock. The case they come in is very nice and can be opened easily with one hand.",

I've tested it on some gage blocks and some 1-2-3 blocks that I have and it checks out just fine so far. I got it as a backup caliper for my Mitutoyo and it works great (so far). I will note that the first set of these that I got about 6 years ago got dropped a couple times and they quickly started skipping gears and getting locked/bound up. I know it says \"shockproof\" but don't be fooled, any set of dial calipers can be quickly broken with a few hard shocks.",

    "title": "Fowler Full Warranty Stainless Steel Shockproof Dial Caliper, 52-008-706-0, 0-6\" Measuring Range, 0.001\" Graduation Interval, Face Color White",
    "description": "The Fowler Shockproof stainless steel dial caliper has dial graduations of 0.001\" with 0.001\" accuracy, shockproof anti-backlash control, a sliding jaw with a lock, and a covered rack. This caliper is used for measuring inside dimensions (ID), outside dimensions (OD), depth, and step. This product has a 1 year warranty offered by Fowler High Precision. If you experience any problem contact Fowler directly for warranty claims. \n\nShockproof spring anti-backlash control with a heavy-duty spring offers increased accuracy over standard gear configurations. Backlash is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth in the caliper controls that prevents the gear teeth from jamming. It is undesirable to have much backlash due to the lack of precision offered by the increased amount of play between gears. Certain gear designs can minimize or eliminate backlash; spring anti-backlash systems use a spring to add a compressive force, thereby minimizing backlash. \n\nThis caliper has a knurled lock screw to hold the sliding jaw in position and help ensure a consistent measurement. A covered rack prevents dirt and debris from clogging the gear, and helps prevent measurement errors. A thumb-operated fine adjustment roller allows for one-handed use. \n\nThe caliper measures 0.10\" per revolution of the dial. The dial has 0.001\" graduations, and the beam has engraved 0.1\" graduations. The hardened stainless steel components, including the beam, measuring surfaces, rack, gears, and depth rod, offer corrosion resistance, increased accuracy, and long life. Self-contained movement eliminates gear misalignment, while the dual pinion drive mechanism reduces wear on the rack and pinion. An adjustable dial enables setting zero. The hardened stainless steel is polished to a satin chrome finish, to help prevent glare. This caliper comes with a fitted case. \n\nDial calipers are measuring instruments commonly used for inspection in manufacturing to provide the precise measurements of an object. A pair of jaws attached to a long beam with a marked scale is used to measure inside, outside, and step measurements in standard or metric units. An additional depth probe slides along the beam to take depth measurements. One jaw is fixed to the end of the scale, while the other jaw slides along it to take measurements. A circular dial indicator is fixed to the movable jaw on a toothed gear rack that transfers movement of the jaws to the dial needle. The base measurement is taken from the long beam, which provides the initial whole measurement in inches or centimeters, and added to the dial reading, which provides fractional measurements in inches or millimeters. A locking mechanism provides the ability to take differential measurements for determining the difference in measurements between two objects. Compared to digital calipers, dial calipers are more durable, but are more susceptible to shock damage and prone to getting dirt in the gears, which can cause accuracy problems. Vernier calipers are more durable than dial calipers because they do not have internal moving parts, but they can be more difficult to read. Dial calipers are commonly used in fields such as metalworking, mechanical engineering, machining, and carpentry. \n\nFowler, an American company, manufactures inspection and measurement instruments such as electronic indicators, calipers, bore gages, and digital scales. The company, founded in 1946, is headquartered in Newton, MA. \n\n\nWhat's in the Box?\n\u2022 Fowler Shockproof 0-6\u201d dial caliper\n\u2022 Fitted case",
