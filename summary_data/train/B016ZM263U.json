      "text": "Very cute toy! The dials on the washing machine and on the iron turn, the front of the washer can be spun like the clothes are spinning in the washer/dryer. A good size for \"washing\" doll clothes. The shirt and pants that are included are made of felt, and do not open to fit on any doll. They have some sort of stiff material inside the 2 felt layers, so they can be \"ironed\", folded, and ironed flat again. The laundry soap is wood, but the box of fabric softener sheets is cardboard, so I'm not sure how long that will hold up. It does include 3 pretend softener sheets, though! Overall very happy with this purchase!",
