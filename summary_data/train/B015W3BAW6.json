Using this tool to snap through the locks was butter smooth, and oddly satisfying. Very easy to do. 10/10 would liberate a bike again.",

      "text": "First time out - tried to cut through the shackle on a Master Lock 517D Laminated Padlock with Long Shackle. Have done it lots of times before with hacksaw blade. Was very easy. But with this bolt cutter - first you can achieve no leverage because the arms are too short. Then it won\u2019t bite all the way through the tiny thin shackle. I kept trying and suddenly the tool exploded, sending everything not welded on flying across the room.",
