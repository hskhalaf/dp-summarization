I dropped that one as well and it cracked in the same space - the thin strip on the bottom. However, I did love the case. It was durable and loved the kick stand (I got a new phone - that wouldn't fit in the case). I loved that it came with a screen protector. And it stayed together even after I dropped it a few times. I'm rough on phone cases, I drop them all the time.",

The case does not allow for the insertion of the adapter that comes with the phone so you can plug in a thumb drive or other USB devices. So, if you need access you have to remove the case which kind of defeats the purpose in my mind. One good feature is the fact that you CAN use it and it does work for wireless charging.",

This new case that was sent to me was scratched when I got it, so they sent a replacement. Now the gray part of the replacement case has turned yellow...not sure why or how, but it looks funny. It protects well, but something odd is going on with what it is made out of.",

I use it soooooooo much and have not appreciated any drop off in the mechanics or sturdiness. I would say the only downside is the built-in screen protector. While this is very convenient it is hard to clean it off to keep that crispy fresh look. Other than that still highly recommend this case.",

It really is the perfect case so I don't have to worry about breaking the phone and can easily use it with the enclosed casing on front. Works much better than the glass protectors I was using.

Had one on my s7 edge for over 2 years and did an amazing job protecting my phone. I also had the over priced otter box commuter case and the spigen is better for only $17. Just my 2cents.",

The phone itself is very slim and petite and this case adds a little weighty bulk to it, but I don't mind. The cutouts are where they should be and the kickstand, although nice, feels like you have to handle it with care. Overall, great case.",
