It seems to struggle technically when trying to run some apps (turn by turn directions just did not work for example) and frequently run low on storage space because many apps can't be moved to the SD card, but it gets the basics like phone, text and email done if you need it. I was glad to trade it in for a higher end phone when my contract was up for renewal/upgrade.",
