I have a difficult time finding a truly soft toothbrush. They might say soft or extra soft, but when I get them home there usually is nothing soft about them. This brush is great. I can feel the bristles getting between my teeth and it's very comfortable for me to use. I will be buying more of these.",

These are the best manual toothbrushes I\u2019ve ever used AND they\u2019re more affordable than what I would pay for standard toothbrushes at the store. They are so soft and comfortable on my gums, but the little bristles feel like they get in between my teeth better than any other toothbrush I\u2019ve used. Plus the compact head reaches comfortably into ever place in my mouth. Love these and plan to use them from now on! :)",

They wanted me to try finding extra soft bristled brushes, and I've had a similar product before from a name brand. So I got these! They're actually better in my opinion because the handle is designed with a hole in the center. It likely conserve resources for the manufacture to offer these at low prices. The added bonus for us is that the handle flexes and reminds you to not 'over brush' by brushing too hard. Hopefully I'll see improvement in my gums.",

After about a week, there is no irritation and flossing hurts much lesser now also. As for the charcoal aspect I can not really comment. I use this brush with charcoal based toothpaste, so I do not know if it is helping or not. However, I figure it can not hurt. As for the design, it is solid. The head of brush fits my mouth perfectly, and the handle provides an excellent grip.",

The \"flossing\" bristles are my favorite type and these are middle-of-the-road as far as flossing brushes go. The bristles are soft (which is a matter of personal taste) and overall comfortable. The bad. The handle. It is small enough to fit into a standard toothbrush holder and I like the idea of using less plastic with an open section. Sadly, the practical result of that is that the colored part is so flexible the brush will bend when using it. It's not much, just enough to make brushing feel weird and to give the whole brush a low-quality experience.",
