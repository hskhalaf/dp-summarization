The gold colour really does look very nice and you can tell the build quality is very premium. I think the face unlock is good but they should have kept the fingerprint scanner. But then again, maybe that is the way forward! The reason why I did not give the iPhone XS a 5 star is because I think it is overpriced, despite it's quality. But that's just my opinion. :)",
