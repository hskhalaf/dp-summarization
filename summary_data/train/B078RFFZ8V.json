What one needs to know, is it takes a long time to assemble the product, allow at least 6 to 7 hours! Very easy to assemble just very time consuming, luckily I decided to do in advance or I would have been in trouble! This isn\u2019t pull a string and done, you have to work every piece of fine tissue paper into place. Everyone loved the end result and raved about it, but I would never have ordered had I known what a time eater it was!",

You have to make the tassels and pom poms, but for me it was fun to do, and it was not hard at all. My husband and I did it together. It can be a little time consuming, so give yourself time to decorate. Well worth the time and purchase!! The pictures really do not show how beautiful the decorations looked in person, but I wanted to give you a peak. Order came in quick.",
