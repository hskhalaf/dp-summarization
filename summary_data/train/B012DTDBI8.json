I wish it was bundled with the keyboard or the Surface Pen because to buy those separately is very expensive, but I'm fine using mine as just a tablet. Only issue is most websites will load normally as if you're on a full blown computer, and it's hard to tap around those webpages with your finger. Microsoft needs to do something so websites realize you're using a tablet and they load as mobile sites or tablet friendly sites. Similar to how websites know you're using your phone and automatically load the mobile friendly version of their site.",
