So, when we take it off we have to clean them all out of the pool every time. It's a cheap way to heat the pool but I guess it's going to mean buying a new one every season.

The pre punched holes permit water to get onto top of cover when folding for removal thus inevitably returning dirty water to the pool when folded back. This is a total hassle as it also increases the weight of the cover dragging it down further to allow more water on to the top of the cover with other pre punched holes. Had I known before it ever was put on I might have taped over the holes. Regardless, the pool cover is a -partial one season-waste of money",

I all so made a holder for it out of pvc pipe something i got off of YouTube you can take it on and off with one person with this.",

It looks like bubble wrap on the bottom, but it works great and can feel the difference in our pool temperature. When we had storms and heavy rain, the cover did not sink or move around the pool.....so it kept all the dirt and leaves out and we could get in after the storms...to a nice warm pool. I am highly impressed with this Intex Solar Cover!",
