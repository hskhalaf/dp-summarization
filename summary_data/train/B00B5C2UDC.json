They also do a solid job of blocking out sound. On the down side, you have to wrap the cords around your ears. They are made of a tacky rubber that transmits a ton of rubbing and thumping if you don't. Side note, only the supplied tips work. aftermarket's fit but don't recess over the horn and make the buds stick out of your ears. At least they give you multiple sizes. Overall, these are better sounding than most of the $40-60 buds I've been buying.",

The plug or the wires, not sure which, no longer deliver sound properly. I expected a longer lifespan. There is a twelve-month warranty but I'm not sure if it covers this issue.",

The pair I got seemed defective right out of the box -- could hear music very clearly but vocals for all the songs I played were so soft as to be inaudible. I tried 3 different iPods which all worked fine with other headphones. I jiggled the plug a little bit and would sometimes get the vocals to be normal in audibility but just for a second or so before fading away. Also, there was tons of noise from the cord touching anything -- which was extremely loud in the seconds between songs -- how come no one else mentioned this? Sending them back as defective.",

However it wasn't more than a couple of weeks later that a friend with another pair from the same order had his also go out. These were only sparingly being used at home and seen no rough treatment. Unless you plan to be exceedingly careful with them, I wouldn't recommend these headphones.",
