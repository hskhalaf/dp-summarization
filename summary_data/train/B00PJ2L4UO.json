Now I love them, I'm not sure yet how close to the end my toes are but I don't really care.

If I was to mention a downside it would be the longer cut on the inner right clog, this is something that can happen when they are handmade, I get that. I feel that section when standing or walking, though it isn't a real bothersome issue. I would purchase again and am saving up for my next pair.",
