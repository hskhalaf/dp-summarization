Two different packs now the strips have turned completely dark in the package, and then you cannot use them. The entire package, unusable. I have no idea why this keeps happening, I\u2019ve read the directions and follow them. The package is tightly sealed it\u2019s kept away from the light and moisture and yet the entire package of strips still turns dark before they are ever used. Super disappointed ... the ones I used BEFORE they turned bad did work well though",
