Did not expect much based on the low price, but when I put them on that first cold morning I was absolutly blown away by the quality and feel. Hands down the best underlayer I have ever worn. No binding, bunching or stretching out. They have the smooth polyester exterior with a velvity brushed interior that was perfect for all day wear in temps that ranged from 30-70' Stayed warm when needed and dry as things warmed up. If you are paying high $ for brand name gear...STOP...and give these a try. You will be glad you did!",

I didn't need to wear anything over it, besides light running shorts, more for modesty, than necessity. Definitely recommended and is good value.",
