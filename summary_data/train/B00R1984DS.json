I tested my sim card in other phones and it works fine. Cellular calls and texts work, but no data. Now I'm stuck with s $275 phone that worked for 10 weeks. Went to Motorola website based on the Amazon listing for warranty but it wouldn't work. ***UPDATE: Reset the phone and switched the cellular setting and it's working again. Very happy because I like the phone, so I changed my rating back to 4 star.",

The phone is a very pleasant experience. Don't care that is will only go to Android 7. The differences are so minute in upgrades, I think it's oversold. Visual clarity and sound quality all shine, and this is the best phone I have used that's over 5.5\". Sitting next to my previous Moto 5\" phone, it's amazing that both phones physically are about the same, but the Nexus 6 has more screen real estate.",

Much more durable than the 6p, and with a better featureset, this phone received none of the advertisement of the inferior Huawei Nexus. One of the best optimized snapdragon 808 phones, a processor much superior to the 810, this thing still outpaces my axon 7, which uses an 820, in day to day tasks. Absolutely great in the hand, everything is glass or anodized metal, and features a very high water resistance rating. Call quality equally fantastic, and if you're on Tmobile, this thing does VOLTE and WIFI calling as of, at latest, Jan 2017. If you can wrap your hand around this thing, get it.",

Much more powerful, crispy screen and improved hardware. People who are saying this is a large phone. It is. But I also believe people are overreacting. Yes it's big, but if you're looking at this phone in the first place you aren't concerned about that, it's an overall great android experience. I also get lots of complements on this phone too, mostly from apple and samsung users! Highly recommend!",

As the battery drains, the performance deteriorates significantly which makes opening and using apps very tedious because of the lag and delay. Snapchat is virtually impossible to use when the battery is below 95% charged. Unacceptable. I have since upgraded to another phone. I would recommend not purchasing this phone. The company I purchased it from was good though, and the phone came in acceptable condition, it's just that this model of phone is horrendous and I did not do the proper research beforehand.",
