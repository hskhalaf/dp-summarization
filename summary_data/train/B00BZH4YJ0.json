The eko trash can I bought is aslo broken so the lid doesn't stay on the trash can when you set it up to use the step open feature. Very dissapointed in this purchase and will be looking for a drill and other supplies to try and fix this trash can to work. Spending almost $70 on this product for it to be broken is annoying and the fact that the eko trash can came in an other products box's makes me wonder a lot.",
