Because they do not manifest a problem, you must use a diagnostic tool such as a scale. Dramatic weight loss is a panic button indicating there may be a problem. My friends love the scale and even bounce up and down to change the read out. Easy to use, easy to clean, accurate. This is not a cheesy scale, by any means. Some may find this amusing, but the loss of a fine feathered friend can be prevented or identified by the use of this scale.",

Only knock is sometimes the kg/lb selector sticks and has to be pushed twice to get it to the lb option. If you're not careful, it'll be on the wrong one and you have to change it and weight again (or convert). HOLD option works well to get a good weight on a skittish pet.",

    "description": "Color:WhiteThe Health o meter 2 in 1 baby and toddler scale converts from infant tray style to traditional foot platform to adjust to your child\u2019s growth. The scale is shaped in the face of a teddy bear, making it friendly for children of all ages. Includes the Healthy Growth Baby Book contains growth charts to help you monitor and track your child\u2019s weight and height compared to national averages.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Health-o-Meter HDC100-01 \"Grow with Me\" Teddy Bear Scale is a first-of-its kind consumer baby and toddler scale. As your child grows, the scale easily converts from a tray to a platform, making this a versatile and cost-effective device for weighing your child as he develops from a newborn to a toddler. \n\n\nUse the Teddy Bear Scale to weigh your baby or toddler. View larger. \nRemove the tray to weigh your child in a standing position. View larger. \nLarge 1.2-inch LCD display. View larger. The large, easy-to-read 1.2-inch LCD display is front-facing so reading the weight is a breeze. Also, for added accuracy with small children, the scale weighs in half-pound increments up to 60 pounds. Calibration is a snap with a \"zero out\" feature that allows you to adjust for the weight of clothing or a diaper. This scale is powered by a replaceable nine-volt battery (not included), includes a growth chart to track height and weight against national averages, and it is backed by a five-year limited warranty. Operating the Scale\nPlace the scale on flat, level surface. A hard surface, such as a tile or linoleum floor, is the best for maximum accuracy. If the scale is placed on a soft, deep rug, then it may not produce accurate results. Once the scale is placed on an appropriate surface, press On/Off and wait for the display to show zeros. If the display shows \"0:0\", the scale is set to pounds/ounces; if the display shows \"0.00\" the scale is set to kilograms/grams. Press the lb/kg button to select between pounds or kilograms.\n\n The scale can be operated with or without the tray. When using the tray, make sure that it is securely locked into place before placing your baby on the scale. Simply lay your baby on the tray and read the display. To use the scale without the tray, you'll need to remove the tray by turning the locking nut clockwise. The tray is replaced by four rubber plugs and a supplied plastic cover tab. Once the cover is in place, hold your baby upright on the scale, and place the baby's feet so that the weight is evenly distributed. Of course, everyone knows that a baby rarely holds still. Health o Meter has an answer. If your child is moving, press the \"Hold\" button to lock in the correct weight. This function displays the baby's average weight for the time period. \n\n \nWhat's in the Box\nHDC100-01 baby and toddler scale, growth chart, and warranty.",
