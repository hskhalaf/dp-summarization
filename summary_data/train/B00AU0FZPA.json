However I have been dealing with it since July and it just doesn't provide any suction. My run to the table saw is not more than 2 foot and still insufficient. To test my piping I hooked up a small 24 year old shop vac to my piping and it provided plenty of suction. I am going to call today to see if I can get any service from the seller and if not I will just keep using the old shop vac and cast this off to a bad choice.",

I replaced it with a regular 5 inch band clamp and the problem was solved. There is no excuse for this.",

Ignore the nominal size markings on that adapter, it is pretty much 5x4 and makes the output more useful and I will confirm that it fits. Or, you can always go the duct tape route.",

I was kind of surprised at how quiet this runs. Sounds about the same as a garbage disposal. Got a used one and had to take a dent out of the motor casing... took all of 2 minutes.

I suppose this unit would be fine attached to both machines at once with a (Y) connection and separate hoses. I usually wear hearing protection, but even without it, this unit is not extremely loud.
