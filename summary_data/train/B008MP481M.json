In fact all it does is to force your head foreword making the experience more uncomfortable than simply resting your head on the tub. When you think about it, the most important function of any head pillow, no matter how you are positioned is to support the curved space between your head and shoulders. This item doesn't come close. The best I can say about it is that it is well constructed of sturdy material.",

Needless to say, it was barely usable. this was something I never heard of, but have needed for years. My next soak was so comfortable I dozed off! The suction cups on the lower section work well, but the top two, not so much. They detatch, but still provide neck support so it isn't that bad. I am glad I found this. A CVS support group recommended it, I tried, and man is this the way to soak away a CVS episode.",

The problem was that the spa cover was too loose and allowed small frogs to get in, and the frogs did their mess on every surface, including leaving permanent stains on the pillows. I haven't started to use the new pair yet, because I'm replacing that spa cover and trying to fix any potential entry point in the lanai (easier said than done!).",

But, just in case anyone looking at this item has a similar tub situation, I wanted to leave this review so they would know going in the possible downsides before buying.",

They are either way to hard or the plastic covering cracks and stabs you every time you lean back to relax. Not a fun time. This pillow doesn't have that issue. The covering is soft and flexible- so it doesn't crack and the pillow molds to the tub and you and bounces back to its original form when you get out. I would recommend this pillow to anyone who likes to soak in the tub and just relax",
