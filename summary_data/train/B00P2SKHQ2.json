Pros: -had a lof the the popular disney princesses -sturdy wooden container that hold the stamps -the rubber stamps were nicely constructed and looks like they'll hold up for many uses Cons: -wish the wooden container was a little bigger - it was hard to get the stamps in/out of it -the color pencils were cheap. They do not sharpen well. We didn't get it for the color pencils so it wasn't a huge deal -stamps pad was cheap. It didn't stamp well and dried up quickly",

She also had two little sisters so this was a nice treat that she could have for herself. This set is SUPER cute and I love the wood box it comes in great to keep it all organized and you could repurpose it down the road. It\u2019s also apparently mom approved because I was told that when the littles nap, this keeps big sis plenty occupied so mom can relax a bit or get a few things done around the house. I always have good luck with Melissa & Doug toys!",

    "description": "When your little princess is ready to have a ball, she will love designing her own royal adventures with this exquisitely detailed stamp set. A two-color stamp pad, five colored pencils, and nine fabulously regal stamps are all packed in a sturdy wooden tray. The Melissa & Doug Disney princess stamp set is sure to inspire creativity in kids and grown-ups alike. Help children identify the image on each stamp, or ask the children to place the stamps in a row, counting them as they line them up. Or try stamping a pattern and asking the children to replicate the pattern, copying both colors and shapes. The Wooden Stamp Set Disney Princesses is a delightful and educational gift for kids ages 4 and up. Add the Melissa & Doug Wooden Princess Wand Craft kit to round out the hands-on play experience and to give kids an engaging option for screen-free fun. For more than 30 years, Melissa & Doug has created beautifully designed imagination- and creativity-sparking products that NBC News called \u201cthe gold standard in early childhood play.\u201d Today, Melissa & Doug is proudly partnering with the American Academy of Pediatrics to foster early brain development and help children build important life skills through play.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom classic wooden toys to crafts, pretend play, and games, Melissa & Doug products provide a launch pad to ignite imagination and a sense of wonder in all children so they can discover themselves, their passions, and their purpose. \n\nSince the company\u2019s founding more than 25 years ago, Melissa & Doug has consistently delivered innovative products that inspire open-ended thinking, encourage kids to see new possibilities, and offer Countless Ways to Play.
