Bad news is that it is so soft, it tends to roll up or down your face when you move it, rather than sliding as a whole, up and down. Causes it to be actually uncomfortable and much poorer performance than the original, basic TF fleece neck warmer. One iteration of the originals I use is using 2 of them together for double thickness. Flawless function, extremely comfortable, and repels arctic level cold with ease.",

Now I couldn't imagine a work day without this.",
