Notes: - The 50 is much better/sharper in terms of image quality. (The 28 almost feels like you are shooting at an ISO higher than your setting) - The build quality is incredible...compared to the 50. My 50\u2019s focus ring is rough and noisy and the AF is scratchy, BUT, this 28 is silent and extremely smooth. I love the feeling. This is a beautiful lens for the price.",

It's so good in low light I rarely take a flash with me. Images are true to life with no distortion and it's tack sharp at all apertures. I use a tripod with cable release most of the time when shooting landscapes but it doesn't do bad handheld, either. The night shot below is on tripod and the day shot is handheld. It's well worth the price.",

I much prefer the 50mm f1.4 for indoor shots on both my ff and crop sensor. This summer I plan to use this lens for Milky Way/Galaxy photos but I have a less expensive Rokinon 14mm f2.8 which is much easier to manually focus. Will hope this works as well.",

Additionally with the amount I saved buying this instead of the L series, I also picked up a 85mm prime, a collapsible diffuser, a B+W Grad ND filter, and 2 B+W UV filters (because i'm paranoid) for the same price.",

The USM focus is quit and quick and works well with my 50D and 60D. It is my favorite lens and shoot 90% of the time because of the background blur as well as being an ideal walk around lens. Trying to do less with zoom also I am using this with the Canon 85mm 1.8 so I have most situations covered.",

Ive owned both lenses for a few months now and can attest that this camera shoots exactly the same if not better because of the F1.8 vs the F2.0 on the 35mm.

I could buy three of these for the price of the 24mm. All i wanted was a good low light, fast, lens to take candid shots with out the crappy flash on the camera. The images are great. Actually converts to about a 44mm film lens on my DSLR. No regrets.",
