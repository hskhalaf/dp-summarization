They don't catch on cotton or other types of material. I had to gently sand the cut out areas and \"soften\" the edges so they would not catch on my nylon tops. I also want to add that delivery of the product was fast.",

I will say that, after looking at EVERY SINGLE example of wooden hangers on the Amazon site, the ONLY hangers that did not have the stupid notches were the ones meant to hold coats - the ones with the big fat shoulders - and some hangers which I already own that are not sturdy enough to hold my husband's heavy clothing.",
