The problem is, as you clean the bottom collects dirt off the floor due to the static charges in the low-humidity environment here in Colorado. Once you spray the cleaner the dirt gets wet and turns into mud on the bottom side of the unit. As you clean, the mud is wiped back onto the floor. This leaves streaks of muddy water that we had to wipe up by hand on our hands and knees. Sold it on Craigs list. Very disappointing!",

The clean up of the machine is easy enough but it takes too long to make it efficient for a five minute cleaning job. The second time I used it I did the whole house, all tile, and it worked great. The clean up time is worth it when you have a big job to do.",

I saw a commercial for it and strategically told my husband about it just in time for Christmas and y\u2019all: IT DOES EVERYTHING IT SAYS IT\u2019S GONNA DO. Vacuums and mops hard floors AND rugs. Cut my floor-cleaning time in half which, in a 3500 square-foot house full of puppy hair and messy eaters, is not insignificant. So really it\u2019s like I got gifted extra hours. It maneuvers well\u2014 fits under the fridge door and everything\u2014 and is easy to clean. Like if I can figure this sh*t out, it\u2019s definitely user-friendly. So if you\u2019re considering getting one, you can stop now and just buy the thing.",

If anyone is wondering if it cleans ground in dirt, it will take it up. This is a excellent product and would recommend that you purchase this. You won't be disappointed and it will save you time in cleaning your house. Very easy to operate.",

The Bissell is lighter, easier to maneuver, operate, and maintain than Hoover's Floormate. The Bissell also cleans my tile floors better than the Hoover, ever did! The Bissell vacuumed up the residue water better, too. I only have real tile and real wood flooring; therefore, I cannot speak about area rugs, as I don't have any.

      "text": "A big problem with this is that because it accomplishes too tasks, it vacuums plus mops, it gets all sort of grit in the water, leaving you to wonder what to do with all that crap. You can't just dump it in the yard or in the trash, but I really do wonder what dumping that dirty water in the pipes could do to your plumbing. It's very odd. Let alone having to clean the darn thing every time you use it. And it doesn't scrub well, and the edges of it don't work well. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it!",

      "text": "This product has made my life so much easier in the cleaning department. I was skeptical at first, but after using it I have to say it does an amazing job cleaning the floors. With a regular mop, there was always dirt left behind. Not with this vacuum! With my steam mop the floors always looked streaked, not with the crosswave! The floors come out clean and streak free. The downside? I don't feel like it handles pet hair well, so I always vacuum my rugs first. Secondly, it just can't get in the edges well, so I always go back to those with a regular vacuum. Still, for a quick clean this is a wonderful product!",
