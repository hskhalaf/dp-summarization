Aside from its similar classic design, the ankle support seems to be consistent for this model, as multiple wearers have attested.The shoe is also proven to be versatile, as it could be used while doing everyday activities, for gym workouts, or even during casual workdays. The budget-friendly regular price is more than enough for customers to consider the Reebok Royal BB4500 HI2.",

        "A couple of shoppers mention that it is more appealing in person compared to the pictures",
        "For a few of the users of this footwear, it provides a secure fit",
        "As per a regular wearer, the flat sole of this sneaker from Reebok is an advantage as it apparently helps with minimizing back discomforts during long hours of standing",
        "There is a shopper who has advised that her husband who has lingering foot issues could only wear this mid-top due to its features",
        "A couple of buyers say that they prefer the white colorway",

      "text": "These shoes were too large for me but I blame that on my ordering them a half size big, mainly because I had just returned a different pair (not Reebook) a half size smaller and they were way to small. Quality and comfort of this Reevok was good although they were a bit heavy for me. Overall seemed to be a good shoe for the money and if they would have fit my foot better, I would have kept them. I always commend Amazon on the ease of returning items, and this experience was no different. Easy return.",

I can't wear some shoes but I don't know that until a few wears. This shoe irritated my ankle so badly I am on the couch resting. You'll need a foot cushion and buy a larger size. You should be good if no injuries. But well.. China?",
