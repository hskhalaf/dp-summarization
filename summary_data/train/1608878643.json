The only problem is the drawings are so beautiful it's hard to risk messing them up. Still, just dive in! Stout's designs are such that they're easy to follow and have fun with but they are also so well realized that it's hard to mess them up. Have fun and don't worry about coloring out of the lines. These images can take it.",

      "text": "A lovely collection of some of Stout's black and white work, clean and ready for your markers, colored pencils, and eyes. Some of the images will be familiar to Stout fans\u2014they're drawings from his Convention Sketches series or the black and white line work that he colored with inks and the like for his dinosaur books. Other images are new. All of them are lush and detailed. The age range of the images stretches from the '70s to just a few years back, pretty much covering Stout's entire career. They're great pictures, colored or not, and it's nice to see Stout delivering a book that highlights his skills with the pen.",

Lots of detail and lots of love. Some of the pics tell a story (there's always something happening or about to happen in his pics). Really nice quality publication... the cover stock and toothy paper are second to none. So pretty, I don't want to color it! May have to buy another one....highly recommended!",
