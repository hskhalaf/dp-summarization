Don't get me wrong, they're still low quality-- but they're significantly better than you'd think. If you break a lot of sunglasses, definitely go for these. I have a toddler who loves tearing sunglasses apart and these are perfect, I just grab another one from the box and throw the old ones in the trash. They're fully capable of working as every day sunglasses, not just gags for a single evening or something. They are a little small on my adult male head, but not uncomfortably so.",

I think they would fit most adults as well. Definitely worth purchasing!",
