It feels light and I compared it to my old Rawlings with a shipping weight of 2.2 pounds and it felt like 3 or 4 pounds after a game. I assumed with a shipping weight of 12.2 oz that the actual weight would be closer to 9oz. It is a good mask and I have worn it nearly everyday this week for over 2 hours each day, but I wish it was as advertised which is why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 5.",

It may be a little heavier than some masks, but it has never been bent or dinged when taking the high-speed hits as many of the lighter weight masks do, so I consider this a pretty good trade-off.",
