Not to mention having to buy a glass replacement top has just taken the half way decent price up an additional $6!!! NOT IMPRESSED. It does however seem to be of good quality otherwise. I will update my review when I can actually use this.",

I also use one tablespoon of cold water over coffee grounds per each tablespoon of grounds used. This pot perks very quickly. Only drawback I see is it is just a bit small for the price.
