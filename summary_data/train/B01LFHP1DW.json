It\u2019s firm and supportive. It\u2019s like someone took a mattress topper and cut a rectangle out of it, which is exactly what I was looking for. I can finally retire my old, flattened pillow! UPDATE 8/23/18 I am still so in love with this pillow, I\u2019m ordering one for backup. I never have neck pain in the morning anymore. It is the same thickness and firmness as when I ordered it 8 months ago. I truly couldn\u2019t be happier!",

The foam smell was barely noticeable out of the box and now that I've used it for a few days I can't smell it at all. This is a very comfortable pillow option for my fellow stomach and side sleepers.

Only downside it is quite firm and my head being so light doesn't really sink into it much. I like that cozy soft feeling of my head nestling in, so I will continue to hunt for the perfect pillow.",

She has continual neck pain so we've tried countless different types and styles of pillows and hadn't found the right fit. Finally, we searched for the thinnest pillow we could find, and it ended up being this one. It's the perfect height to keep her neck level and still provide the support she needs. The pillow does have a distinct odor to it initially but my wife just put two pillow cases on it until the scent disappeared. She highly recommends this to anyone who sleeps on their back or side.",
