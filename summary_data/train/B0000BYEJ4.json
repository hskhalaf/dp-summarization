You can feel the quality of this product in your hand as you use this knife. I would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone wanting a better knife than what they have. In fact, I am so happy with these knives I intend to look into what else Chicago Cutlery has to offer! Cheers! p_rod",

We were ready to spend $80 on a set of 4 German ones, but these were given a high review by the Test Kitchen (who we trust and has steered us to some great products over the years.) They cut beautifully and work great. True, they don't look as neat as the more expensive brands, but we don't care - the money we saved on these allowed us to get a lot of nice steaks to cut and eat :)",
