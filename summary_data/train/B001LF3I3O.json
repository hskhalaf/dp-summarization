It\u2019s fairly indestructible, the base fits inside the the blender pitcher, and is less noisy than a regular blender. I have taken it down multiple intense rafting trips and it has not let me down. It\u2019s pretty incredible that you can have blended margaritas in the absolute middle of nowhere.",
