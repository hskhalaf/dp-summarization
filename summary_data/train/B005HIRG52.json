      "text": "This monitor is beautiful. It shows vibrant, rich colors and is crisper than any I have had. I bought it mainly for photo editing, to replace an old monitor that was not nearly as good, and it has made me excited about photo work again. It is light weight, relatively compact, and has a full set of adjustments. Highly recommended. Please note that if you have a Mac with a mini displayport adapter the cable that comes with the monitor won't work for you. You will need a DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable, like this one:",

      "text": "I was looking for a 23 inch monitor with IPS and an LED backlight. The ASUS PA238Q got good reviews and had the best price in its class. All I had to do was plug it in and set the resolution to the max (1920 X 1080). The output is bright and beautiful using the analog input (I use the analog instead of the digital because I have an analog KVM switch for alternating between a Mac and a PC). The stand adjustment is really easy on every axis. My only negative comment is that the menu operation is not intuitive. It's kind of clunky but I don't use the menus often so this is not an issue for me.",
