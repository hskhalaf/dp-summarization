After having worked in a high-end machine shop for several years I was able to identify many, many features that testify to its quality.

I was a little worried about the power as I was used to 3HP but have only tripped the breaker once cutting wet 2x6 lumber. cons: dust collection comes straight off the blade, so the base tends to get piles of dust accumulating. cost about 1,000 more than comparable saws -- for the safety feature (auto stop), I figure a finger is worth more than that.",
