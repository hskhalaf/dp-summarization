When I called back they made me trouble shoot all over again. They sent me a new door bell and it still doesn't work. Your doorbell won't work with samsung?

Not sure where the error is, but when someone presses it will sometimes ring and other times just show a notification on your phone. There's sometimes a delay whether it be when someone presses the button or if you're live-streaming or if you get a notification on your motion sensor and pull it up to look at.

The only thing - unlike other reviewers complaint that motion detection reacts to background motion, I find that motion detection is not sensitive enough. I have it set to 100% (max sensitivity), but it still misses people dropping off parcels just a few steps away from the doorbell.",
