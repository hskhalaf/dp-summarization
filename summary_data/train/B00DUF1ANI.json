Rather than package them in a cardboard box (easy to transport, easy to store, etc. etc.) the manufacturer chose to shrinkwrap these in clear plastic--open the plastic, and you have tea lights everywhere. A pain to transport, a pain to store. This is a virtuoso level of fail. This supremely poor choice of packaging turns an otherwise mediocre yet acceptable product into an unmitigated disaster.",

These Zion candles appear to have a decent wick, and I've been able to re-light them with some reliability.",

Or, only the center burns, not the whole tealight. The Zion Judaica lights, however, burn well. They burn cleanly, so I don't feel congested after using them for a couple hours. Also, and best ... the wick is still there if I should decide to use them several evenings. I purchased these due to the reviews... and will purchase again.",

The intensity of the candle light was great, shining thru the white paper cups. He was able to arrange the luminaria in the form of large letters to spell out easily legible words from a distance. The candles are long-burning, burn very cleanly, and he had not trouble lighting them---that was a feat, since he was using 200+ in his project!....Great and speedy vendor service.
