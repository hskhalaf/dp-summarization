The ladder really needs a handrail to be truely useful. Also the ladder is too long for our 10ft Skywalker Trampoline as such it really sticks out. The \"door mat\" should have more tie-downs as there are no tie-downs where the safety net opens, thus there is a good chance that you will catch your foot when coming out and possibly trip",

Really Happy with this product! I just got this and put it together. So happy with it. So easy to assemble. Nice and snug. It covers over the spot where the seam tore at the door to the trampoline. The shoe bags are great for little ones who typically throw them down on the ground. And my 2yr old was even confident climbing up on her own. Yay! This saved us money from spending on buying and whole new bumper for the entire thing to cover all the springs. Worth the $30+!",

And my wife tends to be assembly-challenged; every time she gets impatient waiting for me and tries to assemble something herself she ends up screwing it up and I have to go back and fix it. But this one she actually did correctly herself. Happy with the purchase.",
