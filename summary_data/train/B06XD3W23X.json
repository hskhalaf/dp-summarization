      "text": "So far, so good. It's a great conversation piece and for the most part does great at keeping drinks cold. My only issue is that the ice and everything in the cooler does sit right on the water so your ice will melt very quickly. I think to remedy that I will be going to the craft store and getting a piece of foam to put in the bottom so there is a bit of a barrier between the water and the ice. Otherwise would totally buy it again. Don't leave it in your pool empty though, it will definitely fly out LOL",
