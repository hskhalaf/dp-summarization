They sent me the right size 11.5 wide which is a good start. I have already walked in water, through mud, on greasy floors, gotten them wet-dry, wet-dry again and they have holding up well. Very well made, with great treads on the bottom. Winter is on its way and I believe these boots will move me safely through snow and ice as well as keep my feet warm and dry.",

They're just awesome steel toe boots.",

Probably just my foot shape. I didn't see anyone else having this issue. Sent them back and Amazon quickly issued a refund. Maybe I'll try the Timberland Pit Boss instead.",

I'm normally a size 13\" but these seemed to be more like a 13.5\". I'm still keeping them as a 12\" or a 12.5\" would be too small for me.

For heavy work I do not recommend these boots but for a great everyday boot these are awesome. I wear Whites Smoke Jumpers to work in, they were custom fit and the best boots you can buy, but at almost triple the price ($450-$500) they are expensive. I bought these because my Whites are 10 inches and take a little time to lace up, these you just through on and go!!!!!!",
