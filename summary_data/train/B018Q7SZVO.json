I refuse to take pain meds anymore, so I decided to invest in an FIR pad. This is half the price of the Bio Mat and it is just as effective. The moist heat feels so good on my back. When I get home, I can\u2019t wait to lie down on it. My only wish is that they also made one in a shoulder/neck wrap. Being a disabled cancer patient, the warranty gave me the peace of mind that I could try this without risk. Recommend, 100%.",

I also have purchased the belt and use it in combo on my upper back or just plain sit on it while working on my laptop.
