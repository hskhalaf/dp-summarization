However early in the morning when the house is completely still and quiet and i'm using this drive as a boot drive I can audibly detect a slight head-seeking noise coming from the drive, not at all annoying though. Overall love the performance of this drive and would recommend in a heartbeat.",

With that said, Windows 7 and programs do load noticeably faster.

    "description": "Capacity:1 TBWD VelociRaptor drives offer an unmatched combination of high performance and high reliability, perfect for workstations, high-end video and photo editing, low-end servers and performance enthusiast's systems. Comes with a 3.5-inch mounting frame for easy installation into today's high-performance systems and chassis. Ultra fast - Designed around a 10,000 RPM spin speed, these SATA 6 Gb/s drives include a 64 MB cache and deliver the ultimate performance for photo and video editing. Rock-solid reliability - With 1.4 million hours MTBF, these drives have the highest available reliability rating on a high capacity SATA drive. High capacity - State-of-the-art technology delivers a balance of high performance and high capacity perfect for data-intensive workloads that require large amounts of storage such as video editing, 3D rendering and scientific modeling. Ultra-cool operation \u2013 Consumes less idle power and uses similar active power as the previous generation WD VelociRaptor, while offering higher capacity and performance. Advanced Format (AF) \u2013 Technology adopted by WD and other drive manufacturers as one of multiple ways to continue growing hard drive capacities. AF is a more efficient media format that enables increased areal densities. IcePack mounting frame - The 2.5-inch hard drive is enclosed in a backplane-ready 3.5-inch mounting frame with a built-in heat sink that keeps this powerful little drive extra cool when installed in high-performance desktop chassis. NoTouch ramp load technology \u2013 The recording head never touches the disk media ensuring significantly less wear to the recording head and media as well as better drive protection in transit. Pre-emptive Wear Leveling (PWL) \u2013 Ensures reliability for applications that perform a high incidence of read/write operations at the same physical location on the disk. Rotary Acceleration Feed Forward (RAFF) \u2013 Optimizes operation and performance when the drives are used in vibration-prone, multi-drive chassis. Environmentally Conscious \u2013 In addition to being RoHS compliant, this generation of WD VelociRaptor also provides a halogen-free design. Compatible with: PC; Mac",
