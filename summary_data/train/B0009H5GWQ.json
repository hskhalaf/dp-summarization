Now holder no longer rolls up and if I ever get a thicker tool belt I'll just drill out the rivets. This holder should last a long time and is made of 1/8 thick leather just folded over to 1/4\" thickness on bottom.",

Some of the reviews indicated that it was difficult to use and they recommended the hammer holder that hangs lower. I have not found it could be a problem and I would recommend this to someone else. It is made with typical Occidental leather quality and I imagine it will last me for several decades.",

The leather is not stiff, stitching/riveting are also quality. I never wear nylon when I can wear leather. And like shoes, leather gets more comfortable with time and use. However, if you like to eat the cheapest food and see the lowest price Doctors, you won't appreciate the craftsmanship here.",

I thought the high mount would be preferable to keep me from sitting on the tool but it also makes it difficult to quickly get the tool in and out of. Would be better for use on the side where it is more accessible. Other than that it is very durable and well-constructed. I definitely recommend it if looking for a different side hammer loop or something.",
