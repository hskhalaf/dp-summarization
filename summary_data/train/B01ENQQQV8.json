While I don't do Crossfit, you gotta admit, if these Kevlar-lined shoes can withstand that stuff, my regular lifting should be easy. I like that Reebok has been perfecting this shoe and their research and market feedback has been included in the product design. They have a flat sole providing maximum, level support from the ground up. They're light weight and breathe. They look decent, too. But, they're holding up well for this 270-pound bodybuilder, and the workouts I subject them to.",

The toe box is still plenty roomy though smaller than the Nano 5s, and they just plain feel better than any shoe before them. If you're looking for an all around CrossFit shoe, look no further than the Nano 6.0. If you want a good shoe JUST for lifting, go with the Metcon 2.",

    "title": "Reebok Men's CROSSFIT Nano 6.0 Cross Trainer",
    "description": "Add innovation to the much-loved list in this reebok cross fit nano 6.0. This update's re-engineered anatomical design makes for a more locked-in stability that functions flawlessly through woods. Plus, the precision details like the textured rope pro+ shank let you tackle cross fit-specific activities with confidence. A kevlar\u00ae-infused upper ratchets up the durability for one unforgettable shoe.\n\nReebok was founded for one of the best reasons possible: athletes wanted to run faster. So in the 1890s, Joseph William Foster made some of the first known running shoes with spikes in them. By 1895, he was in business making shoes by hand for top runners; and before long his fledgling company, J.W. Foster and Sons, developed an international clientele of distinguished athletes.",
