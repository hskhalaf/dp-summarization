The majority of my rods are 5'6\" with TLD 30 2 speeds and a couple of TLD 50s two speed. I have 2 6' rods with TLD 30s. I was able to store 7 Trolling rods and 3 bottom rods on the 24 rod rack. These are stored in a closet at my condo. I'm going to buy another one for my Spinning rods. Buy one and you won't be sorry!!! Tight Lines",

Had to drill and machine-screw upright posts on both ends to the base-mounts on both sides. Does not come with casters for ease of rolling it around but I simply hack-sawed the little risers on the corners of the base flush with the rest of the base and then drilled the plastic base and installed casters. Sized adequately for multiple rods since the two sides are far enough apart to accommodate multiple rod/reel combos, both bait-casters and open-face reel types. Unlike other rod racks, this one allows full use of both sides for rod-reel storage/holding without much interference between reels.",

I went with the 24 Rod Rack so I could put my conventional saltwater rods on it. (You'll need to space them out due to the reel sizes). This sits nicely along the wall of the garage and is out of the way. Lightweight so it can pick it up to get to the back rods if needed. Great price for a great product.",

The design makes it easy to put in without having to squeeze the rod into a clip. It holds a lot of rods with reels\u2014a big deal. We are fortunate to have options, and chose this and happily paid for it. Really impressed with the quality. Assembly was in 10 mins. Great packaging even. Thank you!",
