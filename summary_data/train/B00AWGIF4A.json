You'll have to trim about 1/8\" off the side and top in order for it to fit without wrinkling. I had read this in the reviews, and was kind of expecting it. And since I have a paper trimmer, it didn't bother me at all to have to trim them. I'm using these to display pictures that I've colored. I've added photos showing the size of their insert laying on top of a sheet of printer paper with a ruler showing the measurement difference.",

All of my frames arrived in perfect condition, and after watching the video it was easy to insert my pictures. I actually like that they're lightweight, I'm not worried about them pulling out of my rather thin walls. I also really like that the frame is thin, it doesn't distract from the artwork. You can't find a better price for 6 frames, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I'll be buying more frames from this company.",

These are priced about 1/2 what they are at the big box arts and crafts store. They come well packed and have actual glass. I find that thicker material does not always allow the glass to snap securely in place. A little dab of clear silicone in each corner took care of that.",

Pros: They look great and are quick and simple to use. My daughter and I inserted 15 printables in no time at all. Cons: You have to be careful popping the glass in/out, my daughter had a hard time with one and the glass broke. Overall - I would/will be ordering more in the near future!",

So, your choice is to fold the photo into the frame, add the glass, and allow the 4 corners to crunch slightly, or to cut your photos down about 1/8 of an inch each way.

It will fold that edge a teeny bit and prevent warpage. End--- The design makes it a tight fit for letter size paper. I don't see wrinkles though. The edges are almost non-existent so what goes in the frame is the center of attention. I use them for printed photos and so far they are nice, but a bit too minimalist in my opinion.",
