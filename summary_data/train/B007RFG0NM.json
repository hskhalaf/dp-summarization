Literally just missed the return window while we were out backpacking with these mats for the first time.

      "text": "Got a couple of these to replace my old-school foam mats, as they took up too much space. These new high tech mats pack down tiny - smaller than a propane bottle, and super lightweight. Once inflated they are also more comfortable than foam. Only takes about a minute to inflate. However, the downside is you have to deal with potential leaks. These seem sturdy enough, but one of them lost some air overnight. I had to exchange it for a new one. So far, no issues. I recommend these (and they are much less expensive than the high end sleeping pads out there), but test them out after purchasing to make sure there are no leaks.",

It inflated quickly and made all the beds, soft and too hard perfectly comfortable. My husband was so impressed he is ordering one to use for motorcycle camping. Also it was very very hot and the pad under the sheet was not hot. I am going to give this pad as a gift this year.",
