I\u2019m just really upset because I think one of the ears broke and now one side of the earmuffs is very easy to turn and I think it\u2019s broken. When I put them on, a piece of plastic kind of sticks into my ear. I would really like a replacement as I\u2019ve only had these for a week :/ UPDATE: The seller refunded my purchase, so I could buy a new pair. SO happy with the customer service. I love this product!! My ears have never been warmer.",
