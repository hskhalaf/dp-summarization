Within 4 months of buying it though, the sprayer tubing had broken down and suddenly started leaking water all over the restroom. Luckily I was home to shut off the water before a disaster broke out. Regardless, not sure if the unit I received was the exception, but it's concerning since this could have been a total disaster costing thousands of dollars to fix if I wasn't home. Wouldn't recommend based on my experience.",

There have been no leaks what's so ever and we are seriously considering buying another one for our other restrooms because it's also handy for when we use the restroom :)",

It flops around, making the nozzle very difficult to lift out. 3) The sprayer has a rubber o-ring that binds to the hanger, even with oil, making it even more difficult to remove the nozzle.",

It allows you to have water flowing to just the toilet, just the sprayer, or both at once. It feels like a heavy, nice quality. I'm glad we paid a few extra dollars for stainless steel instead of plastic parts. The pressure is pretty good for getting poop chunks off diapers - right now baby is EBF, but it's gotten chunkier. Overall nice quality, easy to install and use. I wouldn't use it as a bidet sprayer at least in winter cause the water is freezing! But it might work for that in summer time.",
