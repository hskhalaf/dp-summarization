All you do is unroll it, tie the input tube to the fan, make sure the other tube is tied closed, stake the corners, and blow it up. Putting it away isn't too bad. This thing is fairly portable if you wanted to take it with you to see the grandparents. It's also a subtle flex on all the mediocre parents on your street, so there's that too. If this thing craps out in the next few months, I'll update this review. So far so good.",

My 8yo grabbed the net where you are supposed to store shoes and a friend pulled him back. The net strings tore a hole in the fabric and now there is a huge gash. I used one of the included patches but they are just stickers and the wwight of the bigger kids just poos them off. Still gets 5 stars because it gave us 3 great years. I recomend cutting off the shoe net as soon as you get it... Trust me, the kiddos wont use it anyway.",

This \"bounce house\" is the same exact product as the $50 blow up bounce house except this one has a blower and is a tad bit bigger. I would not recommend this product if your kids actually want to jump around.",

One side with net opening held by velcro won't hold up to toddler wanting to open it. If a child somehow bumps near the opening, he/she could potentially fall out.

We have used this outside, but we primarily use this in our basement. It literally inflates in seconds and the kids have a blast getting energy out on cold days when outside play is not an option. I wish I would have bought this two years ago!!",

      "text": "Great purchase! Super easy setup and take down. There were 4-5 toddlers in it with plenty of room to bounce and play. There are some places at the seams where the stitching seems to be coming undone. I noticed it right when we took it out of the box to set it up, before it had been used. I was disappointed to see that, so I am a little worried about durability. We've only used it once, but it held up well and the stitching didn't get any worse. I would definitely give it 5 stars, but am giving it 4 because of the quality of stitching coming right out of the box.",

It blows up superfast and stores away very nicely as well when not in use. Good buy, hopefully it will hold up until our next son gets big enough to use it too:-)",
