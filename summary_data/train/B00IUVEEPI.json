This 2nd order came in an envelope, the lid was barely on and there was dry woodfiller on the outside of the container. So this time I got woodfiller powder on my clothes. The product does seem usable so I'll keep it. I'm giving GoodFilla one star for nuisance value.",

I would recommend using shellac when possible. I love how easy this filler is to use and sand. It left a great surface and didn't clog my sand paper.",

It survived lots of sanding, staining and a oily wax finish. I'm not sure how it will hold up but it looks great. You can barely see it as it blended in and took the darker stain very well.
