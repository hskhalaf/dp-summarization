There's no excuse for a quartz watch to be this thick. I have automatic watches that are half as thick as this thing. Not only that, but this thing is just plain ugly.

Of course I knew all this before ordering. I liked the color scheme for this watch. The green and red are great for each other. Why only 2 stars? The red 24 hour marking ring is etched on the inner surface of the crystal, not the dial itself. It's just distracting, at least IMO. I needed a knock around watch so I decided to keep it, but I can't get real excited about it.",

The clasping of the watch is another matter. You almost need two hands each time [and you cannot use the hand the watch is resting on the wrist. It should have been a simple buckle with link, or velcro, or something. The box the watch came in is very unique as well. The back up band is plastic and not attractive at all. Knowing this beforehand I would have passed on the watch. I have since changed out the band to a leather one of the same color.",

It's simply an elegant watch that can take a beating and go to the ball right after. So again, why not? I am a huge fan of Victorinox because its never let me down, has shown excellent craftsmanship, and this watch is living up to expectations.",

The only problem is it looses about a minute a month and this isn't good for a quartz watch ( my automatics lose maybe a second a month), so this is not good. The case is stainless steel so while it is tough I have a few scratches on my watch. I still wear this watch on a daily basis and love the looks.",

I was concerned about the 43mm diameter might be to big to my small wrist, but it is good size to fit my wrist. I strongly recommend the buyer to consider this INOX titanium series product, if you really want a watch for conventional and outdoor activities.",

I know these INOX watches usually come in a nice felt-lined plastic box, but mine came in a simple little black cardboard box with a foam insert supporting the watch.

One of the articles I read about this edition said there would also be a swiss army knife in the box, but there is not. The buckle system for the keeping the paracord band on your wrist is not the greatest for getting the watch on and off, but it is easily adjustable and relatively comfortable.",

Well when I do spend money on watches I just don't want to receive damaged ones no matter how minuscule that damage is, especially on a watch that markets is toughness. Also the hands don't hit the minute markers, but that's something most quartz watches have even at the higher quality range.",
