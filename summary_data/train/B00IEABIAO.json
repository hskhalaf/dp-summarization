Once it came, he put it all together in less than a half hour. He did not have any issues. Nothing broke, and assembly wasn't confusing. My son is not a brainiac, so I feel that this model car would be just fine- even for children- to put together. My son really enjoyed this! I highly recommend :)",

I can\u2019t give them 5 stars because the instructions could be easier to follow and, as mentioned by others, there is a bit of misalignment that does affect functioning in the end so not perfect but very good. The cars are are sturdy and can definitely be played with after building. My boys also liked that they came with wheel trim options.",
