It certainly stands out, much more than for my liking. I wish it was more of a matte color. In terms of the sensitivity, I found myself needing to apply more pressure when touching the screen or having to repeat my step twice. What I did not like was that it\u2019s very difficult to keep it looking clean. I constantly have to wipe the screen area clean.",

That said, I do trust it to protect the watch, and it's pretty unobtrusive. I prefer it over a glass screen protector because the curved glass protectors never seem to fit correctly.

      "text": "I really wanted to like this product. I just bought an apple watch series 5 and bought this as a two in one case and screen protector. Unfortunately once placed on (after I tried to decipher the image instructions on the box which took 15 min to understand) the case does not sit flush with the screen and leaves air bubbles which looks unsightly. I kept it on anyhow hoping the air bubbles would eventually disappear with time however I found that the touch sensitivity was altered and I couldn't drag or close apps with the case on. Ultimately a wasted purchase. I will be getting a separate case and stick on screen protector.",
