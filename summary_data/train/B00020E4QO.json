I love this mouse. I don't love many inanimate objects!",

They would hesitate too much or suddenly jump off the screen out of view for no reason at all, this is very annoying, especially when playing games. This mouse has been perfect from the day I bought it. It has never acted up like the other mice I tried. Its response time is amazing, no hesitation at all. And the screen jumping thing is nonexistant. I love it so much I have bought it for several people as gifts.",

This bad boy has the fast response times that demanding gamers require and the extra buttons allow you to play more efficiently which translates into better scores. I would buy this one again without hesitation.",

Very comfortable grip and handle. Easy access to roller and buttons (including side buttons). Very convenient and far more cheaper than Logitech G5 and up. Very good quality product with a nice rubber and, metal like, plastic body. Optional USB or PS/2 interface is a plus.",
