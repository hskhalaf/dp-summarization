It is slightly thinner than I expected but I am told it depends on the time of the crops. Only 4 stars because I expected the retinol to dry out my super oily skin, at least a bit, but it doesn't and I used it twice daily. Does it work? I don't really know because I spend more time applying my skin routine than watching the results in the mirror. I do like how it feels though. The seller is very responsive to any question or issue. I will most likely buy again.",

Since I use a bunch of acne products my skin becomes hard to hidrate sometimes, for this reason I will be trying something else. So for me the product was ok. If you have normal, oily, combination skin it will be very good for you. If u have very dry or acne skin you might use this product with a serum to reach enough hidration.",
