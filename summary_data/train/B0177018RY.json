After 4 weeks, only 6 of the seeds have sprouted with only 1 plant (basil) showing good growth. The others that have sprouted are very weak. Not sure why the last 4 didn't sprout.

I dont like this gardening experience at all... these seeds are duds. Not buying again considering these are way overpriced.

These went great with the pots and we grew herbs from them that still thrive in our outdoor garden today! She was happy with them pretty much overall. We only had difficulty starting one or two herbsthat we couldn't get to grow.. not sure if that was was due to us or the quality of the seeds. Cool though to be able to buy seeds over the computer and then enjoy the herbs in your food after you grow them!!",

Next time I would choose un-coated seeds.",
