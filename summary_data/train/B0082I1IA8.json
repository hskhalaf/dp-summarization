This is a safety hazard as it can cause mold, create bacteria and cause my daughter to suck on soapy water if I wash it with mild soap (as advised on the instructions). I will be returning it, and then go back on a hunt for a paci she will like...",

My only complaint is they don't glow unless in direct sunlight so if you leave them in a crib or bassinet, they won't glow at night. They are also basically crystal clear in color so very hard to find during the day! I wish the small sizes came in brighter colors.",

They can easily be found in the crib in the middle of the night. MAM is a great quality product. I have thrown these in the dishwasher to clean and they come out just like new. Highly recommend.",

You have to be sure to expose it to enough light long enough beforehand to glow at night, so if it\u2019s been in the crib, diaper bag, or your pocket, there will be no glow. Because of the nearly clear plastic, this pacifier is effectively INVISIBLE if it\u2019s not glowing. Otherwise it\u2019s a good pacifier, and I like the lack of a handle, which makes it more comfortable for my child when I\u2019m wearing him in a baby carrier facing me. A good cork, but don\u2019t pay extra for invisibility.",
