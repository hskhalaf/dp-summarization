When you're fighting to get this on, here's a tip: instead of wrestling away from yourself, loop it past the wheel onto the column, then mount it towards you. This makes it easier to see what you're fighting as well as giving better leverage with a tool to pry it over the wheel. I used the handle of a crescent wrench and it made it easier.",

I threw mine in the clothes dryer for five minutes, enough to make the material plyable and it went on without much work at all.

Tip: Make sure it's lined up where you want it once you push it into place because it isn't budging after that.

I tried installing it the day after I got it, which was an unsuccessful wrestling match. So I left it in the vehicle for several days which turned into a couple of weeks, for various reasons. By the time I tried again, it took about 7 minutes, and no wrestling and no creases. It makes the steering wheel a bit wider than I prefer but there is a little give to the cover that makes it reasonably comfortable. Not bad value for the money, so far.",

Installed to a 2017 Chevy Colorado with a 15\" steering wheel, within spec. Overall install was a bit tough, all done with out any tooling, a bit of a workout to seat over form of wheel. After install product fit snuggly, and securely, feel is comfortable and grip tight. Overall 4 stars, due to observation of broken threading, currently threading isnt unraveling, im unsure if this was a result of install or defect. If threading remains intact I will leave review at 4 stars.",

It's a rather thick solution, so even after a few months I'm reminded that it's not the original every time I drive. It has a soft, cushy feel to it, which again is not like the original steering wheel. If you're wanting something that is more like the manufacturer wheel, then go with something less thick. You'll definitely notice a difference with this one.",

Hopefully it takes the correct shape. Ironically I get things like CDs in a big box and things like this crammed into an envelope. It would probably be a lot smarter to put it in a big box so it retains it's shape. Not impressed.",

I could not have selected a better cover as this blends in wonderfully. The grip feels quite nice and it is void of any slippage. I have been using this cover for a few months now without issue.
