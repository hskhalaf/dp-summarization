It's tough enough to carry sharp objects (sheet rock screws, exposed knife, ...). I'm rough on things, but after laying on it on my roof, catching on things, banging into edges, its holding up. I have a 36\" waist - I'm on the 2nd to tightest belt hole. Wouldn't recommend for under 34\", but could go much higher. I added a hair tie to hold the extra belt end from flapping around.",
