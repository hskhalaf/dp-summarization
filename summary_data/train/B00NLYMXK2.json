It only would do HSPA. Even with HSPA, I had trouble downloading MMS, I have to be on wifi to be able to download MMS and group texts. Another issue I had was the slow response time, especially with google maps and such. There was so much delay in loading maps it would some time takes about 5 mins to get going. On the paper the battery is huge, but in real life it barely lasted a day and half.",
