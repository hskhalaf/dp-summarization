Told Amazon to NOT SELL THIS PRODUCT because the cloth on the cardboard that forms the bins disintergrated into this fine powder which made my nasal and lungs so irritated and I got sick. It's a GOOD THING that I didn't have it near my lil grand baby. I bought it June 2018 but by 6-8 months, the material on handles n top sides of the bins started to just disintergrate into pieces and fine powder. It was crazy and terrible. Poorly made in that way. Once that material falls apart, there goes your bin. ONLY 3 pieces of strings for the handle.",
