I\u2019m 5\u2019 10\u201d and when I sit on it, my feet don\u2019t hang off the end. It\u2019s a good size. Bonus: this same chaise is over $400 on other sites, so it was a steal buying from Amazon!",

The hole that the bolts go through is about 3-4x bigger than the bolt itself. And only 1mm bigger than the flat washer. So if you tighten it too much the flat washer breaks into the too-large hole",

The bolt holes in the back \"wing\" piece don't line up with the bolt holes in the seat, so you cannot attach them. I got a replacement one and the replacement has exactly the same problem.
