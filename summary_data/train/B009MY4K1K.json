I got 2 of them for my daughter about a year ago, and I got one for myself a few months ago. It was installed in the guest bathroom next to the living room. Now people in the living room cannot hear the toilet flush. And, if you are worried about water usage, this toilet is about as good as you can do. It reliably flushes away solid waste in one flush, and it stays cleaner than our old standard toilet that used over 1 1/2 gallons per flush.",

One thing that might surprise people is this toilet sits a bit higher than older toilets. I have gotten used to it and find other toilets too low now - lol I cannot recommend this product more, I am very glad I heard about it and decided to buy it. One tip: make sure you connect the water before testing the flush. It is power assisted by the water pressure, unlike older toilets.",
