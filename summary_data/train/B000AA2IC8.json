It draws a bit of current from USB port and I am in the process of upgrading to all USB2 so my computer will not stall (which happens occasionally when everything runs at the same time). In comparison to other cams I have watched this one is practically high definition and although the frame rate slows down to a crawl it will even support 720! I find you can get outstanding color contrast and brightness levels if you fiddle around with the exposure setting the color tint and brightness too. Then WOW! I mean I just never see anything as good out there so bring it on baby!",

It tend to get more dropped connections, but I think it may be due to bandwidth and other things not related to the camera. I use Skype video when I talk with my family that has a Mac or has a slower DSL. The video is a bit more blocky on full screen, but it is fairly realtime.",

Since my father-in-law is hard of hearing we knew the cam would not work for us. We returned the cams to Amazon on December 13th, and as of today, January 11, the cams have not been received by Amazon.
