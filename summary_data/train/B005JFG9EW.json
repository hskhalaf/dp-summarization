You have to maneuver it a little to get it to close correctly.",

While opening the top is easy, closing it involves positioning the two roof pieces more precisely than unhappy cats tend to allow. I could use this for my own cats, but a standard crate is less bulky for my average sized cats. For sure, if I were to travel with my cats, this would be an excellent choice! Hope this helps someone make the right choice for their individual situation!",

Bonus, it\u2019s easy to unclip the top fasteners so that one half of the top can swing down if a cat is more comfortable going in or out that way instead of thru the front door - though the front opening is quite large, and my cat didn\u2019t hesitate to go in.",
