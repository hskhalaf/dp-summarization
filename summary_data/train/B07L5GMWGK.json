      "text": "This is a great design in theory, but I fear that it must have been designed before American propane tanks were nanny-engineered. It works as advertised for short bursts, but there is a design feature on modern American tanks trying to idiot proof them. If it is run full on for more than a few seconds a choke valve kicks in and slows the flow back to a trickle. This valve is finicky and sometimes sets off flow restriction and sometimes not. The instructions are helpful at reducing this but won\u2019t eliminate it. Propane companies won\u2019t fill tanks with the old style valves which work all the time so I guess we\u2019re stuck.",

Don't just slam it all the way down and off like a switch (the flame will go out) . Press down slowly - enough to get the desired heat. Keeping the torch nozzle low to the ground helps keep it lit (thermal dynamics).",
