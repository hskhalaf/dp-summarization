      "text": "After having a computer that supports 1080p without a monitor I felt it was only right to get one. Since I primarily use my PC for gaming I chose this one as it is specifically designed for gaming. But it already has a stuck pixel after about a month and a half. I was kind of annoyed but it doesn't bother me too much really. Good monitor, nice picture and really good interface for changing your colour settings.",

Perfect monitor for FPS games like BF3/4 (coming soon), CS:GO, Sanctum 2, Borderlands 2 etc. Great design and stylish finish for enthusiast looking for the best 120 refresh rate monitor. Fast and easy setup. Cons; Non IPS :') well you can't have everything. I'm doing competitive gaming so the 120 refresh rate is my first pick.",

I was expecting a vibrant, sharp and crystal clear display in all modes but sadly, it's dull & lifeless. For around \u00a3350 i was expecting some 'WOW factor' when viewing. Probably my last BENQ",
