As you can see in the attached video I have tested it through 5 thunderstorms now and 2 wind storms. The only thing I don\u2019t like is the roof poles are not covered from the rain fly. Someone else mentioned that and I think they are right. Great price. Keeps out the rain. Has great night visibility in the night if you take the rain fly off. Plenty of room and light enough to carry in your backpack and live luxuriously.",

The weight isn't ideal, but it compares to tents in this range, so it's not necessarily something to skip over this tent for. Setup is a breeze.

Plenty of space for me, my stuff, and my blue heeler. Might be a bit heavy as a backpacking tent with all the equipment, but it's definitely a fantastic car camping unit.",

The rain fly blocked the cooler night breezes, but we were getting chilly towards morning (about 40 degrees). This tent takes only a couple of minutes to put together. It's super light and compact, with plenty of room for two to sleep. There's no extra room for gear, but that's kind of the trade-off when you buy a light and compact tent. I would recommend this tent to anybody doing spring, summer, or fall camping.",

There really isn't any room for additional items in the tent if sleeping two, so having the ability to use the rain fly to protect my shoes and back pack was a big plus.

      "text": "This is a very beautiful tent that is able to resist strong winds and rain, when I used it i felt like I was in a small room at home than in a tent with the new type foot ball field poles. What I did not like was the tent length and as with some reviews the top pole cross bar that can perhaps puncture the rain fly but I was able to solve this by putting rubber tips at the end of the pole where it comes in contact with the center of the rainy however, I recommend this tent you will not be disappointed with this purchase.",

My thru hike to my backyard was Treacherous but it was nice to find that set-up was struggle free and everything assembled nicely. In my sleep I decided to fight the tent and broke a couple of plastic clips but not because of durability just my carelessness. Reaching out to Featherstone was easy and they helped me get more than enough plastic hooks in case my carelessness resurfaced later. Very helpful staff and very nice tent. Quarantine has been pleasant with this tent, stay safe. #covid19",

Dislikes are tent attachments to the tent poles are plastic and could break easily. Tent pole crossbar for the entry doors need additional padding to prevent them from puncturing the tent OR tent needs a padded pocket for the ends of the crossbar. Personal preference would be to have a padded pocket on the tent. This would prevent ware/tear on the tent and assistance in the tent set up.",

It held up so well and was easy to set up every evening. Loved that you can set it up without the stakes as on night we had to set up on a rocky area. This tent is an awesome bargain.",

I contacted customer service and they were more than willing to send me replacement poles. 5 stars because the tent performed phenomenally given the two circumstances it has had to deal with so far and the customer service was great.",
