And, there is even a special function whereby just the cut side of a bagel or English muffin is toasted. I was sure there would be somebody in the world who still produces a quality product, and now I have found ONE. I love this toaster!",

The first slice may take a little longer but once it's warmed up it doesn't take long for the toast to come out perfectly and quickly. Does bagels and english muffins just as great. I also like the fact that it is made to be repaired...not thrown in the garbage!",

Very simple operation. Perfect toast every time-- *every* time. Wonder bread, artisan bread, toaster waffles, muffin-- all perfect. Barely toasted for the kids, nice and dark for dad. Outside stays cool no matter how much toast you make. One caveat: One of the slots looks like it's broken, but it's not-- that's for smaller or irregular pieces. Comes many colors, but red is beautiful. Yes, I would buy this again-- but I'm not gonna need to.",

The toaster is wonderful, extremely well built, easily cleaned, and can handle very thin to thick pieces of bread, including bagels. Also, I am able to control the \"brownness\" of the toast very easily -- no more overdone toast. Very happy that I chose to buy it.",
