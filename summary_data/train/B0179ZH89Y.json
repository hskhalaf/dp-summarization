My bf always wanted to brew beer and always mentioned it to his friends and family but never started it until I bought this kit for his Christmas & birthday gift (it counted for two important events ha-ha). He was so happy to see that the box included everything to start brewing beer. Of course you will need to buy extra accessories if you go for special size of glass bottles of different airlock. Since then he continues brewing and experimenting with other ingredients that can be found in local brewing stores and he is still using all the things that were included in this kit.",

Some of the essential equipment was involved, such as a hydrometer, a 5-gallon lid opener (it was very hard to open up a lid) and more sanitizer. 2. Some of the instructions were unclear and I had to look between their website and the sheets of paper included. For instance, the paper didn't include when during the boiling process to throw in the hop, and the website did. If both sources had consistent instructions, I would have easily given this 5 stars.
