This device makes getting a reading quick, simple and accurate...even with babies when they are asleep. It can assign reasons to different family members and task changes. Automatically uploads the to the app and can be shared on to other apps like apple health. The app also let's you note down if you have your child calpol or any symptoms they showed. An expensive device to be sure, but money well spent I think.",

Readings are shown in the withings app along with weight etc, but they also come up as notifications on an iPad and iPhone and show on the device too. Compares well to a standard omron thermometer but in a fraction of the time. I will use both as my immune system is compromised at the moment and need to know if my temp goes above 37.5 but the withings will give me the quickest indication of that.",
