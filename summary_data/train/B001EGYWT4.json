What a respite from self-imposed lockdown. I'm a person who likes for things to LAST and when merited I'll spend a little more. This definitely fits the bill. It's constructed well. It inflates instantly. It deflates as advertised. I don't anticipate any problems. The smiles are priceless! Highly endorsed.",

      "text": "The kids love this bounce house. I bought this for my sons 2nd birthday party and it was a huge hit. We were looking at blast zone smaller one but decided on this one as it would give us a few extra years of use since it was larger. It will pay for its self after a couple times using it compared to paying for a rental each time. It blows up quickly and has nice bag to place it back in when done. This is not a cheap bounce house, materials seem strong and thick. I highly recommend this bounce house and will get tons of use.",

Great purchase \u2013 wish we would have gotten it 2 month earlier for their 2nd birthday instead of spending $175 for a rental for 4 hours! It\u2019s extremely easy to set up and clean up, about 5-7 mins each. We generally set it up for about 30-45 mins for the kids to play, and then clean up. Totally worth the purchase!",

The material on the inside is more slick than the slide material. It doesn't make it more slippery but easier to clean if need be. We have kept this inside so far. It does shift a bit when a couple kids are jumping away but that's because we don't have it tied down. My son LOVES it! He is two right now and it will entertain him for years to come.

Folding it up to put back in the box was fairly easy too - next \"wake up\" will be a granddaughter's birthday party in the fall.

    "description": "It comes as no surprise that the Blast Zone Magic Castle Bounce House is our all-time bestseller. Bigger and better than ever, this inflatable blows up in just seconds and accommodates three little princes and princesses at once. It features a safe slope slide, safety netting, and a Velcro entrance so that you can sit back and relax while the kids party. Eye-catching in bold shades of red, blue, and yellow, this bounce house is better described as a palace, complete with turrets and flags. It features a commercial-grade vinyl floor for extra durability and reinforced seams to ensure that every bounce is a satisfying one. Designed for use both outdoors and in, the Magic Castle is perfect for parties, sleepovers, and backyard fun. The extra-high walls and netting reach a full 60 inches from the bounce platform, but are low enough to clear standard ceilings. It's easy to set up, store, and transport. Features: Overall Dimensions: 8.5W x 11D x 8H feet Bounce Floor: 6.5W x 6.33D feet Maximum Occupancy: 3 Recommended Ages: 3 to 8 Inflate Time: 1 minute This incredible set comes complete with the inflatable unit, UL-approved blower, storage straps, and stakes for both the blower and bouncer. When not in use, the inflatable conveniently rolls up, requiring about as much space as a medium to large sleeping bag. To set up your bouncer, simply unroll it. Hook the inflation tube to the blower, turn the latter on, and stake the inflatable down. The blower is designed to run continuously while children play. Air escapes through the seams and fabric. This bouncer is suitable for residential use. Lead-free products: A note from Blast Zone Recent allegations by the state of California against producers and distributors of inflatable bounce products concerning illegal lead concentrations are of great concern to us and our customers. Blast Zone products are not included in these allegations.",
