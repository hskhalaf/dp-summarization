      "text": "My beautiful wedding shoes! These were stunners from the beginning, and I'm so glad I wore them for my wedding. The only downside was, they never seemed to break in. I wore them for at least 4 weeks prior to the wedding, even attending dancing lessons in them multiple times, in an attempt to break them in and it just never happened. I was still so happy with the shoes and the look! The front toe is simple and elegant, and the back is so sparkly and really caught so many eyes. But I would not recommend wearing for more than a few hours at a time. (Tip: buy a beautiful pair of Badgley Mischka flats to change into!)",
