But The problem is with the movement the second hand moves around a lot and the minute hand rock back-and-forth, depending on how your wrist moves. I don't think I would buy another watch from mvmt again. They look great but for the same price you can get a solid Nixon. Also the minuet hand is dirty on my watch. Problems with quality control. But it looks nice. Mine also seams to always be off a few minuets, I'm adjusting it is very few weeks.",
