This one never gets my sleep right, i.e., I go to bed at 9:30 and it says I went to bed at 10:30. If I get up for a little bit in the night at 3:30, it thinks I got up at 3:30, even though I went back to bed and slept until 6:00.

I bough the Withings Activite model with its sapphire crystal, leather band, and more prominent hour markings to replace the Steel. I am MUCH happier with the Activite.",

I like that there are no flashing lights- I can easily look on my phone if I want specific details of my goals. The watch uses bluetooth just like other trackers.

The sleep tracker has not worked once. The step tracker only picks up about half of my steps. I have been through updates, factory resets, uninstall and reinstall. I have tried everything and it just will not work. After spending several days emailing with customer service to resolve the issues, it is still not working properly so I have to return it. I so hope they get this watch working. If they do, I will certainly purchase one.",
