The camera is easy to carry, hold, focus, use. Took some pictures in a bar to test it . Not the best of light. No flash. Contrast, color, color saturation, edge-to-edge sharpness, bokeh...I had to pinch myself. At the price it was a steal. If you find a new one below $350 buy it. You will NOT regret it. P.s: The designer who came up with the rubber cover on the ports/memory slot section should be given another job, like weaving baskets.",

It takes a little greeting used to because of only having one dial but a little time and patience takes care of that. The design of the menu matches other Pentax products but the design of the camera overall is much more advanced. The images have been sharp and full of color with the 40mm pancake style lens that's available . I'm teaching my daughter and grandson photography with this and a WG-2 camera. I gave the Pentax K01 5 stars and it earned every one.",

To get a camera with the same truly excellent sensor that's in the K-5 for the price that these things sell for now is the no-brainer of the century. Focus-peaking is one of those things that you didn't know you wanted, but once you've used it, you don't ever want to be without it. It also looks better with some of Pentax's legendary FA and DA Ltd. lenses on it rather than the little 40 it's always pictured with.",

      "text": "Arrived ok and everything worked. It takes good pictures and is useable at higher ISO's with good performance but the design and lack of eyefinder can be a downfall, I got it with the intention of snapshots and a B cam for some video and it works well for that. If it is rev 1 firmware you need to update it to get better autofocus times. One thing to be careful of is the video has really bad \"rolling shutter\" effect, this seems to be partially related to the onboard anti shake, disabling the shake reduction in video mode (not camera mode) helps considerably with the shutter effect.",

The handling is smooth and easy. The SR system works very well (it does make some noise as the sensor shifts). Peak focusing is really nice. The image quality is superb. Despite the controversial appearance of the camera, it is a stellar performer. I bought it at a blowout price right after Ricoh pulled the plug on that model. It was less than the price of a telephoto lens! If you can still find them, buy one. You won't regret it.",
