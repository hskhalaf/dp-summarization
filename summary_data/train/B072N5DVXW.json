I love ginger beer for the kick, and you don't need much of this get a good spicy kick in the mouth. As opposed to, say, Goslings or Bundaberg that's more sweet than spicy.

Q-Edlerflower Tonic taste chemically and bitter where as the Fever tree tastes like some one made a fresh herb infused tonic.",
