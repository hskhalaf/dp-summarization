      "text": "After researching this camera and reading rave reviews, I replaced my point and shoot with this model. This camera makes beautiful crisp outdoor pics. But like any point and shoot, indoors, if the subject is too far away for the flash to reach(approx 15ft), not going to get the shot. I was however able to make some beautiful video of my child's recital from the back of the room, great zoom for video. Sound quality great. Pop up flash is a bit of a bother as it pops up everytime the camera is turned on. Easily hooks up to hdtv for viewing. A little bulkier than I had expected.",

The price was fantastic and the only design flaw I don't care for is the spring loaded flash that pops up goes easily unnoticed before you turn the camera on. Just from the natural way of holding the camera, the flash can be held down by your fingers and cannot deploy. A small issue when you see the quality of pictures, especially in low light settings.",

Ive had this camera for over a year now and its still working okay. the reason i say \"okay\" is because the picture quality seems to be diminishing. Lots of noise is created when zoomed in above 12X or when the ISO is set above 400 (i find this very disappointing) Taking pictures at 48X zoom or 1600 ISO is pretty much useless I however, edit my photos on Photoshop to reduce the noise and improve the overall quality, see for yourself: [...]",

Small enough for my pockets, but I'm a big guy with big pockets. If you are looking to do manual adjustments and create your own style then this camera will work for you. Plus the zoom is great, easy to control and digital zoom can be turned off witch is great. Wish there was a traditional view finder, but those are hard to find today. Great camera, Cannon is easy to understand and well made.",

We hike a lot, and find that the battery lasts several days, even when we are shooting pictures all day long. The still image quality is outstanding; have not used the hd video so can't speak to that. Would recommend this camera to anyone who wants high-quality images without lugging along a bulkier SLR camera.",

I always wanted at least a little more zoom capacity, while retaining clarity and ease of taking pictures. This one fulfills my wishes perfectly, without the size and inconvenience (to me, at least) of putting on additional lens, etc. The software that came with the camera also provides me with an easy way to trim, reduce red-eye and a number of other features. This Canon PowerShot well deserves the 5 stars I've awarded it. Incidentally, I discovered this particular model while talking to a fellow bus traveler in Mount Rushmore....we were so impressed with the viewing surface. M. Schanapp",

I took this on a trip to Central America into some rough country and it held up well. Also, the HD video was of amazing quality.

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SX200IS 12 MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackCreating gorgeous images is more fun than ever with the sleek, impressively-equipped PowerShot SX200 IS. Capture close-up, wide-angle shots with stunning 12x optical zoom. Experience the unprecedented image quality and point-and-shoot convenience of Smart AUTO, along with enhanced operability and an intuitive new menu. HD shooting at 1280 x 720 pixels with HDMI output lets you see all the beauty of your HD images and movies on your HDTV.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCreating gorgeous images is more fun than ever with the sleek, impressively-equipped PowerShot SX200 IS. Capture close-up, wide-angle shots with stunning 12x optical zoom. Experience the unprecedented image quality and point-and-shoot convenience of Smart AUTO, along with enhanced operability and an intuitive new menu. HD shooting at 1280 x 720 pixels with HDMI output lets you see all the beauty of your HD images and movies on your HDTV. \n\nPowerShot SX200 IS Highlights \n\n\n\n12.1-megapixel resolution, 12x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer\nFor all its easy operability, the PowerShot SX200 IS has a feature set to be reckoned with. 12.1-megapixel resolution delivers a wealth of detail to every image, and allows you to crop and enlarge any portion of your shot freely. With the camera\u2019s powerful 12x optical zoom, you\u2019ll get up close fast, handy at sports and school events as well as everyday creative shooting. The 28mm wide-angle lens captures more in every frame, and gives your photography a professional edge. \n\nThe PowerShot SX200 IS is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nCapture Your Best Shots Easily \n\nSmart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SX200 IS to Smart AUTO and you\u2019re ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It\u2019s a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you\u2019re photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you\u2019re getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nShooting Modes \nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 23 Shooting Modes including 11 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way \n\nHD movie shooting capability plus HDMI output\nThe PowerShot SX200 IS lets you record video in beautiful high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies (and still photos) on your HDTV with an mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high-definition monitor. You\u2019ll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 still images at once. \n\nBlink Detection\nBlinking subjects can ruin the best shots, and the problem usually isn\u2019t detected until it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. The PowerShot SX200 IS is equipped with Canon\u2019s new Blink Detection to combat this common image flaw. The feature uses the power of Face Detection to determine whether any subject in the previous shot had closed eyes. If closed eyes are detected, a \"blink warning\" icon appears for 3 seconds, allowing you to retake the shot before your subject or subjects move on. \n\n3.0-inch LCD with wide viewing angle\nThe camera\u2019s high resolution (230,000 dots) 3.0-inch LCD with gives you the big picture, whether you\u2019re shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera\u2019s menu functions especially convenient. Clear and bright, it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. It also has an electronic viewfinder that provides sharp images when you shoot close-up with Super Macro shooting mode. \n\nA World of Advantages with Canon\u2019s Technology \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self-Timer. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\nCanon\u2019s most advanced image processor, DIGIC 4, delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you\u2019re ready to shoot, then delivers perfect focus. In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 image processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA Face Detection Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include the photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, specify Face Detection Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range, and the Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway--allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot SX200 IS can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The PowerShot SX200 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the PowerShot SX200 IS features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot SX200 IS body \n * Lithium-ion battery pack (NB-5L) \n * Battery charger (CB-2LX) \n * Wrist strap (WS-DC9) \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB interface cable (IFC-400PCU) \n * AV cable (AVC-DC400)",
