A friend of mine has been boasting about Red Wings and his seem to be holding up great, will see. One thing I can say is the scent that you get when you open the box for the first time smells like a New baseball glove .",

Wearing them for the first day was the worst, raising a small blister on my heel. but by the 3rd day they are like old friends. They look great obviously with blue jeans, yet would look dressy enough for chinos or slacks. Owning & operating a retail hardware store I am on my feet 10-12 hours a day so good shoes are very important. These fill the bill! I am seriously considering buying a second pair in fears Red Wing may change the fit-style or just discontinue them",

I normally wear size 7 1/2, ordered size 7 and it fits perfectly. Highly recommend this chukka from Red Wings. It has a very simple look just like my pair of Iron Rangers.

    "description": "Red Wing Heritage's Foreman Chukkas combine a simple leather boot upper and Red Wing's durable neoprene cushion sole. The Foreman Chukka is a lightweight shoe that takes the timeless chukka design and attaches it to a comfortable neoprene work sole. The neoprene outsole was designed to provide traction and long-wearing support for workers who spend hours on their feet and move between various terrain. The combination created the Foreman Chukka, a shoe designed to work and relax both outdoors and indoors while standing up to any environment.\n\nFor almost a century, Red Wing Shoes has been producing top-quality work boots and shoes. It started with a corner store in the quiet river town of Red Wing, Minn. Today, Red Wing Shoes produces thousands of handmade shoes every day, making their legendary quality available worldwide.
