      "text": "The stylus is super super useful for teaching my students. This has all the bells and whistles of the best laptops: normal usb, sd card expansion, type c charging, touchscreen, backlit keys, decent trackpad and reasonable battery life. Touchscreen and display is better than all the other chromebooks I've used and even laptops (except maybe like a 4k xps). so it's comfortable to watch things. nonetheless, does take a while getting use to a taller screen, and i think i prefer a shorter one for watching, which would also make it easier to drop on a cluttered desk. battery realistically lasts me half a day i think, but in all fairness i always have it plugged in somewhere.",

Great for browsing, watching films and working in the Cloud etc. It charges very fast, seems well made with a great keyboard. I use it in all modes {tablet, tented etc}. I dropped one star because one of the hinges wasn't straight but seems to operate OK. I did contact Amazon via their customer chat, but waited for so long for a human to help me {you have to go through the robot first} that I gave up. I thought that as the hinge works ok, I will keep the Chromebook as it is probably just cosmetic.",

This model although i little smaller in size is spot on and works very well and is worth every penny. The quality and build is outstanding and i am very happy with this purchae even though it was much dearer it is certainly worth it The best buy i have ever purchased from Amazon. Thank you",
