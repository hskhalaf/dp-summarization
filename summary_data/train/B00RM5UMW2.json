Concrete was most \"difficult\" but really just rough work mixing. The posts, etc were all easy. Great instructions. For backboard have a truck. We backed up to the post with it cranked down. Two of us lifted up to truck and lifted up the 12\" higher while the wife slid the large bolts in. Go 60\" not 52\" ... it's a much better playing experience.",

It totally destroyed the rim and bent the arm system so the backboard is no longer square with the post. Backboard is still intact and raises and lowers fine and the main post was unaffected. This is a beast of a system that took a beating and will be repaired to hopefully provide years of additional service.",
