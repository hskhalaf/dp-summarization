I did the research and because I also have the Milwaukee M18 weed whacker that I purchased a 9.0 mah battery for I decided to get the 12.0 (massive and heavy) mah battery that is sold with the chainsaw... it was a great choice! I have a fairly large yard with 5 tall aspen/poplar trees that completely cover the yard with leaves in the fall and I\u2019ve never run out of battery once with either the 9.0 or 12.0 battery.",

With the 9 amp battery it is a bit heavy for an 83 year-old guy, but I manage without notable pain the next day. I'm impressed with this machine. I recommend it, but if a woman is going to use it, I would suggest buying two smaller amperage batteries to reduce weight.",

Do not expect it to replace tour gas blower, but it is great for small cleanup jobs, and for getting really hot fires stoked. Nice thing is, no starting, no exhaust, no gas smell or spills. Only downfall is battery life- even with the 8.0aH battery, expect 10-15 minutes running full tilt. I understand the physics, moving air at these speeds and volume requires quite a great deal of energy. Hard to believe these same batteries in my 1\u201d impact will remove and install several semi truck tires on the same charge. Either way, a convenient supplement to your yard care tools.",
