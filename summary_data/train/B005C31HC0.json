      "text": "I have bought three of these over the course of several years. They seem to last about two years before the fan starts giving out and making noise. But that's not bad considering how little you pay. When operational, they work decently. It's not a powerhouse or anything but it does a decent job of moving the air. I like them because they are not bulky, don't have a bunch of dumb lights, and it's slim enough that it doesn't message up the feng shui of my work space. I have bought three thus far... and I would imagine I'll buy another one in about two years.",

I don't want lights on my cooling pad, what I wanted was a silent cooling pad to keep my laptop cool while it is connected to an external monitor while I use Zoom. As it turns out, this is not nearly quiet enough, and it certainly isn't silent. It's loud enough that I can't use it while I'm on Zoom, because everybody can hear it. At least it is metal and holds the laptop off the desk surface, so its getting a little cooling, but not what I need it to be getting.",

Hard to say, but I think during gaming, it might help lower temps by a couple of degrees.",

More often during warmer months. I have the laptop fan blowing directly at the top of the router and that does the trick to lower the CPU and radio temperatures about four degrees C. It does the trick to keeping the router stable. This was the easiest way to solve my router's overheating problem without having a workshop project and potentially ruin the router.",

Even when not generating a video file from iMovie, the MBP was always very warm underneath - something that didn't happen with the 3-fan Havit solution.

Unfortunately the fan part of this unit is why I'm deducting stars here, because it's really not that good. Yes, it'll push air around just fine, but calling it \"silent\" is a gross overstatement and the USB plug feels flimsy. It sounds like a small box fan and is noisier than my laptop (albeit with a lower frequency sound). Some manner of variable speed control would have really helped here IMO.",

      "text": "It's a little thick for actual laptop use, but it has a fan and needs room to move the air. So I guess it has to take up a little room. I don't really have anything negative about it. If your laptop creates too much heat, this is a sure cure. It plugs into a usb port, so there's nothing extra to deal with, and it definitely moves the air. It will keep both your laptops plenty cool. The noise level is less annoying than I would have expected, although it does exist. That's another \"have-to\" if you want the air moved, right? I used this with my old laptop and I didn't have any problems with it.",

Note that most laptops will power up the USB ports when it is sleeping, which keeps this laptop cooler running when it does not need to. So far, I have no complaints whatsoever because even with the excessive running of the laptop cooler, it is still working reliably and quietly.",

After that was patched back up, the fan blades got caught on something inside, and one of them snapped off. It's now useless unless I can get the casing open to remove the broken fan blade.
