I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on home haircutting tools, these got good reviews, so I bought them. I have never bought shears sight unseen before. They are wonderful. Super sharp -- I have cut into my fingers a few times proving just how dull my old shears really were! These are truly right OR left hand scissors and work just as well either way.",
