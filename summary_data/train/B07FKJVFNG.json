When the movie is playing you can hear the terrible background sound of the engine! I had it checked twice and was told that it was the system. Long story it was gonna cost me more to fix the problem. I will never buy anything that seems to good to be true.",

We have four sets of headphones now & they all work interchangeably which is nice. One of our headphones got stepped on & broke. It was so easy to replace & have it work perfect. The sound is great through the headphones. No issues at all. I\u2019m really happy with this purchase. I don\u2019t have any complaints.",
