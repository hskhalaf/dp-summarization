Oregon with the clay soil that is typical of this area) and don't remove the mud as easily as the Carlisle. With the Carlisle, it is much easier to remove mud from the sides and back of the heel of my boots. Plus the bar underneath the brushes is great for getting the mud off that gets stuck against the heel.",

My husband at 5'8\" does not get hit in the face so it really just a short person problem. I'm trying to come up with a splash guard of sorts to help. Otherwise it does what it should and is heavy enough that we just have it in the grass, not screwed down and it stays put.",

    "title": "Carlisle 4042414 Commercial Boot 'N Shoe Brush Scraper with Chrome Plated Steel Frame, Blue",
    "description": "Size:Complete Unit| Style:1 Pack| Color:Blue\n\nThe Carlisle 4042414 Spectrum Boot 'N Shoe brush contains two brushes with blue polypropylene bristles attached to a chrome-plated steel frame and can be used to brush shoes free of dirt and debris before entering a workplace. The polypropylene bristles resist stains, odors, bacteria, fungi, and wear, and are suitable for wet or dry conditions. The brushes flip up to expose a steel scraper that can be used to remove heavy debris. Each brush is attached to a plastic block that resists moisture. The chrome-plated steel frame resists wear, corrosion, and impacts, and can be wiped clean. Holes at the bottom of the frame can be used to mount the Boot 'N Shoe brush to the floor. This product measures 14-3/4 x 7 inches (L x H). (L is length, the horizontal distance from front to back; H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point.) The steel scraper is 16-1/2\" long. The bristles are 2-1/2\" long. This product is free of BPA (Bisphenol A) to address food safety concerns raised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other organizations.\n\nCarlisle manufactures food service equipment and supplies and sanitary maintenance tools and supplies for commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities. The company, founded in 1954, is headquartered in Oklahoma City, OK.",
