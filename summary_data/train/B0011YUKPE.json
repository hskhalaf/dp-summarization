      "text": "Bought this to continue physical therapy at home after insurance stopped paying for PT sessions. Returned it immediately, as it was fairly easy to maintaim one's balance due to the nearly flat angle of the rocker's bottom surface. I ended up buying a rocker board made by Fitter First, which provided a more challenging exercise due to it being less steady--on top of it, the incline angle/difficulty setting can be easily adjusted with a simple twist and pull. If you buy this and share a similar experience, don't say I didn't warn you!",

Worth the money and useful for other forms of exercise. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

      "text": "Works as advertised. Much better than the inflatable one I had previously. As someone else noticed, the base might be a little too wide as it's pretty easy to balance on. I use it while practicing hockey stick work though, so the movements are enough to make balancing more difficult. The only real drawback I've found is using it barefoot, which is really the only way to use a balance board. The pattern on the platform hurts my feet after a couple of minutes.",
