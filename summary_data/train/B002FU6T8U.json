I will buy another pair of VonZipper polarized like I had before. They lasted nearly 6 years before bubbling eventually ended their usefulness.",

I have a small face and these fit me much better than most sunglasses, but, they are still pretty small. If you have a problem with many sunglasses seem to stick out past your face, these will likely fit you well. I would recommend these sunglasses. If you like the style, you'll love the quality. Will not be disappointed. My previous pair lasted 2 years with daily use before I lost them.",

What you see is what you get. Build quality is great and the lenses seem fairly hard, though I bought these as a second pair to my first scratched pair (4 years old).

Even on a dull day, or if you're feeling down or blue, go outside and put these on, and they really lift your mood, just by making the world look a little brighter. Not sure how they do it, but its for real. The sides curve around a little, too, to offer sun protection on the sides, really great feature that I don't have on my beloved wayfarers!",
