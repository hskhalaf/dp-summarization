Before this was Alan Wake in which is included as a digital download with this game, or was upon my purchase. Alan Wake is a psychological thriller and probably one of the best ones if not the best (easily equal to Resident evil and Silent Hill games) and Quantum Break is more of a shooter than a thriller, but Quantum break Looks amazing for a title that was released the first year Xbox One was released. There are some very cool environmental/time manipulation powers and a very compelling story that keeps you hooked once you get into the game",

The mechanics are easy to understand and after a couple of minutes you'll be God amongst men. There's a couple of downsides that will probably kill you off, first there's some frame rates hiccups in some occasions and second, the whole game with the live action episodes is too heavy! That's it! If you have the space, want to play a game with friends that like the sci-fi genre and if you know Alan Wake, this game will most likely have you hooked... P.s.: Remedy... I'm still waiting for Alan Wake 2...",

The game plays out more like the show 24 with a timeline of things after an event. The filmed scenes can be skipped as it slows the experience down. The game becomes a button smasher as it is missing a few elements. Good for a couple play throughs but not memorable.",

      "text": "Quick, glitchy, doesn't tutorial well, expect to die alot the final boss fight. Had to replay a lot because of glitches when putting my xbox on standby, gameplay is great otherwise, confusing story, but hell of a story all the same. Definitely an original concept, I don't like real live action tied into gameplay, they spent so much time and money animating the faces, it seems stupid to tie in live-action. Overall, worth the $35 I paid, but glad I didn't pay more",

I wish more companies would put more story in games like Remedy did. Overall the game is great plays fantastic and feels like a good game all around. Buy with confidence and enjoy the story!",
