I've been in the tax business for over 40 years and not once during those years did I not have a calculator on hand. Or for that matter, an IBM Selectric Typewriter - not sure I could do my job without both of these \"old style mechanical pieces\". Thanks guys - great machine at a very reasonable price.",

I ended up returning this product but not because there was anything wrong with how it functions - I just couldn't tolerate the constant loud noise when in print mode (which is why I only gave it 3 stars). Otherwise, this calculator was great! If you just need a calculator infrequently, the sound may not be an issue for you.",
