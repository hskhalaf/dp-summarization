No recourse or advice was available from GrennTech customer service. So back the fan went causing my gift to be a big pain for the person I gave it to. Would NEVER buy from Green Tech again. Amazon, however, returned purchase price immediately. Thank you for that.",

Love that i'ts bladeless and easy to clean. Remote is handy also. With the 12 settings, you can have a slight breeze on the lowest, and level 12 gives off a nice blast of air. I'm so glad I tried this fan. LOVE IT. I plan on buying a second one for our cabin. It does a great job of moving air around and it's extremely quiet.",

When I went to plug everything in and turn it on, there was a loud rattling noise on the inside. Don\u2019t know what it is but I can\u2019t use it. Disappointed with the product. Unfortunately I am unable to return it ATM due to COVID and our mailroom not accepting packages to be sent out. I will adjust my rating if the company reaches out.",

The slight noise I can hear as I fall asleep is a nice register to me, probably the best white noise I've ever had. Cranked up to the max, the fan starts to get loud, but it moves a lot of air. I almost never need to use it above 50% though. The only complaint I had was the beep whenever you change the fan speed, so I opened it up and disabled the piezo buzzer myself. Now it's perfect :D",

She did turn it up to high when she first got it, and it wasn't any more loud than a regular fan, maybe a little quieter. Overall she is very happy with it.

The PureFlow fan is an amazing product. Quiet operation, nice air movement, easily located to meet our needs and the design appearance is not the typical boxy looking fan.

For me, the lowest setting is more than enough of air. I've used it on the lowest setting for a few days now. It makes plenty of breeze from a surprising distance. I aim it a specific 'point' and the fan moves the air at that focal spot from about 10 feet away.",

I do have central AC in my home but I like to place my new so quiet fan in front of AC vents to conveniently move air around! Makes it SOOOO!!! much cooler!
