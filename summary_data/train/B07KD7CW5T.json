In my opinion, this device has become an extension of Amazon's marketing department and no longer serves as a pleasure device for customers.

Extremely quick between apps, videos play without any issue, screen looks beautiful compared to past iterations. Most bad reviews so far have been people trying to use incompatible accessories from past fire hd tablets that used micro USB. Fast charging time with 15w adapters and the type C port is a welcome upgrade. Obviously if your not a fan of the amazon ecosystem or OS, then you might want to go with something that runs stock Android or iOS. For the price and these specs, this tablet really can't be beat.",

The screen is excellent, battery life is outstanding, I've been using this for several hours throughout the day and haven't had to charge it yet. I've sideloaded the Google play store and have access to all my Android apps which is a plus. The Amazon apps are also convenient to have at hand. All in all a great tablet that I would recommend to anyone looking for a budget device",

I will keep it a couple days til I calm down then make final decision. The design is awkward. It is too long and the fulcrum makes you drop it constantly. Steve Jobs would never send this design out! Maybe you have to get used to it but it's got a very heavy top and wants to fall out of your hands all the time. Bad design. Don't buy it. Not worth it. At least for me today. Maybe after a few more days. Unsure. mary j.",
