Consider this, many other models have exhaust exiting the back of the tool. The safety mechanism is long & cumbersome in tight spots, so i removed it and was pleased.",

Right-angle configuration provides easy access to tight spots, so you can grind, break sharp edges, de-burr, port, and polish virtually anywhere.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nLong lasting, economical, and ideal for general-purpose grinding, the Ingersoll Rand 301B Air Angle Die Grinder delivers a number of beneficial features in one compact package. Right-angle configuration provides easy access to tight spots, so you can grind, break sharp edges, de-burr, port, and polish virtually anywhere. The 301B has a 0.25 hp motor that delivers a free speed of 21,000 rpm.\n\nGreat for grinding, breaking sharp edges, deburring, porting, and polishing (view larger). The 301B's strong aluminum housing withstands tough operating conditions, and its durable ball-bearing construction improves balance, reduces vibration, and ensures a longer life. The small, lightweight design provides easy operation, and greater access to tight spots, while an integral safety-lock throttle lever prevents accidental start-up.
