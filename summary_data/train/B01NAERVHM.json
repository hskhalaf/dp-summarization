The second set I bought were for a low-clearance area and the extra 2 inches between the light and the ceiling make it not work - I was counting on the flush mount!",

It's super bright, lightweight, and relatively easy to install. The hanging mech is clever and eliminates the need to be too precise with drilling and cable placement. BUT! You'll need to replace the included screws if you're fastening directly to rafters, or drill a pilot hole first because the screw heads strip easily. There's no shame in using drywall screws to finish the job, son. None at all.",

Also the cord is rather short and no hanging string on off switch. Just a cord that plugs in and switch like you\u2019d find on desk lamp. Flick it on. Good value for $35-40.",

I bought the 4-pack and one of the lights had a bad switch. I contacted Charles at Hyperikon and he is having a replacement sent to me directly. No questions asked. No hassle.

If it had a 8 foot cord length as most other corded ceiling lights, I would have rated 5 Stars.

They look very professional, and the cable adjustment just tops the cake! I'm planning to buy two more for my garage. I highly recommend these shop lights to anyone looking for stylish bright LED lights for a workshop, garage, or anywhere more light is needed!",
