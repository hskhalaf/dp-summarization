      "text": "I've had great experience's with Bully tools before, but their post hole digger is a disappointment. It might work ok in sand or other soft dirt, but I didn't get through digging the first hole and the blades were both bent and the hinge was torqued out of alignment. The steel in this tool is soft and pliable and completely inadequate for the application. In addition the hinge and hinge stop are poorly designed, the hinge is a simple bolt that allows too much flex, which in turn causes the hinge stops to bypass each other and jam the tool. Was looking forward to another quality American made tool, but this was a let down.",
