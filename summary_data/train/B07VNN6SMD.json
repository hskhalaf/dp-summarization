      "text": "This is my third NB purchase and by far the most impressive product. The first two were 600 and 900 watts, which lasted about 3 years each when the motors burned out. I assume this was because of filling too close to the lines. This model has several improvements, including multiple speeds and functions, an actual blender, plus the 32 and 24 oz cups for smoothies; it is quieter and more high tech. The old style cup had rubber gaskets that were inset and fouled if not very carefully cleaned by removing them. The new cups have eliminated this problem. I expect to enjoy this NB more and for it to last longer than my first two.",

The smaller sized cups are so tall with just a tiny blade at the bottom, I can never get it to blend my ingredients - so basically they are useless.

Even worse, the small containers that come with the blender have a separate blade attachment that's a disaster; the last time I used a mini-container it stuck fast to the blade attachment after I used it. I was NOT ABLE TO DETACH IT nor was anyone in my household. I threw the container (still attached to the blade attachment) into recycling. Huge waste of effort and a major frustration. Also, large container is designed with large divots, for some reason, that make it difficult to clean (as is the top).",

It is tempting to just rinse it out and toss it on the dish drainer, but then residue and minerals from the tap can build up over time and eventually affect the seal between the jar and base.",

So far i have blended salsas, soup mix (tomatoes,onion,garlic with chicken broth) and when it done its perfectly blended that i don\u2019t have to use a strainer.

Chops any solid veggie or fruit to a liquid. Ensure you add some form of JUICE or fruit liquid to it because it eases the blending process. The smaller \"to-go\" cups make it easy to bring a smoothie for breakfast or lunch or post-workout shake at the gym. I have not tried it with any chilled or frozen fruit yet but i imagine you have to let it thaw some before blending. I love this blender and definitely believe it was WORTH the investment. :-)",

I also like the suction cups on the bottom of the blender. It lightly suctions to the counter so you don't feel you have to hold the blender down. One thing to note - the blender is pretty loud. That being said, I think most blenders are loud... so do with that what you will.",

This thing is a gem for those on Berger but want the vitamix experience",
