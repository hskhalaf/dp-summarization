When I first put it together, I slightly followed them, but was sure \"I had it\" when I just attached the tracks. When the cars wouldn't stay on, and yet they did when someone else had previously put it together, I realized it does in fact matter where each track is attached. So follow the instructions carefully. Otherwise, awesome toy. My 4.5 year old loves it. We keep it out for awhile and then we take it apart and put it away for awhile. It is like having a new toy when we pull it out again. Have fun!",

They are able to easily feed cars onto the track and are thrilled by the numbers of loops they can get before they jymp track. They are not into the crash aspect, but instead keep track of which cars go longer or faster. I once counted 64 full laps before a car jumped track! Now, sometimes they jump track after 1 loop, but there are enough \"long rides\" to make my little girls squeal in delight! Thousand of loops are on the 1st set of batteries too!",

      "text": "The pair of \"hooks\" on the bottom of each track are flimsy. If the hooks loosen, the tracks no longer snugly connect to the base and this can cause cars to become unstable and crash. Even when the toy is brand new, certain cars will never drive well due to a variety of factors, e.g. weight, size, resistance to rolling. Some cars will drive great. I don't recommend this for kids who treat the toy roughly.",

With 4 crash zones you are sure to get some \"epic carnage.\" It says it links together with other tracks but that is only in one spot, the intake track. Anything else would mess up the closed circuit that is required to make this work.",
