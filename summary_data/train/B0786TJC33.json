Feel like they really paid attention to all the little details- the temperature doesn't fluctuate and keeps everything cool, the door closes just right, LOVE the blue light and best of all- you get an electronic control at the price of a mechanical control cooler!!!!! Most value for money. Love the 120 can capacity, it can actually fit a little more than that. Hopefully they launch larger versions in the future- would love to get some for my office too.",

Got it down to 36, which is good enough for what I need.",

We do have to be careful because we have a clear covering on our patio and I think the sun does affect the temperature because of the glass front. But, since we live in a very moderate climate, it hasn\u2019t been much of an issue. I did a lot of research because I like my drinks really cold and I wanted something aesthetically pleasing. This cooler really fits the bill, I\u2019m so glad I chose it because even over a year later it\u2019s still great.",

If it is missing something this obvious, it makes me nervous about quality control for the rest of the product. Also, it doesn't work very well if it isn't level. The seller was very prompt in offering a generous discount on the product & I will work with the manufacturer to get a foot. The beverage fridge works very well, thus far, otherwise.",

I\u2019m going to purchase locally where returns are easy and repairs are possible. Amazon is great.

I set the temp at 35 degrees for I like very cold beverages. The cooler works great and looks great. My old G.E. compact fridge lasted 28 years hopefully this HomeLab cooler can come close.",
