The complaints from other reviewers about the padding interfering with grip are valid. If you\u2019re not accustomed to gloves with significant padding, these will be a major adjustment at best. I put them on, grabbed a barbell and knew immediately they weren\u2019t going to work for me, and I have XL hands. That said, they get four stars because I have to put something and they seemed like a very well put together, quality set of gloves. Just not for me.",

I love the snug fit of the loves and I really love the long wrist straps, just be careful no to over tighten them. The chemical smell has finally started to subside, but it is still present after 6 weeks. The gloves come off with ease by using the pull tabs on the two middle fingers. The padded palms provide the much needed protection from the heavy weight of the bench press and dumbbells. I thought the price is a bit expensive, but thus far, the quality and comfort is worth the money.",

Crown Gear also included rubber pads that I grip between the steel bar and gloves. Hooks on back of the middle 2 fingers help to remove gloves if you press the palm against your body. Sizing for weightlifting gloves is different from regular dress or outdoor gloves. I measure a men's medium, but wear men's large in weightlifting gloves and they fit like a second layer of skin -- as they should. This was true of my old Harbinger gel wrist wrap gloves and my new Crown Dominator gloves.",

Dips are also less tiring on the hands due to the extra thickness of the gloves. The only drawback is that it makes it harder for me, since I have small hands, to grip the barbell or dumbbell with the extra padding in the palm of the glove. I ordered a size large, and they fit perfect. Wish that the fingers were a little longer which might aid in the ability to grip the barbell on deadlifts, etc.",

They tighten up more easily than you'd want too so I'd say buy these a size larger than you normally do and you'll be pleased. There's a seam that can be annoying where it wraps around the wrist, so if you order too small, I'll dig in and you won't enjoy these.",

Thanks to the extra padding in the palms, my calluses are also softening since I started using these gloves. My old gloves constantly gave me blisters and calluses. I also love, love, LOVE the pulloff feature, allowing for a quick transition from workout to cool-down, without spending an extra two minutes trying to pry sweaty gloves off my hands. I'm recommending these to all my CrossFit and Kettlebell friends!",

One of the features I didn't have on old gloves are the tabs on back for easy removal. Great idea. They're unobtrusive, effective and remove the struggle of fighting with the glove to remove. Also the wrist guard with its double closure is infinitely adjustable and once you close it, it stays closed. Overall a great value despite its above average cost. They will last longer, they will help protect my hands and they look great. They are a value because they deliver on what the promise.",
