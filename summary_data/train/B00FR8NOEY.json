      "text": "I really liked the look of these shoes, but they are too narrow. I have fairly narrow feet, and usually take a size 10. DCs pretty much universally fit small, so I got a 10.5. Initially, they were comfortable, but after wearing them around the house for a couple hours, I really noticed how narrow they were, and they started rubbing uncomfortably along the instep. I returned the shoes after that. Disappointing, because the style and color are great.",
