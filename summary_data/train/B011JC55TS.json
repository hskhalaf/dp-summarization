This Chromebook is perfect for school and I am beyond satisfied with it's performance. I absolutely love the simplicity of this laptop and it's light enough to carry around. Although, you have to have some kind of internet connection to take full advantage of the Chromebook and it may be a difficult transition for people who like Windows, because the Chromebook runs on Chrome OS. Meaning no easy \"my computer\" or \"my files\", everything is done through your google account (drive) or the cloud. Something that Windows lovers won't really appreciate.",

My son has used it HARD for school and pleasure for several months, and it's been perfect. Only quibble is that the speakers are pretty awful, but we use headphones or external Bluetooth speakers if watching video/music (or connect to TV via HDMI cable) -- so it doesn't matter.",
