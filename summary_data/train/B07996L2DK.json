Even in setup it recommends you save the fingerprint in several positions to make your chances better. I was never able to get a thumb print to even be accepted. Even worse is that after 3 failed attempts to open it with a fingerprint it won't even open with the key. This safe is a total waste of money and Amazon should be ashamed of putting their name on it!",

It isn't going to offer the security of Fort Knox, but being smaller than a gun safe, it can be located in places where it would be difficult to not only find by \"work on\". Great security for the price. I am more than happy with the purchase and would definitely purchase again.",

Of those initial rejections, most were caused by my own poor finger placement on the scanner. Overall, the biometric lock works well.
