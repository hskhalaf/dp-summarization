The movies look great glasses very easy to use. if they last and hold a charge they will be perfect. Update: Had these for 3 months. They last about 15 movies before needing recharge still working great. Ordered 2 more pair. 2nd Update: Had an arm break on glasses contacted seller received replacement in 2 days... no questions ask!",

I opened the box and found a nice zippered case that includes the glasses, a cleaning cloth, a small printed instruction sheet, and a USB charging cord. I turned them on per the included instructions (very small text, use a magnifier if you're old like me) and they immediately synced to my Wowoto T8E projector HDMI'ed to a Sony 3D BluRay player, and within literally seconds the show was a go!!! The 3D is clear with no detectable ghosting. I wear glasses and these fit comfortably over my prescription lenses and frames. Recommend you give them a try!",

The power button is great because it also cycles through the lens shift. Its very convenient to not have to open up the projector menu and go back and fort trying to figure out if its set right or not. Just click the button above your nose and you are good. The cases that come with these are nice and the glasses themselves appear sturdy enough even though they are very light.",

If they don't detect a 3D signal they turn themselves off after about 30 seconds to conserve battery life. Speaking of battery life, I charged them up when I got them and I've watched about a half dozen movies and several dozen YouTube clips with them and still have not had to charge them. Impressive! They're comfortable too, and fit over my regular glasses with no problem at all. 10/10 would recommend.",

The instructions had few english words but there's not much to figure out, you plug them in, charge them, and turn them on. I have an Optoma 143X and they paired instantly upon turning them on (after the 3D image was up). Note that the stickers on the lenses are for taking off the protective film. I thought at first they left a residue, but you're supposed to pull them half off, then the full-lens protector comes off with them on both sides. Great product!",

One set looked like it had been opened and there was a splotch of adhesive on one of the lenses. I wish they did work. They are much lighter than the Optoma glass. They are charged by USB.",

      "text": "I have a VAVA 4k Ultra Short Throw projector and have been meaning to get some affordable DLP Link glasses for a while now. These glasses work well, but are not the greatest over top of my existing glasses I need to see ;) I get by as 3D is pretty much a novelty but had they been a little bigger it would have gone from small annoyance to hardly noticeable. If you don't wear glasses, these fit great and keep you in the action. I would recommend these are they are a fantastic price and worked flawlessly with my setup and are very reasonably priced!",
