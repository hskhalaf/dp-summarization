That's the reason I bought this knife, US company with a reputation for quality US made knives. Box just arrived. I flip over packaging and read \"Made in China\" almost immediately. Will not open it just yet, may return it. Looks like a nice knife. It's probably an excellent knife. But the advertising is just straight up incorrect. I'll be contacting Amazon and possibly Kershaw to address this issue.",

Firstly, they will not accept a photo of the problem, the knife has to be sent back to them and they want me to pay for shipping so that they can evaluate the problem. Which means that I would be out another 6 or 7 dollars with no guarantee they would replace the knife (cost of knife about 15.00). Then it is unclear whether I would have to pay return shipping. What good is a warranty when the cost of shipping is more than the knife.",

I have filayed everything from crappie, to bass, to catfish with this knife and it is super sharp and the rubber grip makes it easy to use. 5 STARS, Highly Recommend this product!!!!",

Holds an awesome edge for filleting a 100 breasts at a time. Non slip grip is great. You can't go wrong, KERSHAW BABY!!!",

    "description": "Style Name:9 InchKershaw\u2019s Clearwater 9-inch fillet is perfect for filleting larger fish with ease. The blade is made of Japanese 420J2 stainless steel with the perfect degree of flex to make detailed jobs simple. This \u201csofter\u201d steel enables the blade to bend without breaking so it moves easily through the body of the fish, rendering the ideal fillet. It is also highly corrosion resistant for work in wet environments, without rust or buildup. The handle, made of co-polymer material, is durable, contoured for comfort and textured for tough grip that\u2019s soft-yet-firm, making filleting even a large catch less fatiguing. Its neon green highlights make the handle easy to spot in a marine environment, while adding stylish contrast to the basic black handle. The 9-inch fillet\u2019s handle design, with its central contour and hand protectors at both ends, fits the hand and locks in for extra-comfortable grip. The Kershaw 9-inch Clearwater Fillet locks into its own ABS sheath for secure storage or easy belt carry.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nKershaw 1259 Fillet Knife with Nine-Inch Blade features a stainless steel blade and co-polymer plastic handle.
