You will learn about P/e ratios and other basic fundamentals to look for in companies without getting into dry details. Pretty easy read, under 4 hours for your average reader.",

First instead of giving his theory, he asks have you made the investment which is frequently better than stocks (buying a house). Next, he tells you to look in the mirror: do you have the temperament to invest in stocks? Finally after those two serious considerations are addressed, he shows how the truth is hidden in plain side. That is, information you come across from shopping or your vocation can provide leads to companies which are prospering and good candidates for investment. The only thing which could be better than this, is if Warren Buffet took the time to write a book like this.",

Mr. Lynch points out the possibility of the dot.com bubble even thought it has not happened. However, some of his advice is regarding savings accounts and real- estate are extremely out of date now.

This book gives a methodology used by the author to analyze stock markets and stocks. More-over he gives an explanation of the importance of various numbers mentioned in the balance sheet of the stock. The writing is easy to read and the flow of the book is logical. All in all, I enjoyed the book and will practice it.",

Cuts thru a lot of bull handed out by Wall Street and the Media and just explains how the market really works, that it can't be figured out by what people are saying and talking about one tragedy after the other, but explains how that can be used to your own advantage.",

Even though it was written 30 years ago it still provides timeless basics and concepts. The biggest issue is that it was written during a time of rising super-malls and department stores so some of its industry specific advice is outdated. Highly recommend as a first dive",
