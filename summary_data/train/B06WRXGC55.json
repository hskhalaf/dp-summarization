Their true size is about the width of a dime and as thick as3 dimes together. We certainly be reordering lots more. Have already placed and received second order!!! Couldn't be happier with these magnets !! Our second order and can't explain how strong these are. Add alittle drop of E6000 glue and your magnet is secured and ready to hold your item a at least four pieces of paper or two Extre large post cards.",
