Application of the primer: I apply it with my fingers and let it dry a bit before I put on my eyeshadow. 3. How it works: Awesome. Eyeshadow colors show up much more vibrant and really help stay on throughout the day. It has become a mainstay of my makeup routine.",

I wear make up for most of the day (7am-7pm) and this makes my eyeshadows look fawless from the moment I leave the house until I'm ready to take my make up off.",

It's a good product it makes my eyeshadow more vibrant but it doesnt blend well with my skintone like I was hoping it would",

Just let it dry for 30 seconds, apply your powder fairly quickly for the best hold. Then you can put liquids and gels (i.e. eyeliners) on top without any issues. It holds the powders so well! Now you do need to use a thin layer or it looks shabby. A little goes a long way!",
