Since buying and installing this digita replacement, I have saved 25% on my power bill. It has already paid for itself, and I wish I would have bought it sooner. The install was fairly simple. you'll need to take a photo of the old wiring setup of the thermostat you are replacing, and have wire cutters and pliers to bend and shape wire on hand.",

This was the worst and there is no phone support number on the box or the installation instructions. Not good when you're in an area with limited cell service for voice and no data!",

Now I am wondering how the light should work. I can turn the light on but when I press the next key it goes off. If it is intended to be a night light it is ok. On the White Rodgers thermostat it replaced the light stay on so you could make temperature adjustments etc. I will call in when I get around to it.",

      "text": "We were replacing a White-Rodgers 20 year old Thermostat and ordered what looked like the same one. It was a little smaller but had the same features. It was a little difficult to install due to the small area to attach the wires. The manufacturer and seller were very helpful with questions we had, especially since the product did not come with an installation flyer. We found it online and we were also sent one from the seller. It works fine and looks good. I hope this one lasts 20 years!",
