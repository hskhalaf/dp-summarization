It works well on any surface and while being very compact it is still comfortable to hold and easy to use. It connects instantly and required no software installation of any kind. All you will need is a free USB port for the wireless mini USB adapter. The USB adapter stores in the mouse so you don't have to worry about losing it.",

Other than that I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a wireless mouse as long as range of signal is not an issue.",

This could be easily solved by installing the latest driver on Microsoft website, not a big deal but still made me annoying for some time. Anyway, nothing could be perfect. This mouse is good and the price is reasonable.",
