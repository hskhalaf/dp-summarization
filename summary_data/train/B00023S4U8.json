It is just an accessory in the Lefhheit system. I did not see anywhere in this product description that you had to buy the handle separately. Most people assume that they are buying a rake with a handle; wrong!!! The quality of the rake is very good but who needs a rake without a handle. :-( ;-( :-(",

There are larger rake heads but I found this size to be perfectly balanced in size and functionality with out experiencing any shoulder pain due to pushing / pulling larger quantities of dirt. This rake head is very manageable and as with all Wolf-garten products flawless in construction/ fit and finish. Used the wooden handle for the first time this weekend and have to say the wooden handle adds a nice feel to the rake head.",

It was pretty easy to help level out bumps, etc. My only complaint is that when you snap the rake onto the handle - I have the 59\" metal one - there's a bit of wiggle on it, as in it's not a perfectly tight fit. It didn't affect the use of it. I haven't tried and of the other attachments yet so I don't know how tightly they snap on.",
