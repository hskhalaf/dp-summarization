Great product, seems very high quality.",

It has a horrible smell like burning electrical wiring or circuit board, but it has been running for two months with no problems. It doesn't get hot, and my wife runs it for as long as 30 minutes. The stink is only slightly abated now.",

If I had any complaint it would be a slight odor from the rubberized handle that transfers to my hands. I think it's getting less after using several times. Be careful with the rubber tips though, I had the one which the little fingers on and after an hour of steady use where I fell asleep, I woke to several small open sores on my skin! Personally I've never used different tips on a massager and won't ever again.",

It's gotten gradually louder, but still works. Used 1-2 hrs at a time, nearly every day until last April when we purchased a rechargeable unit. Now it's our back-up massager used 1-2 times per week.
