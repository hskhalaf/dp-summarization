Many of my friend's DVD's are old and not HD. Tried one of them on this player and the picture quality was fantastic on her HD TV. Second I wanted a player that's not overly complicated and relatively easy to operate. My friend had no problems in operating her new player and now is a pro at it. And last and most important, my friend is extremely happy and playing all of her favorite DVDs",
