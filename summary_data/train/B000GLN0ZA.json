I suggest if you're concerned to only buy from Amazon. I agonized over the sizes- 55, 58 & 62mm. 62 is mostly for men. 55 is for petite faces. 58 is standard/medium. From experience, the only thing worse than too big is too small. The 58 is perfect!!! I own polarized glasses. These aren't, which is fine. I read the UV protection isn't as good on polarized. Polarized is meant for glare- ie: out on the water",

When I\u2019m wearing them you can see my entire eyebrow, and I have a small to average size face. I like my sunglasses to provide a little more coverage. The lenses do jot provide much sun protection either. They are extremely thin and delicate. I don\u2019t wear them because I am afraid they will break easily. The only good thing about these sunglasses is that they look beautiful, but are not sturdy or functional.",

These are even better than the old golden aviators that were lost. f you're looking to change it up, buy these!",
