When the keyboard is plugged directly into the MacBook Pro, no problems. Also, the sound port doesn't always sound right and I have to jiggle the jack. Doesn't matter which sound device is plugged in, same issue. And sometimes my machine won't get any signal to my external monitor. So I have to restart to make it work. None of these problems from my Belkin Express Docks.",

Sadly I have to return it because as a new item at this price I expect everything to be in working order. Overall the docking station is solidly built and looks good. As long as you do not get a defective one it is worth the price.",

      "title": "Works fine with Yoga 920",
      "text": "So far, this dock is working great with my Lenovo Yoga 920. Charging and a second monitor (using USB-C to HDMI cable) are working perfectly. I have a USB hub daisy-chained to one of the USB ports, and that is working fine as well. The Thunderbolt 3/USB-C cable is rather short, but this seems to be an issue with all the docks and must have something to do with the pricing for 40GB certified cables (since evidently, even a 1m passive cable is in the $70 price range). When I first plugged in the dock, I was prompted to install some software and then prompted allow the dock to mount. But since then, everything has just worked.",
