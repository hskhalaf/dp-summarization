      "text": "I've been using this router exclusively over the last three months for connecting wireless devices to my home network and have found this device is capable of handling 4 devices streaming 4k video with no issues. I am yet to test the stability of both wired and wireless devices but I'm reasonably confident it should be able to handle 5 devices at the same time. Usual wireless transfer rate is 28-30mb/s. Also, a nice added bonus to have the option of a guest network that comes in handy when visitors stay over for a few days.",

However, the Wi-Fi speed direct from the Virgin Hub3 was never more than 50 Mb/s, even right next to the box. Last year I installed one of these routers upstairs, connected to the Ethernet network, and now another downstairs. I now get Wi-Fi speeds of around 90 Mb/s using the 2.4Ghz band and around 215 Mb/s using the 5 GHz band. These are speeds using the Speedtest app on my Huawei P20 phone. In busy periods the speeds are lower, but still very acceptable. I am therefore delighted with these routers.",

However they have been very supportive of attempting to resolve one or two specific features (unusual) that I wished to employ. At this price it certainly gets my recommendation.",

Also it routinely drips the connection to some devices and then getting it to reconnect is impossible without rebooting it. All in all this has been a big waste of money.",
