Quality - Seems excellent so far, but I've only owned them for a few days. Stitching all seems well done, leather is soft and supple Feel- Extremely soft inside... Almost like a micro fleece type of liner. Should hold up very well in the winter and I expect them to be warm. Overall, I would buy these again and I do recommend them to anybody looking for a nice pair of leather gloves for cold climate.",

Unfortunately, I have worn them maybe two dozen times now, and today when I put them on I noticed two seams have ripped. The area between each finger looks to be quite stressed. Either I got a bad apple or the materials used are very low quality. I did not abuse these gloves, they have simply been used for driving. Will try to contact seller/mfgr to see if a replacement fairs better, otherwise my opinion is that you should look elsewhere. Will update review as applicable.",

The luxurious, generously and excellently sewn in cashmere lining, is an excellent insulator in conjunction with these gloves. They look great with both formal and casual clothing.

You get faster with practice, but I don't think I will ever get enough practice for swiping, especially virtual keyboards where you slide your finger around. As gloves, they are also pretty good. Easy to get on and off, but that probably depends on the luck of their size and my hand size. Keep me warm enough, but they are no substitute for really insulated gloves if it gets below 0F (-20C); for those conditions, they'll keep the wind off whiel you go out to your car.",

      "text": "I have been using these gloves about a month now. The outer shell and lining of the gloves have a great feel! Even though the quality of the material is really good, these gloves are a bit thin and do not provide the mentioned warmth. I used these gloves in 5 C temperature and my hands were fairly cold. The glove cuffs are wide and hence let the cold air in at times, that might be the root cause! Overall, I am fine with these gloves, but I will need another pair for serious (less than 0 C cold)!",
