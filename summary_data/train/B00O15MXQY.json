Even with the font set to large, incoming calls show up in a very small font in one little corner of the main screen, using maybe 10% of the height. WHAT ARE THEY SAVING THE OTHER 90% FOR?? Completely useless, can't even see who is calling. That's not even counting the mini-display on the outside when phone is closed (also miniscule). I got this for an 85 year old based on supposed \"senior\" features. Don't waste your money. This thing is garbage.",

So be sure to order a Sim card for it if you don't already have one starting with 8901, I think the Sim size is \"regular\" or \"standard\" but I could be wrong about that. Definitely T-Mobile compatible but it also could not read the entries on my old sim card for some reason.",

I probably used about 15 minutes of talk time and spent about 20 minutes entering contact phone numbers in that period of time. The rest was stand by time. I never turned it off. It's just what I was looking for. Oh and by the way, the small size is a big plus.",
