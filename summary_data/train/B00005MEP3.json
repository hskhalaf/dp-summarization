      "text": "I bought this 10 years and 10 months ago as a small office fax machine, it finally gave out. I didn't realize it was that old, I am impressed. It has had some heavy use both sending and receiving faxes. I replaced it with a similar fax only model. It is nearly identical, no retraining necessary. I always recommend this series of fax/multifunction printer to people looking for a good business quality fax.",

      "text": "Pretty reliable printer. Very helpful for sheetfed scanner. 2nd paper tray available still some places so you can use it with two different forms loaded in the trays plus the manual feeder. I have had four of these running reliably for around five years. Toner and drums are dirt cheap too. Use these all day for scanning documents, printing letters, stamps dot com postage, faxing, etc. Occasional error messages can be deciphered and/or cleared with info available by searching the web. Definitely rated 5/5 at my office.",

You may be able to print if you're lucky, but the scanner and the manual feed aren't supported according to the Brother website (a page that's impossible to find). The worst part of my experienec so far is Brother's technical support for the Mac. If you try to reach them by phone, they'll actually ask you to FAX your question to their Mac expert who can ONLY be contacted by written fax (no email address, no telephone number). Just a customer service nightmare. I wish I could return this, but I'm stuck now. Get the HP multifunction instead.",

Have done print jobs as large as 300 pages or so, and the printer really does crank them at 10-12 pages/minute. Print quality is excellent. Mac OS 10.1 works great with the printer; kudos to Brother for staying up-to-date. Don't know about long-term durability, but seems solid enough. The Fax works fine. Can't go wrong at this price.",

See the drum listed in supplies? You're gonna need one about every 2nd or 3rd toner cartridge. That's right, boys and girls, this slug is gonna cost you it's suggested retail price in toner and drums every few thousand sheets. And, amazingly, even with replacing the drum, which seems to last the life of the machine on other units from HP or IBM, the print quality STILL never returns to \"like new\". Buyer beware...",

You can get it to print by downloading a patch from the brother website, and then use the HL-720 print driver, but all other functions such as scanning and such are not available. This work around is merely to print. Overall, the machine is OK for a laser printer but sub-standard for faxing etc.",

    "title": "Brother MFC-8500 Laser Multifunction Center",
    "description": "AMAZON.COM\nWhile most all-in-one machines sacrifice quality for convenience, Brother's MFC-8500 multifunction center compares favorably with dedicated machines on the market. A fast 15-page-per-minute print time combined with 600 x 600 dpi output provides quality images with little wait time, while an 8 MB memory can up to 500 pages for out-of-paper reception. \n\nThree quick scan buttons provide plenty of convenience, while a maximum scanning resolution of 9,600 x 9,600 (interpolated) dpi provides ample quality. The fax machine is call waiting, caller ID, and distinctive-ring detection ready, has 116 auto-dial stations, and has a super-quick setting, which can scan faxes in as little as two seconds. \n\nThe copier has a multicopy function of up to 99 pages, can enlarge copies anywhere from 50 to 100 percent, and is capable of a 600 x 600 dpi output. USB and parallel port interfaces are provided for easy connectivity, while ScanSoft PaperPort and TextBridge OCR are included with the MFC-8500 to help you get the most out of your scans. \n\nEven with all these features, the best thing about this machine could be the price tag. The MFC-8500 also comes backed with a one-year limited warranty.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe MFC-8500 is a 5-in-1 commercial laser multifunction center that combines performance, connectivity, and reliability. This full-feature fax, laser printer, and convenience copier is also equipped with a 9,600 by 9,600 dpi (interpolated) resolution scanner that has three easy \"Scan-to\" buttons on the front panel, allowing users to scan directly into their applications seamlessly. PC Fax capabilities allow you to send and broadcast faxes directly. The MFC-8500 can work in most Windows and Apple applications.",
