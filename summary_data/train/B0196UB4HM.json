The most pleasant part of this new unit is how quiet it is. The LaCie made a nearly continuous rattle that was driving me nuts. The only sound the CalDigit make is a tiny \"gleep\" on occasion. It's so faint that it took me a while to figure out where it was coming from. Very pleased with this unit.",
