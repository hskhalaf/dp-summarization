I believe the lash hairs grow in cycles and now I am losing some of the lash growth, but they always come back with the use of this product. The key is to moisturize your lashes daily (coconut oil or castor oil) and remove your eye makeup gently. Also, once i have achieved the lash growth and length I drop usage to once every other day. Taking a short break in between helps to boost growth again as well.",
