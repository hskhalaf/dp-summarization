    "description": "AMAZON.COM\n\n\nKidde Radon Kit view larger  KIDDE 442020 RADON GAS DETECTION TEST KIT \n Kidde's radon test kit analyzes the amount of radon, a carcinogen, in your home with an EPA-registered facility. Radon is estimated to cause thousands of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. each year and exposure to radon in the home is responsible for an estimated 20,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Radon is a health hazard with a simple solution.\n\n HOW IT WORKS \n Place the enclosed radon sampler bag in the test location for two to three days. Then mail the radon sampler bag to Alpha Energy Laboratories in the kit's self-addressed envelope. Test results are mailed back to you by the lab. \n\n ANALYSIS FEE \n Analysis included, no additional fees to pay except New Jersey residents EPA charges $10 \n\n WHAT'S IN THE BOX \n Includes activated radon sampler tray and return mailer envelope for professional lab analysis \n\n WHAT IS RADON? \n Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water and gets into the air you breathe. Radon can be found all over the U.S. It can get into any type of building \u2014 homes, offices, and schools \u2014 and result in a high indoor radon level. But you and your family are most likely to get your greatest exposure at home, where you spend most of your time. \n\nRADON DETECTION KIT AT-A-GLANCE\n * Mail in radon test kit and analysis for residential and general use \n * Professional analysis detects cancer-causing colorless tasteless radon gas seepage \n * Meets state and Environmental Protection Agency requirements \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Kidde Radon Detector Kit allows you to quickly and accurately test for radon gas in your home or workplace. Professional Lab Analysis by an EPA-Registered Radon Testing Laboratory is included. Radon is an odorless, tasteless, invisible and radioactive gas, a natural by-product of decaying uranium. In outdoor air, radon is diluted to such low concentrations that it is usually nothing to worry about. However, once inside an enclosed space such as a home, radon can accumulate. Along with your specific test results, you will receive information on how to conduct follow up tests, as well as a detailed list of governmental agencies to contact for more information. Often the home owner can correct a problem with sealants or other products at a relatively low cost.",
