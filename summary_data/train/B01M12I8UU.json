It is of very poor quality compared to store-bought or bought from \"Michael Kors\" as the seller...these glasses were warped, disfigured (although easy enough to warp back into the right shape), and grease covered the lenses. What I received is not what I expect at all for this price point or buying a brand name such as Michael Kors. Disappointed, yet still functional and \"repairable\" - I would not recommend.",

I buy expensive glasses because I expect to use them for years. My last pair was Coach, and I used them for 6 years, only tossing because I had scratched the lenses, still fit perfect. These fall off every time I move my head, which is super frustrating. They fit fine in the beginning, just seem to have lost their shape really quick. And I'm clearly way too late for a return. Guess this one is just a loss.",

I live in FL and always need eye sun protection. These are dark enough but not too dark. I have even worn them in the pouring down rain on the highway because the brown lenses help lighten the gray dismal rain and brighten the view. Definitely worth every penny spent",
