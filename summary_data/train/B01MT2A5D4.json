There is just room between the glass and the frame to put zip ties through, which makes for great cable management.

Other than that, everything was perfect and the glass was intact and well packaged. Other reviews that say the glass was damaged is certainly due to the carrier's fault during delivery since the glass is layered with styrofoam, cardboard, and non-scratch sheets.

Otherwise it's a beautiful, sleek desk and goes perfectly in my beauty room/home office",
