It's a great amount of light to mimic the sunrise especially with the days getting shorter. The base is sturdy and the snooze button is easy to hit. Lots of features on this alarm clock. I would recommend this for everyday use and for kids to learn when it's time to get out of bed.",

I wanted a clock that emulates a sunrise; that function doesn't work as advertised. Also, the nature sounds are very cheap sounding, and the speaker sounds horrible. This clock can tell time, and has an adjustable light that has color options, but I would not recommend using this as an alarm clock. Look elsewhere.",
