After \"Reading Disk\" to went to \"Not Playable\" Tried other CDs and got the same result. Since I'm well within the one year manufacturer's warranty period I'm hoping they will stand by their product. I am raising the rating from a previous \"one\", to \"four\" since I just called Bose support and received prompt attention. They are sending me a UPS label for the return and will fix or repair the unit and extend the warranty for another year. Very satisfied.",

There is no equalizer so you cant adjust bass or treble. Dont really care for the app that works with this either. The only way this works with all of the music apps they have listed is with your phone via bluetooth, so when you get a phone call, your music stops. For 600 bucks, I expect way more. Sending this back, not happy.",

I can now connect my google phone and my ipad to the Bose via Bluethooth. works great. Now my next step is to connect my tv and im all hooked up.",

Also, SoundTouch should be able to control the cd player functions - you can see the Wave speaker - why not give the user the ability to make cds part of the whole house experience without forcing us to rip cds to a personal music library. Overall, this seems to be something of a half-baked product.",

This system replaced it and in just one day I can say I have no regrets whatever. The SoundTouch software gives me so much more versatility and mastery over my music--definitely worth the money. I waited years for a Bose system--and it was worth it.",

My teenage daughter came in the room the first day and without any instructions and within just a minute used her android phone to starting listening to Spotify through the new Bose.
