My only beef with it, albeit minor, is the brightness level of the LEDs. I keep it in a cabinet and can still see the light through the cracks, so if you are using this in a room where bright light will be a problem at night, you will either have to unplug it or put a towel/item of clothing over it. I concede that, in looking at their product pictures, the bright LED is actually a selling point.",

Also, pushing the attached pro controller around a bit results in the controller to move instead of staying put, not a real big concern, but it does make me feel like the usb-c port on the switch will get damaged if the charger manages to fall off my desk. Just a heads up, especially for those that may have kids or pets that are prone to knocking things off.",

I do wish that the color of the light without a joycon, and the fully charged would be different, just to help differentiate it more. but nonetheless, it's a great accessory",

My children (8 & 12) easily remove and attach the Joy-cons from the charging station daily. We do not use this for larger Switch controllers nor charging the Nintendo Switch, we will use the OEM charger for the base unit.",
