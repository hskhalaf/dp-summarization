I have two other Husqvarna products that I purchased within the last year and found them to be reliable and easy to start. So far, this has worked quite well. It's much lighter than the previous hedge clipper I used, and the blade is much sharper. Reminder; if you want to extend the warranty on this unit for an additional year, be sure to purchase the Husqvana premixed fuel or the motor oil at the same time you buy the unit!!!",

So much easier to use. Does much more. Smoother, more powerful, cuts much nicer. I can't believe I waited so long. My yard looks better already and in half the time. As for this specific product, it has ran really well so far. Heavier than a battery trimmer. You might need to rest your forearms more often, but it cuts really smooth. It starts up fast every time. I enjoy trimming with it, whereas trimming used to be a dreaded task.",

Starts easier than my Sthil, and has about the same power. (I think they both use the same 21.7 cc engine) So far, am very satisfied with the Husqvarna. Time will tell how it holds up.",

I have to feather the throttle for several minutes with the choke half closed to get it to run with enough RPM to engage the blades. Then if you get enough RPMs to engage do not turn it up to cut vertical; it shuts off. This is a very poor quality machine for Husqvarna to be saling. What ever happen to quality control! Do not buy this trimmer spend your money on a Poulan and at least get the job done or a Stihl if you need a serious trimmer. Again DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TRIMMER!!",
