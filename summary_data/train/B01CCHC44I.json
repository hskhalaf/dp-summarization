Downside to this crate is the latches are poor design which weve additionally secured with carabiners. And the pan doest not latch in which means she can simply push it out to get to the carpet. Ive secured the pan with sheet metal and screws. Just need a Phillips driver to remove the pan is all. Shes not been able to do anything with the bars. Shes now secure and her anxiety has gone down.",

Honestly, we didn't want to return it because it was such a pain in the ass to set up and would be a bigger pain in the ass to ship back. So, we've had to add some wrap around locks to keep him in and regularly have to tighten the screws. One positive, I really like that the bottom slides out for easy access to clean. However, the floor isn't extremely comfortable for my dog since there are gaps between the bars. I don't recommend this product.",

And YES I made sure it was as square as possible, which is hard since the holes don't line up. My dog is VERY smart and figured out how to push out the tray and ESCAPE.
