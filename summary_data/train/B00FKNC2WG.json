      "text": "I ended up with a bad patch of eczema behind my knee that was getting alarmingly worse every day. It was hot, burning, itching and driving me crazy. I tried about 6 different creams and combinations of remedies but everything just seemed to make it worse. I finally came on here and did a search for eczema creams and picked this one because of the reviews. It started having effect immediately, calming the burning and itching. I applied it twice a day, once in the morning before work and once after work. Each day it just got better and better until it cleared up completely. It took about 3-4 weeks to completely clear it up but it worked beautifully.",

First of all, let me say I used this on my hemorrhoids after trying for weeks, the OTC brand. After 1 week, not only did the pain and itching go away but it started to decrease the size of them. Then I tried this product on a blotch on my face. It has just about eliminated it. My wife has also tried it and is amazed at how well it works. It's truly worth every penny and more.",

I like that it seems to sooth irritated Eczema\u200e spots on my skin which I have had all my life , and the smell is much lighter than some tea tree products which can be over whelming. I have only used the product for a couple of days which is why I will update later. The company is very responsive and the ingredients are all natural. The container that it comes in is small enough to slip in a purse to use for hands or lip balm. It feels kind of greasy when you first apply it, but is easily absorbed into the skin.",

One night I started rubbing this into my cuticles and after about a week I noticed a huge difference! My nails don't split and my cuticles look smooth and perfect. And I don't have to keep applying all day even if my hands get wet. For me morning and night is all it takes. This is amazing stuff and I love the portability, the subtle scent, and it won't spill.",

There are many tea tree items that have an overwhelming medicinal smell. Chamuel tea tree oil balm has a perfect balance of fragrances. It's not over-powering at all. The balm takes a little bit to absorb when using on my face, but it could be due to the natural oils. I started using it to soften my hands and especially the cuticles. It absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling. I would highly recommend to others.",

The scent, suitable for males or females, disappears quickly when used on cuticles. Handy for skin breakouts, such as can happen with CPAP masks, this balm has Tea tree oil, which has an antiseptic quality, and is the fourth listed ingredient. Wheatgerm is the last listed ingredient. The balm comes in a small (just under 2.25 inch diameter) screw top, lightweight-metal can, so it is convenient and portable. This is good to have on hand for many skin conditions such as scrapes, dryness, and break-outs. The seller emails a list of several uses. Recommended.",

      "text": "I get eczema on my face and it is very frustrating. My skin becomes very dry and flaky and as a person that wears makeup it looks bad when the foundation dries up around the flaky areas. This product works very well in moisturizing the dry areas and helps reduces the itch. I just started using this product 4 days ago and can see huge results. I apply it at night before bed and in the morning as a thin layer and my makeup goes on smooth.",

Another plus is the pleasant smell and how it lasts for hours. It was an answer to my prayers!!! If you want results, buy this balm.",
