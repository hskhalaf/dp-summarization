They even suggested I take this thing to my local seamstress and see how much it would cpst to \"fix\" it..I dont have time wih a full time career and being 71/2 mo pregnan to deal! It's on heavy side even empty the walls dont breathe and the mattress/mat is thin plastic not comfy and doesnt appear safe to leave a baby in it to sleep so as a travel changing table ...maybe but without side zippers its a big heavy rectangle of uselessness and its way over priced at that",

    "description": "Travel Smart with this revolutionary travel bed! This is the ultimate travel bassinet for baby, combining a comfortable sleep with the convenience of a change station and the storage space of a small diaper bag. Mom and Dad will love a single bag for all of baby's needs on your next vacation, or even just a trip to the mall. The travel system measures 30x15.5x7.5 inches open, making it appropriate for babies 0-12 months old. The bed folds in half to close, making it easy to stow away. Lythor Baby has put a lot of work into improving the 3 in 1 Travel Bags strength and overall design and have made the bag safer to keep baby away from any potential harm. We have listened to your feedback and made changes to improve customer shopping experience. For example: Lythor has streamlined the pocket design of the travel bag to keep the bag compact but leave enough space to hold all your baby\u2019s diaper changing needs for a full days outing as requested by customers Lythor has increased the thickness of the mattress and redesigned how the fitted sheet attaches to the mattress to remove the need of Velcro connections and makes removal and cleaning of the fitted sheet easier. Unlike other suppliers, Lythor has an easily removable main strap to detach while baby is sleeping for safety. Lythor has used only the best color and durable fabric chosen for its ability to stand up to frequent folding and all day use. Lythor has also added a carabiner keyring for quick access to your keys or a baby pacifier at the suggestion of customers. If you wish to order, please select the \u201cadd to cart\u201d button at the top right of this page. Thank you for considering our Lythor Baby 3 in 1 Travel Bag!",
