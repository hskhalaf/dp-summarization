      "text": "I've owned a couple dozen or more asics running and tennis shoes (trivia - since they were called Onitsuka and made track flats) and been very satisfied. These not so much, I was hoping to play basketball in them but injured myself on first wearing. They are suede, and offer little ankle support. Arch support is okay, cushioning is sub-par. They are basically a retro fashion shoe for walking around in, not playing basketball. Too bad as I loved my last pair of asics tennis shoes and the running shoes are usually a good value and reliable.",

I am a 12.5 and a size 13 in this shoe was a good fit, so I would say this shoe is pretty true to size. I like the throwback late 1980s styling, though that might not be for everyone.",

He chose the name ASICS for his company in 1977, based on a famous Latin phrase \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,\" which, when translated, expresses the ancient ideal of \"A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.\" Taking the acronym of this phrase, ASICS was founded on the belief that the best way to create a healthy and happy lifestyle is to promote total health and fitness. Today, ASICS offers a full line of performance-driven athletic shoes and technical active sports apparel and accessories dedicated to bringing harmony to the body and soul.",
