My boots held up great in New York's record breaking blizzard on 1/22. The snow piled up, beaded up and rolled right off and my feet were bone dry. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to increase the longevity of their boots 10 fold.",

The LP applies easily when it's warm. Leave your boots somewhere very warm overnight and the LP will penetrate the leather and yield excellent water resistance.

Some people suggested running it under a hair dryer to help melt the wax but I didn't find that made much difference.

I've used mink oil in the past and I can say with certainty, this one is better.",

If you\u2019re looking to completely weatherproof your boots, I would recommend at least two applications to begin with. A useful test is to spritz some water onto the boots and see if it beads up; if not, do another application.",

I bought this as an organic, natural way to preserve the leather headband and ear cups of my Sennheiser Momentum over-ear headphones. The preservative is very easy to apply, with just the heat of your fingertip enough to liquify it, and once it sees the leather, it seeps right in. If what you're applying it to will touch your skin (like headphone ear cups), I recommend letting it sit for 1-2 days, as it gives the leather a stickiness - obviously from the tree sap in the preservative. A little bit of Obenauf's goes a LONG way, and this little 4oz vial is going to last me a number of years.",
