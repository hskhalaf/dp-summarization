Willa did not have a hair net on her pigtails when she arrived, and one seems pulled out and mussed. Her hair is completely uneven.

Don't waste your money purchase a Target version doll instead. All of our Target dolls still have their legs years later. The tears over the doll breaking have been so sad. Willa was her favorite and to break for no reason was devastating!",
