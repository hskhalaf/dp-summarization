The \"Tour Soft\" is made to be a soft-feel ball, while the NXT was a harder feel. I shot like crap for most of the season (average of 8 strokes off my handi), but then I did a lot of homework and tried the Velocity ball. Problem fixed. Titleist really made me mad with this episode.",

It is so easy to track the ball in a air, and find it in the rough, woods, etc. if you miss the fairway like me, or it\u2019s a difficult day to follow your ball. Use these.",

Thats the exact improvement I was looking for with these balls. Did not give a 5 star because they exterior is fairly soft, scuffed up fairly easily in my experience with them. Would purchase again, but cant afford to keep switching the balls out because of softness.",
