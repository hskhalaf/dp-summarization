Very light and not dense at all. Stores nicely in the refrigerator. I can store it in the freezer too, although expect it to be a bit more crumbly but that hasn't been a real issue for me.

      "text": "This is the best mix I have tried. The bread recipe on the back of package is very easy and bullet proof. I have forgotten to preheat oven, and etc. and the loaf comes out perfect anyway. I also find that the bread is not sticky and underdone inside even though I only bake it to 200 degrees internal temp. This is not true with other recipes I have tried. I have really enjoyed using it because it tastes much better that \"store bought\" gluten free bread and is just a fraction of the price. My non GF family members even like it which is saying something.",

Then the house smells AWESOME as this bakes Even non GF family members comment about the wonderful smell. I love toast every morning with this bread.
