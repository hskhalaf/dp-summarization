It is a lot of fun whenever we have people over and the tire allows us to roll it off to the side of the yard when necessary. I replaced the Voit ball with a very soft tachikara ball and use a butchers knot to tie the ball to the rope.",

I had to deflate the ball a little to soften the hits to the hands, might be best to use gloves. Definitely recommend it!",

The eye bolt is attached to the top of the pole with a nut for the tether ball to attach to. I thought it said a permanent eye was on the top of the pole. This is not permanent in my opinion. It is heavy duty and easy to install when all the pieces are included.",

We do a lot of entertaining, and children flock to this thing. We also have a big swing set and in-ground pool, so it's a nice addition. I'm not sure about some of the other reviews that say this is not sturdy. I anchored in in Cement, 2 feet deep, as recommended. It is not going anywhere! I know it will provide years of fun for us!",
