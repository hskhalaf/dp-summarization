The 4k enhancement is most noticeable on youtube UHD demos, and netflix UHD. 4k discs look better than their blu ray versions, but not astoundingly so. However standard blu rays look fabulous. Brilliant optical set up, supremely tweakable. Whisper quiet, depending on settings used. Gives out a fair bit of heat if you are sitting close to it (as I do). Superb remote, back lit, feels good in the hand. Worth the upgrade from a standard 1080 projector. I've had three previous projectors, all by Optoma, but this beats them all!",

The projector is enjoyable viewing during daylight hours, but comes I to it's full glory at night or in light controlled conditions. The unit itself is very well made, but Very large and Very heavy. Make sure you account for this when deciding its location. The lens shift function gives quite a lot of versatility in that regard. But be aware its lack of Bluetooth will mean you'll need to run at least a cable to the front sound bar or buy a Bluetooth transmitter",

      "text": "Very nice projector, great mounting flexibility with generous lens shift. The picture out of the box is wonderful without any calibration. It\u2019s quite big, so make sure you have adequate space for shelf installation. There is an annoying high pitch noise coming from the projector when displaying 4k @ 60Hz... the noise goes away at 50Hz so this is what I\u2019m using by default on my apple tv 4k for menus. Blacks are not so black, especially the upper and lower bands on cinema formats, but it\u2019s not so bad after all... i guess that\u2019s why the UB line exists and commands a higher price. All in all it\u2019s a great projector for its price.",
