One of mine came with a small stain that looks like blue marker, but the bags were not used so I didn\u2019t bother sending it back. I figured it wasn\u2019t a common occurrence. The only downside to these bags is that they are not airtight so I can\u2019t pack things like chips, crackers, dry cereal etc. the night before or they will be stale by lunch. Overall they are great. I would purchase again.",

I feel like my food stays fresher longer! I've packed apple slices which after a few hours would normally go brown, but mine have stayed crisp all day. For the price, you can't beat it. I will definitely be purchasing more for as gifts in the future.",
