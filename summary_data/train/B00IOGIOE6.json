Plus they fold down and can be put in the storage bag attached very quickly and easily. I have used many kind of high chairs but these are the best, space saving and great for travel.",

Hard to clean and clip is in stupid place with little cover tab over it that kid picks at and makes dirty, making it even harder to clean.",

I also wish it would have a net or something to catch anything that falls between the edge of the chair and the table at the front. I\u2019ve lost spoons and toys that way.

In practice, it's a total pain. With the covers, you can't fold the chair or screw it onto the table. Once it is screwed onto the table, it takes some skilled contortionist work to get the covers on particularly if you're mounting them to a booth seat.

I travel with it, I keep it in the car, I can't go anywhere without it...I've gotten many compliments, especially how quick and easy it is to set it up and take it down and slid it back in the attaches pouch! It's extremely safe and sturdy and will use it until the weight limit recommended by the manufacturer. There have been instances when we couldn't use the chair because of the lip of the table but majority of the time it fits! The bright color is amazing! I haven't needed to wash it yet but have been spot cleaning and it's held up well so far.",

My son moves constantly and he will actually sit in this long enough to eat so it must be comfortable for the kiddos. All the fabric is detachable so it's super easy to wash and then reattach.

      "text": "I love the fact that this is compact and doesn't leave a huge footprint in our dining room. It is also great that LO can eat right at the table just like Mom and Dad. It takes a lot longer to attach it to the table then I anticipated so I don't see myself taking it to restaurants with me like I had envisioned but for at home use its great. LO seems decently comfortable, she is still on the younger side but she seems to do as good sitting up in this as anything else. I do love the sleek design, the navy is great and doesn't scream \"baby.\"",

Getting the bar back through when reassembling can take a little time and patience but it's not too difficult. I would recommend.",

We brought it to her grandparents' house and it fit perfectly in our carry on luggage. We noticed a gap of an inch or so when it was attached to a square table, but the gap disappeared when we attached it to a round table, so be prepared to get the tray or have food/toys slip through the gap if you are using a square/rectangle table. Overall, I like this much more than a traditional high chair because of how compact it is and how much closer our daughter can get to the action!",
