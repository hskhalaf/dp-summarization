The cable lengths are fine and can be easily managed inside the Amplifier's volume. The 8pin ATX 12V power connector will not be used and you will only need a single PCIe modular lead.

I understand though. Sometimes, you get a defective product. I asked amazon for a return, and they got one to me in an exceptionally fast time. I was thrilled. Then the second PSU was defective as well. This was not acceptable to me. I cannot accept two defective products in a row. I will likely try other Corsair products in the future, but I CANNOT recommend this unit. Best of luck to you all.",
