The Microphone is excellent and easily as good as anything out there. With regards to sound, these cans have a lovely bass asthetic which whilst it has a wide sound stage due to the huge ear cups it has a all encompassing feel, basically it feels like your in the world. Especially on xbox one with dolby atmos enabled. I would say these are not as good as the cloud alpha 2's in terms of raw sound precision, but they are not a million miles away.",

First headset i own that feels comfortable wearing glasses. Wore them for four hours straight, once\u2014my ears did not sweat. I was unfortunate enough to receive one where bass (subwoofer) on the left earcup did not work (worked fine on the right one). Support was AMAZING at Astro. I had no problem getting a replacement fast. I am now astro fanman!",

Unfortunately the headset is really heavy and starts to become uncomfortable after about 5-10 minutes (especially when wearing glasses!). One point to note is that you have to really push the cable in when plugging it in otherwise you will only be able to hear out of one ear! The sound quality on these is terrible compared to other headsets in this price range, particulary the bass.",

My only con is there's no mic mute button at all. This is annoying for playing solo on multilayer games. Overall really solid headphones for the price!",
