I\u2019ve had other refillable toys similar to this and the inside is mostly hollow to make room for catnip. These are tightly filled with stuffing and the pouch is so tiny you can\u2019t put much in at all.",

The others filled body pockets with catnip, and were somewhat floppy. This one's body is full of polyfil and is taught and plump, and the catnip only goes into the base of the tail.",

I like the Velcro idea, but they need to have a bigger opening and less stuffing inside so you can really fill the toy with catnip. The Kong Refillable Toys are much better in this respect.",

She likes it but the gripe I have is there isn\u2019t much space in the Velcro pouch to put more than a pinch of catnip. Then it spills out if you put even a tiny bit more. Afterwards I have to clear the Velcro of the catnip to close it. So tedious and time consuming for such a simple task and cat toy. I had a refillable mouse that had 3x the space from another in-store brand. But she prefers when I divide up an old scrunchi into half and fill it with catnip. (I tie a not at both ends).",

So I was really hunting to find another one and LO! here it is on Amazon. It really seems to offer a lot of appeal for a cat, so don't hesitate to buy it.",
