Awesome condition! Comes with a little bag for you to put them away \ud83d\ude04. Super comfortable and specially when working out. When it comes to the straps they are great and stick together really well secured. I would recommend buying from Nordic. Thank you for the awesome product and the great conditions! Hope you guys keep on progressing!",

They stay on. They do not hurt to wear the. I highly recommend these!!!",
