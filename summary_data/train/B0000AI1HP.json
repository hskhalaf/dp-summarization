      "text": "This filter got the highest reviews of any of the IR filters which is why I chose it. So far the results have been good but as I am still in the \"test\" mode of doing infrared photography, I have nothing to share. Once the image is captured digitally, quite a bit of post production is required in order to end up with a satisfactory shot but; this has nothing to do with the quality of the filter itself. Unless you get the original IR image to manipulate, all is moot. Hoya delivers the goods. This filter is being used on the Fuji Finepix HS50 EXR, for those who are interested in more data.",

      "text": "It works as a 720nm high pass filter as advertised. Important note for DSLR users: factory cameras have a blocking filter around 850nm, so that wavelengths longer than 850nm will not enter the camera sensor. If this filter is used on an unmodified DSLR, nearly all the light is blocked (this is why exposure times of several seconds are needed)! This filter should be used on a camera WITHOUT a near IR blocking filter. There are other filters available that are high pass above 850nm, which may result in higher image contrast on green vegetation.",

Tripod is a must since 15 second exposure times are the norm in full sun, but the wow factor is incredible. Color photos appear as olive-tones for the sky (again, G7) and the silver/gray for the foliage. B & W is just grayscale. Very cool filter if you want to try something new. Quality tripod will help immensely with windy days. Beware of sun-flaring when shooting towards the sun as this is not a UV or polarizing type filter.",
