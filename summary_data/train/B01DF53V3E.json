I had a problem with this toaster (half the heating elements stopped working) but after writing a negative review, I was immediately contacted by customer service. They expressed concern over my problem, and immediately sent me a new toaster and a pre-paid label so I could return the old one. So despite the issue I had, B+D supports their product completely, which is pretty awesome. The toaster itself is very good. It feels a little lightweight compared to other toasters I've had, but the slots are very wide and fairly deep, so I can fit slices of homemade bread in easily. Toasting is even and it heats up pretty quick.",

So far it's been reliable and you can (just) fit a bagel in there, even a small to medium sized hamburger bun, which is convenient. Over the last year and a half the toaster has gotten pretty 'binary' with its toasting performance. Somewhere between setting 4 and 5 is 'not toasted at all' and 'charcoal-izer'. Everything above it sure-burn and everything below is 'wasting your time'. And again, the top gets frying pan hot so that it's browned like you'd expect to see from jet exhaust ports.",
