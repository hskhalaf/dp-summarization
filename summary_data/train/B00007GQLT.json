This one since it functions like a 32mm I find it is a very versatile focal length. I find it to be great in low light, vivid color, and sharp at 2.8. There is barely perceptible barrel distortion on the crop sensor camera. Overall I love this lens and would suggest it for both photography and video for a crop sensor camera.",

    "title": "Canon EF 20mm f/2.8 USM Wide-Angle Fixed Lens",
    "description": "The Canon EF 20mm f/2.8 USM is an ultra wide-angle lens for serious applications. Plus it\u2019s easy to hold and carry at 14.3 oz. (405g). A floating rear focusing system gives sharp images at all subject distances and an ultrasonic motor (USM) enables fast, smooth and quiet autofocus. Full-time manual focus override allows for precise manual focus even when in AF mode. The minimum focus distance is 9.8 inches. Filter size: 72 mm, Closest Focusing Distance: 0.8 feet.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWide-angle lenses let you capture more of the image by broadening the angle of view and increasing the depth of field, thereby bringing more of the area into focus. The lenses also provide a unique perspective by expanding the apparent distance between the foreground and the background. This Canon 20mm f/2.8 is no exception, with such additional features as a floating rear focusing system with an Ultra Sonic Motor (USM), a 0.8-foot close focusing distance, and a 94-degree diagonal angle of view. As with all Canon lenses, the 20mm lens carries a one-year warranty. \n\n Specifications\n\n\n * Focal length: 20mm \n * Maximum aperture: f/2.8 \n * Lens construction: 11 elements in 9 groups \n * Angle of view: 94 degrees \n * Focus adjustment: Rear focusing system with USM \n * Close focusing distance: 0.8 feet \n * Filter size: 72mm \n * Corresponding mounts: Canon \n * Dimensions: 3.1 inches in diameter and 2.8 inches long \n * Weight: 14.3 ounces \n * Warranty: 1 year \n\nUltra-wide-angle lens for serious applications. Easy to hold and carry at 14.3 oz. (405g). Floating rear focusing system. Sharp images are obtained at all subject distances.  The optical performance, fast f/2.8 speed and ultra-wide-angle coverage make this a great choice for many applications, like interiors, scenics, travel and photojournalism. It uses a \"floating\" optical system for excellent sharpness even at its minimum focusing distance of under 10 inches (0.25m), and with a ring-type USM and full-time manual focusing capability, offers the speed and handling pros expect. \n\n Wide and Fast\nIf you need an ultra-wide angle and a large aperture, one of the following lenses will fit the bill. Ultra-wide-angle lenses can capture scenes beyond your natural field of vision. The EF 15mm f/2.8 Fisheye, the widest of them all, has a 180\u221e angle of view. For more normal-looking wide-angle shots, there are longer wide-angle lenses up to 35mm with the maximum aperture you need.",
