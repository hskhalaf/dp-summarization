The only reason I give 4 stars is because the box was crushed on one end and all the staples securing the box were either unattached or missing. Also I was missing a bolt from the brackets which is explained in my review of them. But they do look great so I am happy. Update..Missing bolt was sent via priority mail with no problems. I am upgrading my review to 5 stars because of the great customer service from Westin.",

A styrofoam block was pulled apart to add filling in the gaps between the board and the plastic shield also to stabilize a clip which kept sliding back and fourth. Now it feels nice and solid and not producing a rattling sound. Not sure how long this product will last...this is questionable. Meanwhile I plan on enjoying my Westin Step Boards.",
