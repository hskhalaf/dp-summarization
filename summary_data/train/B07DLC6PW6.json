But in the end, buyers highly recommended it to their peers because it was comfortable to wear.",

Walking around with the back sliding down, have to sit to adjust only for it to slide down again. Touching your shoes in a hospital position means washing your hands even more than usual. Also, the wide is much looser than I\u2019m use to. For $120 I was expecting them to be flawless.",

The soft back works for me as a regular slip-on shoe because Vionics whole shoe is an orthotic & they keep my foot stable. I've been wearing them as mules in the house & they work great!",
