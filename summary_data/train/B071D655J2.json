It feels much lighter than most longboard leashes I have had. Would it be my go to leash on a huge day- well it wouldn't matter because I would be on my shortboard. So I would say if you are looking for a bit lighter LB leash (I have yet to find a comp leash) this one seems to be a bit less bulky than most.",

The joint where the cuff connects with the leash is also very large and stiff, so, since this is on your forearm, it is always getting in the way.",
