Application is patchy and streaky, so would recommend a makeup sponge over a makeup brush. The only attraction to this foundation is its price. You could possibly make this foundation work for you with the right skin care, face primer and setting spray is a must.",

Admittedly, it is not perfect in that it is still a shade too warm for my skintone. Attached is a photo on my inner arm, which is slightly darker than my face.

Mine felt like normal foundation consistency. However, i didn't receive the color i ordered. I assuming the Amazon gods felt i was more ivory than porcelain. Either way, It broke my skin out terribley in my jaw line, nose, and neck. Rather bummed out. Ill return to Neutrogena I suppose. Hope this helps someone.",
