I would highly recommend going this route.",

The 4 stars are because the o ring on the female side is very easily torn. Lasted about a month. But the hose is a over kill for the small pressure washes you get from Costco or sams club. But if you want something that's industrial quality this is it.",

I should have paid closer attention to how it attached because I needed to purchase additional parts to attach it and make it quick release. Only set me back another $10 or so. I\u2019m actually glad I had this oversight because it makes it much easier to use and store. This attaches much like an air compressor does. I was worried it would leak water but I have used it a few times and so far no leaks and a great purchase!",

It's going on my 4gpm 4,000psi comet pump pressure washer(hot) with a 13hp engine. Overall seems heavy duty and meets my every expectation. I can usually spot quality and durability as I work on things very often. I have not rated maneuverability in the above as I haven't tested on my hose reel yet.",
