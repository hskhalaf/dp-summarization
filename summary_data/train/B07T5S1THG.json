The only way I was able to install this lock is that I am very handy with these kind of things and it was a hellava challenge for me. It looks good on my door. So far the functionality works good. Only thing is that there are no sensors or anything, so if you are like me and have your door open on nice days, the lock will not sense that the door is open and will auto lock if you have that feature enabled. So you door is sitting there open with the deadbolt lock in the lock position.",

I love how classy this unit looks, no rubber buttons that will yellow or flimsy flip-pads. The set-up didn't seem too difficult (my husband did it) and the included physical keys were a definite bonus (easing my worries about what happens if the electric goes out.) We set the code as something out son can remember so I can have him open the door for me when my hands are full, which is a huge help. This also lets me go on walks around the neighborhood without needing to carry my keys, I love it.",

We have several friends that have them and the ease of leaving the house without your house key is so appealing. We installed the lock and we\u2019re very happy with how we can be free of the house key. This set does come with keys, but instead of them being on our key ring, it\u2019s hidden on our porch as a back-up for just in case. The keyless door lock works perfectly and with the app on our phone we can lock/unlock our door remotely for added security.",
