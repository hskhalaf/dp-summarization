      "text": "This Burton Backpack is great! I love the floral design. It's not too over-the-top and not too subtle either. It's unisex and goes with just about everything. I've gotten so many compliments. I'm in college so it mainly holds my laptop, pens, and some notebooks/textbooks, but even with all that I can still fit so much in here, very roomy. It holds up extremely well and after two months of heavy use still looks and feels brand new. Burton makes amazing bags and luggage and I would definitely recommend!",

It has three pockets inside, one for laptop (with a separate zipper on the side, which is my fave feature for quick access to my laptop) and one for papers or somethin. The third pocket is mesh. The outside pocket is just open- I use it to keep quick acess stuff like my work badge. Inside I use a cable organizer for electronics, makeup bag and wallet to keep it organized. Solid backpack and in my experience better than hershel.",

Unsure if this is a knock off but I don't think so which is why I'm still giving it the good review. Hopefully the warranty holds up its needed.",

I haven't put my laptop in the special pocket yet, but it'll fit fine if I need it to. There's a small zippered pocket and one bigger netted pocket. And the color!

The material used in the backpack feels durable, but the bottom seems to be made up of softer material than the sides. The backpack is made in Vietnam.

      "text": "Really wanted to love this backpack. It's very attractive but just not well-designed or durable. First of all, it doesn't have any pockets besides the one zipper pocket on the top flap and the interior laptop sleeve. This means that I have no place to organize smaller items like my phone, wallet, keys, pens, snacks, etc. I'm beyond tired of having to fish around the bottom of the bag looking for my things! But worst of all, the straps have started to rip off after only 6 months of use. Very annoyed that I'm searching for another backpack so soon after purchasing this one.",
