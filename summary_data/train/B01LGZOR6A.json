My ONLY complain is that they dont send enough of the connectors to assemble in any other configuration than what is pictured. I put 2 squares in the storage cabinets on both sides of my RV's bed in the master bedroom. It left enough of the pannels to assemble another 2 square stack for somewhere else but id need at least 4, but more like 8 more connectors. It wouldnt cost much to simply include a few more. But, small complaint for a product that does exactly what I needed it to.",
