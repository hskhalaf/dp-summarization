      "text": "I bought these for my boyfriend who skateboards regularly, due to the high reviews. He wears them as both skate shoes and regular shoes. As regular shoes, he says they are fine, but not amazing. They feel like cardboard, and aren't too comfortable. As skate shoes, these are awful. He skated them once (not very intensely) and they immediately tore. The material that goes over your toes is very thin, and thus cannot withstand someone skating them.",

But this being a skate shoe, I was about to go only a half size up but changed my mind and went a full size. Glad I did. Their 11 is actually a size 10! It's the same length as my sneaker. Toe box is the same as a 10 too. Other than the size label, it is a perfect skate shoe. Grippy on my board. Extremely comfortable without socks, nothing inside rubs. I'll update on the durability of the sole, but I'm gonna put it to the test on my longboard!",
