      "title": "OK But Average Sound",
      "text": "I had real hopes for this system, especially given the high original retail price and glowing reviews of others (for other colors). It's OK but not great. In my opinion, the sound is not tinny but also not full. The \"subwoofer\" does add a little bass but it isn't real sounding bass. My small JBL ipod speaker system sounds better. I don't like that the speakers are totally exposed when open--other similar systems have something over the driver to protect it. The 3d effect works but is pretty standard for these kind of portables. Nice unadvertised feature: it works with and charges an Iphone 4g. Worth the asked price but not much more.",

And for 30 bucks its a deal. its very nice how you can fold it up and just put it in your bag. it also comes with pouches if you're worried about scratching the surface. i did have a problem trying to doc my 4S while having an otterbox defender around it, but my other docking stations have the same problem.",

Everywhere I take it people are surprised how it puts out such a great sound in a small package. It sounds better than other most expensive units I've heard before. It's easy to use and easy to carry. It includes a small carry bag for the unit and the plug. Also it protects it from getting scratched and dirty while you carrying it in your bag. If you want great sound at a low price, get your selve one of these. You won't regret it.",

Going to take it to the Philippines and enjoy it at the many resorts that we are going to visit, it is small enough to take along and it charges the I-pod while I listen. Good product at a really fair price, I would highly recommend this to anyone. Also it will accept the I-pod touch with the protective covering on.",

Not enough volume for big crowds or party moving watching while other activity going on. The design is great for storage protection as we take it camping to listen to music. The front flips up and down to protect the speakers with storage. Great for our purposes.",
