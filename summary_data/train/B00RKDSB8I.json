It also is easy to flip it around for either left or right-handed use. The legs have sturdy, non-slip rubber pads that prevent the cane from slipping and also help prevent marring your floor.

If the Quad Cane does fall to the floor one can right it by pushing down on one of the exposed feet and it will likely pop right back up to be within your reach.",

This cane with 4 widely-spaced feet is really great! It stands easily, and fits in the car footwell when she is a passenger. We were afraid that she might kick the feet as she walked, but that hasn't been a problem. The price was really good, too.",

It will technically still work for helping get in and out of the shower (I recently injured my knee hiking) but I would not feel safe using it to walk any distance so I guess I'm stuck with crutches for a while.",
