With this tent FINALLY we can spend ALL day on beach , enjoy fresh ocean air . We kept both door down and inside tent wasn't hot at all . We got spoiled quick , never again go on beach without this tent",

The stakes that come with it are just not long enough to effectively keep it to the ground on a windy day. The frame would benefit from another flexible rod, but that could hinder the ease of breakdown and collapsibility. So I understand why it was designed as is. Sans wind, this is a great product.",
