But my Wi-Fi software reports it is N 150, the unit is a Chinese brand and manufacturer. Both units deliver on features and performance, except for the N rating, noted previously, on the first bought unit, which shows the D-Link router lives up to D-Link's words in total. Thus it's 5 star rating.",

Not only would it not stay connected but security protocols are ineffective if it is not secured by a LAN connection. Been traveling across country & have been constantly kicked off every wifi hot spot in every motel I've stayed in. Extremely disappointing as I need to make bank transactions along the way and this router has proven to be absolutely useless. I am now getting phone calls from mortgage companies, more spam than I can block, despite setting up the security protocols as soon as I hooked it up. DO NOT BUY THIS IT DOES NOT WORK!!",
