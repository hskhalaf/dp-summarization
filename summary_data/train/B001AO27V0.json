I had a decent gun for ~15 years that I got at a craft store. still have it but the control and the volume that this gun puts out is just amazing I do 10 times as much with it. I used to think I could fix everything now I really can!:) 3M I love their stuff Note: you can use either the quad glue sticks or the 2\" / 5/8\" sticks with this if you just take the quad part off. I have used it both ways. Sometimes certain glues are only available or cheaper in one format.",

The feed mechanism only operates intermittently, failing to engage and leaving me pushing the sticks in with my left hand while holding the gun in my right. I'm looking to buy a cheap import to see if they will do better. It's tough if you want to use the 3M adhesives (good stuff), but the \"correct\" gun is a piece of junk.",
