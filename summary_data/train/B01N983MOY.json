After turning red, and skin irritated, I washed it off. I then read the bad reviews and saw that others experienced the same issue. I also read others saying this isn't even organic at all and has harmful ingredients. =( definitely returning!!",

The tanner does stay on for the 5-7 days and it does fade evenly which are both good things. Definitely invest the $6 and get an application mit. The mit definitely helps it go on more evenly.

I used rubber gloves or bare hands and just had to wash 2-3 times to get from staining my hands.

Since it dries quickly you have to move quickly to avoid streaking. You also need to make sure you moisturize daily or it starts looking a little weird.

Also, I am quite sensitive to perfume-like smells, but this one didn't bother me. I woke up with the sensation, \"What is that smell?\" and my first thought was, \"Cinnamon rolls\". But nope - it was the Skinerals self-tanner I'd applied the night before.

This product looks like a real tan and I get compliments from coworkers too. The only negative if any is that it brings out your age spots and highlights them, as well as the sun that created them to begin with. I feel like a new person and have bought a second bottle as of today. Also I didn't use a mit. Instead I used a stain applicator pad from lowes, and it works quite well....",

This bronzer has nothing but good things about it: Dries IMMEDIATELY No offensive odor No streaks! It may not last as long as they say, probably only 3-4 days, however, you get so much for your money and it is so easy to apply, it is not a big deal.

I\u2019m embarrassed by how this product looks when applied bc it looks terrible & fake. From afar it looks like a good tan but up close it looks like a preschool finger paint project.
