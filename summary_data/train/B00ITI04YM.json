Either way it doesn't work, so I have two drives of 2TB each that work and no backup, which was my reason for choosing it. Also, very important, since the thunderbolt cable is integrated as part of the drive, if you damage the cable or connector you have no way to connect your drive so it becomes useless.",

I have one beef, it does not daisy chain Thunderbolt, so I can't attach another device to this. Unfortunately my other device, an older Cinema display, does not have a Thunderbolt port either. So I can only hook one or the other to my Mac Air at a time. I would give it five stars if it could daisy chain",
