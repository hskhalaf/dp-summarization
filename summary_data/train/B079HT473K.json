I have seen large dragonflies check them out while flying with my boyfriend. The downside is that the battery only lasts about 8 minutes but it is a long 8 minutes when you are flipping and shooting at a partner. Seen pretty durable though my boyfriend smashed his into something one of the first times flying and one of the guards broke off. Comes with extra parts.",

      "text": "I ended up buying two of these individual units instead of the \"combo pack\" because it was cheaper. They arrived quickly and setup was easy. They came with two canopies, so I am able to have two different colored drones. Flight control is pretty good. Altitude hold works very well. It works best on rate 1, but has two higher rates. They are very hard to control in a small room on anything but rate 1. The only bad thing about this is that one of the controller sticks gets stuck when rolling full left, but other than that, they work great. The battle part of the drones works very well too. Flight time is decent at around 4 minutes.",

One of the prop protectors has already gotten broken, but it seems to run fine without it. I wish there were fewer buttons and they were better marked on functionality.",

Very smooth & easy to fly, built tough and can handle crashes, the four \"HIT\" features are impressive. Playing time is good . played about 3 battles with some free flying as well. Now to see how well these will hold up? My only (minor)negative is the battery connection. Best if you plug it in first then slide it into the unit. Tail stub makes it hard to easily connect.",

There was not a problem with the drones identifying the other drone when facing it. You can shoot the other drone from at least 15' away. They are extremely responsive and very few adjustments are need directly out of the box. These are great for learning to fly and then having fun when a friend comes over to fly around too.",

It a great drone for a beginner and for the price. Battery Charge lasts for more than 10 minutes of flying.",

Yes it holds altitude fairly well but cannot imagine flying two together and playing game. Mine does not show any sign of laser. Maybe you have to have two for it to light up. UPDATE: The seller reached out to me based on my original review. They took care of all of my concerns and even provided a second HS177 to double my fun. The drone is fun and fast and works great which is a positive reflection on the seller.",
