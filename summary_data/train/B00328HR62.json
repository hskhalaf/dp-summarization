That's not full HD, but can be OK for YouTube, etc. I found the camera to be easy to use. And lasts pretty long on a charge. The optical zoom is only 4X. But I only use it as my backup camera.

I need an wide angle lens since I tend to take pictures of large items, offshore structures, from a short distance. It appeared this camera fit the bill and it turns out it has a wider angle view than my P50 with the wide angle attachment. Very pleased with the operation and can also use the panorama feature for those areas where I still can't get everything in one shot. Small size, good features, just what I was looking for. Very pleased.",

The picture quality is great for non-pros such as myself, and the size/weight is just amazing. I did notice some noise on indoor, low light photos, but for the price, this can't be beat.",

One thing that I really didn't like is the N-type battery - it is smaller, but it also means it doesn't last as long as a G-type. With the big LCD, this means you MUST have a spare battery or you'll run out of juice in the middle of your day. At least if you are on vacation, using this camera constantly.

Take breathtaking panoramas in Sweep panorama mode and review them on a 2.7-inch LCD. Record 720p high definition movies while Optical SteadyShot image stabilization, iAuto and Face Motion Detection makes taking great images in various conditions easy. \n\nSony Cyber-shot DSC-W350 Highlights \n\n\n\n14.1-megapixel Super HAD CCD Image Sensor\nA powerful 14.1-megapixel, 1/2.3-inch Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 14.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3+ (13x19-inch) size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots. \n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens with 4x optical zoom\nThe professional-quality Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for great outdoor, sports, and travel photos. \n\n2.7-inch Clear Photo LCD display (230k pixels)\nGenerous 2.7-inch (230K pixels) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp, natural color that makes it easy to compose shots, read menus, and view photos, even in bright sunlight. \n\nSweep Panorama mode\nReach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama Mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and ultra-wide options, the camera can take panoramic shots of up to 185 degrees. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep. \n\n\n\nHD MP4 Movie Mode\nMP4 is a popular format for high definition video that compresses the size of your audio and video, making your media files small enough to easily transfer to your compatible PC or Mac. MP4 is also highly compatible with the Web, so you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo or video-sharing Web sites like Photobucket or YouTube. (Compatible PC with internet capability required). \n\nSelf-Portrait Timer\nSelf-Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face, it triggers a 2-second timer, and then snaps a picture. \n\nBIONZ Image Processor\nThe BIONZ image processor delivers the high resolution and fast performance you expect from a Sony digital camera. Fast processing enables unique Sony features such as Sweep Panorama, Handheld Twilight, Antimotion Blur, HDR, etc to take and combine multiple images in less than a second to create wide panoramic images. Images have reduced grain and appear less washed out. \n\n\n\nIntelligent Auto Mode\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, faces, and adjusts settings resulting clear images, faces with natural skin tone and less blur. Take advantage of all the technology without leaving Auto mode. Take a picture from a kid on the playground, to landscape shots, to a beautiful flower or an indoor birthday party. All clear images without leaving auto mode. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects nine different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Portrait, Landscape and. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep. \n\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. \n\nFace Detection helps focus on the correct subject Face Detection technology\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. \n\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces. \n\nAnti-blink Function\nIt's frustrating to think you've captured that perfect shot, only to review it later and discover one of your subjects blinked just as you pressed the shutter. The Anti-blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \n\nSmile Shutter technology Smile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\nDynamic Range Optimizer Standard and Plus\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to help recover shadows and highlights. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing. \n\nIntelligent AF\nThanks to Intelligent AF technology, capture fleeting moments like a child's adorable expression with the ultra-quick AF which locks focus in as little as 0.3 seconds. \n\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode, easy-to-understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings, removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition, the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode. \n\nFunction Guide\nThis beginner-friendly optional function helps navigate through the various functions and settings displaying the description of chosen functions or settings on the LCD screen. \n\nIn-Camera Retouching Tools\nRetouch and enhance your photos on the go with in-camera Trimming, Red-Eye Correction, and Unsharp Masking functions \n\nIn-camera retouching options \n\nPHOTOMUSIC\nPHOTOMUSIC combines images with music (4 tracks, 5 minutes per track) to produce fun and entertaining slide shows with standard visual effects (Simple, Nostalgic, Active, and Stylish).
