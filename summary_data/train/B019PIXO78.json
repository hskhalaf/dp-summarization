Today, 6 months later, find that it's physically broken and is useless. I find the right side wing of lower keys don't work, including the Enter key... & that there's a visibly elevated ribbon cable loosely folded next to the \"/?\" key. (See photo) Too late to return...

When typing quickly, I often will hit the side of a key. On my built in MacBook Pro keyboard and on a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 that I paid $35 for, the keys register fine when doing this, but they don't register on this keyboard (see video). Also, often I will get a double \"m\" or a double \"r\" when typing those keys once. The form factor, however, is impressive, and the keyboard feels solid. I just wish it didn't slow down my typing the way it does.",

The reason I am deducting one star is the layout is not what I was used to, what I have used in little netbooks, which I was thinking this keyboard to be, but is not, so you have to learn the keys again. But besides that, it works perfect, it suspends after some minutes of inactivity but reactivates by pressing any key. Shuts down when you fold it and turns on when you unfold it, pretty cool. I recommend this keyboard to anyone who wants to make his phone or tablet more productive.",
