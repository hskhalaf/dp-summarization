Have to say he is the pickiest child when it comes to clothes and these QUICKLY became his favs!! Also have to say he's a little on the small side and these fit Great! Also wanna say color was as expected and where he wears them SO much I have washed them about 75 times (yes I'm Slow to review) they have held their original color and shape, altho I do not put them in the dryer. Jyst wanted to add that which for kid's clothes I think is important",

Also thinking we'd save the next size up until he grew to that size. However, the waist has very little give--almost zero stretch--and the drawstring is just decoration. It's a string sewed in at that one spot. I'm not happy. Misleading. The pants are a cool color and nice fabric, but they might as well be a fixed waist size. I would like to return them, I missed the window and I don't know how to contact the seller.",
