      "text": "Many great looking recipes for diabetics or those who just like good, healthy food. I agree with the reviewer who said many meals appeared to contain too many carbohydrates, so use judgment with how many carbs you actually eat based on your specific medical plan. The idea that 25% of a diabetic meal could be carbs is common, but probably not a good idea for everyone. For those interested in halting the progress of diabetes, I recommend THE END OF DIABETES by Dr. Joel Fuhrman.",

My only small issue with this book is because of some differences in opinion on how diabetics should eat. If you are on the super low carb side of the argument, you might find that this is too carb heavy (in terms of grains and starchy carbs). If you fall in the moderate carb camp, you will find plenty of options. Many of the recipes could be easily adapted to a lower carb lifestyle. I will use this a lot.",

There are some great options for breakfast here. I enjoyed the Fatoush salad and several chicken dishes, but the mushroom meat loaf was labor-intensive and not that great, especially as leftovers.
