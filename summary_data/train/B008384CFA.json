      "text": "It's just a k-5 with cheaper case, without the top LCD panel. But it retains its best qualities: an incredible sensor, the weather resistant properties and a fantastic viewfinder. On the plus side, it can be powered with 4 AA batteries with a non included accesory. I bought the Maksina brand one which just does the job. The only flaw I found so far, a minor one, is that the memory card isn't too easy to extract, due to the rubber sealing of its compartment.",

      "text": "This is a fairly compact camera for a fully featured DSLR with a specification much higher than its price point. It has an excellent 16mpx sensor with good high ISO capability. It is weather sealed and has a large bright viewfinder giving 100% coverage. It has two control wheels and good ergonomics. The controls are configurable and really yield little to its big brothers the K-5II and K-5IIs. It is an ideal camera for still photography. Although it has competent video facilities it is not really designed for the keen videographer as it lacks a dedicated video button and HDMI output.",

Maybe the best deal of 2012 for me when i purchased it for \u00a3369. It has an amazing construction quality and good grip, image quality is one of the best out there at this price range.",

Performance wise is superior in every way great low light and a nice touch is that with the K-10 the generic lenses did not focus true, with the k-30 the fine adjustment is very easy to use and the lenses focus accurately. I would highly recomend this camera as an upgrade from the K10",

Since the Pentax brand is not as strong as Canon or Nikon you get much more for your money than you would with these other brands and the quality of the camera is on par with them as well for a relative novice like myself. The look and feel of the camera is really good, quality of pictures excellent, easy to use with a relatively simple user manual. Unless you're going pro right from the start, this is a great camera to start with. One other key advantage is the availability and low price of second-hand Pentax lenses.",
