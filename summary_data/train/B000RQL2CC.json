      "text": "Bought this product for nursing school. I have a littmann but since our stethoscopes tend to \"walk off\" I didn't want to risk a $100 scope disappearing on me. I bought this for a cheaper substitute and I must say I am IMPRESSED. The sound is almost equal to my Littmann, very comfortable to wear especially in my ears, I can hear breath sounds, and rhythm in heavier patients with ease. I would definitely reccomend this for nursing or med students, or anyone that needs a quick replacement (you might fall in love). Plus free parts for life and a life time warranty? Who can beat that?!",

I can hear SO much better with this one! At least 5 other coworkers have also recently purchased one because we love ours so much! Highly recommend! Lots of different color combos, hearing quality is next level and let's not forget the price is awesome as well!",

      "text": "So far I have used this stethoscope for a week at work. It works better than my Littman does. I can hear lungs a lot better. Even on people with a little more cushion. It is a little heavier and stiffer than the Littman, but well worth dealing with considering I can hear better. I had a Dr. use it after intubating someone and he was impressed with it's sound quality.",

    "description": "Color:All BlackHandcrafted Since 1971 | Lifetime Warranty | Free-Parts-for-Life Program | Latex Free Constructed from acoustically-superior stainless steel, the MDF MD One Stethoscope delivers accurate auscultation of heart, lung, and Korotkoff sounds with acoustic integrity and clarity. An ergonomic design ensures comfort for the doctor and patient, even during extended use. The MD One is a premier diagnostic instrument with unmatched performance, durability, and aesthetics. Chestpiece: The handcrafted stainless steel dual-head chestpiece is precisely machined and hand polished for the highest performance and durability. The full-rotation acoustic valve stem with green indicator dot allows the user to easily identify the active sound channel and seals in sound. Acoustic Tubing: Constructed of thicker, denser, latex-free PVC, the Y-configuration non-stick acoustic tubing provides insulation for superior sound transmission and seals out ambient noise while preventing the cracking and wearing that can occur from repeated use. The longer-than-average length allows a comfortable space between health professional and patient. Acoustic Pyramid Chamber: A patented internal metal-alloy chamber located in the acoustic tubing below the spring keeps the tubing channel open for maximum sound transmission into the headset. ErgonoMax Headset:Hand polished, pre-angled stainless steel headset features a patented internal dual-leaf spring construction for durability and custom fit. Soft silicone ComfortSeal eartips (available in standard and small sizes) are clear for hygienic purposes and conform to the ear to seal out extraneous noise while ensuring comfort during extended use. Patented SafetyLock eartip adaptors lead the industry in user safety. Included Accessories: 2 extra sets ComfortSeal eartips, spare ultrasensitive diaphragm, and ID tag.",
