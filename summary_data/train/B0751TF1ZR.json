      "text": "We added this to a wall mounted 48\u201d TV in our kitchen area. The sound from the TV\u2019s speakers made it difficult to follow dialogue across the room. The addition of this sound bar has greatly improved the clarity and quality of the sound. It was easy to mount to the wall and connect it to the TV via an optical cable. I also programmed my cable/TV remote to operate the volume. Overall the performance from this sound bar is impressive. The bass is more than sufficient for our purpose.",

I have it connected to a 55 inch Sony Bravia via optical line and at first the sound quality was only marginally better than the TV. Once I turned on the surround sound the room was filled with sound coming from front, left, right and surprising from behind. It claims to have an internal subwoofer and it does okay, for a sound bar but still lacking for my preference. I have a Polk sub connected to the TV via the headphone connection for true room shaking bass. After some volume adjustments I am very happy with the Klipsch RSB-3 sound bar.",
