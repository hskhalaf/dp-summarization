My son loves it and it is a great way for him to burn off energy. We used it outside in the summer, but also inflated it in our garage in the winter. The kids ranging from age 3-6 had a blast. Things got a little rowdy so my husband ziptied the side door shut so the kids wouldn't jump out on the cement floor in our garage. Several family members have commented on what a wonderful purchase this is!",
