I am hoping with practice I become more proficient because right now I\u2019m not saving any time or energy by using this instead of an iron. I will say, for items that were left in the bottom of a basket or for pressing cargo pants/uniform shirts, this has been great for getting the pocket flaps flattened.",

It is a learning process but I can now do a button down shirt in just a few minutes and they look like I sent them to the cleaners. As a bonus, I now press my cloth napkins, table and handkerchiefs. It is so easy and why not. Amazing difference. I now press my work shirts. Like me, you will probably find many uses.",

      "text": "I use this to press iron-on interfacing on fabric. It works great - i have a very nice finished product. There are a few drawbacks about the product... It takes a long time to heat up and re-heat between cycles. Some times over two minutes to reheat. So you press one part of your fabric and have to wait two minutes to be able to press again. The \"throat\" or neck is shallow. In other words if you are pressing something large it gets bunched up between the presser and the arm base.",
