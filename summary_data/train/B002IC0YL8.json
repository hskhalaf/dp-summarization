In addition, I can't believe they get away with saying the swollen battery issue is normal! Once they swell, they are nearly impossible to remove without breaking the remote. I have one (different model) that broke the battery door clips off because the batter swelled so much! That's \"normal\"?",

It may be a fundamental problem with devices using \"toggle off-on\", because components inevitably get out of sync and one needs to work their front panels manually.

You can do a lot with what they call \"Activities\" but there are times when you would like to specifically identified a series of commands for one or more devices and this remote can not do that. Technically I'm sure it is capable of it but for some reason, Logitech has opted not to enable it in this version of the remote.",

If something isnt working the remote walks you through a series of troubleshooting problems or gives you the option of fixing it yourself. It's really easy. 3. It's rechargeable.

Bottom of remote is curved, so it's \"impossible\" to press any button if the remote is on a hard flat surface. Range is greatly inferior to the 890, but should be acceptable for most applications. I love the design... button spacing is very good, and every button operates perfectly with one push (my 890 is finicky in this regard). I also love that the remote extender doesn't have to be PC synced anymore. I highly recommend the Harmony 900. My 890 battery immediately swelled (pregnant!), but so far, the 900 battery has retained its shape.",

I've been using IR repeaters for years, and they've been inconsistent and slow. This remote completely solves the problem. Every click is \"heard\", and the equipment responds much faster than with the IR repeaters. One minor annoyance: if the cabinet doors are open, the two IR signals arriving via different paths confuse the equipment. With this repeater the doors must always be closed.

If I had purchased this one initially, I would not have bought a 2nd one. We were thinking to buy same for our other TV/bluray/DVR, but will not based on our current experience.",

      "text": "I was extremely disappointed in this device. The RF range was barely 20 ft in a normal house environment. Logitech is completely unresponsive. If you want to be able to control your home TV from another room, this device is not the answer. They claim they tested it for 100' but that was line-of-sight in an open room. Hell, you could do that with an IR-only device. Since receivers are very simple, it means they scrimped on the power of the transmitter - probably to extend battery life. It is much simpler to program than other remotes and has a vast library of supported TV, amplifiers, etc. VERY disappointing..",

The only reason I didn't give this remote five stars was because it came with a install disc that was outdated. Once I downloaded the current software from Logitech's website, set-up went well and I'm now loving the 900 too!",

Bought a second remote (first one died after a couple of years - screen was going weird) so ended up with second base station + receivers. Set both base stations/receivers up so would have coverage across the width of the cabinet where all my gear is stored. Thought this might resolve issues where RF would fail (cross symbol shown on remote) but still get the odd failure... Would have gone with another option if I hadn't spent ages getting it working with my MediaPortal installation.",

That being said, customer support wanted to give any excuse in the book why the RF signal was intermittent to none, including \"cordless phones, baby monitors, wireless routers and even treadmills\". I hope that this will save you some of the headache that I had. Not to mention the 4hrs on the phone with their \"wonderful\" customer support.",
