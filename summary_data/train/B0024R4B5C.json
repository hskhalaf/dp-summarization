I wanted to put an outdoor antenna up, in the hopes of getting more channels and stronger signals, so I bought this RCA Outdoor Yagi. Before putting the RCA antenna up outside, I replaced the indoor antenna with the yagi, and put it at the exact same location I have the indoor antenna. I got zero channels with it. Hard to believe, but this thing did absolutely nothing. My TV doesn't even acknowledge it is there. Not a good product, so back it goes.",

I bought this antenna hoping it would do better than the window unit I had but that\u2019s not the case. Don\u2019t waste your money.

The wires that connect to the antenna seemed very cheaply made and wouldn't ya know, after I installed it, it picked up channels for an hour and then tv went blank. I looked at the antenna and the wire broke off. I am a a very technical person so I installed two new connectors and tried to reinstall and once again, the piece broke off. The wires that come out of the splitter are way too thin. They simply break off. I was very dissapointed.",

Ladder up to roof, (age 65 now) inspect antenna, come to find out the OLD style flat lead connection to the antenna was broken one one wire. It is a short pigtail converter from coax to flat lead. True I can get another for around 3 to 5 bucks. However it's just not worth the climb on the roof anymore, for a minor item which shouldn't even extis on modern antenna's anymore. I replaced the whole antenna with a clearview 4 , yes more expensive... but no weak link. I get the same channels as before as well.",

I did have an indoor antenna with a booster and only received half the stations I receive now, many with less clarity. Dump the dish, especially if you mostly need local stations.

The best buys antenna came already with an amplifier. This one you have to buy your ownn seperately. The extra channels though were mostly foreign and home shopping channels.",
