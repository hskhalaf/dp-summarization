Chicken alfredo and linguini, it wasn't perfect but that was my fault not putting enough seasoning in it ,but otherwise, being able to watch the meal cook as it was going because of the clear dome was great.My only problem was the package was supposed to include a free white recipe book but it was not in the box.If you could please send me the cookbook it would be greatly appreciated.THANK YOU! john kondrich",

But simple stopping and turning once or twice manually works easily. I have had other similar auto stir fry machines and they all suffer from this.

Secondly, the stirring blade would keep things from sticking on the bottom, but it would not mix the food in the pan. What was on the bottom, stayed on the bottom not allowing the food to cook evenly. This is a good idea but still needs some work.",

Eventually the front panel stopped working correctly and then the entire cooker went dead in the middle of preparing a meal. This was after using it only four times.

The pot had a very strong chemical smell the first few times we used it. We contacted customer service and tried their suggestion of soaking the pan in hot boiled apple cider vinegar. After a few times, the smell was less but I can still taste something different in the food. So after about 10 tries, we gave up and decided to return the item. Better safe than sorry.",
