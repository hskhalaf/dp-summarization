I remember my parents had box fans that would blow themselves over on medium, and on high would circulate air throughout the house! This thing, can't even blow paper off my counter at a few feet.",

It\u2019s placed weirdly in the top corner in the back... NOT easy to take apart and clean. The cheaper fans you can easily unscrew a couple places and remove the back.... this one you unscrew a couple pieces and fight for the pieces to come apart.

A gust of wind passed by and the fan blew itself backwards off the sill and hit the carpet, breaking one of the blades. $30 out the window after only a couple days of use :(",
