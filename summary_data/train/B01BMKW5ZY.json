But all beverages are great in these mugs. You can use ice in them and when you do the ice does not melt and water down your beverage. The other thing I find these mugs are great for are ice cream floats! Now that I have them I wouldn't want to live without them. \ud83d\udc9c...sadly, 3 months later after using them everyday, both of them have cracked! A great product for a very limited time!! 2 stars",

The trivet stuck to it. When I looked closely, I saw that the seam down the side had split open and the wetness on the trivet was the gel leaking out. It's not a lot of money, but it's mine and I don't like giving it away when I thought I was getting a decent product in return. Into the trash it will go. Caveat emptor!!",

I hope these mugs can last half that long but that's a lot to ask. I've always had mugs that held 15 oz, and now I strongly prefer these with 22 oz capacity. Cheers!",
