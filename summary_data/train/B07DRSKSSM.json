      "text": "Just tried out the Brooks Revel 2 and the Aonije 2ltr Hydration Pack. Trainer's: felt light and good cushioned suppot on the heel. I tend to be heavy on the heel so these felt really nice. Surface ran on was road and pavement. Condition was wet and the grip was good, didn't feel like I was going to slip going round corners. Size are a medium width and went a size up. Enough room for swelling but not too much to cause rubbing All in all, great low-mid price item",

They arrived Wednesday, I wore them around the house until Saturday and then Sunday got a half-marathon PB in them. Very comfortable, lots of support. I buy them one size larger than my regular work shoes and the fit is perfect allowing some space for when your feet swell in a long run.",

I wore Brooks years ago and had forgotten just how good they are. I normally wear a size 9, but ordered a 9.5 which was just right. I have now bought another pair of Brooks the GTS19 Adrenaline and they are even better than the Revel 2, but are more expensive.",
