I have sensitive skin but I have been gradually upping the percentage of retinol in my products through the year so have had no reaction. I would NOT recommend this product who has never used retinol and is looking for a \"quick fix\" thinking that more is better. There are two things I have learned - make sure your face is completely dry before applying and let your skin get used to the product before going at it full on. Otherwise, you end up with skin that looks and feels like you have been sitting out in the sun for 18 hours.",

This is a strong retinal formula, so use with caution if you have sensitive skin. I will continue to use this product as it is well worth the price.",

Now, it is strong, so if you have never used retinol before, start with a smaller concentration (such as SR Luna Oil) because it can dry your skin out if you aren\u2019t used to it. With that in mind, A+ is so smooth and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. It has really done wonders to reduce fine wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.
