What im LIVID about is that I ordered the queen frame & there are \"queen\" stickers all over the frame indicating it is for a queen sized bed, but my queen box spring does not fit. The frame is not wide enough. Do you know how much energy I put into putting that stupid frame together at almost 30 weeks pregnant? And in order to get a refund its expected to take it apart and ship it back? Ridiculous. I do not recommend and I'm really curious to know how all these people with good reviews got their bed to fit.",

It was very easy to put together, however the first frame I ordered had a bad spot weld. Amazon was great in sending out a new frame, but it was very inconvenient to tear down my Select Comfort air mattress, disassemble the bad frame, reassemble the new one and put everything back together. Not to mention the new frame had a bent rail that needed straightening. Also, good luck fitting a defective frame back into the original box without tearing up the cardboard. Make sure you check all the spot welds before assembly!",

After deciding the new one wasn't necessary, I started the return process. I then learned it was going to be almost $17 to ship back. I decided rather than lose almost half the cost of the bed to just keep it. It took about 40 minutes to build, and so far works as intended. I reached out the the company and suggested to better advertise the return fee. I assumed with it being a prime item the return wouldn't force me to eat part of the cost.",

We bought it as a set together with the Zinus Victor 4\" mattress foundation - another excellent product! The frame and foundation together were 11\" tall, which worked well for us. So glad we found this on Amazon!",

If you're using it for sleep and lounging, and maybe some light activity, it works fine. Not recommended for jumping on the bed, or throwing yourself on the bed, or for very active consenting adults performing some vigorous activity. The price and convenience is well worth it.",
