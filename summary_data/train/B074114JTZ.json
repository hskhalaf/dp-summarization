In Texas the weather is very dry and high humidity, so I have a solution. It's super small I can put it on the desk and my room. The material surprised me because at first glance it seemed like a toy \ud83d\ude33 I thought it wouldn't work but I was wrong. In my opinion it is not loud and lasts a long time.

      "text": "This does put out visible mist; however, the light makes it unsuitable for night use. I have it in my office for winter when the heat is drying out the air. It mostly puts mist up that falls right back down. I'm not sure how well it can be working to \"humidify\" the area given how much water falls right down. It is a cute idea, and it is definitely portable, but it would be better without a light.",

Keep in mind that this unit is very small and would work best to keep on your desk or right next to your pillow. It probably won't make a dent in an actual room.",
