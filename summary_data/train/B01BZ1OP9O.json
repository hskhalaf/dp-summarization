I can't say I've used it on my face for acne as many do but you can tell it's of quality, pure and unrefined. I gave it 4 stars since, while I like the concept of the bottle design, the pump can be stubborn and doesn't allow much control of how much oil you'd like to use at once. Since jojoba doesn't oxidize as easily as other oils, the brand could consider going back to a dropper. Although, since 4 oz bottles and droppers seem to be faulty, they should consider selling smaller portions so the droppers don't break as easily in the packaging.",

I just rub a few drops in my hands and distribute it through my hair with a concentration on the ends before I wash my hair and use cream rinse as I always do. This oil leaves a natural protectant on the hair so it tolerates a quick blow dry extremely well and comes out soft and manageable.",
