      "text": "I don\u2019t what the big thing is with these headphones, but the sound is nowhere near the Sennheiser open backed ones at half the price! They suck to your head and I had a headache after an hour. I had to take them off and swapped them back to my Sennheiser\u2019s .....there is no comparison. Unfortunately I cannot send these back as it\u2019s too late ....but please don\u2019t waste your money. I\u2019m going to have to sell them privately now. They are just awful. Sound was so low and it was full up. Horrible headset. Sennheiser all the way!",

This is the best quality of sound in closed headphones you can get anywhere in that price range, or even for 300 euro. This is not your standard overpriced garbage branded as gaming, these are just great headphones for everything. Only downside, the cushions aren't the best, but they are good. (and you can always replace them)",

      "text": "Used for Call of Duty - sound is staggeringly detailed, way better than my Sennheiser Gaming headset (both paired with an Astro Mixamp Pro). However the closed back made it almost impossible to hear my own voice when talking into the microphone and couldn't hear the wife's either (which made her rather unhappy). Furthermore the microphone appeared to fail after a few days so returned them. Maybe I just had a dud pair, but I'm going to have to think hard about whether I want to trade off stunning sound for an inability to hear my own voice.",

      "text": "Short review, i don't believe in wasting time. 1) How do they sound? Like a pair of DT770 but have a wider soundstage, so sound great. 2) Are they comfy? NO! They basically press on your upper jaw and can cause pain after an hour or so. 3) Any Issues? The cables are terrible, the mute switch makes an auditable click down the mic, the volume pot is channel inconsistent and the microphone is loose and not secure in the rotary hinge. I sent them back as at this price i could have gone DT770/990 with a modmic or standalone and had a much better QC expedience.",

The sound quality is good enough, definitely not the best I've heard, I'd say its on par with the custom one pro. My only issue is if the cable breaks it doesn't look like you could replace it with a normal cable and replacements will probally cost alot. Most headsets usually die around the little in line controller so I hope this one lasts abit longer.",
