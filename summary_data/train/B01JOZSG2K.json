      "text": "The oven works alright, but the 'bake' mode has a big overshoot problem. On the initial heat-up, it will overshoot the requested temperature by as much as 100% (I measured as high as 500F when I set the oven to bake at 250F). After this initial overshoot and cool down, the oven does a reasonable job maintaining the requested temperature (it's a simple hysteresis controller. The hysteresis amount seems to be about +/-10 degrees F). This initial overshoot is probably tolerable for most food uses. However I am using this oven to reflow solder PCBs, so the overshoot is quite annoying.",
