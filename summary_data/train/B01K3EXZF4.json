      "text": "I bought a Cricut- then realized that an iron just won't do when it comes to HTV. So I went searching for a heat press. Can't beat the price on this one. It's really easy to use, works wonderfully. The hardest part was finding the right outlet in my house to use that didn't have anything else plugged into it because it does need 15-20. That said, once I got it up and running it was extremely simple to use and I've done everything from XXXL T-shirts to tiny dog shirts with this. I would suggest this heat press to anyone.",

You will have to move the item around to make sure the entire image is pressed (if your image is really large). The only issue I have is locking the handle into place. It takes everything I got to lock the handle down. That\u2019s why I give it an overall three stars.",
