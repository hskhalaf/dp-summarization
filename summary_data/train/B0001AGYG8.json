We have used them on both lakes and class ll rivers,they are very, very stable and maneuverable ,added trolling motors and use kayak paddles instead of oars. Easy assembly and breakdown.Taking them East this year to paddle 10 more states in our quest to paddle all 50 before we are too old and these boats We believe will get us there.",

Motor mount gets an electric trolling motor on board, but reaching the motor is a literal pain and steering the boat with the motor on is really bad. I am now trying to mount the motor in the front for easier access and improved steering. All things considered, much less expensive than a fishing Kayak and I would make the same purchase decision because of the value. Please also note that manuverability would likely be acceptable with the provided oars. The craft does get blown around a not insignificant amount.",

Use a standard swivel, cut off the bolts on the seat to fit and attach the seat with the wingnuts. Then as another reviewer said use carriage bolts to attach the assembly to the rails and knurled knobs to make everything easily adjustable. I used 1 1/2\" 1/4\" carriage bolts and these knobs:",

      "text": "Fantastic boat! I bought the smaller red classic earlier and enjoyed it so much, but alone. So I upgraded a bit and bought this larger one for myself and gave my wife the first. Both boats are so much better built than the competions in the bigger sporting goods stores that I am totally pleased with the craftsmanship and know we will get many happy fishing seasons from them. This Colorado is setup for a motor, so that will be the next addition. I hardily recommend this one for the larger guy. I'm six one and 240 and this boat fits me comfortably. My advice, BUY IT!",

      "text": "As a senior, I had difficulty staying bent over for the long periods required to do all the strapping. I also felt the strap ends could have allowed more room at the buckles in order to slip the straps through. Once assembled, it was fun on the water. Very stable, though your feet will almost always be dragging in the water. You will not need a trolling motor with more thrust than 30. Steering the boat with the motor was really hard. It would have been better to have the motor in the front pulling the boat rather than pushing it. Frankly, after a few uses, I sold the boat - again because of my age and restricted abilities.",

One Down fault I give is the Oars and the position of the oars. It is difficult to get into a pattern and when encounter heavy win it is tough to maneuver. Other than that this unit is superb and I recommend it to us in lakes and ponds where the wakes and win are not rough, if not be ready for a hard upper body workout.",
