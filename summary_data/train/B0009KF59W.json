It has some grip to it and definitely does not \"slide\" off your hands. Doesn't have any weird lumps when its fully pumped and just a great out door ball in general. My only con with this is that it does not perform well indoor. It might have been the ball that i got, but the grooves in the ball are a bit rough.",

I like the feel and texture of its composite leather... grippy enough without being over-grippy like a rubber material would be. The ball did need to be inflated when it arrived but that\u2019s simple and easy. The Problem became that the ball shipped with a bad/leaking air valve. So I\u2019m planning to replace that myself now. A Valve Kit cost $16 on amazon so the $19 ball now costs $35 to use properly. Went from being a deal to just a normal cost item I have to wait to use, for the second time, instead of buying at the store and using the same day.",

When indoor she always uses her Wilson Evolution (which is 100 ties better than this ball, but also costs significantly more and almost never goes on sale) but now, during the corona pandemic, all practices and games are outdoor for safety reasons and the outdoor surface would completely destroy the Evolution's leather very quickly. This ball is perfect for these outdoor practices. Its material is nice enough to play (it's not soft and tacky like the Evolution, but it also doesn't feel nasty like the $8-$15 rubber basketballs) but sturdy enough to withstand dribbling on a blacktop surface.",
