They break very easily so they must be handled very gingerly. Also, they do not stand up well in thunderstorms. High winds can damage them. Also, after rotating the antenna to get the best picture, the antenna will rotate off station during a moderate wind. If the antenna did not break so easily, and it locked in place after steering the antenna to desired stations, it would be a very good product. As it is, it is just mediocre.",

The amplifier inside the antenna is resilient against close RF transmitters that would overload most amplifiers. Still working great and bringing a great signal to our televison.",
