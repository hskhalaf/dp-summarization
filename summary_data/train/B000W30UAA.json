My son loves this pellet pistol but it was to hard for him operate. So what I did was drill a hole in the face of the piston with a small! small! step drill. Untill he could operate it. This drops the compression down and also lowers the power of the gun. But it's just for paper so we aren't worried about. It's easy to operate now and is a great trainer with a good trigger for smaller beginner shooters.",

No recoil, decent power (400 fps with a 7.9 grain Crosman Premier Hollow Point pellet), light, predictable trigger, and superb accuracy are the main traits of this airgun.

With this, I advise on a snug fitting leather glove, at least for the hand used to compress the pneumatic. 2: add a pellet pen to your order. The loading area is very occward.

The \"diffuser\" they created by tucking the barrel in and porting the frame does nothing to help the accuracy of a gun of this power level. But, an inch of barrel could add a smidge more velocity, which is crucial in drag stabilized projectiles -pellets. I mainly use it for plinking and target-which it was designed for and it does this as well as some $200-$400 guns of the same design from other companies. You will never find a more accurate pistol for about $30.",

Nice, cold weather gun which doesn't suffer from low temperatures like a CO2 powered pistol would. Looks very good, Had good workmanship and is quite accurate. A lot of value for the money.",

I have a few co2 pistols and a multi pump pneumatic pistol and find myself reaching for the p17 the most frequently for its ease of use and accuracy. Trigger breaks cleanly and has the ability to be dry fired to practice technique. All in all a wonderful little pistol.",
