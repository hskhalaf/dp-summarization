Winter usually gifts me with a cold or three over the course of the season, and so far the occasional bath with this soak has helped keep me cold-free. The tea tree oil in this also really helps to keep your skin nice and soft, which can sometimes be an issue when you live in the frigid northeast. Awesome buy, will definitely be enrolling in the recurring delivery option!",
