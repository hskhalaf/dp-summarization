I was extremely surprised and disappointed and knowing this, I also would NOT BUY important infant items from amazon going forward. BUYERS BEWARE!!!",

After trying both, I decided to keep the (warmer) cotton version, because I'd rather us both be a little warm but way more comfortable, than feel uncomfortable (hard and scratchy) with more airflow.",

I am average height and slender. I went with the Onya carrier since the straps are wider, less bulky, and can be crossed in the back. I cannot reach the back clasp, so I need to be able to cross the straps or they will fall off. This carrier will probably work if you are tall and have wide shoulders. But don't order the Open Box. It also smelled really bad when it was opened. The Onya didn't have a bad/strong smell.",

We ended up going for the normal Ergobaby Carrier (360) because I think these are the best made and highest quality carriers out there, but definitely just make sure the mesh is a good fit for your little one.

This causes problems when you would like to do things at home or out and about and don't have anyone there to assist you with it. Otherwise, I love, love this carrier.

      "text": "We tried all of the major brands and several Ergobaby carriers and this was the best for us. The fabric is comfy and breathable for baby and the baby can move from rear facing to forward facing and it can be worn on the back. Other carriers were not as breathable or the fabric mesh fabric was not as soft. The only issue with the carrier is there is no pocket or else I would have given it 5 stars.",

It\u2019s easy to use, it\u2019s sturdy, and I love that I can wear it and then we can adjust it and my husband can wear it. I\u2019m really glad we can use it for a long time, too, since it carries in several positions and for up to 30+ pounds.",

She's now almost 10 months and 20 lbs...and THIS IS definitely one of the best decisions we've made. We prefer the mesh because it breathes. It's also more convenient than the cotton one because it DOES NOT have the noisy Velcro that other complained about. Now...if we're talking about noisy velcro, it's probably not bad. But, the Ergobaby 360 MESH does not have the velcro. It's an easy buckle that snaps together. Definitely lets the baby sit a little lower on you and provides EXCELLENT support for hours.
