Love the 4G of memory as that helps me keep 12 tabs open at once while still surfing the net! Coming from Windows 8 and using Chrome OS has been a pleasure! Also a long battery life and low res screen has been a plus!",

I keep in my bedroom to read emails, browse the web, etc. Some annoyances are the lack of Skype and other Windows software, although there is a Skype web beta now. I agree with others that you could use your Office 365 account to use the web-based MS products, but they lack all features. I am also an avid PC gamer so will always need a Windows machine. I would not use it as my primary. That being said, this is a great product, lots of power and features for what it was designed to do.",
