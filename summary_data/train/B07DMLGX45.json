      "text": "The pros: wide enough for an adult head, fun colors. The cons: these must have lots of nickel (the metal) mixed into the plastic, as I have a nickel allergy and these gave me the telltale rash where they touched my nose/cheeks. This has never happened to me with plastic, only with actual metal. Also, while the description online says they have UV protection, the packaging does not mention that at all, so it may be a false claim. Finally, they are very flimsy.",
