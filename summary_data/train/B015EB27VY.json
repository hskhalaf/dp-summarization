By the way it would't hurt to have some wavy strands, why is this a privilege only brunettes have? It looks like all blond dolls of this line have the same issue, others have mentioned it as well. I've noticed that brown and black haired dolls have thicker rooting. I guess I will have to throw away her head, I am not a fan of her tiny lips either. So far the blue top brown hair is my favorite!",
