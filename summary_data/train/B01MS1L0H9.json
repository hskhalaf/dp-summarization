When trying to assemble and attach the cord, the part you plug in to the back of the machine was sunk into the machine and could not be retrieved. I had to take the machine apart to push the plug through so I could connect it. If we ever unplug it again from the back of the machine I will have to take it apart it again. It works great but I'm not happy with the plug situation.",

There are two temp controls one for front and one for back. Only gripe, to clean rollers requires that you leave on, and temp control to very low to wipe off.",
