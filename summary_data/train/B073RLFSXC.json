It was energy efficient and if the bottom shelf was a little close to frozen to keep the rest of the refrigerator at the right temperature, I could almost treat that like a feature, not a bug. Unfortunately, in the past I always trusted Kenmore appliances to be durable and this was not. After two years, the fan motor broke and I have been waiting for weeks for the backordered part to arrive from Sears with no estimate as to when it will actually arrive. I will not buy Kenmore again.",

Delivery team also was early, I got a phone call letting me know they were ahead of schedule. I like that! Normally I would get stuck waiting for a delivery well past the intended time with other providers or big box stores. Refrigerator works great, and looks good too. Nothing too fancy, it does it\u2019s job and I couldn\u2019t be happier!",

It worked great for a year and four months, then started to frost up in the freezer, and things were freezing in the fridge (yes I was adjusting the temp control and fan speed). Then the fan in the freezer was shut down by ice build up, while the fridge compressor failed. The temp in the freezer was always cold even with no fan, but the fridge was cool only by heat conduction with the upper freezer. I would buy this again (if available) but with the extended warranty.",

The interior lighting is fine, although my unit does not have lighting in the freezer section. (I see other questions about this feature.) It's really not a deal-breaker or even an issue for me. Unit seems quiet, and the shelves are easy to adjust. Setup team did a great job. Very professional, prompt and courteous.",
