It is pricey, but I figure I can get a whole jar full of facials, which are nearly as good as some I've had at the spa, for about half the cost of one spa facial. The product smells and feels great and leaves my face smooth and refreshed. I also like that it doesn't take forever if you don't want it to. It is particularly great to use in the dry winter months as it scrubs away dull winter skin and leaves your skin soft and plump.",
