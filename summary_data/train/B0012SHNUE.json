Read on to see why my rating may change in the future: I have used this BioKleen oxygen bleach for several years and it does a good job, for what it is. It is not the toxic chlorine bleach that \"really\" whitens clothes, but BioKleen products have been my main choice for non toxic cleaning products. However, now that the company has been sold to a larger company I do not know if I will continue to use their products. I will be watching the ingredients very carefully from now on to see if the new owners maintain the quality and the ingredients. If not, I will change brands.",
