My kids are 2 and 3. They don't want to hold still for long, they want to play. 15 isn't a real strong spray, but enough for a the length of time I need. The spray drys almost immediately so I am not worried it is being rubbed off. There is a light coconut scent to it, which is pleasant but not overpowering.",

It's best if you are in and out during the day or shopping or something other than the pool or the beach. Kiss My Face does make products with a higher SPF. The price is high too, but I don't mind that for an environmentally friendly product.",

Although using a spray makes it more convenient to cover areas like your back, I've found that you still need to rub this in to get good coverage. The dry oil nature of this is nice, and doesn't make your skin feel greasy like sunscreen usually can. I wouldn't use this on my face, but it's great for the body. I also like that it's vegan and cruelty-free.",

Because of the low SPF, it was intended for use just by the adults in the house, but since I can't use it on such a sensitive area, I'll be looking for another option. For use on other areas of the body, I did find it easy to spray (the twist lock feature is easy to use on the top) and it definitely smelled of coconut. Too bad about the face...",
