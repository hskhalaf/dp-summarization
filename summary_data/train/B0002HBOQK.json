I don't have a large head (I seem to recall that I wore a 7 1/4 Bell Star helmet back in the day) but in order for the headgear to be comfortable I pretty much took two of the straps out to their fullest extent. I'm not impressed by the padding of the headgear - I have my doubts if it could be worn for hours without discomfort. But when it gives you a real edge over anything without the ability to see in IR, well, one just has to make a few allowances.",
