I ordered two of the 16'x'16'x16' shade sails and both measured 14' 6\" - a full foot and a half short on all sides - and that is measuring along the curve of the seam with a tape measure. I've ordered 16' shade triangles from other sellers on Amazon and they measured a full 16 feet grommet to grommet and there is a noticeable difference in the total area covered. It was quality fabric with strong stitching but that is the only good thing I can say.",

I'll have to see if I can adjust it better.",

It's still functional, but the rust is a little frustrating. That said, the fish haven't complained and it did cut down a little on the direct sunlight to the pond.",
