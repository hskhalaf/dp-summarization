You have to hold down the mode button for 3 secs to be able to set the time. The set up is inconsistent, and I was about to return the product until I noticed some good advice here.

Wasn\u2019t looking for loads of bells and whistles. Just speedometer and odometer mostly. It fits the bill just fine and looking forward to getting many thousands of miles out of it in the upcoming cycling season.",

If you go to their web site they are more clear IMHO. Have just taken one 20 minute ride and it works just fine.",
