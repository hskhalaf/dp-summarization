It cut through the smell and doesn't leave any kind of headachy deodorized smell. Super pleased. Will only buy this product from now on.",

The unscented Anti Icky Poo truly has no scent once it dries, and is the only product that has completely gotten rid of the urine. For older, dried spots, it does require multiple applications over a few days so you do end up going through the product quite quickly, but it is totally worth the cost.",

I used it once on an area of wood floor, where the other products had supposedly worked, only to have odor return, Anti Icky Poo really DID WORK, we had a week of intense humidity and there is absolutely, positively NO ODOR!!!
