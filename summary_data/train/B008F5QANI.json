She has plenty of room and she has no problem jumping into it and keeping her urine in the litter, not on the sides of the pan. Another plus with this pan is that it has a lip on the front that holds the plastic bag while you clean the litter. Good work Catit.",

So far all of the Catit products I have purchased are absolutely amazing and worth every penny. I can't wait to buy more from them.",

It turns out to be one of the best litterboxes I've used. The high sides keep the litter in even if the cat is an enthusiastic digger, and the separable rim adds an extra barrier against litter scatter and helps secure a liner in place. The slight angle down toward the front makes the box accessible despite the high sides. When I needed a second litterbox recently, I unhesitatingly purchased this one again.",
