Others I've used force you to grab the comb on the sharp or serrated side, the SBS comb has a useful handle (in more ways than one with the bottle opener). The texture of the comb is just right, sharp enough to work, but not sharp enough to damage your board. The curved scraper edge allows you to get those little bits of wax that seem to migrate from the deck of the board onto the rails. All in all, it works like it should.",
