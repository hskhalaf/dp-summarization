My complaints are, the phone app to unlock the phone is super clunky and hard to use... I just use my code every time. Also, I was hoping for something more hands free. Perhaps a connection with the phone that allows an unlock from the car when it's cold and rainy (more like the keyless entry in my car). It does look sleek and clean, and so far (6 weeks in) the batteries are holding up. Installation was relatively easy for a moderately handy person.",

I'm on hold with them now after being hung up on by the first rep I got through to. So now I have a security device that doesn't work, and when I do finally get a replacement I'll get to pay a locksmith again to come out, re-key it to match the other locks, and install it. I do not recommend this company's products.",
