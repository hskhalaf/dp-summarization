The external rubber is reasonably grip-y, stiff enough to protect the floor, and honestly the folding feature is a nice touch. Quality control is a problem. The top side is fine, but on the bottom the rubber isn't complete. The internal fibers that give the thing some structure are not covered by the rubber - they are exposed. This will lead to premature failure. An additional minor gripe is that it could be 3-6\" longer. My rowing machine juuuuuust barely fits.",

      "text": "This is a very well designed product. It is very thin, which makes it easy to stow after use, but it made me worry that it would not absorb much punishment during my workouts. I was wrong. It is a great cushion, and the mat has other, cool design features. The prefolds make it easy to set-up and put away. One side has a very rough surface that grips the floor. Even on my hardwood floors the mat does not skate around. I highly recommend this product. In service, Rich",

      "text": "Ordered this along with the Stamina Air Rower and it's worked wonders. After assembling the rower, I had just started testing out the rower without the mat on my hardwood floors. Unfortunately, the rower would keep skidding and I'd keep on moving forward. Thus, I quickly busted the mat out of the box and with it, it stops the skidding and is a perfect size for the Air Rower. The mat does not take up too much room and does exactly what it's supposed to in protecting the floors. Probably don't need if you have carpet in your house, but I would highly recommend this complement to the air rower if you have hardwood or laminate flooring.",

It does get a little slippery if you start to sweat so i just keep a towel handy to wipe my hands before getting into a plank position. I love the way it folds as opposed to rolling. When I'm done it just slides under my couch and out of site!",

It's fine if your using it for equipment but I'd never want to workout on one of these.

For example the mat worked really well using it while performing mountain climber exercise. Material is strong, not overtly slippery and it has no odor. The only negative aspect I found was that the folds tend to stick up when opened completely. This can be overcome by overlaying a heavier item over the folds until the mat flattens out.",

It's thin enough that even folded double, it's only about 1/2\" thick. It has some stiffness to it but has perforations (or, more to the point, carve-outs - they don't go all the way through the mat) to make it easy to fold. It's textured to make it less slippery, but still carries a warning that it's slippery when wet. Seems as if it will protect the floor very well, and since it folds to 1' W x 3' L x less than 1' D, it's easy to store.",

It is larger than the roll up type I'm used to and so errant sweat drops are caught better.
