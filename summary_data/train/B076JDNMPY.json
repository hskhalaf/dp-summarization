The trimmer is only OK, but that isn't why I bought it. Battery life exceeds all my expectations. In a week, I'd use ~35% of Norelco 9000 shaver. This shaver uses ~10% of battery in same time period!!! I'm astounded at battery life.",

While researching that, I came across the Phisco. As the cost of the Phisco was less than the RQ12 Pro replacement head, I decided to try it. Could not be happier! Quiet, smooth and comfortable. I have only been using it for about 2 months now so hoping it will hold up. I highly recommend this razor for everyone who liked Norelco before their quality went to hell.",

I have sensitive skin, but have no irritation. It glides smoothly across the skin and leaves no stubble behind.. You should try this razor. I think you'll be very happy.

This shaver works, but it definitely is not a Norelco. Not horrible, but you get what you pay for. PROS: Lightweight Great battery life Easy to charge (micro USB) CONS: Does not give a good clean cut; Takes 8-10 passes to do a regular daily shave, and even then I can see/feel missed facial hair Seems to run slow - does not have the power of better shavers out there Head is flimsy - does not keep good contact with skin while shaving",
