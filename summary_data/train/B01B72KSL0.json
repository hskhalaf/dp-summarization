The Altra Torin 2.5 is one such shoe and more. It has very nice arch support, smooth and effortless transitions, and delivers enough ground feedback despite the significant amount of rubber and cushioning.",
      "pros": [
        "The Torin 2.5 secures the shoe in the right places and includes a roomy toe box for fantastic wiggle room to provide runners with a very comfortable run, as observed by most reviewers",

        "Some runners noticed how smooth the transition was from landing to take-off",
        "Quite a number appreciate the lightness of the run despite the max cushioning",
        "Many of the comments valued the shoe\u2019s versatility as a high-mileage trainer or as an up-tempo option",
        "Moderate to long runs on varied surfaces is where this beast shines, according to several testers",

        "It is \u00bd smaller than standard",
        "The breathability is not as good as before, as noticed by some of those who have tried the earlier version of the Torin",
