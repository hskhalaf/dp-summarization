I always hated when my husband kept dragging our crummy little old coffee table super close to the couch every time he'd sit to watch TV every day. The dragging would wear out the carpet! So happy the new table is heavy. Now he can't drag it!!! Yipppeeee!!",

I put it together myself with just a hand from my son in less than 1/2 hour. The screws go into predrilled/threaded metal holes and instead of being hard to line up like most \"assemble at home\" items, it was a piece of cake. They all lined up right away and the directions were fantastic. I've come to expect directions with pictures that you have to study to decipher what they want you to do but the instructions with this table have instructions in plain English. Thank You!!",

Don't get me wrong, it is a very good, sturdy table that can't just be pushed around so easily. It's heavy & I like how it feels but you would think the manufacture would have put the most important thing in the 2 packages that was sent to me are the bolts to assemble the whole thing. I had to make a trip to the hardware store just to get the bolts & of course the inconvenient. The 48\" table is perfect size for my living room.",
