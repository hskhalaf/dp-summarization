Not sure I would purchase again due to this slant, it definitely throws the whole thing off, other then that it would be great.",

Because of its unique design, the table can sit lower to your lap, making it much more comfortable to use. And if you prefer it to be higher, it\u2019s easy to change. One recommendation I\u2019d make is to be able to tilt the table for even greater comfort. Though I did find a way around that issue by purchasing a very nice adjustable laptop stand.",
