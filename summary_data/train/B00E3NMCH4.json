If you put so much oil in your paella that it ruins the pan then I'm not sure you're making paella! I did however notice some scorching on the underside of the pan from my stove, but that's commonand does not effect cooking. This pan is 15\" and works perfect with my recipe that uses 3 cups of rice, I wouldn't try to add any more than that!",

Now they say that my warranty no longer applies, so now I have a total of 3 unusable pans.
