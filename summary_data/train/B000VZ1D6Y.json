I have issues with fish oil so to find them in a dry tablet and in the amount of IU's I wanted was a huge plus! Too much supplemental Vitamin A is not good for me (makes me dizzy) so the 5,000 IU's are perfect! The tablets are not huge, they are rather flat and somewhat small, so they are easy to swallow. Solgar is my go-to for quality vitamins.They have helped my vision and I will continue to take them so long as they are available.",
