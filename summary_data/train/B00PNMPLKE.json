Just have to make sure they have a head pillow. I bought 3 Dordor&Gorgor's Organic Cotton Newborn Infant Head Body Car Baby Seat Support Pillows from off Amazon as well to put in the stroller. The parents said the pillows fit and worked great. Keep in mine these are newborn triplets so they are tiny babies. It works great! Great stroller!",

The seller will also charge you close to $40 for returning the item. Beware and avoid!!!!",

There are no foot rests for the middle and first seats so older children tend to push down on the cloth bottom area which could eventually cause it to tear if allowed to happen.",

I've tried changing where they sit in the stroller to see if it would balance better, and the only way it pushes and steers easier is if there are only 2 children sitting in it. Plus is it collapses and pops open easily. Would be nice if it had foot rests for the other two seats - only the front has seats, and muliple cup holders would be nice.",
