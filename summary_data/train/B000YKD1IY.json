Because of that, he has trouble eating and needs extra \u201cbang for his buck\u201d with calories with the food he does eat. Fortunately, this food helps with that and helps keep his weight up (he lost 4 pounds after his accident and has gained back 2). Unfortunately my other cat has put on a little weight, as he likes it also, and I am unable to keep it somewhere where only the slender one has access. :/",

My fluffballs avoid eating it, actually boycotting until they figure out nothing else is coming. Ill try it out for a couple of more months, for a total of 4 before I try again.

I was spending $31.99 at pet stores for this, and maybe - at best - $28.99 on sale. So, I'll be buying it from Amazon forever afterwards.",
