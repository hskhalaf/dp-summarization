The 2 straps with a snap buckle and loops on each shoulder are important to me as they secure the bag to my body while I am running. The bag has several compartments and the 2 pockets on the side are super useful to get stuff without taking the bag out of my back. The 2 liter bag is convenient and does not move around. I am now using it every time I go for a run. I strongly recommend it for all runners.",

This backpack leaves her hands free for the two hiking sticks we use! Sturdy and well made. I will purchase one for myself when my present one wears out!",

I was hoping the insulation on the straw would help with the \"leftover\" water that stays in the straw after taking a drink. Sadly, it doesn't. The water in the bladder is cold, but the insulation on the straw did nothing to help keep it that way. So before getting to the cold water, I had to drink the hot one first. That's my only gripe about the backpack, that the straw didn't do anything to keep the water cold. Otherwise, it's a great price and even better backpack!",

The mouth piece on the bladder is really weird; it has somewhat of a gap under it that makes it feel like the mouth piece is going to fall off. I imagine I'll probably get a different bladder, but the overall cost was so cheap that it didn't seem worth it to send it back. The backpack itself is actually pretty nice compared to ones in stores that are similarly priced. The straps are a little wide and dig into the front of my armpits just a bit.",

I like that there are multiple pockets. Never bounced during the entire run, it fits/tightens very sturdily around your body. I had to push some of the excess straps under the main shoulder straps as they were too long, I may have to cut them. I can now run for longer distances and have plenty to drink/eat along the way thanks to this bag. Other than the plastic clip breaking, pretty good so far, thanks!",
