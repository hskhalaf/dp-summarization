I feel awesome priming and firing it, making it worth it for me. If this is too expensive for you, get a Strongarm, but if you want the fun, I highly recommend!",

And while both did prove to be true, there is still a slightly heavier final \"click\" that takes at little technique for him to overcome. He's used to wrestling with larger Nerf guns but I've generally found the rear T-bar style (for example, Nerf Dual-Strike) to be better for kids with shorter arms or less brute strength.",

Doesn't jam or malfunction. Easy to pump and scavenge darts/load while running around. That's why I love it.",
