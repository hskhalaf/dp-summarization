Others have complained that it really hurts the tablet's sound, while other say it makes the wireless connection unstable.

I bought this as a kitchen tablet, mounted under my cabinet. It handles my shopping lists, music (paired to Bluetooth speakers), and cooking websites with ease. Far surpasses it's role. This thing comes with hardly any software. This is a really good thing. I could disable a lot of the built-in stuff, which leaves me a lean battery-friendly device. I'm seriously considering buying two more. One for my girl, and one for me to have a for a large map surface when out hiking in Colorado.",

Battery life is a bit on the short side, but may be because this was a used unit with perhaps many recharge cycles on the battery. I have not cracked open the case to install a new battery. With the decreasing cost of 5v power packs, I'll probably just velcro a 20,000 mAh pack to the back of it and use it that way. This will be used WIFI control of a digital mixer and the battery pack makes a nice \"handle\" to hold it by, leaving my other hand free to operate the mixer controls onscreen.",

Battery seems to last forever. The tablet is much faster at everything than the MemoPad. Not problems with networking at all. Overall a very good buy at less than $200.",

If you want a cheap tablet to throw in a bag or move around the house to watch video on, this is great, but even simple tasks like web browsing or checking email are sort of a chore. Its response time is that of a 2007 smart phone, and its processor lags quite a bit. I'll be keeping it because for the price, this is about the best display you can get, but if you are planning on replacing a computer or using this for work, it is definitely worth it to spend more money and get something else.",

CONS: 1) Only 16Gb, it's 2015 ! 2) Settings background is white, no way to change, w/c is glaring 3) No auto-brightness for display 4) And No Way to change the Lock Wallscreen to a custom image??!!! Firmware is latest at the time of this post, had this for 3 wks now. Please Lenovo, fix the above in a future update! ;-) Other than the above, it works fast & great!",

When held side by side, I could not see the difference in the picture quality. This boots a little faster than the Yoga, but otherwise, curb your expectations, you are after all, buying a tablet for under $200.00",

The tablet is great, and I have not seen the lack of performance or sound quality noted by other reviewers. Maybe a software update problem? The sound quality is great, picture is great, and the construction is decent (still plastic, but firm enough for me). The tablet will be going in a case with a screen protector, so hopefully it will survive our daughter. I may buy another one if the price drops again.",
