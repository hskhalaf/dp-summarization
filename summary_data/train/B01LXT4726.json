I would imagine, for someone taller, who must keep their headrests raised, they could move around if empty. I generally use cloth bags, and the handles are held securely by the hooks. Plastic bags also fit well onto the hooks. They are a sturdy plastic. An excellent, practical purchase to keep my car neat and organized again.",

I have one in my car and my husband's as well. I've also been giving them out to family and friends and they love it. The price is reasonable and these hooks are a practical solution to being able to reach my handbag while driving.",

I would take a look at your headrest as the opening of this may be a little small for some vehicles. From the front of the headrest post to the back of your seat can be a maximum of about 6.5 cm (2.6 inches). This includes the diameter of the post of your headrest.",
