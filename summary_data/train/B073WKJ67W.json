Got the Husband Pillow for her for Christmas and she LOVES it! It\u2019s much taller and provides better back support. The added neck pillow is buttoned in and can be adjusted, so you can get it at just the right angle. Plus there\u2019s a big zipper on the bottom so you can wash the cover...her other pillow didn\u2019t have that. I just tried it and wow...looks like I may be ordering two more for my husband and I! Guess we\u2019ll see how it holds up over time...keeping our fingers crossed!",

It took over 24 hours for the foam to expand, but despite this delay, the pillow with its well/designed arms and removable neck pillow proved to be a good size and height for me to be supported comfortably and to get some rest while in an upright position. A lot cheaper than investing in a hospital bed. Add a handrail to tuck under mattress and you have a perfect combination to solve the problem of getting out of bed and resting upright while in post-surgical recovery mode.",

The pillow is heavy and substantial; however, don't expect to use this pillow without a headboard or wall as a backstop, otherwise you'll probably just roll over backwards. I find this pillow to be a substantial upgrade to the foam wedge and standard bed pillows I was using previously to prop myself up in bed to watch tv. I'm happy with the purchase, and expect to get many years of use from this pillow.",

I can't speak to it's durability just yet, as I've only had it for a couple months, but again, the removable cover will sure help with it, as the issues with previous similar pillows have been that the stitching comes undone.",

I bought this pillow because the chair is so wide, I can't put my arms on the chair arms, and so deep that my feet don't touch the floor. I love that the makers of these pillows over stuff them, so that you can take out the extra stuffing and make if just exactly the fill that you need. It's taken me a couple of times, but I have it just the way I need it and I LOVE it. I just wish they also put a zipper on the inside part of the head rest so you could adjust that too.",

I had back surgery three days ago and since arriving home from hospital yesterday, I have spent all of my time on this pillow as it provides the support and position that I need for my lower back. Great cause too, as they are cleaning up our oceans with proceeds.",

It doesn't hug you, it just provides a firm soft layer against whatever it's leaning on. After using it it doesn't return to it's normal state, it just stays how it shifted.",
