The toe box is definitely wider and more comfortable than my All Stars. The only issue I had with these was their insole which had a huge heel-to-toe drop. Fortunately, the insole is removable, and I'm perfectly comfortable without it. Without the insoles, these shoes feel just like my All Stars, but with a wider toe box for my toes to have some wiggle room!",

Yes I can buy new inserts, but for $80, these should have had arch supports. The plus side is that the shoe looks great, fits great and they did put a nice padding on the back of the heel (where many shoes like this rub). Haven't decided if I am going to keep them yet, $80 is a lot of money to spend on shoes with no arch supports.",

The arch support is better than most shoes this style, and I do like the look. I changed the lacing only because I needed to tighten them more easily. (lacing is VERY long) Again, not a bad shoe, just not really what I was expecting from KEEN.",

Also, there is minimal support in the footbed, much less than the previous generation. They also only gave one color of shoelace, instead of giving a grey/white option as well.
