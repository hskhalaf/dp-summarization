My acne scars have lightened, my acne has been greatly reduced, and the health of my skin and hair and nails has just improved over all. Great value for the price. This has made my facial skin look younger as well and given me a lovely natural glow for the next day that isn\u2019t greasy. Can be used as a carrier oil for other essential oils. Great but I use daily and still have half a bottle left after a year.",

I have been using it twice a day: in the morning under my 100SPF sunscreen, and at night over my treatment cream. The best thing is that this doesn't make my face feel oily--seems odd to say that after directly applying oil to my face. It's true though! One other bonus: my toddler has had rough skin on the backs of her arms, and I tried putting this on her with great results! I love that it doesn't have harsh chemicals in it and that it is sensitive enough for her young skin!",

A little goes a long way -- you can probably moisturize half of your body with a palm sized dollop...if that. I hope you enjoy this product as much as I do!",
