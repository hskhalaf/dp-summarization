      "text": "Having gone through 2 different Insinkerator tanks, I can honestly say the build quality of both the Ready Hot tank and faucet is ahead of Insinkerator. Comparing the 2 faucets is like comparing a big box store faucet to one from a plumbing supply store. The Ready Hot is heavier and sturdier in the hand, which much fewer plastic parts. An added plus is the rotating spout and the ability to lock the handle in the open position for larger fill jobs. Time will tell if the tank's longevity is better, but the outlook looks good.",

I had to have the plumber come and install it, so it cost me $100 to install the replacement. Now after just over a year, the replacement unit is leaking badly. I decided to take it apart to discover where the leak was coming from rather than get a 3rd unit under warranty. The fitting for the tube at the bottom of the unit is plastic and had broken. See photo. I am going to try another brand.",

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because when the water is being heated in the tank (it does this periodically over the course of the day to maintain the water temp), it's a little bit noisy. It's installed in the cabinet under the sink, and even when the doors are shut, I can hear the water getting heated. Maybe this is a normal occurrence, but I'd be even happier if it was quieter!",

We purchased it in early November, had the kitchen remodeled for thanksgiving, and then it failed in late December. The failure was primarily the faucet (no water would flow through the faucet, however it would flow through the refrigerator dispenser on the same line). The temperature control was strange. it would be fine, and then randomly start to boil over out of the faucet. We would turn the temperature setting down a fraction and the boiling would stop, but the temperature drop was significant....very fussy. The boiling may be related to our elevation (about 5500 ft) but the fussy control should not be related.",

      "text": "Pros: Installation of the faucet was really slick and easy. Cons: Thermal control is marginally acceptable. You can get to 190F as advertised. However you have to put the thermastat at 100%. If you leave it at 100% the unit boils over and shoots steam out the faucet occasionally. Later when you try to use it again you have to use cold water to push out the hot, reducing the effective temperature. In practice you cannot leave the thermostat at the temperature needed for 190F water if you want 190F water the next day.",

I have flushed it out completely at least a dozen times and it helps temporarily but the bad taste comes back after time, especially if the water has been sitting in the tank for a couple of days. I was hoping it would improve over time, especially since I had to pay a plumber to install it. Unfortunately, it has not gotten any better and the return cut off was 3 days ago. I am worried the water could be bad for my family\u2019s health.",
