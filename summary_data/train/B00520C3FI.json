But, it is on the small side, and we fear our full figured lady cat might be intimidated by the small size. She has gone in to retrieve treats, we think, but have never actually witnessed it. This would be great for a smaller cat though. The lights are fun and the material seems durable. Got it at a great price so if she doesn\u2019t warm up to it, I\u2019ll gladly donate to the shelter.",

The paper is thick and stays open better than regular paper bags. But I won't be buying again.",

She plays with this quite often, and especially loves to run through it and jump at my dogs to scare them! This product is MUCH cheaper than the products offered at pet stores, and seems to be a higher quality! I would definitely buy this product again!!",

Domestic cats have few outlets for the solitary activities they often crave; Twinkle Chute provides your cat with solo play and privacy that can fulfill their needs and enrich their lives. The crackly surface and touch-activated lights of the Twinkle Chute adds to the interactivity and fun and will quickly become one of your cat's favorite toys in the house.",
