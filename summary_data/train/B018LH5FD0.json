The salmon one is always the cheapest of the varieties and he seems to like them all equally so we only buy this one. Way too expensive at Petsmart. I definitely would recommend this kind of grain free treat/dog biscuit. He treats them as if they are higher value than a lot of his other treats. They aren't for really small dogs though unless you want to break them up which might get messy.",
