I've tried Nike and Asics, but neither brand lasts as long as New Balance. I get 2-3 months more wear out of New Balance shoes. I replaced my Nike and Asics shoes every six months because my knees began to hurt (the cushioning was worn out); I've been getting 8-9 months wear from the New Balance 880s.",

They provide the softest cushion, yet they are incredibly stable and firm. Every aspect of this shoe is great and my body thanks me. I wasn't excited about spending $130 on a shoe that looks like every other $50 pair of New Balances, but the are worth every penny. Get them and thank me later.",

This is good because it helps to my asked inward instead of outward, so it's good when running but feels awkward when standing. I don't like wearing these shoes for the simple fact that the tongue constantly slips away from the top of the foot and rotates to the outer edge of the shoe despite trying different lacing methods. The tongue bunches up to the outside of my foot instead of staging on top within minutes or a fewsteps after readjusting them. I don't recommend this shoe based on that reason.",

That runs my streak of bad online shoe purchases to six pairs in a row. I've yet to buy a pair that fits as expected. Normally, I'd just go to the store, but this time, I thought I'd avoid the mask nazis, and COVID rigmarole. I was wrong. It's too bad, they seem like nice shoes.",

You don\u2019t want Payless shoes as training shoes. It must fit your foot type: whether pronator, supinator or neutral foot. :)",
