I have it right behind my door (just the way that my apartment is designed) and it\u2019s great for setting things like my keys, mail and small plants. I accidentally overwatered one of my plants and didn\u2019t check to see that the excess water had drained onto my table and thus a small part of the corner is slightly swollen now ): ...so just something to pay attention to: don\u2019t let it get wet lol.",

The pieces that lock onto the screw heads were not able to lock due to imprecise screw measurements and holes which led to frustration and confusion and so it caused me to assemble the boards backwards with the glue. Never will buy this product again.",
