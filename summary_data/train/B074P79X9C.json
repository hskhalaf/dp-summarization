Music: Through the roof, I don't know how they did it - but it sounds amazing. Don't waste your money on other speakers that are twice the price or more.

I'm sure when summer comes around I'll try to extend those in the backyard. Great bass and you can turn it up loud....very loud without distortion. I shopped around a lot so save yourself the time and energy and just by these. Hope this helps you decide.",

      "text": "This came highly recommended and the sound quality is good, but it's almost useless as a portable device. After owning for a couple of months the battery dies within minutes of being disconnected from power. I've had the JBL Flip 3/4 and honestly, the sound isn't that much better than those devices, and on the JBL's the battery lasts for hours and hours. In addition, we've had problems with the power adapter as well; it seems to work only sporadically, further reducing the usefulness of the speaker. Very disappointing, will probably buy the bigger JBL portable device.",

However, if anything the quality exceeds that of previous generations before HK was bought by Samsung. Great product, would purchase again and expand the sound range within my house!",

Well I decided to keep it and give it a second try and what do you know, it turned out fine. I connect it to everything from my cell phone to my smart tv. The sound quality is movie like and the boost is awesome. I'm thinking about ordering two more for different parts of the house and using it for cookouts.",

The surrounding silicone (where you push the buttons) tucked into the shell falls out often. The bluetooth connection sounds great when the speaker knows which phone it was supposed to be connected to. I have to leave my phone screen on or else it sounds like losing phone call through a tunnel. The problem is also solved if everyone else in the house turns their bluetooth connector off completely.",
