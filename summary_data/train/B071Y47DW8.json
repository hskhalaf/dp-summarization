They use it as a balance board, car ramp, bridge, roll balls over it, climbing (the baby) on it, sliding of it, rocking in it...the ways to play are endless. There are so many ways to discover heights, gravity, balance...And yes, Mom likes to balance on it too. It is sturdy enough for that. We will enjoy this for many years to come, as even our 12 year old neighbor couldn't resist balancing on it, first thing she came in today.",

He loved it but it appears to be defective. The angle of the curve appears warped causing the ends not to lay flat when in the bridge position. When one end is flat the other is over an inch+ off on the other side causing it to be very unstable for him to walk on. I\u2019m returning it and hoped to repurchase a new one but they are now listed as unavailable. Will have to buy elsewhere.",

It's handmade from German beech wood and super sturdy. Even my husband was able to stand on it and it didn't budge! It also has a really nice feel to the touch and is well made. My son loves rocking on it, but he has already found 101 other uses, which is what I had hoped for. I love this board and so does he. Highly recommend!!!",

We use it with supervision because I want to watch out for pinched/crushed fingers if he were to rock over them.",
