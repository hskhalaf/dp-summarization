Started with 125psi ended with just under 90 on the guage. Right at the end you could feel it was having a little trouble driving the staples, but anything over 90 psi was just fine. Well worth the money. It drove 3/8\" staples thru premium artificial grass into 3/4\" OSB with no problems. (I should have used 1/2\" but the 3/8\" did the job. Don't ask why I'm stapling fake grass to 4x8 sheets of OSB, it's a long and crazy story.)",

There's no safety tip to interfere with the stapling, therefore you can jam the point of the tool into double-bead welting in your upholstery work.
