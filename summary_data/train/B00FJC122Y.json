It is very comfortable at first but it doesn't stay tight around my foot, even when I tighten the laces and that's true for even the straights, around curves I feel like I'm going to slip out of the shoe. All this to say ive even had Nike and other top brand shoes do this, and it may be a personal thing to me, but for the price, you can't go wrong with this shoe!",
