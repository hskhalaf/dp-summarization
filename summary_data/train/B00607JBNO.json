      "text": "I've had this phone for 10 months. This phone has become better than nothing - slow to load apps and almost worthless as a phone. At first it was good for apps using my T-Mobile $30 data plan. Perhaps it has become too full; although I keep trying to get rid of apps I don't use often. I use it with my Google account. I have been pleased with streaming Netflix on it and now the World Cup games, but I have never got Kindle working well on it. If I try to place a phone call on it (they go through Google Voice) forget it. \"You try a call and take your chances.\"",

It's like it gets stuck and has to think about it each time you press a button. I assume the processor is just really cheap and bad. It also randomly shuts itself off at inopportune times, so I have to check on it every 30 min or so if I'm expecting a call to make sure it hasn't gone to sleep. It also just randomly starts programs, like when I click on \"messaging\" and it opens my camera. It is supposedly 4G but is way slower to load internet than my girlfriends iPhone with 3G.

Neither the screen nor the buttons would respond to anything I did, so for about 45 seconds I continued to walk with the phone ringing full volume in my hand like some fool. Got some priceless looks. I finally had to pull the battery to get it to stop. Just another day with this phone. (Yes, I tried rooting this phone - it still stunk.) Avoid.",

The reason it is 4 stars and not 5 is because the phone lags and at some times becomes totally unresponsive for like 5 mins. This only happens when you have alot of apps open at the same time.

This phone, once unlocked, is easily rooted [...] and once you remove the T-mobile bloatware, you'll find more than enough space for all of your apps. You can even tether without incurring extra fees. Unlocking is a bit of a pain. Keep your receipt handy and you will have to fax it, yes FAX to T-mobile along with your IMEI. Alternatively pay $20-$40 to have it unlocked. With this phone, it's as simple as putting in an non-T-mobile SIM card, turning on the phone, keying in the unlock code and hitting <enter>.",
