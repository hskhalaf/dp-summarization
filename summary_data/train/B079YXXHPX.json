The one setup box makes it so easy if you need to add or unplug HDMI cables & it alleviates you ever having to move the TV screen to do this which I always found to be a pain in the neck.

Power runs, along with audio and 4K video, through the razor thin One Connect wire. As a result, the One Connect box is larger due to the power transformer. I easily snaked the single wire through the wall. Using a direct Ethernet for top quality streaming. I mounted the TV to the wall using the Samsung NO Gap Wall Mount, and surround sound through a Bose 700 Soundbar, bass, and surround. Easy set up, absolutely phenomenal picture. Fantastic features and easy integration with all my devices. I highly recommend the Q7!",

      "text": "In November 2015 I purchased a Samsung UN60JU6390FXZA TV. It was and is awesome. When our second TV died I consulted Consumer Report then purchased a Samsung QN65Q7FNAFXZA. The picture quality is truly amazing! I strongly recommend Samsung QLED technology. I'm not a gamer so I can't comment on that video quality but I can't think of a reason it would not also be outstanding. I added a Yamaha YAS-207 sound bar system (a Consumer Report Best Buy) they make an awesome combination.",
