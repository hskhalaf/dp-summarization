The Mtech is very light and comfortable to use. The SOG is light as well , but it is not comfortable to the hand. For the price and what my intended use (which is to carry while hiking) the Mtech suits my purpose much better. I do like the Sog , but the Mtech wins my vote. It is a capable little axe for basic survival if needed.",
