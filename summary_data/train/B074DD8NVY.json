Yesterday, I used it for the first time to air up P265/70R17 tires from ~19PSI to ~35PSI. Took me a total of 13min to get all 4 tires to pressure (including time to move from tire-to-tire). Pump did not shut-off or overheat. It also seems to run very quietly compared to other compressors I've seen/heard. Included hose is plenty long enough to reach all 4 tires of a 4Runner. I did notice that the pump does not shut-off once reaching set pressure but need to try again (although this seems consistent w/ other reviews).",

As it is, you can fill the tire to whatever pressure you like (which it does pretty well) but by the time you unscrew the stupid chuck from the tire stem some unknown quantity of air has leaked. Then you have to use a separate tire gauge to check again then re-attach the compressor and fill again, overshooting the mark hoping to compensate for the inevitable leakage when disconnecting. Lather, rinse, repeat. Had they not pinched pennies on the chuck and used a decent quick disconnect they might have gotten a 4.5 star rating.",

Due to a tiny sidewall puncture on a long trip, I've been forced to re-inflate my pick-up truck tire at least twice daily for the past week. The compressor performed flawlessly.

Once it reaches the set pressure you want, the display freezes that number, the pump keeps running, overshoot for about a minute and over inflates by about 2.5 psi. My guess is they anticipated air loss when unthreading the fitting from the valve stem and gave the slowest fingers the priority. I observed 2 suburban tires inflate from 65- 67 psi to 80 in about 70 seconds which is very impressivery for a 12volt portable.",

Although the compressor doesn't shut off after filling the tire, it does stop pumping once it reaches your setting. If I turn off the pump the tire loses about 2 lbs. before I can disconnect the hose, so I found it was better to leave it run a few more seconds while I disconnect the hose, as opposed to adding 2 lbs. to the setting.",
