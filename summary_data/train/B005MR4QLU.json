Often I'd press a key and nothing would show up on the screen, so I'd have to press a key several times to get it to register the letter I'd pressed. Label makers are supposed to be convenient and labor-saving, but for this one it's not worth the hassle of having to jam on the buttons all the time. Seems like better DYMO technology could fix this model up in a next generation, but skip this one - it's too big and clunky to be convenient and too small and finicky to be comfortable to use.",

The navigation button doesn't always respond. The \"Clear\" button doesn't seem to do anything. While the Amazon product description does not mention \"Clip Art\", the packaging states it has 200+ clip art images - It does NOT. When I contacted DYMO, their reply was that the punctuation and math symbols and such were \"clip art\" - That's punctuation and math symbols - That's deceptive and it isn't Clip Art.",

I've used the downloaded DYMO desktop application as well where the LabelMaker functions as basically a connected printer for storing label text and using some odd size fonts and all, another great feature. It uses the label tape efficiently, and generic refills are available, so no drawback there. Go for it!",

That night I let it charge overnight again and pulled it out again on Friday to use - same thing - dead as a doornail. No power at this location - had to use my other battery powered labeler (PTOUCH) this time (it works but sucks batteries)",
