      "verdict": "The Blazer Mid Rebel from Nike puts a unique spin on an icon. Despite several rebellious tweaks like the zipper, asymmetrical lacing system and deconstructed Swoosh, these sneakers remain to carry the identity of the Nike Blazer.The lacing system and the mid-top construction may need some getting used to especially for those who are used to low-top sneakers, but given some of the style points, it is worth a try.",
      "pros": [
        "Some of those who have reviewed the Nike Blazer Mid Rebel shoes are pleased with their purchase",
        "Its unique construction captivates the few commenters into buying these sneakers",
        "Because a wearer is highly satisfied with her purchase, she bought the other two colorways from the collection",
        "A shopper is delighted because this pair goes well with jeans and pants",
        "These are extremely stylish according to a wearer",
        "A couple of users have praised the model because there are various colorways that are available for purchase"

      "cons": [
        "Although the diagonal lacing system looks good in pictures, wearing them on actual doesn't produce a good look, said some of the consumers",
