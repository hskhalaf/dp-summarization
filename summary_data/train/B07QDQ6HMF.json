It\u2019s amazingly quiet and completes a large house on a single charge but great to have the second battery for backup. Really great attachment selection, including the filter cleaner which is a great touch. Manoeuvres much better than our previous Dyson cordless and has a convenient flip switch for keeping the power without constantly holding a switch down. Really well thought out appliance, wouldn\u2019t go back to Dyson.",

I've owned the big brands before and this beats them hands down, very impressed with the smart suction meter which really helps when you need extra power, and the fact that I don't have to physically clean the filter is one less job to do! The accessories that come with it are fantastic and I've used them all, really useful. The fact it comes with a 2 year warranty and \u00a3200 cheaper than the latest dyson with better features, more accessories and smarter technologies is a winner for me.",

When you release the trigger bits fall out, so it did not suck up the best. Also on max it over heats and stops you useing till it has cooled down. I returned and ordered a Dyson v11 animal. WOW what a difference, the Dyson is so much better. Sucks better, moves better and just feels better. It's a shame as I was hoping it would be better than the Dyson, but it's not. So happy I payed the extra and got the Dyson. Sorry Tineco",

So no major issue. We simply pop the vac on auto and can do our 3 bed semi on a half battery charge. So still have a battery and a half spare when finished. It is a very good quiet vacuum. No hesitation in recommending it over the more expensive competition.",

Additionally, it feels better built than a Dyson and has some interesting innovations (mentioned above).

      "text": "I\u2019ve been using this for a couple of months now. It is great on carpeted floors, the battery life is very good and generally the build quality and features are pretty impressive. However, it really struggles on hard floors, especially when it comes to dealing with larger bits of dirt, crumbs of food, etc. Apparently there is an extra attachment for hard flooring but I can\u2019t seem to find it available for purchase anywhere. Given that our downstairs is entirely hard flooring, I\u2019m finding myself having tosweep the floor just as much as using the vacuum. If our home was fully carpeted then I\u2019d be satisfied, but since it\u2019s not, I can\u2019t help but feel disappointed with my purchase.",
