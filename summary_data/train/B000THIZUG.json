We ended up using a separately purchased valve adapter and compression nut & insert (pictured) that we brought separately. My home is 20 years old. I would expect a \"EZ\" install kit to include a few different sized adapters rather than just one size fits all. It clearly does not. As for the filtration, it is good to handle flavor issues related to chlorine usage and calcium usage in my area. It also looks nicer on the sink than one that you mount to the faucet.",

Not many current faucets are going to work with the parts that are supplied with this setup. The installation now takes three times what it should and multiple parts are required with a good chance of leaking. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you're a plumber or are very good at reworking your plumbing. Culligan could have easily included a second fitting for those of us that have the smaller size fixtures. This seriously took the fun out of the purchase and I would look at another option next time.",

What I did was to remove the battery portion of the faucet and fix it ,and seal it with flexseal to prevent water seepage.",

That is what is supplied and mine and I'm sure many others are 3/8\" connections. Had to go to a big box hardware store and buy a 3/8\" tee for $8 to get my unit connected. Also they tell you to use Teflon tape on faucet end and they do not supply that either. You would think Culligan would supply you with a one cent piece of Teflon tape but not. Water taste is is dramatically improved and unit has very good water flow as well .",

However, it doesn't seem to clean the water nearly as well as my Pur pitcher filter. My tea doesn't look as crystal clear and leaves a residue in my glass after brewing. I suspect this is a more porous filter than the Pur filter. It will likely last much longer, but not filter as well as the Pur. I beleive Culligan offers better filters for this device, but those probably won't last as long either. That's always the trade off with filtration + better filtration = less life as the filter clogs more quickly.",

However, most people will have soft water systems installed in their home, and tapping off the cold faucet at the sink runs softened water through the filter. Not ideal for quality and pretty much the exact opposite I wanted. So, with a simple saddle valve kit purchased separately to tap into the unconditioned water line, I have good tasting water for the family to drink and cook with. I especially enjoy the idea of upgrading filters if needed without having to change anything else. Overall a nice kit but I don't recommend installation as described in the instructions.",

After almost a year - It works fine. No leaks no worries. Unfortunately for me auto-ship doesn't allow you to really select when you really need a new filter. The longest span is 6 months.
