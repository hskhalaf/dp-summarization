The shadows don't even take up most of that space. It's about half the size of my iPhone 6s. I would give it less stars, but the pigments and colors are great. But mostly I find that it just isn't worth $45. The individual shades of MAC shadows are much larger, or you could just buy a Pro-size pallet. Love the colors, but this is TINY.",
