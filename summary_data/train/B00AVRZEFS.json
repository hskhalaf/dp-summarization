Well, the machine works fine and crushes ice very well BUT...after about 10 days, some black gunk (bacteria) started showing on the steel blades...washed the head in a dishwasher but gunk remained...so I chose to disassemble the crushing mechanism which is just a spindle with sepetators.....except that once they all came appart and went to the washing again.... it became a nightmare to ressemble because it needs to be done INSIDE the head with NO space....I manage once....then had to do it again a few weeks later..and after 20 minutes of anger...I smashed it.",

We've used it for a week while camping and it solved a HUGE problem that many campers have: how to make a good mixed drink with the big cubes (actually round barrels) of ice that the portable ice makers produce? Since we only used it a week we can't speak to durability, but this gadget chips those big cubes into the perfect crushed ice while the entire bottom is suctioned solid to the counter top for stability while you crank the handle.",

The product so far is deceptively strong. I've only used standard-sized cubes (4 at a time) and while the crusher feels like it might break at times, the plastic and metal crushing apparatus seems to hold up under pressure. As a rule, I crank both ways to even out any resistance from the ice and not ask too much from this product. Great value for the money.",

I spend several minutes cranking away just to crush 4 or 5 cubes. But if you're not in a hurry and you don't have a plug in - this little bad boy will do the job.",
