Clumsy and annoying software. ~30mb download speed. Under 1mb upload speed. It works, just not very well. Would not recommend. Bought a used Netgear Nighthawk AC 1900 for roughly $10 more. Never disconnects. Seems to be really sturdy. Cool design. Minimal un-intrusive software. Over 200mb download speed. Over 20mb upload speed. Like night and day. Would highly recommend. Don't cheap out on a wifi receiver if you're paying for good internet.",

If the EDUP provides service for 8-10 years I will remain pleased with the purchase. The computer is also used in Malaysia where it will communicate with a Roseswill RNX-N4PS 300Mbps router on a Huawei modem.

My connection was constantly dropping and had to be reset, and my signal strength was never better than 25-50mbps. I tried another USB adapter a while back that offered little improvement. Decided to give this EDUP 1200Mbps dual band adapter a try and received immediate and dramatic improvement. My signal has not dropped once since plugging it in and I'm consistently getting 150-250Mbps signal strength. Wish I would've bought this 2 years ago. Very pleased thus far!",

      "text": "Got this adapter to provide internet for a desktop in my house. Unboxing, setup and configuration was simple and smooth. The adapter worked right away giving out a strong signal being one floor down and about 15ft from my router. Signal was strong for 3 hours straight then all of a sudden began sporadically dropping over and over again. Unfortunately it's been like this since 2-3 hours of connectivity then it will go on a 20min spree of connecting/dropping signal. I thought I found a good solution to my wifi connectivity issues but have now been met with yet another Adapter that promises above board performance but comes in well below what's promised. 3/5",

Also when connecting the cord to the adapter, I have to put it in at just the right angle for it to actually turn on. God forbid it falls or unplugs cause then I'd have to spend another 10 minutes figuring out how to pit it in at the right angle. Overall I wouldn't reccomend this for long time use. If you use it for a short time it's great but remember it will deteriorate.",
