The presets are task based, and focus on real world scenarios, resulting in fantastic pictures whatever you're trying to capture. Colour reproduction and image quality are both fantastic, possibly better than the DSLR we own. Battery life seems very good, well over 100 shots since Christmas day and the battery hasn't needed charging yet!",

This appears to be a regular issue with this lens, it seems to have been 'stretched' from 28-24mm and as such a sharp corner image quality can never been obtained when shooting at wide angle. Pity, as I much prefer this camera to the competing Sony RX series.",

If this is not a big thing for you, then you can save a good bit of money by going for this Canon instead of the Sony RX100 Mk4.

Still no matter how much I press the shutter button and take photos when it \u201cdoes work\u201d still says busy. Tried to contact the Canon in UK/Ireland and they never got back to me. Still have the warranty.",
