I now can have my 70-300mm zoom lens on the T6i and the standard zoom on my T2i. The 6 is better in almost every way, although I still do like the screen on the 2, which is not covered. Otherwise, yes, better all around.",

With high resolution and an ISO sensitivity of ISO 100\u201312800 (expandable to H: 25600) the EOS Rebel T6i can capture images of immense quality in more lighting situations than possible with point-and-shoot cameras and camera phones. Advanced technologies combined with sophisticated automatic exposure features make the EOS Rebel T6i easy to use. Simply turn the camera on and feel confident that the results will be stunning whether they're being shared on the web or printed large and displayed on your wall.\n\nDIGIC 6 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe EOS Rebel T6i camera is equipped with the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which makes several important advancements to image quality both in photos and video. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also enhances the camera's performance capabilities, powering full resolution high-speed continuous still and video shooting while providing distortion correction, and much more. Video recording in MP4 format provides better compatibility with mobile devices and tablets. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices.\n\nBUILT-IN WI-FI & NFC FOR SIMPLE UPLOADS AND SHARING\nBUILT-IN WI-FI\nFrom uploading photos to social networking sites, emailing family and friends, or archiving images to a computer, the EOS Rebel T6i camera offers a number of easy solutions for sharing. The EOS Rebel T6i is equipped with built-in Wi-Fi to make wireless sharing of photos between compatible devices incredibly easy and convenient. Using Canon's new Camera Connect App*, the EOS Rebel T6i can connect to a number of compatible smartphones and iOS devices* for image browsing and transfer.\n\nBUILT-IN NFC\nBuilt-in NFC (Near Field Communication) helps provide a virtually seamless connection to numerous compatible Android\u2122 smartphones**, and the new Canon Connect Station CS100.

A variety of the camera's expressive capabilities are available to you: use different shooting modes; choose AF frame modes (single-point/face detection); shoot in continuous shooting mode; and utilize the AF button. Just connect to a device using the Camera Connect App* to start capturing photos. Printing to compatible printers supporting PictBridge (Wireless LAN) is quick and easy.\n\n* Compatible with iOS versions 6.0/6.1/7.0/7.1/8.0/8.1, Android smartphone versions 2.3.3/4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4 and Android tablet versions 4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4. Data charges may apply. With the download of the free Canon Camera Connect app, this software helps enable you to upload images to social network services. Before uploading images, please be aware that image files may contain privacy-related information such as people and places. If necessary, please delete such information. Canon does not obtain, collect or use such images or any information included in such images through this software.\n** Compatible with Android devices version 4.0 or later.\n\nSOPHISTICATED, AUTOMATED MOVIE RECORDING\nEOS FULL HD VIDEO\nUsing technologies designed for professionals and refined for simplicity, the EOS Rebel T6i camera makes gorgeous, polished Full HD videos at the press of a button. Technologies like advanced Hybrid CMOS AF III mean the camera focuses fast, and stays focused, even if the subject is moving. Advanced EOS optics help deliver shallow depth-of-field to provide the beautiful cinematic ambiance seen in professional films. Canon STM lenses provide smooth AF when shooting moving subjects, and the high ISO sensitivity allows the camera to record videos in low light with reduced image noise for clear, sharp footage. An automatic wind noise elimination feature makes sure voices and music do not get drowned out by the sound of the wind blowing. Videos are recorded in MP4 format, which helps provide high quality videos that take up relatively little storage space, but are also easy to share and upload. Canon offers a wide selection of compatible EF and EF-S lenses too choose from, so users have the freedom to create truly unique videos to express their artistic vision. With Canon EOS, it's easier than ever to expand your imaging possibilities.\n\nFASTER FOCUS, IMPROVED TRACKING\nHYBRID CMOS AF III\nThe EOS Rebel T6i camera features a robust, sophisticated AF system for Live View and video shooting. This Hybrid CMOS AF III focuses incredibly quickly and accurately, and maintains focus even while the subject is in motion. This is incredibly useful when photographing or making videos of fast-moving children or pets when unpredictable movement is involved. Designed for providing the best possible autofocus capability, the EOS Rebel T6i delivers photos and videos with sharp, consistent focus regardless of the shooting situation. When using the EOS Rebel T6i with a Canon STM lens, operation is even smoother and quieter.\n\nSHARP AND CLEAR, WITH TACTILE CONTROLS\nVARI-ANGLE TOUCH SCREEN CLEARVIEW II LCD MONITOR\nCanon EOS Rebel DSLR cameras that come with a Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch ClearView II LCD monitor use capacitive technology similar to today's popular mobile devices. The screen is touch-sensitive and delivers intuitive touch panel operation. Two-finger touch gestures can be used for zooming or changing images. Menu and quick control settings can be accessed, and focus point and shutter release can be activated with the touch of a fingertip using Touch AF. Displaying fine detail (at approximately 1.04 million dots), this screen is perfect for composing and reviewing images. Thanks to a solid construction between the monitor's resin-coated cover and the liquid crystal display, reflections are minimized, and the display can be viewed, without glare, from any number of angles. The LCD's surface is treated with a smudge-resistant coating to minimize fingerprints and maintain a bright, clear image display.\n\nFAST-ACTION SHOTS ARE EASY TO CAPTURE\nHIGH-SPEED CONTINUOUS SHOOTING\nThe EOS Rebel T6i camera can shoot up to 5.0 frames per second, continuously. Whether capturing that perfect expression, the game's winning goal, or the bride walking down the aisle, the EOS Rebel T6i delivers the speed and performance for amazing results.\n\nINTELLIGENT SCENE ANALYSIS FOR EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS\nADVANCED SCENE ANALYSIS\nThe EOS Rebel T6i camera features an updated scene analysis system that detects the prominent light source in a scene and makes adjustments to the camera's exposure, focus and color settings to account for the prevailing light. A new RGB+IR sensor that's capable of detecting near infrared light and flickering light sources enhances the Scene analysis system's accuracy. This means the EOS Rebel T6i can minimize the effects of fluorescent light; it takes gorgeous photos in twilight, and it can detect skin tones, for accurate exposure and focus in portraits. The camera can even make the greens in landscapes more vivid!\n\nCONSISTENT, HIGH PERFORMANCE AF\n19-POINT ALL CROSS-TYPE AF SYSTEM\nFor shooting through the viewfinder, the EOS Rebel T6i camera features an updated 19-point all cross-type AF system with improved tracking of moving subjects perfect for capturing action with accuracy. Cross-type AF points maintain accurate focus even if the camera is held vertically or horizontally, no matter where on the frame focus is first achieved. The EOS Rebel T6i also features three focusing area selection modes that make accurate focus even easier. Single point AF allows users to easily choose any one of the 19 focus points for precise focus. In Zone AF, one of 5 zones is selected and focus is locked within that area of the composition. With 19-point automatic selection AF, the camera detects the subject automatically. This is especially useful in shooting sports or other unpredictable motion.\n\nSIMPLE TO PREVIEW, EASY TO SHOOT\nFUN CREATIVE FILTERS\nThe EOS Rebel T6i camera comes with a number of different creative filters that are available as presets and can be previewed before shooting. Effects include Art Bold, Water Painting, Fisheye effect, Soft Focus, Toy Camera, Grainy Black and White plus Miniature effect in both still photographs and movie mode. With incredibly different effects, creative filters are a terrific way to express or enhance the mood of a scene and make photography with EOS Rebel DSLR cameras even more fun.",
