He absolutely loves it and had many hours of enjoyment putting it together. There is a lot of pieces and a lot going on. The instruction manual is huge! He rated this as the best Lego set out of the hundreds he's put together. Yes, it's expensive but if your kid is like mine and puts the 500-1000 piece sets together in almost no time this is worth it.",

If you are younger than 13 years old I would not advise getting this set. It was a very long build that, although it was very fun, was tiring.
