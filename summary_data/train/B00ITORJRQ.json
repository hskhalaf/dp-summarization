Everything is so crisp, so responsive, and so easy on the gamer - BenQ went above and beyond in catering to their customers. Also, the HDMI out for cap cards is a huge blessing, especially considering with the Elgato HD60 on a standard monitor, it has to be constantly plugged in for the console to actually output onto the screen.",

Not sure if this is the biggest reason for my drastic increase in performance (I did also purchase some nice gaming headphones and an elite controller), but it surely has helped, especially on darker maps. Not as good for RPG's as the color/lighting is off (i.e. when it should be dark in game, you can still see perfectly, so good from a performance standpoint but a con from an immersion standpoint). Minor gripe is that the output no longer is able to feed my elgato (if anyone has found a solution to that, it would be greatly appreciated), but it still works for outputting to a different screen (i.e. a TV for Netflix or RPG's).",

My only gripe is the lack of USB or even a third HDMI and remote control (because I'm lazy at night and don't want to get up to turn it off for Netflix). When I first experienced the green colors I thought something was amiss with the colors, but it was the monitor brightening the black areas of the map (Battlefield: Hardline). If you have been called a hacker before, expect it a LOT more with this monitor. Could have extra features, but at the end of the day, I'm the beast in the lobby, not my opponents and that's all igaf about.",

I was so wrong. Besides the colors being brighter and darks being much more clear, the response time makes a huge difference! I'm getting fast no-scope kills I normally would miss, dodging opponents more often, and overall having notably better stats. This was instantaneous! The first time I played, I noticed a marked difference. I can't speak for PC gaming, but for console... this will give you an advantage that you will notice the first time you use it .",

The sound quality of the monitor isn't the best but but it didn't bother me since I had a speaker that I hooked up to it via 3.5mm sound jack. If you are a console gamer and looking for a quality and best experience under $200, look no more! I would give this monitor higher than 5 if I could!",

This monitor makes it so much easier for me to get precise shots off because 1080p on a screen this small is incredible. I don't notice any lag either (although I didn't notice any on my previous TV, so I can't say this is better from that standpoint). If you care a lot about sound, maybe look for another monitor because accessing the volume-control on this TV is annoying. Plus, the sound-quality isn't great.
