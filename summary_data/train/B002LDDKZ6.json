Gave it three stars only because it was relatively inexpensive compared to the others, and in this case one gets what they pay for. Wasn't all that flat, bowed up in the middle, thus the arms were leaning out and the handle didn't fit right, the assembler had difficulty getting the little screws, with only about 1/4\" in the wood, to thread and hold. Had two separate holes in each end as the screws never really took a purchase in the wood handle. Pretty disappointed, but will make it work. Get some longer screws and handle it with care.",

I weighed mine, on a very accurate scale, and it weighs only 1 pound 10 ounces. Also, it is not flat. If I put this on my griddle, I can spin it like a top. I guess that is not a big problem since it will be sitting on food. It does, however, take a little longer to heat since the whole surface does not contact the griddle. If you are looking for a hefty, well made press, keep looking!",

Once cold, I reinstalled the handle and put it to use. This press is great for about 3 strips of bacon. Any more than that and they stick out the sides. I might also look for a round one to fit my cast iron pan.",

As for the grill, it's a bit too narrow to use on most items I cook, so it will stick to being used with bacon or narrow cuts of meat, it's not too heavy, and I don't think it will press juices out of the meat just from sitting on them.",
