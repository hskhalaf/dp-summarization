      "text": "I love fit flop's flip flops (say that 5 times fast!) and I've always wanted their sneakers. When my most recent pair of shoes wore out I decided to order these and I am not dissapointed. I love that the laces aren't real and they easily slip on my feet. They also keep my feet mostly dry even in wetter weather. The soles of the shoes help with my plantar fasciitis and I have no foot pain while wearing these, they are absolutely wonderful!! Thank you for making cute orthopedic shoes Fit Flop, my feet thank you!!",

This feels like it could be a wide width shoe even though it\u2019s B width. I highly recmmend",

Turns out they\u2019re too flat, no arch support causing my knees and low back to hurt. And the ball of my foot hurts after a few hours in them. I had to usr Dr schools insert w these for a little added support. None of my other fitflops have i had to rely on additional padding Highly Disappointed.",

They get dirty easy and are difficult/fussy to clean - and expensive. But, more stylish than regular sport shoes. Great with leggings!",

They are also wonderful for the plane as they are stretchy and when your feet get swollen on the flight, they accommodate. So glad I bought these!",
