I mean, how hard would it be to have a little video on Amazon. I may figure this out and change my mind and keep it, but right now, it is just very frustrating trying to make the velcro things work without breaking them as the mirror flops all around.",

I glued a 2\" cat eye glass mirror to the one it came with and works fine. Pity the company is so cheap they could not spend the few extra cents for a real mirror, would have gladly paid a couple more bucks to get a good mirror, that is really what your buying in the end.

With the provided hardware, the result is a wobbly mirror, and looking at the physics I can't imagine how it could ever not be wobbly. Bicycle helmets and their air gaps are just too awkwardly-shaped, and you just can't cinch down zip ties tightly enough, for the mirror to keep a solid grip. I solved that problem with a layer of gaffer tape. I'm fine with that overall, but when I think that I paid $40 for a tiny mirror and still needed gaffer tape, I can't quite give the coveted five-star rating.",

Just remember, its not like your in a car, your head is always moving and you have to move your head at times to get the perfect angle. I ride a road-bike so I move from top handle bar to lower bars periodically which would move the mirror angle somewhat. I think the cost at 40.00 is somewhat high but it was the only mirror with larger surface area and flexible arm.",

The mirror arrived with ample permanent and removable (velcro) mounting to allow me to test position the mirror on several locations on my helmet. The mirror can also be removed from the mount for easier transport. Very happy with this purchase! I would definitely recommend to friends and family.",

    "description": "The American-made Safe Zone Bicycle Helmet Mirror is simply the highest-quality helmet-mounted bicycle mirror on the market. Thousands of our customers agree, and often tell us that they find our product is superior in functionality and durability to all competing helmet mirrors. The 2.25\" mirror yields an extremely wide field of view, much larger than any other helmet mirror. The sturdy mounting is unparalleled - no weak adhesives or fragile parts to worry about! The arm is easy to adjust, maintains functionality and is guaranteed not to loosen over time. Simply attach the mirror base to the helmet with the included straps, straighten the mirror arm, and snap the mirror directly into the base to install. Once it's installed, peel off the plastic film protecting the mirror. For any mounting difficulties please contact us directly at 971-258-0925 or view the detailed photos and videos on the Safe Zone Installation tab on efficientvelo.com. The Safe Zone Mirror will fit nearly all helmets and we'll provide advice and free supplies to make the mirror work as needed.

We stand behind our products and personally service this warranty, so you don't have to worry about your bicycle rear-view needs for the length of our warranty. Try cycling the Safe Zone way! We're sure you'll agree that the Safe Zone is the most effective bicycle helmet mirror made. Please note the Safe Zone ships with a protective plastic film over mirror which must be removed before first use. Once you have the mirror mounted on your helmet, we recommend doing all major adjustments when you're not riding, and with your hand bracing the breakaway point. Once you have it adjusted to a good spot where you can see behind you and it's not blocking the main field of vision for you, you can do \"micro adjustments\" by moving the mirror when you're on a ride.",
