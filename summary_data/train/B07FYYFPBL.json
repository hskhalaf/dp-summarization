      "verdict": "Supra replenishes their product lineup with a rendition of their Stacks series and reintroduces the vulcanized interpretation as the Supra Stacks Vulc II. The vulcanized modification, designed for skaters, offers more flex, lighter comfort and great board feel as compared to a cup sole construct, which could also benefit non-skaters.Although it is marketed as a skate shoe, it is advised to use as a casual shoe to get more extended use and your money's worth. Finally, users favor this kick for its breathability, comfort, sleek style and budget-friendly price.",

        "A significant number of shoe users appreciate this sneaker's lightweight yet durable construction",
        "Some added that despite its lightweight the shoe holds up great as casual footwear",
        "Some wide-footed consumers were pleasantly surprised with the pair's ample room",

It's only glued on so there's nothing holding the black part into the white part short of that. 2) the laces are ridiculously long for these shoes. I see no reason why they have to be so long. I can live w/ that, but #1- not so much.",
