I put it on my (29er) 2019 GT Avalanche hardtail and I love it. Remember to adjust it and set it up for you. These are not plug and play. Setup is easy and the chart is on the fork for weights and psi levels. I hope this brand develops more selection and variety in the near future.",

One bump absorbs fine and the next has no travel. Unexpected function makes this a hazard on anything but smooth roads which defeats the purpose of a shock fork. Save your $$. I don\u2019t normally write reviews but losing some skin and $$ makes me want to caution anyone.",
