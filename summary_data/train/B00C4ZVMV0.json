The mattress is a great value still for the money, but $8 at Walmart makes it a crazy deal in comparison. I got the mattress as we had a hole in one of ours for when we are car camping. The mattress lost air the first two nights, but after using it a couple times it stopped stretched and held air better. For the price you can't beat the mattress, unless you buy it for $8.",

Filled with air straight from box, and has not needed a single refill. Two of us walk on it constantly and it's used almost every night. No bad smell; the ridges are love or hate (I prefer the vertical style - you can align your nose into it at night for easier breathing if you sleep on your stomach now and then).",
