I love my Ultra IP but the company did not do a good job of explaining the differences in the buttons--I had to search by googling and reading lots of blogs.",

All I can say, is, according to my experience, buy the Max, not the Ultra.",

Usually I just unplug and let it sit for a bit and then restart to not lose the pressure built up inside and it eventually works. I tried to use the chili setting on it, but it made it too watery. It really needs to be on the manual high pressure setting to get a good consistency or else you'll have to reduce it, which boils off all the flavors. But, when it works, it makes the best chili I've ever had in my life.",

    "description": "Size:6 Quart| Style:Ultra| Pattern Name:Pressure CookerInstant Pot Ultra 10 In 1 Multi-Use Programmable Cooker is the next generation in kitchen appliances. Designed for the home chef looking for a greater degree of customization and control for even greater precision cooking. The Ultra combines the functions of a Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice/Porridge Cooker, Cake Maker, Yogurt Maker, Saute/Searing, Steamer, Warmer, Sterilizer, and, a truly new and unique feature, the Ultra program. The 'Ultra' provides complete custom programming for pressure and non-pressure cooking. Now, one can set the exact parameters desired to achieve perfect results each and every time. With the 'Altitude' adjustment, the guesswork is eliminated from a recipe conversion providing a more precise cooking time. Designed with a large, blue LCD display with a 'Cooking Indicator' to provide one a clear visual on the progress of your dish from preheating, cooking, and Keep Warm. A central dial with a simple turn and press provides added precision in program selection and adjustments. And, the new - 'Steam Release Reset Button' ensures the safer handling of the steam release after cooking is completed. Built with 16 smart programs: Soup/Broth, Meat/Stew, Bean/Chili, Cake, Egg, Slow Cook, Saute/Searing, Rice, Multigrain, Porridge, Steam, Sterilize, Yogurt, Warm, Pressure Cook, and Ultra. Now, your favorite dishes are as simple as selecting your preferences and having them ready up to 70% faster. With the 'Sterilize' program one can pasteurize dairy products, sterilize baby bottles, jars, and utensils; as well as, perform certain types of canning much more conveniently than ever before! The 'Cake Maker' is designed to prepare soft and moist cakes and the 'Egg' prepares perfect eggs in just a few minutes. America's most trusted brand has moved into a category of its own with the Instant Pot Ultra! Delay Start time - Up to 24 hours. \n\nHow It Works:\nThe microprocessor carefully runs lab-tested algorithms to control the time, cooking pressure and temperature to ensure consistent cooking results. Users can customize these settings to control pressure level, adjust cooking time and a cancel button, allowing one to achieve their preferred cooking results. For instance, the \u201cmeat/stew\u201d key is programmed to prepare perfectly tender, thoroughly heated meat dishes; however, users can attain fall-off-the-bone results by adjusting the cooking time. \n\nThe fully sealed environment traps the flavors, nutrients, and aromas of the food instead of releasing them throughout the home. During pressure-cooking, heat is distributed evenly, deeply and quickly once pressure is built. In addition, minimal water is required for steaming so vitamins and minerals are not leached or dissolved. As a result, greens retain their bright colors and phytonutrients, meats and bones are thoroughly cooked yet tender, and whole grains and beans are soft and delicious, all with remarkable consistency. \n\nDesigned to cater to varying tastes and food conditions, Ultra has adjustable settings to achieve one\u2019s desired cooking results; 3 temperatures in \u2018Saut\u00e9\u2019 for searing, simmering or thickening for a maximum time of 30 minutes, and 3 temperatures in \u2018Slow Cook\u2019 to complete the tasks of a common slow cooker, \u2018Keep Warm\u2019, and 3 temperatures in \u2018Warm\u2019 to preheat food. \n\nThe 24-hour delay start allows users to postpone the cooking start to have dinner ready when you are. Automatic \u2018Keep Warm\u2019 holds the temperature of the meal until you are ready to serve. With the Ultra, one can easily turn the \u2018Keep Warm\u2019 function ON/OFF.Power supply: 120V \u2013 60Hz",
