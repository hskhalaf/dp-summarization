      "text": "Well we love this game. It\u2019s very family friendly. Easy to complete as a new \u201cgamer\u201d. Also would be great for families that have children that like to jump up and down, you can force that through the computer to your little sack person. We did finish the game quite fast, like playing 4 hours a day in 2.5 days. Which was sad because we were really enjoying it. But what was annoying is that it takes awhile to load, it seems like between each time you start a challenge it takes a long time to load. That\u2019s why i\u2019m Giving it 4 stars",

I love playing other peoples levels and think it is a game best enjoyed with an internet connection. That being said you can still enjoy the single player offline with much replayability as most levels have sticker spots with stickers acquired in different levels and you can still create offline if thats your thing too. I hope they keep making little big planet and inspiring kids and adults alike to play, create and share.",

It is much shorter of a story than the first two as there is more effort put into the building levels option and the puzzle levels. Overall, it is a good game. It is easy to learn the controls and as usual, sheer nonsense in the levels. I loved it, I just wish the story was longer; we beat the game within a weekend and we weren't playing constantly.",
