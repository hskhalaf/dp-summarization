I had to put all my food in garbage can. We can not understand why this black oxidation. This is poison. So disappointed. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY this, and don't wast your money.",

First to be scratch-off my list were those Aluminum coockers (it appears that Al is not a best choice for a pot, for helth reasons); then discarded were those with long handles: what's the point, who invented those... they take storage space for nothing. Remaining was the Presto 8qts; a bit smaller yet stainless and priced half the competition. Diameter of the pot is a great fit to lat-top stove burners; and provided removable stainless bottom tray comes handy.",

If you are familiar with pressure cookers at all it's easy, but I could see where someone not familiar might be confused as to when to start timing. It gets to pressure quickly, so once you see a fairly steady steam, start timing and turn the heat down.",

I also recommend the larger 8 qt over the 6 qt as there is less likelihood of over filling the pot and potentially plugging up the pressure relief. With the short handles on the new 8 qt version I find it easier to open and close. My new stainless is not showing any signs of the hardware corrosion reported by others. I still have my 40 year old 6 qt aluminum version of this cooker it still works!",

I didn't mess anything up and everything worked as it should. Easy to clean up too. A great addition to the kitchen.",

Stainless steel steaming basket for cooking several foods at once with no intermingling of favors. Includes a 64-page instruction/recipe book. Liquid capacity 8 quarts (7.6 liters).\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nPressure cookers have experienced renewed popularity over the last several years because cooks have rediscovered what some cooks (particularly grandmas) have known for a long time--they're really fast. And it's easy to cook healthfully with pressure cookers, since the food retains so much more of its nutrients and flavor. Presto's 8-quart pressure cooker is a multi-purpose pot that can stand in as a conventional soup pot as well as perform the kitchen magic that pressure cookers are famous for. Chicken Cacciatore cooks in 8 minutes! (The USDA recommends pressure canning as the only safe method for low-acid foods such as vegetables, meats, and poultry.) This professional-quality stainless steel pressure cooker is a handy addition to any well-rounded set of kitchen tools.\n\nThe heavy-duty lid locks down during cooking; an inner sealing ring keeps the steam in. In addition to a pop-up pressure indicator and a simple steam release mechanism, there is an overpressure plug that will let off steam if it builds up excessively. This pressure cooker is useful for weeknight dinners or for any meal that needs to come together quickly. An accompanying booklet contains 75 recipes, ranging from basic soup stocks to stews and pot roasts--even desserts like Petite Pumpkin Custards! Tenderize lean cuts of beef or pork; or cook chicken, fish, or vegetables faster than you can in a microwave, and without losing moisture.\n\nNonabrasive cleansers are best for cleaning this stainless steel pressure cooker, though occasional use of a fine metal polish will help the exterior keep its shine. The Presto 8-quart pressure cooker is fully immersible; in addition, the sealing ring should be removed after each use to allow cleaning of the inside rim of the lid. The vent pipe is simple to keep clean with a small brush or pipe cleaner, and both the air vent/cover lock and the overpressure plug are removable. The pressure cooker measures 10-1/2 inches in diameter (15-1/2 inches including handles) and 8-1/2 inches tall (including lid). Presto guarantees this pressure cooker with an extended 12-year warranty. A detailed instruction and recipe booklet is included; special safety issues that pertain to pressure cookers are clearly explained. --Garland Withers",
