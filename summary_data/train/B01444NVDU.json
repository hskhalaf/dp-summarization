I also installed an eye was station below it. The guys and I love it.",

The refill system and kanban cards are very smart. The reordering site and app require a business name even though these are marketed a lot towards home HSA/FSA customers. The mounting kit and actual mounting of the kit is solid, while still being able to remove it from the wall in case you have to grab it and go. The doors and hinges are sturdy, the latch is strong but designed to breakaway and reassemble in case you tear it open during an incident.",

I added some extra over the counter medicine needed for a 24 office like mine and had room to fit it in the box. Easy to hang as well. My only complaint would be the lever to open the box.
