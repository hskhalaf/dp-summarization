Service was even better then expected when we ordered thru Amazon. I believe they the postal service delivered it on a Sunday. We were expecting a Monday or Tuesday delivery. We also ordered the NBA 2K14 and the XBox One, along with the control charger base all in the same bundle.",

Think of it as a basketball RPG where your play determines how you are awarded points to assign to various attributes. If you are a mycareer player that already has 2k13 i highly recommend the upgrade. Last years version felt as if you had to pay to win, this year the point earning is more evenly balanced and correlates to a more readily playable character. This is a must buy for 2k fans.",

      "text": "I absolutely love the 2K franchise. I've bought everyone since Sega Dreamcast. They improve majorly by giving us a story line for Career mode and MYGM is pretty sweet as well. I would suggest improvement on the story line by giving us more roads to choose instead of having it basically all the same. I would also like to see improved player creation and voice overs. Maybe give us a choice of dialogue.",

    "title": "NBA 2K14 - Xbox One",
    "description": "Platform:Xbox One\n\nNBA 2K14\n2K\u2019s Visual Concepts studio, the team behind NBA2K14, has seen it all in the video game world. Founded in 1988, the team has experienced plenty of new gaming system launches over the years. But never one like the launch of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Re-energized by the new systems\u2019 technology, the seasoned team at VC has developed a completely new experience for next-gen NBA 2K14, featuring re-built game modes, a brand-new gameplay engine, and stunning graphics.\n\n\n\n\nNEXT-GEN VISUALS\nTo truly take the game to the next level, to nail the thousands of interconnected details that create a next generation visual experience, artists had to change the way they work, starting with the materials that make up the NBA 2K environment: rubber, plastic, metal, and vinyl. In the past, artists would individually recreate each item, but now next-gen technology enables the team to build a library of materials with the correct index of refraction, reflection amount, and so forth. Everything in-game, from the scorer\u2019s table and backboards, to human elements such as skin texture and sweat, was re-created to ensure the whole package lives up to next-gen realism.\n\nView larger ECO-MOTION ENGINE\nWith Eco-Motion, the NBA experience comes to life in new ways: Crowd reactions, atmosphere, coaching strategies, real player voices, and, most of all, the emotion of the game. Player animations are dynamic, and evolve on the fly as you play. Player personalities and emotions factor into the game as well, affecting how players perform and behave on the court.\n\nView larger NBA TODAY\nNBA Today is a brand-new feature for next-gen NBA 2K14. Stats, videos, and scores, tied to the real NBA all-new ways. The focal point of NBA Today is the Daily Zap, featuring video from the previous day\u2019s games delivered directly to your PS4 or Xbox One daily from NBA.com. Accompanying the Daily Zap, gamers can view the latest standings, scores, and top performers. The very same data used to adjust rosters using the new Dynamic Living Rosters system, all viewable 24 hours a day in NBA Today.\n\nView larger MYGM\nMyGM is a complete re-imagination of what a franchise mode should be, built exclusively for the next-gen consoles. Everything you say and do shapes the world around you as you oversee an entire organization, right down to the details of staffing, managing player expectations, game pricing, team facilities, and more. The decisions you make have ripple effects throughout the organization, both on and off the court. The Conversation Engine will remember everything you say, so each decision is vital to your success in both the short and long term.\n\nView larger MYTEAM\nMyTEAM returns in a new format. Earn, collect and build your ideal lineups to compete in tournaments, challenge online users in Road to the Playoffs, or take on actual NBA teams in the new Domination mode.\n\nView larger MYCAREER\nLive your career not only on the court but off the court too, with an all-new, player-driven narrative experience. There is a full cast of characters, endorsements from companies like adidas, Nike, and Gatorade, and branching-path storylines. Over 40 hours of gameplay await you in the first year alone. New to MyCAREER, when your MyPlayer needs a break from the grind of the NBA season, press conferences and commercial shoots, there\u2019s a place you can go to play some pickup games with 100 of your closest friends.",
