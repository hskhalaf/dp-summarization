I honestly feel I could have purchased this at a dollar store. I am going to be returning this product ASAP.",

Works great and definitely more cost-effective than a Swiffer vacuum and more maneuverable than my Dyson vacuum cleaner.",

One major complaint is that although the head snaps into place along the pole for storage, it doesn\u2019t snap into place facing up or down to sweep.
