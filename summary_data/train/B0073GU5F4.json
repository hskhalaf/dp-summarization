This is to set the appetite for real skiing down the road. I'm a bit surprised at reviews expecting these to be serious downhill skis. You probably aren't likely to find anything good at this price. These skis fit their purpose wonderfully for us: our 21-month-old son loved being able to put on his skis and stomp around on the snow for a while.",
