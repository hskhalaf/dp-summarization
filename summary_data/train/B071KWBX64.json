      "text": "What do you do when your wife and kids take your air pressure gauges? Buy a monster they can't put in the compact car glove box! These are professional grade gauges, beefy, accurate, with a snap ring so you can hand it in the shop or on your belt to show off. Can handle minor prybar applications! Two pressure heads, useful as I'm guaranteed to stop with the wheels under the fenders. Standard heads (not EU). No air release button - those are for amateurs, anyway. Can support weight of most cars when rolled over (oops). All kidding aside, very high quality, long lived air pressure gauge. I bought two, as our dog is the only family member without one",

      "text": "The gauge has all of the attributes you need to check the tires on large vehicles. It is long, the head is narrow, and the gauge goes to 160 PSI. All of my other tire gauges either could not go to the 100 PSI I needed, or the head was too large or at the wrong angle to reach into the valve step. The gauge matched the reading from the tire shop when I got new tires. I have now used this multiple times to check the air pressure on my RV and very happy with it. I would buy this product again.",

      "text": "This seems to work well, but the larger issue is that it fits my dually wheels. I recently bought a different brand where the angles on the two heads were different (specifically, one of the heads was straight (in line with the shaft of the guage), and the other was at an angle. The straight in-line head would not work with the valves on the inside of the dually - the wheel frame interfered. This pressure tester, however, fit fine - where both the inward facing and outward facing heads are NOT in line with the shaft of the gauge.",

Works well on both duals and single wheel and appears to be equally accurate at low PSI and well as high (large truck tires at 110lbs!).
