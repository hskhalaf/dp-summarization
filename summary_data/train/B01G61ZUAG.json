The much-touted comfort level of the original remains the same, but the shoe has grown lighter.Since it\u2019s covered in leather, ample support can be found.\u00a0The sneaker runs long but provides a fit that\u2019s comfortable even for wide-footed users. The only real disappointment with the shoe is that the gold detail looks more like silver.",

The green design looks great too- sporty and versatile without being too heavy and trendy. Glad I bought them- they wb 5 stars if more support for my high arch and a bit tight across top of my foot (bc of high arch). Ordered size 10 after reading the reviews- fit well and roomy, not too loose. I normally wear 10 in Nike sneakers.",

I took a chance and ordered them anyway. They're a little tight, probably should've ordered my normal size but yet, they're still comfortable. For the price that I bought them, I can deal lol! Keep in mind, the white leather is not a true white like other sneakers. It's a very (very) faint light grey/blue tint (which does not bother me and Tretorn's are known to not have true white color on their sneakers). Hope this helps!",

It also fits many outfits in addition to the casual ones. It goes with my wool coat from different brands including DVF, Max Mara, and Burberry. Some people tell me that I can wear it when it drizzles or snows (of course it won't work for a blizzard:)), but I haven't got a chance to try.",
