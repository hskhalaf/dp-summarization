I initially purchased a thinner, smaller squat pad for my hip thrusts & glute bridges which worked out great until I started lifting ~ 125lbs on my hips. Once I increased my weight over 125lbs I had to look for a different sponge and I'm extremely happy with the BEAR Strength & Conditioning Sponge. I wish I opted for it from the beginning. Word of advice: if you know for sure you'll eventually use higher weights - than it's worth investing in a higher quality sponge. Otherwise, a smaller sponge would be sufficient.",

I will say, you might want to measure your gym locker and make sure you get one that fits. I have to bend mine to fit in.",

She has used this pad twice now and has no pain at all. The redness in the back of her neck on leg day is also gone so at this point it is a great product well worth the money. Also the company emailed us to make sure we were happy with the purchase which in my experience says a lot about how much they think of there customers. I\u2019ve never had a company email me directly so in the future I would buy from them again... hope this helps",
