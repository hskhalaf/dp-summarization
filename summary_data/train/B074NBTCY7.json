There's a quick guide on the NEST site that will ask you questions about your system and will tell you if it's compatible. The physical installation was not a problem. I did have an issue with setting it up with my NEST app. Even after I scanned the code, I could not get the unit to give me its key code. I had to look at the back of the unit and manually enter the code. Once that was done it worked like a champ.",
