Use your imagination of loss in damage vs just putting your tower either on the ground or somewhere sturdy and secure. Yes I've seen pictures of people's review here putting his or her tower in the corner section but I've also seen on Reddit broken pcs falling from glass tops breaking. I don't know about you but I don't have a spare $1,000 usd sitting around waiting to hit the ground. Again, great and easy table, just don't go crazy thinking a glass top will support a 40lb-60lb tower.",

It isn\u2019t the most sturdy if you push on it from side to side. However, for what I use it for it doesn\u2019t wobble.

The mess was minimal thanks to other reviewers :) I found the instructions to be very understandable, all parts clearly marked, and nothing missing. I made two mistakes because I missed clear steps in the instructions, but both were very easy to fix because the product is made such that the bolts can be unscrewed again without stripping.",

      "text": "It was hard to put together. The tracks for the keyboard tray were too far apart so I don't even use that part so it's a waste as a computer desk for me. It just sits in the corner as a bill area. Very disappointed. I would've returned it but didn't want to bother with taking it apart and was thinking of using ties to keep the tray on, but I never did. Not too sturdy either, which is why it's just a bill desk and not a study desk - a book or two and writing would make this desk shake around.",

I'm looking to upgrade my desk now, but when I purchased it I needed something compact, relatively strong, and decent looking. This fit the bill perfectly, especially for a little over $100. Do not expect this to be an executive style desk with heaps of space. Understand its limitations and determine if it's what you need. The only con I have is the double bar running horizontally does block my legs from fully stretching out occasionally but I think I'm unique in how much I value full leg extension room. Many reviewers have had no issue with it so I wouldn't say it's enough to rate 4 stars.",

Walker Evans refused to send me the 6 missing pieces weighting about a pound, so I had to ship back the entire package weighing 66 pounds and wait for a second desk. This delay was a big inconvenience for me. Plus the thing was complicated to put together, easy to goof it up..",

I found out how by checking YouTube and finished assembly soon after. Not a planned purchase but am glad I got it.",

The support bars down by your knees are definitely a bit strange but if you find a way to tighten them down on the bottom bar of the legs then you can just rest your feet on them and have the same support for a bit more comfort.",
