I have no complaints about comfort or performance. I would buy these again instead of the name brand shoes costing twice as much.",

Other reviewers warned me, and I thought, \"How difficult can it be? The price looks good.\"",

I dont ride much other than that, so if you put tons of miles on your bike these may wear out though they seem pretty solid to me not having much experience. I would recommend these for anyone who doesnt ride a ton and is looking for an inexpensive alternative to the ridiculuously priced brand name models.",

I've worn a small hole in the right heel. 3. The cleats are a bit worn down but it is to be expected. This was definitely a good buy",
