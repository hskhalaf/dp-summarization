I used a good sharp pair of small tipped scissors and hand strength to set them free.

I have wanted a letter board forever now and I\u2019m glad this is the one I chose! It matches perfectly with the rest of the grey accents in my room. The variation of numbers and letters that they include is amazing, and they even include a bunch of fun symbols. This letterboard is the PERFECT gift.",

I also love all the words in cursive and the many pictures and \"doodles\" to add to your board.",
