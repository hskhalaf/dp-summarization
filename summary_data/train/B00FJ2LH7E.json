I called Oboz and they informed me their biggest width is E or W ( no double wides) I also ordered the boots twice and both times i received singe wide boots. This was what lead me to call the manufacturer. The single wide width seems to be about the same width as most Merrell boots I've owned. They look and feel nice, but the pair i kept are not broken in yet and have not seen any real challenge. They seem more firm than Merrells and the mid-high ankle supports on the Oboz are a little higher than my Merrell Moab Rovers.",

I'd never heard of Oboz and after my favorite boot morphed over the years to fit a narrow foot, this boot is perfect.

They are very comfortable with good protection and support on the rocky trails of N. Carolina. Ran into a couple days of rain and true to their name, the boots stayed dry. My only complaint is they seemed to slip very easily on damp rock and roots. I had to be extra careful in those situations. Not sure if this is unique to the shoe or a common criticism with any boot. I would recommend these boots as long as they fit you well.",

I am basically a 9-91/2 in most shoes, but I am a definite 10 in these, so I do advise go a 1/2 size up with Oboz. Once you hike a bit in this brand of boot, you will be a believer, I am pretty certain. I am a finicky bastard when it comes to footwear, and I am now a life-long Oboz-er.

After trying Danner, 5.11, Bates, etc, I was still not content until I bought these. These boots are comfortable all day and keep my feet warm and dry when out in weather, which it sees a lot here in Wyoming. They are very lightweight and my knees don't hurt after wearing them all day. The durability is great and after 8 months, they are showing no signs of slowing down. I will be buying another pair in the near future for hunting and would highly recommend these boots to anyone. They will not disappoint.",
