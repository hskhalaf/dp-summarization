It doesn't get timely updates (apparently known by Blu products). Not worth the money. Well not any more. Maybe if it was more open source. As far as picture quality, they are ok at best. 13 mp but the shots are not the greatest. and i know it is a budget phone but if you are called a selfie phone you should shoot some great selfie pictures. In very good lighting the pictures turn out pretty good, but again the lighting has to be spot on.",
