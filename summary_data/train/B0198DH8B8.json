I could probably fit 2 more inside. I also use one of these to hold hard bubble-foil-wrapped gum pieces, because the sharp edges have more than once jammed under a fingernail when reaching into my purse. The little bag stands up to the sharp corners with no issue. Pen added for visual size reference.",
