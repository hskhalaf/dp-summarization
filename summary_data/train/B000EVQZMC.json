The first one lasted a day and half with threads all over my house. I assumed it must have been a fluke as the first one I ordered in 2017 lasted 8 months. I gave my dog the second one and it didn't even make it thru one evening. My dog is still a large puppy and an avid chewer, but this is ridiculous! You can tell the quality has gone down from the previous version. These are very soft, whereas the first one was more rigid. Don't waste your money!",
