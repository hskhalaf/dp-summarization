I used the method of putting on a layer, wiping it off after 30 seconds, checking, then adding another layer until I was happy with the results. The tint lasts about 10 days, more if you apply it darker at first. If you are applying for event, do so maybe 3 days before so the color can fade a little.",

If you\u2019re fair, try one brow at a time so you can watch it processing and remove before your brown brows become black. If they do, no worries, it fades in time. I start with the lightest, thinnest area of my brow so it starts processing first as it needs a few more seconds than the thicker areas.",

I left it on for a total of two and a half minutes, but I would suggest starting out at one minute and then building up so you don't go too dark. It didn't irritate my skin at all to reapply it to go darker. Considering what it costs to have your brows tinted professionally, this is worth it. I can't attest to how long the tint lasts as it has only been four days, but I will update.",
