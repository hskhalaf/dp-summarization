The menu system though is very annoying, not nearly as good as Nikon for example and difficult to use and the focussing isn't very good either at selecting the most likely subject and the selected area often moves. Controls are good but a bit fiddly for bigger hands.",

The viewfinder shows no image or information and turning camera on and off does not help. The only way to unfreeze the camera is to eject the battery and restart the camera. Menu is complex but once you have set the camera up you rarely need to use this. Electronic view finder takes some getting used too and is slower than conventional SLR. LCD tends to reduce batteyr life significantly. Misses some useful features common with Nikons, e.g. ability to create picture folders, hide pictures, and selection of min/max ISO speed.",
