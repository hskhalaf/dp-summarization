Then, after not even 20 holes made it was already dull and not cutting at all, regardless of the amount of pressure applied. These are standard leather strips, supposedly what this tool was made for. The case it arrived in also has a torn zipper so that isn't even a useful item for holding the remainder of the pieces included. This was a complete waste of money.",
