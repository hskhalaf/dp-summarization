The overarching story is fantastic but it's the cast of varied and well-written characters that makes the game truly shine. I didn't have the opportunity to play through the series until a few years ago but the franchise instantly became a favorite. There's a reason there is a huge amount of nostalgia surrounding the series. This is also one of the few times I would suggest buying all of the DLC. The content will add new characters and missions as well as some various equipment. Just do it.",

Pssst ... the follow on series is better than you might think when you play it even though it seems a bit linear.",

The game does not have all the DLC but it does come with the Cerberus Network, Bring Down the Sky, and Pinnacle Station. If you want all the DLC you wont get it from this trilogy set. But if you don't really care about the DLC it's worth the price, especially if you are new to the mass effect unniverse.",

      "text": "I played through the last 2 games in this series on an Xbox360 and a PS3. I picked up this trilogy because of a sale that made it cheaper than buying just the first game in the series but even at normal prices this is a great game series that, IMHO, plays better on the PC than the console. The keyboard/mouse combo is more precise than a controller for this type of game. This does not come with all of the DLC though... I docked a star for that because, to me, a collection like this should be complete.",

This being on PC, i would highly suggest looking up HD graphics mods, which only further enhance the greatness of this title as a whole. You could play this entire series over and over and it could be completely different every time. Its just that good. Stop wasting your time. Buy this now.",
