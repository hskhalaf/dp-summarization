It uses gentle surfactants and has no fragrance or unnecessary filler ingredients. The packaging and pump mechanism is likewise simple yet high quality, it doesn't feel flimsy like some foaming pump mechanisms on cheap hand soaps. I would give it 5 stars if the price were a bit lower. That said, if you only use one pump this should last quite a while and the price is in line with other premium skincare lines such as DDF and Murad.",

      "text": "This Replenix Acne Solutions Gly/Sal 2-2 Foaming works well enough for 29-yr old adult skin that is once again dealing with acne breakouts long after treatment with Accutane seemed to eradicate it. Replenix is not on par with 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide products, however, some individuals do not need 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide or cannot tolerate the harshness of it, so this product is an excellent alternative. It is a foam, which is wonderful and preferred to liquids/gels/bars. It goes on where you want it and stays on your face. It removes makeup very well, but cannot be used for eye makeup removal safely.",

It dramatically has changed the appearance of my skin, and me helped me with acne and clean dirt. Leaving the skin clear with natural brightness. My skin type is oily and I hate it, this helps me control that too. You can see (and feel) results from the first use, but if you continue the routine for at least two weeks, you wouldn\u2019t be happier. I highly recommend this, no matter the age you are or the skin type.",

I found this to be a decent makeup remover too except you can't use it around your eyes or lips, which makes it a pain in the butt for cleansing the face and removing makeup. It also rather stinks. Funny odor. Two squirts of foam though does the trick and it washes off easily and quickly. No cloth needed.",

I do like the foam, as I feel that it works with less product compared to a gel and rinses easily.",
