If you are a expert player you may want more than this model but for beginner thru intermediate players-this will be with you for years. My second Yamaha guitar and I feel both have excellent tone, playability, and value. Looked at many inexpensive guitars before buying this and do not regret it.",

Fret work was really great for an inexpensive bass. Nothing sprouting and no bites on the hand. Neck feels good and I like the balance of it. Really like the look of the old violin sunburst and it plays great (now that it is adjusted).",

I bought the old violin finish and it just looks and feels like a really high-quality piece. It's also very comfortable to hold/play. If you are also a beginner, do yourself a favor and restring it with Ernie Ball Slinky Flatwound Cobalt strings of a lighter gauge. The difference in playability is night and day. Because they're flatwound, they won't kill your fingertips. The lighter gauge helps to reduce the amount of finger pressure you need to apply which will minimize fret buzz.",
