Tried so many pills, bamboo extract, biotin, silica from Fiji water, no change until my beautician advised silica but by this particular brand only for great quality and absorption. She also told me about taking Ester C by solgar. I started taking both daily. 3 months later I noticed no hair in the shower drain. Could hardly believe Been taking for close to 10 months, got my mom in it too, she is noticing difference after 2 months. Gonna stick with it!",

My husband and I began taking these daily and within the week we could see the hairs on our arms growing in thicker....so we did before and after photos, 2 months go by and our hair has gotten to lush its insane! Nails so hard they're hard to clip....so not a bad thing. If you suffer from brittle hair, hair loss, skin issues, bone pain, or brittle nails, get this!! And stick with it. I also noticed within the month the pain I'd have in my knees or elbows after a days work wasnt there anymore...I'm 30 and I felt 20 years old after taking this for a month. Unreal stuff.",

I try really hard to get all my vitamins from whole foods and on top of that, supplement with stuff for an additional hair/skin/nail boost like biotin, collagen, hyaluronic acid, etc. This Solgar oceanic silica is the only thing that has made a significant difference for me (supplement-wise). My nails grow really fast and strong after taking 2 capsules, 2x daily with meals for what seems like only a week, and somehow my nail beds look healthier too. I stopped for a while when I ran out to see how another hair/skin/nails supplement fared for me, and after coming back to this, have realized how effective/awesome it is. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "Personally, for my body needs and response, this Solgar silica works best. I've noticed the more popular silica brand, which I've used for years, has gradually reduced the capsule content. Capsules reduced to half full. I actually found these by Solgar through researching then muscle testing for my body. The Solgar Oceanic are my #1 choice. Better hair strength, nail strength and skin which are external evidences. I suspect the internal evidence is bone happiness & wellness.",
