I may try to take it apart to see if there is anything I can tighten. Update, the upper cover comes off and there is a tension screw you can tighten. Issue fixed. This is not in the instructions.",

I found that the original antenna was power activated and the dealer was the only place that had the antenna, but the cost out weighed my decision to buy the antenna, so again thank you very much for being their to help. Great service, shipping, and product inventory.",

Put it on a pontoon boat console that is fiberglass and is thicker compared to auto body sheet metal. Had trouble getting the nut attached to hold the base on. That was on me. Not sure if it stated the minimum-maximum thickness the base would work on, when I ordered it. All in all it's mounted, and works OK.",

      "text": "I ordered a pair of these little antennas to mount on either side of my Peterbilt 330 cab. I had to relocate the radio antenna because a rig mast would otherwise hit it. From past experience with an International S Series truck with a single antenna mounted at the right front pillar of the cab windshield, I did not want to experience reception blocking of the radio signal by the structure of the truck cab. I have these antenna mounted one each side of the cab. They are short enough that they won't be hit by objects overhead but will still capture the broadcast single no matter which way the truck is facing.",
