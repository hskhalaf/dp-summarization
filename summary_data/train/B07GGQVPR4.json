Then the company forces a firmware upgrade through the app and tell you that you need to switch apps to \"Ecovacs Home\". I did this and it absolutely ruined this robot. It gets stuck in the middle of the floor, gets tangled up in its own charging station, and can barely get out of the room that its charging base is in. I'm past the return date and product support window per Amazon. I paid 399 for this when I bought it off Amazon. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT you will be very disappointed and have an expensive brick.",
