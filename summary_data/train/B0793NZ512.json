Once the pieces are apart it\u2019s not an easy rinse off since the pulp is stuck in the chute, I have to jab a stick in there and try and pull it out. Clean up lates about 15-20 mins.

We juice daily, carrots, beets, cucumber, celery, cilantro, zucchini and some other things. We had to be careful to mix the most fibrous of these and cut in tiny pieces and juice interspersed with the more watery veggies. It worked great until tonight when the top portion cracked during juicing for no apparent reason. Very odd and I'm sad it broke after the warranty was expired. Overall it's a decent juicer for light use id say. Loved the wide chute! OK value for the money, but if you really want to juice every day you need something more heavy duty.",

More importantly, the pulp come out really dry so i am wasting any fruit, unlike the one I got before.",

I juice celery daily and need something to hold up to it, the celery pulp constantly backed up into the filter chamber which caused the juice to leak out, pulp would also end up in my juice. It was easy to use and clean. I have returned my upright model and am hoping the other model will be better!",
