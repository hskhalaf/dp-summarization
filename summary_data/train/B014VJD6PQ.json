Is someone sneaking in and charging it at night, or have we somehow stumbled into the solution for sustainable energy? Could I run a car off of this thing? Should I send it to the DOE for examination? Are we already the unwitting subjects of a government experiment? Are we safe around this thing? I am afraid.",
