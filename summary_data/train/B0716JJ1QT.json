The placement of keys are little weird because they included the num pad on the right so you need a day or two to get used to it . (Fun fact: they sent the original windows installation disc and driver CD inside the box but the computer doesn't have a CD drive )",

I was suckered in by the great specs. Specs aren't everything you can't enjoy this laptop because its uncomfortable to use. Stay away and buy a good brand Dell, Apple, Asus please don't make my same mistake I wish I can switch this laptop out for something better it's an embarrassment to use.",

Blazingly fast, can handle everything I throw at it. Looks beautiful too. Highly recommended. I'm not a gamer but plan on getting some games just because this rig can handle them. Also it's surprisingly light, much more so than I expected which is good as I travel a lot. Eventually plan on adding a 2nd HD for storage. You will be happy with this laptop. As far as I'm concerned it's the best you can get for under $2-2,500",

Eluktronics made this laptop very easy to upgrade, so you could add the ram yourself and save a little money.",

I under-volted which dropped temps about 10-12 degrees which was a bonus. I have a laptop from a few years ago by Clevo and this is the same quality. Screen was uniform, high quality and the laptop itself was surprisingly light for its size. The trackpad is nice and smooth, the keys were nice and bright although the only downside id say is the left side gets warm but that's not anyone's fault. Overall was a really good purchase and highly recommend this laptop for on the go gaming or desktop replacement.",

The only limitations are the SSD, which performs at a SATA level, rather than the M.2 PCIe level you would expect (but still, it's an SSD, so it blows HDDs out of the water), and the speaker (but I've never heard a good laptop speaker).",

I cant give it 5 stars because I havent used it all too much since Ive got it (due to surgery) I even called their customer support for a quick/easy answer and it was absolutely painless JUST LIKE IT SHOULD BE. And that is greatly appreciated. I will update this when I have used it more",

If you want to upgrade the base model you can buy straight from eluktronics to maintain your warranty. Also love that windows comes installed clean except for the software to control the custom hardware. Overall a great gaming laptop that isn't as gaudy as a typical gaming laptop.",

      "text": "Laptop came as advertised. Never heard of this company as they are new to the market. This laptop works great. Purchased for my daughter as the laptop she had been using was outdated and buttons started to fall off. Able to play Overwatch with no issues. Many inputs built-in as the laptop has an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, and headphones. Very easy to setup. I would recommend this laptop. Also no \"trial software installed\" which, in my opinion, is a nuisance.",

      "text": "Great laptop. Runs cool and the build is very solid. The IPS screen is amazing..... However, initially there was a problem. The WLAN driver was causing the system to reboot....frequently. A couple of drivers were updated before I realized that the WLAN driver was the problem. After it was updated this system became a tank and now handles anything thrown at it. It's a fantastic piece of equipment. And, as a night owl, the backlit keys are so sweet.",

I highly recommend this product. Also my final note would be to add a primary component list so I know what's inside if I need to replace or add anything. I'd love to know without opening what 8gb ram stick I have in order to get another to bring it up to 16gb.",

PUBG on medium settings is also very smooth. Battlefield 4 and Battlefront 2 on medium settings are also great! SO far very happy with the purchase!",

The second is that there is no way to control keyboard backlight on Linux. I would change my rating if either of the problems would be solved. All in all is a good device and I can recommend it despite the problems described above.",
