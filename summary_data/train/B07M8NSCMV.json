The suit is very conferrable, and fits very well (it is expectedly tight). The only complaint is I've developed a small hole in the back webbing, which I would not expect given how shortly I've had it. I'll update this if I can remember if this hole becomes a bigger issue.",

Still too tight. I'm not that big. Figure out how to get the sizing right before you buy. I got stuck with restocking fee.",

The size L had too much fabric and irritated my skin where it would bunch up (soft spots). My opinion is the previous chamois pads are more comfortable/firm than these. I recommend buying true to size.",

    "description": "The Free Aero Race short is the all-around race short Castelli supplies to Team Sky, as well as all race teams they\u2019ve sponsored since 2007. But that\u2019s not enough of a reason for you to just go out and buy a pair. Since these guys ride over 30,000 kilometers per year, we consider them ideal testers and continuously solicit their feedback. The difference is that we actually listen to them. And the good thing for you is that the pros are looking for comfortable shorts too, so this short is made to be minimalist and fast, but without sacrificing all-day comfort. For this year Castelli has made subtle but important refinements. The seat pad has been updated with a softer, stretchier and totally seamless top layer. The leg gripper is also stretchier and grips better. The bib straps are both lighter and more comfortable while giving better support.",
