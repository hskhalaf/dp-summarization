As another review noted, if you own the Mark II version, this may not be a compelling upgrade. However, if you are new to Olympus, this is a great camera. Though it\u2019s a 16MP sensor vs. the Sony\u2019s 20, in practical use, there\u2019s no discernible difference in image quality.",

I will say unboxing was simple, fun, and quick, which had me taking pictures in less than 2 minutes from picking it up off my doorstep. I look forward to many more amazing pictures and learning how to maximize the cameras use.",

I would prefer to reserve 5 for truly \"ideal\" products. There are probably not many of those, but this comes pretty close. For example, I would like a bigger sensor with more resolution that would improve the chances of getting sharp photos taken in low light on the fly. If Olympus did that, with the same current features, I would upgrade in an instant.",

It's solidly made and will allow me to add on accessories as I become more adept at handling it. It has, in a way, the weighty & familiar feel of my OM-1. The quality is great and positioning of dials is easy to learn. I'd recommend this camera to any beginner who wants a camera that will help them develop their photo skills.",

      "text": "Great update of the original OM-D E-M10. It adds 4K video and an easier menu system and takes great pictures like its previous models. I'm not sure that anyone owning the OM-D E-M10II would benefit much to upgrade to this model, unless they want the 4K video. I own the original E-M10 and I am really enjoying some of the newer features. It is easy to use for beginners and a good way to get started in more advanced photography.I think more advance photographer would also like the camera. I love the size and weight of the Olympus micro four third cameras. They are great for travel with very little compromise in picture quality when compared with larger sensor cameras.",

Received it fine, and got to test shoot with it for a day or two. I highly advise you rethink about a self retracting kit lens before purchasing this. The shots it took were great. The body is lightweight. The features are nice. However, on only my second instance using the camera the auto retracting kit lens jammed upon trying to enter sleep mode, a huge bummer. Had to return it for that reason. Exploring other options for a mirrorless camera for now.",
