I never thought a little motor like it has to open a little lid would need 3 D batteries, and that those batteries would only last 1-2 months at best.....and now for the past 3 months the lid hardly opens when needed. I've read several reviews about this exact same problem, and our friend's does not work now either. In reading their warranty page, I love how it says \"Manufacturer will not offer any refunds or product upgrades\"....Real nice! Thanks NineStars, I wonder if you're actually still in business?",

This one is big enough to support out family of 5 but at the same time not so big that the trash smells by the time you need to change it. I love the automatic lid. The sensor is great and so far the battery life has been really strong. I expect I will order a second one of these for our downstairs kitchen. Highly recommend.",
