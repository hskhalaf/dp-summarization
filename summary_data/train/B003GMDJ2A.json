I'm a small guy and couldn't adjust the straps to fit close. Still the apron felt oppressive and didn't move well. Used for plasma cutting and after first use found that everywhere a hot piece of metal landed the leather shrunk and now I have a warped apron. Still works. I suppose leather does that anyway so its not the products fault. Might be more appropriate for different activities",

The straps and belt were easy enough to figure out and adjust. The apron is rather thin suede and not stiff at all. Wish I'd found this apron before.",
