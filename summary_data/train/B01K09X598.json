Cons: The white top will stain upon contact with any sort of dark liquid (e.g. coffee ring,etc.) so use a coaster. Also, the integrity of the piece is poor \u2014 it is wobbly. However, these are acceptable deficiencies given the low price. I would rather have the extra $ and use a coaster and have a slightly wobbly bedside table. Overall: Good for those interested in purchasing a piece for the short term that looks elegant but does not have $$$ price.",
