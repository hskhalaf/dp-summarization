They both picked it up very quickly & by lesson 11 ready didn't need my guidance at all. I'm hoping this will be a start in developing an interest in learning electronics and/or programming. Well worth the money.",

      "text": "Although Arduino can work with Macs, apparently sometimes it has problems finding the port. We constructed this and then tried it on two different laptops and a desktop. On all three, the programs wouldn't upload to the arduino. Very very disappointing. The book we have even used a Mac as it's example so it's obviously possible. I'm giving it three stars because it came with everything it had and construction of the materials themselves was easy. But it seems possible that this product in particular isn't interfacing well with Apple products.",

I am now the proud owner of a huge assortment of wonderful doo-dads, gizmos and thingamabobs about which I know absolutely nothing, with few exceptions , but I'm looking forward to learning!",
