No way to put that back on without retapping the hole - Plastic parts, like wand holster, are flimsy, and poorly secured - Not as powerful as other similar PSI models that I've used - Short hose - Wheels are terrible!!! - Chemical suction hose is pathetic, and poorly placed. It will get burned from proximity to hot engine",

I stopped them there to explain that I didn't buy it to have to take it to a service center, that I expected it to be free from defects on delivery. I called Amazon to return it and they were great and got me setup for a return and refund pronto...thanks Amazon, always great! Maybe I just got a lemon, but not willing to keep it.",

The muffler cover smoked too as the paint was baked for the first time. Neither of these concerned me as I expected it in a brand new engine.",
