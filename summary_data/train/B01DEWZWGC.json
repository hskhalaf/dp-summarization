Amazon said it was past the 30 day exchange period so I had to contact Panasonic. After about a month of dealing with four different divisions at Panasonic through over a dozen emails, over 20 phone calls and several online chat sessions, they said it wasn't covered under the warranty and that I would have to pay $40 to have it replaced. Will never do business with Panasonic again!!!",

You cannot add time to a item that is already cooking. This does not help at all when you are trying to make popcorn. No easy set buttons like a 30 sec button. Good value for the money, wouldn't buy this microwave if there were any other choices available when I purchased this one. If you just use to warm up items this works just fine.",

This one is easy and quiet as it closes. I also love the feel of the touchpad since the buttons are slightly raised and I can feel that the button was pushed so that I don't hit it twice and set the microwave for 11 minutes instead of 1. This microwave is also very easy to clean with smooth, rounded corners. Overall, nothing to complain about.",
