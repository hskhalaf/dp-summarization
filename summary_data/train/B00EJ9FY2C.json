The effects are really awesome too, especially if you have multiple bulbs. Plus, add it in to home automation recipes through things like IFTTT and it's great. I don't know how I would feel about it at regular retail price, but if you catch it when it's on sale, you should buy one. I'll tell you, though, it's like like a Pringles - betcha can't just eat (buy) one. It just puts the concepts of normal lighting to shame and it's very bright (if you want it to be)",

But that really makes the most sense, in case you don't have your phone easily available when you walk in the door and you want to see where you're going. Otherwise, you may flip the switch and be bathed in a bluish pink tint, from your last nights party. (There's lots of apps for all platforms that support LiFX and Hue at the same time, for you Hue lovers)",

I have had 2 of these bulbs on my porch for halloween and the spooky colors you can get from these bulbs is fantastic. I had a Deep red and a dark purple that looked amazing even when it was daylight. Now I have one green and the other red for Christmas! I live in Louisiana and the muggy, rainy, humid heat has had no effect on them outside. They are always connected and come on and off when I schedule them to do so. Setup is very easy and streamlined. Anyone with a smartphone can do this.",

It is very bright, the app is good, and it has IFTTT support (although the delay between IFTTT triggers and the bulb actually doing stuff is long. Im sure that's more to do with IFTTT than the actual bulb). It also doesnt need a hub like with more expensive bulbs like the Philips Hue. I'm going to replace all my bulbs with this. BTW, you don't need the app to control the bulb. If you turn the light switch off and on again, it will just turn on with the last settings you had it on. Then it will just work like a normal light bulb.",

Well, it is as bright as a regular bulb and took about 2 minutes to set up and am very pleased with it. Yes, it runs a little hot. However, I remember popcorn poppers as a child that used a 100 watt incandescent, and the LIFX is definitely not that hot. As soon as I can save more money and my wife lets me, Im going to be buying many more.",
