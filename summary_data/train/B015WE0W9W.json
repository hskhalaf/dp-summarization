I just want this to be known so others can not hold high hopes on getting exactly what they ordered, but I will say the weight numbers are good, and they still work as they should, just not at all as described in color.",

The little rack is pretty crappy quality to begin with, but the fact that it\u2019s missing screws makes it basically worthless (unless I just wanna run out to Home Depot to grab some). Weight quality is whatever. Nothing spectacular, but I like that they are black. I could\u2019ve seriously gone to Walmart and gotten colored weights for less money. Pretty livid that the screws are missing. Grrrrrr!!",
