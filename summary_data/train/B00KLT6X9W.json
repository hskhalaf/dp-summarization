Also, the bag was stiff and did not form around the contents. The bowl under the bag had to be the width of the bag to catch all drips. The bag came untied twice and fell, splash, into my drip bowl. So, a simple straining process grew to cleaning up whey splattered on me, the counter, and the wall. I would not recommend this product.",

Well, this led into several failed attempts where the paneer would stick to the cloth or the cloth just became a soggy mess. This bag worked perfectly! The material is sturdy and held the paneer without becoming too limp. It was easy to squeeze the excess liquid out without losing any of the yummy stuff. And then... it was super easy to clean and store away in the kitchen. I can\u2019t wait to explore what else I can make with this bag such as almond milk. I will never buy cheesecloth again!",

I refuse to reward that kind of bait and switch I tried to be all earth-friendly, and get a set of organic cotton nut milk bags. It didn\u2019t matter whether I was making almond milk, soymilk or oat milk. The pores of the bag got clogged immediately, and I\u2019d spend twenty minutes trying to squeeze the milk through. Forget that. This bag is SO much easier, but still strains the milk beautifully. It\u2019s large enough to handle a whole batch, and sturdy enough that it\u2019s already held up to dozens of uses.",

My plan was to use it for straining things like \"fire cider\" and elderberry tincture. My first use was ginger extract. I was able to use it one more time before cleaning it became unreasonable. Little bits of ginger and berry get stuck in the seam, and have to be picked out one by one. I can't even fathom using it for ground nuts, unless the natural oils help them release more easily. It's a great idea, but something has to be done about the seams. Surely there's a better way.",

It\u2019s still going strong, even after all that use. Some tips: Take the drawstring out if you don\u2019t need it. Turn it inside out to use it. The inside hem just collects debris from whatever you\u2019re straining and it\u2019s kind of a pain to clean. If you use it inside out, it rinses out much easier! I just rinse mine well, wash with some Mrs. Meyer\u2019s dish soap, rinse again and hang to dry.",

The bag caught probably 99% of the grounds, with only a few grams (out of 450 grams) of the finest grounds making it through. Those sunk to the bottom of my mason jar, so all I had to do was pour the cold brew out and rinse out the sludge on the bottom. The bag was also very easy to rinse clean with nothing more than water. I hung it up to line dry and it is ready to use again. Great product! Thanks.",
