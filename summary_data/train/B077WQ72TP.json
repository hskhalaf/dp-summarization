I have many computers that I run almost like a server so I don't have them all connected to keyboards/mice making this item a godsend for me. I can plug it in any computer and it works instantly. It has made going between all my computers so much easier. I do not have to deal with 2 devices (keyboard and mouse) and there connections anymore. This simple item has solved this dilemma for me. I strongly recommend this product for making your like much easier should you need a device to quickly go between different computers or maybe for an HTPC.",

It can feel a little cheap at times if you try to type too fast, and the mouse tracking can be a bit sluggish with accidental clicks happening frequently. All of those issues can be solved by slowing down how many inputs you try to put in which isn't hard, but it can be frustrating sometimes.",
