The adjuster could be a bit better to allow a tighter grip but honestly if you use a shower cap and then put this steamer over it, it fits great! The high level gets high, like really high. I wasn\u2019t expecting that but again it\u2019s what I needed. It\u2019s not loud at all. The cord is a bit short but aside from that nothing but good things! I\u2019ve recommended this to a few people already.",

I have only used it twice since purchasing it a few days ago and it has made my hair feel softer and look shinier. I highly recommend it if you want to increase the health of your hair.",
