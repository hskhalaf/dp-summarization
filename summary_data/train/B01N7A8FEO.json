Putting it together was easy with two people and took about 20 minutes. The shelf looks nice but we needed to put styrofoam under it to make it stand straight. I wouldn't use it for heavy usage as it seems like the finish would chip off. I am using mine for decorative items only. When we were putting it together, some of the finish was flaking off.",
