Due to the configuration of the grill grate, I do not get an even char or much grill flavor. I chose this grill because of the dual burners, so I could do indirect cooking. Due to the small size, I do not see enough of a temperature difference to allow for this method, resulting in overcooked food. It is too late to return, so it's going into the trash.

Since I keep mine outside, rain fills the drip pan regularly with greasy water that then drips onto patio. Disposing of gas bottles. The camping gas bottles are (relatively) cheap, convenient but not refillable and not easily disposed of in a ecologically responsible way. Better to buy a refillable bottle and the connecting hoses if you want to use the grill a lot.",

We'd like to be able to find the fitting we can use so that we can connect the grill to the propane supply for our diesel motorhome rather than use the very small, non-refillable propane bottles. In order to use the motorhome propane supply (which has it's own regulator) we need to take the regulator off the grill and install a metric fitting to the grill. We haven't been able to locate the metric fitting. Since this is a grill used by many rv'ers, one would think that Coleman would engineer the propane supply capability we're looking for into the grill.",

We opened the box and before we even started to remove it from the box, the broken piece fell out. We had to finish unpacking it to see where it came from. Since it is to bulky and heavy for us to repackage and return for replacement, we will just try to order the part from Coleman. Hoping this review is helpful. We have no complaints at this time with the grill since we haven't used it yet. Just unhappy with the condition when it arrived.",

Make sure to get a few extra cannisters of propane, the small ones do not last too long. Just one tiny gripe, the grill is fairly heavy but its actually a good thing so it wont fall over to easily.

    "title": "Coleman Propane Grill | RoadTrip LXE Portable Gas Grill",
    "description": "Show off your grilling skills on camping trips and picnics and at tailgating parties with the Coleman RoadTrip LXE Portable Propane Grill. This outdoor grill combines a collapsible design with convenient features that facilitate grilling in tough conditions. The grill's individually adjustable dual burners each blast out 10,000 BTUs of heat, giving you enough cooking power to prepare a wide range of foods, from grilled veggies to thick slabs of steak. The Swaptop interchangeable design allows you to switch out the grill grates for a griddle top or stove grate (both sold separately), while the Instastart ignition lets you light the burners simply by pushing a button. Ideal for summer cookouts, this portable gas grill also excels in chilly conditions thanks to PerfectFlow technology, which helps ensure steady heat output. Sliding tables on both sides of the grill provide easy access to ingredients and utensils and can be tucked away for easy transport and storage. With its 285-square-inch cooktop, this grill offers a large cooking surface area without sacrificing portability. Its collapsible stand sets up in seconds and folds up for compact storage, while its large handle and wheels make the grill easy to transport. And thanks to its porcelain-coated cast iron grates and removable grease tray, this camp grill is easy to clean.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nTake the convenience, efficiency, and versatility of the household barbecue grill on the road this summer with the clever Roadtrip Grill LXE from Coleman. Whereas other portable liquid propane grills are petite and tabletop in design, the Roadtrip LXE is a full-size grill with collapsible scissor legs for countertops or travel. This 36-inch grill features 285 square inches of cooking space, ideal for toting to the beach or just into the driveway a small block party. Two 10,000 BTU burners cook meats evenly. Independent control knobs allow users to adjust temperatures on either burner for flexibility. \n\n The grill comes equipped with two warp-resistant cast-iron grill grates, coated in porcelain for cleaning convenience. Two side tables attach to the grill's sides for extra preparation space and store neatly under the grill. A grease tray catches drippings, sliding out for cleaning. The grill is outfitted with an Instastart electronic ignition. The grill affixes to a standard 16.4-ounce disposable propane cylinder, or can be hooked up to a 20-pound tank with an additional accessory purchase. Burning on high with a propane cylinder, the grill operates for 2.1 hours, while low settings allow operation for up to 4.5 hours. A heavy-duty vitreous lid cased in painted steel contains flames to reduce hazard while barring access to bugs and debris. The collapsible legs feature two wheels on one end and a wide handle on the other for towing. To clean the cooking surface, use mild detergents and avoid steel wool. Coleman offers several interchangeable Roadtrip cooking surfaces, including a stovetop and griddle, for separate purchase. This grill requires assembly. Coleman offers a limited five-year warranty for this item. Collapsed, the grill measures 36 by 22 by 13 inches with a shipping weight of 60 pounds. Propane is not included. --Jessica Reuling",
