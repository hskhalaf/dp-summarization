My dog is a very picky eater, but since making the change to Lil' Plates...he loves eating. I am so happy to find a high nutritional quality, grain free dog food that he likes. The value of the product cannot be beat. I have seen an improvement in him physically and mentally in terms of energy. I want to give my pet the best nutrition possible, and I also want him to enjoy what he is eating. Even as a dog, you only live once!",

I thought I would introduce a little variety and ordered Merrick Lil'Plates grain free real salmon. Both times I gave it to him he picked at it and then vomited. I stopped it immediately and went back to the Merrick Black Country Raw Infused. I highly advise not buying this dog food.",
