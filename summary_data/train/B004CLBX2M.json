Most these types of gates had a easy turn dial which does not need tools; just why \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019d still get this gate every time since the opening is wide enough that you don\u2019t need to slip through till you lose that baby weight (13 years and counting \ud83d\ude02).

It's made of quality sturdy metal but I would not recommend.",

I'm hoping I can still return after ordering it months ago.",
