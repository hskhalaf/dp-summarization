My only wish would be that the volume control were concealed or to be able to 'lock' the volume at a certain decibel. These girls want it LOUD and gMa needs it a little quiet sometimes. It does seem durable though and they really like it alot. (I know, they are a little young for it but, I wanted to instill music early!.}",

First of all, when they say gigantic, they mean gigantic. Secondly, I doubt you\u2019re kids are going to be Mozart with this thing so your ears are going to bleed. Luckily, it has great volume control and you can turn it to a reasonable volume level. I\u2019m giving it 4 stars because it works in every way it is supposed to, but the box states that you should not fold it up for storage or it can short out. Considering this thing is longer than Shaq, that\u2019s a con. Anyway, my kids love it.",

The fact that it's musical and has a large age-range of who would enjoy playing with it was a huge selling point. Great quality, no issues, many hours of entertainment, and the fact that you can record the music and play it back after is awesome.",

It would be perfect if the volume was easily controlled, but it is on the corner of the mat which is most likely to get stepped on by a toddler and turn to full volume. Also on the other corner is the button for playing the same time over and over again, so my son hits that and then the thing plays on repeat until I get up and go step on the button again. Highly highly annoying. The piano part is nice, I just wish they had thought through the settings better.",

The best reason to encourage children to play with this toy is it helps kids experience having control of something. I love the playback feature because it reinforces what the child created.

Also Record is easily hit by mistake then going back to playing is not trivial, I still haven't completely figured it out. Overall it's a good product.",

Batteries last forever, although being able to plug it in would be better; we taped down the edges so no one would trip over them, but since the battery compartment is accessed from the bottom we need to take it all off in order to change the batteries when they do need it. A great size for young kids, a bit fiddly for adults who want to play along but not impossible. The different instruments extend the fun, but we haven't really gotten any use out of the recording function.",
