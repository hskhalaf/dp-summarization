As the mallow heats up that little fork they give you allows it to slide everywhere. Would be very easy to drop a mallow right on the heating element. If you're not at least minimally talented with your hands, and paying 100% attention while using it, your gonna drop one. If that happens the device is burnt toast. Works great if you're careful. I definitely wouldn't let kids under 18 toast their marshmallows though. The device wouldn't last long.",

Also, I believe the whole system it is unsafe to use with little children, as the heater sits on top of the food holders.

      "text": "For some reason I was unable to put the brown tray on the bottom and when I did, it was unstable. As a result I just use the tray on the side or put my s\u2019mores ingredients on my own plate instead. All of my guests who have tried the machine with me LOVE it. It\u2019s cute, it works, it is perfect! Takes a few minute to heat up then could take a few more minutes to heat up a marshmallow but the waiting period gives time to chat it up with friends. Only issue was that I accidentally had my marshmallow touch the top tray and as a result it\u2019s now stained; I couldn\u2019t wash it off either.",

Also, the electric cord needs to be longer so it can sit in the middle of your table. We have to plug it in on a side table or counter and stand there till done! They taste real good when they are done, but I am still disappointed; however my kids think it is awesome.",
