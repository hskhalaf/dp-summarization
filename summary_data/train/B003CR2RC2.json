Unfortunately, the fragrance doesn't really linger. I understand that a body wash isn't exactly cologne, but I would expect the scent to last for at least part of my day. For this reason, I can't really justify the (somewhat high) price of this product. It's no different than a $6 bottle of Dove for Men.",

I work outdoors/in camping conditions during the summer and was searching for a decent quality shampoo and body wash that wasn't overpoweringly \"girly\" or \"manly\" smelling and that came in a reasonable size to last a couple of months, but not feel wasteful. This is great - deals with all the grime, is a refreshing minty scent (although slightly more \"manly\" than neutral), and doesn't make my hair all frizzy. I've used it for the past 2 summers and will be purchasing it again for this coming summer.",

I'd say 2-3 months with light daily use. Yes it is probably the most expensive body wash you will buy but it is a higher quality. However, the scent doesn't last long at all on your body. Pretty much vanishes once out of the shower. Still enjoy it though.",

This product's best attribute is that it does not dry the skin nor leave an oily residue. Sorry guys if this is a turn off for you, but as a woman it is so nice to have found a product with these qualities.",
