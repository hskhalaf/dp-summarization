Yes, it broke in half. The metal casing just fell apart, the oil came out out and the hammer mechanism fell out. I couldn't believe it. Will just save my money for a Bosch or Hitachi demo hammer. I thought I was saving money, but it turned out I wasted money. Buyer beware.",

I received a quick response to my email from xtremepiwerusa and they said to use \"20-40 weight motor oil\". More than a few reviews mentioned oil leaks. I noticed a slight film of oil on the toolbit after removing it. Not enough to run down the bit. Plenty of power for occasional home use.Hope it lasts.",

I removed approx 1200 sq ft of travertine tile in about 2 hrs (with a few 5 min breaks).",

      "text": "$139. This jack hammer is a wonderful deal. I have used it to remove 1500 sq. feet of tile and glued down wood floor. You can rent something similar but you will end up paying more for the rental than just buying this unit. I thought because of its low price it might last halfway through my job. After 1500 square feet it still works like new. I also purchased two wider bits for removing flooring.",
