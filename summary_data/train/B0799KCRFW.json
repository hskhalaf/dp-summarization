I also had a Roomba that I got from Costco for about $400 with no remote. It would keep giving me error notifications. So I returned the Roomba and got another one of these for my living room. When I got this new one, I couldnt charge it using the dock but that happened with the previous one as well. If that happens just clean the pins on the dock and the vacuum itself.

My only complaint is that I need the hepa filters.. but I learn to search for other models filters with same size. But the robot is amazing. Don't waste money on expensive brands, you are paying only the brand, this is better, stronger and friendly. I recommend for dirt places because its trash space is bigger.",

I would recommend that iLife reprogram for multiple passes and a scrubbing pad. This would improve the mopping option significantly. I like the drip system instead of a spray which would dampen furniture legs. Haven't tried the vacuuming feature yet as the floor had already been swept. Will repost later.",
