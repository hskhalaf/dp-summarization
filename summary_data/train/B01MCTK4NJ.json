After hand loading the filament until it came out of the nozzle at ~220C, I started the first print at 10mm/s for all speeds, Great result first time out - zero issues. Printed a second part at 15mm/s and again was impressed with the result. Will test at higher speeds over time but for now, I am very happy with the outcome.

The SainSmart TPU filament has no jamming problem for me. In fact, I can print SainSmart successfully even after turning the speed back up to 50% of my PLA speed. If you have a Bowden extruder, I would recommend the SainSmart TPU over this TPU. I have successfully printed small parts, taking around an hour or less, with this filament, but I don\u2019t recommend the filament.",

The filament worked as predicted and has nice flexibility and seems to work just as well as some more pricey TPU I\u2019ve purchased in the past. It\u2019s a little stringy, but that\u2019s tough to eliminate entirely with TPU. Bed adhesion was strong on my Prusa MK3. I forgot to protect the bed with a layer of glue or hairspray, but the print did not damage my bed\u2019s surface, fortunately.",
