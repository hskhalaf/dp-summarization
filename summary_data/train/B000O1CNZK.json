Instead of using the pull out drawers, I replaced it with another cabinet unit with a swinging door. That order was from another site that sold the cabinets as individual units. My office mate purchased 6 units as well, and together they look like one large unit. I would highly recommend this product. We receive lots of compliments! Thanks!",

Once you have all the pieces together and configured in the layout you want, they are easy to attach to one another, don't wobble, shift around, or otherwise seems structurally deficient.",
