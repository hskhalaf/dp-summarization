This might work great for other skin conditions and people but just has not lived up to the hype and I'm not thrilled that I spent so much money to find out it didn't work.",

The only issue is the smell, it\u2019s not what you\u2019d expect in a lotion. I don\u2019t want to say it stinks but there\u2019s definitely a medicine/ointment smell to it. The smell dissipates after awhile but initially, it\u2019s not something you\u2019d cuddle up to.",

I prefer scent free and this was minimal. I will not return this because of the mess and will purchase again. Maybe I'll get lucky with a better pump and more product in the container.",
