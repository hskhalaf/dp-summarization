Your back never really feels like its resting against the back of the chair. You get a roller in the behind when you sit down till you get the thing going. Unless I'm missing something nothing is every in contact up around your shoulders what so ever. Yea get a pillow if you want to watch tv while using. I'll to do some more testing and research, maybe missing something.",

Good Price World and Eric already has sent me shipping info on extra padding for foot massage. No extra charge for padding and they are even picking up cost of shipping. Chair is very quiet.

As for the actual chair, it\u2019s comfortable and effective. It gives an excellent massage to the middle to lower back. It doesn\u2019t do as well on shoulders and neck, but overall works as intended. I also agree with some of the other reviewers who mentioned intensity of the foot pressure. Even at the lowest intensity setting it feels like it might crush my feet, so I often don\u2019t use the foot massage portion of the chair.",
