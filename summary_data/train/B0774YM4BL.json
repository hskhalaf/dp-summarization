We installed in our motorhome and it holds up well while we have traveled. The lid has not popped open and holds all our tooth brushes. Was a good purchase. Customer service: recommend looking into your glue strips not peeling without ripping the padding up.",

When I saw this product I figured we would try it. When my son saw it he was ecstatic, because he would no longer have a dirty toothbrush. He now hangs his toothbrush with no fuss. The application was simple, and it has stuck to the wall extremely well. If we ever move this will definitely come with us or I will have to buy another.",
