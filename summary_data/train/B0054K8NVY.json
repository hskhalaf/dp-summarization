Get some large clamps to help pull the muslin wrinkles out and to keep the cords out of the way.",

Mine has started ripping at the top. Although these things can get a little annoying, I would definitely recommend this product. You will not find all of this equipment for such a good price.

It does all fit in the case, but it's also another hassle to have to take out the bulbs, and repack them in the boxes each time. Maybe there is a kit that uses less fragile LED bulbs that are as bright, with an easier setup?",

I recommend using sand bags to stabilize the backdrop support, and at the footing of the hair light , if not it can wobble quite a bit. When I received the kit there was an issue with one of the soft-boxes, I contacted the seller and within 3 days a replacement part was at my doorstep.. Quality kit for beginners or if you are on a tight budget, and a quality seller with great support.",

You can get replacement thumb bolt from a hardware store to replace the plastic ones. need to add some type of weight to the boom light, it comes with a bag for sand, but leg weights work well.
