I didn't want to use a hot glue gun again because it didn't last and because of the heat. So... I put it in the trash.",

I think that the chinese made feeders were leeching weird chemicals out of the plastic and the birds said \"no way I is drinking that stuff\". So I changed to these good looking made in the USA feeders and slowly but surely my little flock is returning to feast on the delicious sugar water.",

      "text": "I was looking for an affordable, generally well-reviewed hummingbird feeder. This one hit both those marks....but I'm not sure why. It is made of the cheapest, least durable plastic out there. But worst of all, it is SO incredibly difficult to open. This makes cleaning a nightmare. I broke 2 fingernails attempting to open either side of the lid. It is not well-made at all and I'd sooner get something at the dollar store. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have issues with the hook breaking (though I could see that happening, because the hook is also made of very thin, floppy plastic).",

I bought this feeder because it has 10 feeder ports and I wanted to accommodate more birds at one feeder. But, the photo is a bit deceptive. The 10 flowers (feeder ports) are much closer together than they appear. So close, in fact, that if 10 birds were all seated at once they would literally be shoulder-to-shoulder, and we all know how \"tolerant\" hummers are toward one another. IMO, the base needs to be wider and the ports need to be separated a little farther apart. Otherwise it appears to be an okay feeder. Personally, I still prefer glass though.",

First of all, it's wide mouth (so it's easy to clean), the base comes apart (so its easier to clean and safer for the hummingbirds so you can ensure that bacteria and algae isn't building up inside). And to top it off, it has a reservoir at the top to put water so it discourages insects from climbing onto the feeder. We bought two of them -- and have DOZENS of hummingbirds in our backyard. So glad we took a chance this year and bought a different brand. A great buy!!!",
