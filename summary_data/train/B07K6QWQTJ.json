So I do think that this has to be in the exact right place in order to get the right reading.

Setting the date and time only allowed you to increase numbers. If you mess up, you have to remove the batteries to reset the values and redo the setting. 2. Since taking out the batteries resets the device, if your device runs out of battery, you'll lose the record of blood pressure values in the device. Considering this is something that might not be used on a consistent basis, it's a drawback. You'll have to keep a record of your blood pressure elsewhere just in case.",

It is very easy to use, easy to read and handy. It can also a lot of unnecessary stress haha",

Good for travel. I probably won't use this as my main monitor.",

That helped me determine the accuracy because we had taken the upper arm cuff to the doctors office and compared the results with the readings the nurse would receive. I really like this you.
