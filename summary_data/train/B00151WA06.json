The microplane pictured has a rubber handle, this one is made of hard, cheap plastic and the actual grater is aluminum so is doesn\u2019t adhere to a magnetic knife block like the one I thought I was buying. Because this cheap material was used, the grates are ragged instead of sharp and shred your fingers with the slightest slip. To make matters worse, Amazon won't allow a return for the item for some reason.",

It's IMPERATIVE you keep the hard plastic sleeve on it, otherwise, it could bend in the utensil drawer and end up breaking -- but sometimes other people in my kitchen haven't gotten that memo. Wash it immediately after using it, don't put it with anything else until that plastic sleeve protector is on it.",

I also bought a glove to protect my hands. This tool is very sharp, so I'm very careful when I clean it. I use a brush and I clean it while the residue is fresh, so it's softer than if I leave it for a while. It comes with a plastic cover, so I toss it in the drawer with my other tools and it keeps it's nice sharp edges. I'd recommend this any time.",

Lemon zest also comes out great. Cleaning is very easy. The only negative point I have is that the base is extremely sturdy. If you were to bend it you may be able to break it with not that much force. I guess at such a low price you can't get everything perfect. Overall for the price very good product, it just doesn't get my 5 stars.",

      "text": "Over the years I have purchased a couple of microplanes and although they were good for grating things like parmesan cheese they did not perform well when I tried to grate lemons or limes. By far this is the BEST I've ever used. It perfectly grates lemons without getting any of the pith in the mix. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a superior grater for their kitchen.",
