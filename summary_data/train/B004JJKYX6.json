The lid stays on pretty well with the magnet lip to minimize smells. The mesh bags come out pretty easy. If I were to nitpick, I might find little baskets to put in place of the mesh bags which might make soiled clothes extraction slightly easier. Currently the mesh bags stay in place by attaching to the long velcro strip inside the hamper.",

I plan to order two more and that should hold everything I will need for quite a while without having to worry about \"where am I going to put this?' It is well made and quite heavy. I have those small fabric cubes, but they are lightweight in comparison to this one. I was quite surprised when the box arrived. Very sturdy indeed!!",

The removable mesh liner attaches to the bin via velcro tabs on that outside of the bin, and the top portion of the liner folds over the outer lip of the bin to keep it from falling into the bin when clothes are tossed in. My only suggestion to the manufacturer would be to change the velcro tabs so that they are on the inside of the bin instead of on the outside. Otherwise, it works well and helps to keep the closet a lot more tidy.",

      "text": "I like this product now that it's assembled... There were some issues with assembly because seams not straight and corner not true. Used diagonal zipper to square box, but zipper cheap plastic and one of teeth bent so difficult to square one side. The size is generous. Easily fit in entire basket of clothes into each of the two sides. The look is clean, I may install a small hinge inside the lid as you can't keep the lid up , it just Velcro's on to the back of the unit so is a bit floppy. This is lightweight so it easily moves to clean around.",

The top stays shut because there is a magnet under the lip. I would recommend this to a friend/family member.",
