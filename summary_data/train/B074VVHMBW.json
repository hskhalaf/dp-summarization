I only bought these a couple of months ago and when I received them, they did look the part. They fit well, we\u2019re comfy and didn\u2019t need a lot of breaking in. However, after only a couple of months the leather has cracked along the bottom lace line, The sole is starting to come away at the sides. Also along the crack you can see that the leather seems to be bonded and not full grain. The boots aren\u2019t waterproof either, even after waxing and reproofing the tongue. See attached photos",
