Sorry, I understand we are talking a small difference but they are in fact 101mm. The website description is not accurate. I bought these because the description said they were 107mm and that's what the bocce league specifies in their rule book. The bag they came in is very nice and the balls nest in there very well. Nice set and I would have been happy to own them if they were the size described.",

This is a traditional/regulation set, so if your looking for something to play with little kids, maybe you want to consider something else. The balls are heavier, but once you get used to them it is fun to play. We are 60+ in age, so it's not that hard to get use to the weight. We've had it a month now. Excellent quality, good workmanship. I would definitely recommend this set.",

Since there are no actual indents or nicks in the surface, I do not intend to return, but the quality in the finish was very disappointing. If I could do it over, I would have paid the extra $30 and purchased the Perfetta Professional Bocce Set. The weight being off is very annoying, but I guess that's why Baden doesn't advertise a weight specification. The bag seems to be very sturdy.",

These are the heavy ones you're looking for so you can get a good loft and heavy thud to land it right next to the pic.",

    "description": "Take the family on a trip to Naples without leaving your backyard with the Baden Champions bocce ball set. This regulation size 107mm and weight 2lbs per ball bocce set has been constructed with the true backyard games connoisseur in mind. The age-old outdoor game of bocce ball has traditionally been played on natural soil or crushed stone courts but can be played on a variety of different terrains including grassy lawn surfaces. Baden\u2019s bocce sets are constructed with a premium poly-resin from surface through the core, unlike most competitors using a concrete core with filler. Baden\u2019s bocce set also comes with multiple scoring patterns on the balls (circle vs stripes) allowing for up to (2-8) players per round. Included with your set is a durable carrying bag for easy storage and transportation. The International Standards of Bocce Ball have determined that a circumference of 107mm (4.2 inches) and a weight of 920g (2lbs.) per ball is the international standard, which Baden\u2019s set adheres to.",
