It's been hard for me to keep her hair mat free, since I'm dealing with health issues. I just purchased this leave in conditioner for both my cats. I noticed right away it made their dry hair smoother and softer preventing their hair from getting matted. I like that it's unscented too, since my cats do not like anything scented. I do feel it's quite expensive and wish the price would come down. I don't understand why pet shampoos and conditioners should be so much more expensive than human ones.",

It doesn't have a scent that I can smell, and it didn't upset my cat's tummy. I appreciate any product that minimizes both my cat's discomfort and my odds of getting murdered by said cat.",

I think as the directions said, it depends on the sensitivity of the cat. Or 2 others don't go on the new couch, but also aren't dirt bags and don't claw the couch. I wouldn't recommend this product.

I have had to reapply after a while, but that is to be expected. The scent is strong - but not unpleasant- and doesn't linger for long. The only issue I have is that despite holding my breath and trying other methods, I still manage to breathe in some of the mist. Perhaps opening the bottle and using a paper towel to wipe the product onto the surface will work better for me? I just recently used it again.",

Since, it take A LOT, over time, to make them stop scratching. Consistency is key. My cats do a lot of their scratching at night. I spray the furniture before bed. I still hear some scratching, but if I OVER SPRAY - the smell takes in the whole house. The cats then end up hiding under our bed. That\u2019s not the effect I was going for. Yes, it \u201cworks\u201d, but you need to be consistent which means continuing to purchase the spray....",
