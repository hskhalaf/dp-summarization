But after trying to use a gas can to fill my boat and fighting the waves in the water I decided might as well try it out. After receiving it I must say I LOVE this product. Well worth the price.",

    "title": "DuraMax Flo n' Go LE Fluid Transfer Pump and 14-Gallon Rolling Gas Can",
    "description": "Size Name:LE Fuel Transfer Pump and Rolling Gas Can Tank Caddy,Smart. Trusted. Best-In-Class. Duramax Fuel tank is made of rugged high-density polyethylene plastic construction in vibrant red. This gas tank provides 14 gallon capacity and dispenses at 2 gallons per minute with a patented Flo n' go Maxflo siphon pump. Easily portable on 6\" wheels, making maneuverability a breeze over rough terrains, ideal for marine use and landscapers. 10' long fuel hose.\n\nCaution: Tank swelling will occur. EPA regulations have eliminated the traditional venting in these tanks. New portable outboard marine fuel tanks will not vent below 5 PSI with noticeable swelling. The new EPA compliant cap will cause the portable outboard marine fuel tanks to swell. The swelling is a result of the fuel vapor building pressure, because the cap must stay sealed up to 5PSI. All tanks must remain sealed beyond 5PSI during storage and transportation. The new tanks have been tested to remain sealed and safe at these pressures even when swelling is visible.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWhether your fuel needs include watercraft, hunting and camping, generators, backyard power equipment, or professional landscaping tools, the Duramax Flo 'n' Go fluid transfer pump and rolling gas can make refueling a snap. The Flo 'n' Go is made of a durable, high-density polyethylene material in red that safely holds gasoline, diesel, or kerosene fuels. When it comes time to refill, the pump's patented Flo 'n' Go hand pump and pump holder handle takes over, letting you transfer fluids on level surfaces with minimal priming. And thanks to the dual mechanical shutoff valves at both the tank and hose, the tank's disconnection is spill-proof, providing a safe fuel transfer for both you and the ecosystem. \n\n The tank includes a sizable 14-gallon/53-liter capacity and a 10-foot-long fuel hose, as well as a bolt-on hanger for convenient hose storage. And users will love the sturdy 6-inch wheels, which makes it a breeze to maneuver the tank over rough terrain. Other features include an ergonomically designed, heavy-duty top handle with extra-deep base unit handholds for transport; a UL-approved mechanically vented fill cap; and recessed grooves that provide nuisance-free strapping locations for safer transport. The Flo 'n' Go fluid transfer pump meets all DOT and UN transportation requirements.",
