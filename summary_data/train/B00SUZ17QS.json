I wish the glass stirs were longer than the test tubes are deep. And I am yet to understand why they included 2 shorter glass stirs also. The instructions for the experiments can be a little vague (add a little of this chemical) makes it hard to know if it\u2019s half a scoop or a granule.... either way the experiments are fun. It has been her favorite Christmas gift.",

Nothing will explode, burn, or even get hot. You're down to pH experiments... cool but pretty tame. One of the test tubes broke... not close to real lab quality. She loves to use the beaker to make slime projects.",
