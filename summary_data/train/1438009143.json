My only complaint is that it is very focussed around the NY City test, and my test, although was in NY, was not a city test, and was nothing at all like the book practice tests of content. However, if you read all the strategies provided, and practice the test and the wording, you should be prepared for anything they are asking. The test is less about what you know, and more about how well you can understand what they are asking and extrapolating the correct answers from information provided.",
