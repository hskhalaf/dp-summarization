The cover is comfortable, stays tucked-in (unless my husband is laying on the sofa watching football) and not unattractive. I take it off when we entertain, but if a guest paid a surprise visit when the sofa was covered, I wouldn't mind. Note that the cover is not waterproof. Recommended. Update: We purchased a waterproof pad that is slightly longer and wider than the cushion area of our sofa. We placed the pad beneath the throw to provide protection from our elderly parents and our dogs.",

      "text": "This cover is great! It is washable, comfortable and looks very elegant on the couches. We have a large dog so it really protects our leather couches when we are not home. The only trouble we have is that it slips off the back of the leather couches . For us its a minor problem since we only use the covers when we are not home and it still protects the sitting cushions which is why we bought this product. We have gotten numerous compliments on them since most of our friends are dog owners and use random blankets to cover their couches.",
