The sleeve it came with is decent, but other than that I am disappointed in the product and how much I payed for it.",

I was so excited to receive this, but the silicone is soft and just didn't give me any support. I waited too long and lost my chance to return it so I threw an awful lot of money out the window on this one. Unless you can try it on in person or are ready to return if its not for you than I wouldn't recommend purchasing this. A knee brace is just one of those things that you need to try on and feel if its right for you.",

We ordered another as he says it fits well, is allowed in soccer and football and protects where the PT said he needs protection. This is our second and we will keep using this brace as long as he is in sports! Great brace!!!",

    "title": "DonJoy Reaction Web Knee Support Brace with Compression Undersleeve: Grey, Medium/Large",
    "description": "Color:Grey| Size:Medium/LargeThe DonJoy Reaction WEB Knee Brace uses a responsive, webbed approach to knee pain that gives you a distinct alternative to the basic knee sleeve. Developed by world renowned orthopedic surgeon, Dr. William Nordt, the DonJoy Reaction WEB can help decrease knee pain and increase function, getting you back to your active lifestyle. The elastomeric web is an innovative solution that absorbs shock, disperses energy and shifts pain away from your knee. This webbing acts to dynamically stabilize the patella (kneecap) on all sides, bringing the patella into proper tracking position to reduce pain. The open framework of the elastomeric web, in combination with the mesh backing, creates a comfortable fit and a breathable solution for relief of anterior knee pain. It's secured with Velcro straps, and weighs only 0.5 lbs. The lightweight design makes this knee brace ideal for all-day use. One undersleeve is included, and is made of 85% nylon/15% spandex. The DonJoy Reaction WEB can be used to treat or prevent the following knee injuries: patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), chondromalacia patella (runner\u2019s knee), quadriceps or patellar tendonitis/tendinosis (jumper\u2019s knee), Osgood-Schlatter disease, general patellar tracking issues and instability, and mild knee osteoarthritis. The DonJoy Reaction WEB is worn by professional snowboarders, volleyball, football players; as well as the U.S. Snowboarding and U.S. Ski teams. Universal fit allows the DonJoy Reaction WEB Knee Brace to be worn on either the left or the right leg.",
