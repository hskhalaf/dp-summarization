I bought one a year ago, on average I probably use maybe 2 times/week, so after about 100 times use (each time 2-5 minutes to make pan fried veggies), the protection layers all faded away and bottom no longer even. the Life Time warranty is a joke, first you have to pay to mail it back (which is almost $30+) and unless you can prove the wok is leak or soothing they consider it is \"usable\" so if you need a wok for a year then it's ok, but you can find a lot cheaper ones for a year.",

We cook /everything/ with it. It's so versatile and the new pan reminds me why I loved the old one so much. I wouldn't call it a wok, though. Its flat bottom acts more like a standard nonstick frying pan, but it's high, rounded sides make it wok-like. We use it for fried dumplings, tofu, large batches of pasta sauce, etc.",

Add chopped onion and bell pepper, and some thinly sliced beef. Season with Coconut Secret Amino Soy-Free seasoning, and a little Himalayan pink salt. Our family loves it. Of course there are other stir-fry combinations. This pan just makes it fun to cook it in. It's almost too small for us.",
