Then they said too bad but the warranty is only good for one year. I had it for 13 1/2 months. The discount they offered brought the cost down to what it is on Amazon anyway, once you factor in shipping and the $20 more expensive protection plan. Which you obviously need! I trust Amazon, but not Fitbit. They do not re expect their product to last more than a year.",

However, tracking your daily steps and distance is ridiculous. I walk and hike quite a bit and wear the fitbit in conjunction with an Omron Tri-axis pedometer which works quite well. The fitbit is WAY OFF in it's counting compared to my Omron. Probably because the fitbit is secured to your wrist there is no way that it can accurately record your steps properly. I'll update this review when I have it a bit longer.",

      "text": "So happy with this! Helping me achieve my weight loss goals! I love the reminder to get walking each hour! Battery seems decently long enough, I just charge when I shower cause it\u2019s not waterproof. Pretty sure it sometimes counts arm only movement as steps, so not 100% accurate there, but good enough to give me motivating a good idea of where I\u2019m at. Also the exercise tracking function does not work well for treadmill exercise, as it uses gps on the phone instead of steps for distance and speed. Still, super happy and purchasing other bands to switch it up!",
