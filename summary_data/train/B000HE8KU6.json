      "text": "I really want to like this camera. It looks great and is incredibly slim, but the picture quality is so poor I may just have to suck it up and buy another camera only 5 months after buying this one. I am not an expert photographer, but I have owned 2 other digital camera and this one takes by far the worst pictures. It is useless indoors or in the evenings. I have spent 6 months tweaking settings etc, but I cannot get this thing to take good pictures reliably. I would advise looking elsewhere for a camera.",

My wife loves this camera for it's easy to use features and portability.The Red will do as I could not find this model in the fiesta orange.A neat little camera.Love it.",

Not a single technical problem with it, the battery lasts all through the day of turning it off and on and it's very easy to use. The screen is huge; it does not have a viewfinder if you're into having one. Takes nice video clips as well and I love the red color of mine.",

The buttons are quite small, which can be an issue for larger hands. Also doesn't have a lot of high end/manual features, so if you're looking for a lot of SLR-like features, this is more of a point and shoot.",

    "title": "Casio Exilim EX-S770RD 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Red)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe attractive EX-S770 shoots 7.2-megapixel still images and records high-quality movies in MPEG-4 format. In addition, it features Casio\u2019s Super Bright 2.8-inch wide-screen LCD but still retains the ultra-slim card size of its predecessors. Its impressive wide-screen display employs a 230,000-pixel LCD that clearly displays images and information down to the smallest detail, and boasts a maximum brightness of around 1100cd/m2 -- more than bright enough to see outdoors on a sunny day. Casio has also added new functions to make the most of the EX-S770\u2019s new wide screen. \n\n The high-quality stainless steel body of the EX-S770 is the epitome of design elegance and ensures ease of operation as well, while maintaining all the slimness and beauty the EXILIM Card line is renowned for. \n\n Exilim EX-S770 Highlights \n\n Wide-aspect movies In addition to high-quality, VGA-size movies in MPEG-4 format, the EX-S770 can record 16:9 aspect ratio movies compatible with wide-screen TVs, which are growing in popularity. The camera records impressive movies with a simple press of the movie button. There is no need to change modes. It also features an electronic anti-shake function that delivers beautiful movies by minimizing blur from shaky hands. \n\n Data Storage function The included Data Transport software enables computer data -- including business documents, e-mail, and Web pages -- to be automatically converted to JPEG format and transferred to the camera. For instance, tourist attractions and maps that users have looked up on the internet can be viewed on the camera\u2019s LCD, eliminating the need to carry around a guidebook. The camera also includes Photo Transport for transferring stored photos in a PC to the camera. \n\n eBay Best Shot mode As the 22nd of 34 Best Shot modes in the EX-S770, eBay Best Shot takes photos at a size that is image optimized for display on eBay, allowing picture takers to more quickly and easily create photos for selling items on eBay. eBay Best Shot mode also includes Auto Macro, an ideal setting for capturing images of small items such as jewelry, tags, etc., thus automatically adjusting the focus from acquiring fine details in close up shots to capturing large items from a distance. eBay Best Shot mode allows users to capture optimized images at an ideal size for eBay. \n\n What's in the box \n\n Exilim EX-S770 digital camera, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, USB cradle, USB cable, AV cable, special AC adaptor, AC power cord, strap, CD-ROM",
