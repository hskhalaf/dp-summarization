Only thing I didn't like was the wall charger never turned green when the hoverboard is plugged in for charging even after 4 hours of continuous charging. Didn't want to over charge so unplugged it. The hoverboard does give about 30 to 40 mins of playtime before needing to recharge. I may have just gotten a bad wall charger. Overall would have been a 5 star. Would recommend this product but just watch your charging time to not over charge it.",

Got for one kid and had to buy for my other kid (and I still have more kids in line waiting for theirs... :) This is super fun, easy to use. It takes a while for you to find your balance, but just a little practice you will be just fine. I think it is pretty safe but you have to wear safety gear (like with any other thing you ride) The battery has a very long life, which is great. They can play a lot and the we recharge it overnight so that the next day we are ready for more fun!!! I recommend!!!!",
