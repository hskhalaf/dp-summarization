Our large drawing mat boasts a brightly colored border with whimsical animals accompanying the alphabet to inspire his first steps toward writing.

Because there are no messy inks or chemicals, your toddler's artistic endeavors won't cause stains or messes. \n\n Easy to use, again and again \n\n Lay out the Aqua Magic Mat, fill the pens with tap water, and watch your child's creativity come to life. With 4 non-toxic polypropylene plastic stencils, an EVA stencil, 4 stamps, a design roller and a drawing booklet, the possibilities are limited only by his imagination. As the water dries on the mat, artwork fades and will fully vanish in 10 minutes. Your child is free to create brand-new drawings as many times as he wishes. With no paper to replenish, the Aqua Magic Doodle Mat is a cost-effective and eco-friendly toddler toy for boys and girls. \n\n A world of possibilities \n\n Our Aqua Magic Doodle Mat folds away when not in use, taking up less space than a water table or drawing board easel.

With our 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee, you've got time to see for yourself the educational power of drawing and painting for toddlers and children. \n\n Show your child that his success is as endless as his imagination.
