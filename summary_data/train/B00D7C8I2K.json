The sandal impressed buyers because it needed zero break-in time, had decent looks and excellent waterproofness. While there were features liked by consumers, its hefty weight and inability to dry quickly brought disappointment.In conclusion, all the necessary benefits can be enjoyed upon owning this KEEN product.",
      "pros": [
        "According to the majority, the Newport from KEEN is the most comfortable pair they have ever owned",
        "Many buyers commented that the sandals were highly durable and therefore could easily last a decade",
        "A lot of individuals admired the snug fit of the KEEN Newport since it prevented uncomfortable chafing or sliding of the foot from inside the sandal",
        "Several consumers mentioned that the footwear, owing to its well-thought-out waterproof build, could be worn while hiking through rivers and streams",
        "A few hikers mentioned that it needed no break-in time and could be used straight out of the box",
        "Some users liked the overall look and colorways of the KEEN Newport sandals"

      "cons": [

The first pair lasted about 6 years and were looking a bit ratty and unbelievably, someone stole them!!!!. The reason I wear them so much is the toecap. It's so easy to stub your toes in ordinary sandals. Also, buy your normal shoe size, they don't take much breaking in.",

I've only worn these a few times so it's early days , but once on a 6 mile walk around Cardiff bay and surroundings and so far the best sandals I've ever worn , sturdy well protected whilst still keeping your feet cool also in comfort easily 5* Their a bit Pricey lets hope the durability lives up to the cost ....",

      "text": "I've always used Teva sandals before but saw these in a shop and decided they were better than the equivalent Teva model. The sole is much thicker, and the rear does not rub my damaged Achilles tendon. So, as usual, I ordered them from Amazon at a (slight) reduction and they arrived next day. Wore them on holiday walking, getting on and off boats in Oslo fjord, walking in water, and for general use since I forgot I had them on. They are treated with an anti-bacterial agent so hopefully they will not start to stink like my Tevas, which are now consigned to the outdoors for storage and only used when my wife isn't around!",

Good for running short distances (not tried longer!) and did a 6 mile muddy hike with no problem. Nice wide fit and a thicker, more supportive sole than the other Keen sandals I tried. The build quality is good too: should last several years of hard wear, with luck. Recommended.",
