      "text": "My feet stay dry when walking in the rain and the size fits fairly comfortably. However, the cushioning is fairly minimal, so if you have chronically sore feet you may wish to consider inserts. The back of the shoe has also been rubbing the skin right off my achilles heel (it was causing enough damage that someone I was walking with noticed the blood on my socks.) I've taken to wearing a bandaid on the back of each foot where this happens, at least until the shoes break in a bit. It's worth noting that this might only be a problem if you wear low cut socks or own socks that have worn thin.",
