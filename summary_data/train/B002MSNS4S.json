I've been using mine for years now and even though Sony is discontinuing the product in the US I'm still going to hold on to mine for as long as I can. I'm not an avid eBook reader but I use it often enough. It does have a tendency of turning off completely in sleep mode but other than that I haven't run across any glitches. The touch screen works fine albeit a little slow. Even if they were still selling it I probably wouldn't buy it again because the glare is annoying enough to be off-putting but if they fixed that it'd be pretty awesome.",

Authenticate computer 3. Authenticate Sony 4. Download books When you connect the reader to your computer make sure it is on otherwise library books will not work when you try to open them.",

It is obviously an old model and has no newer features, but for under $20 , it holds a bunch of titles, is portable, is easy to use and connects to my PC without a hitch...so it's better then not having an ereader. I'll use it a bunch.",

Even if you don't want to buy books, there are lots of libraries that you can check out ebooks to read. Not to mention, the Sony e store always has some free books that get changed periodically. I really look forward to see where Sony goes with their readers.",
