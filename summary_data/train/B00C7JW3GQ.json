      "text": "I love these! We started using cloth when our little guy was 4 months old. We have tried different kinds and these are my favorites. They have a place where you can put the liner inside the cover, but we don't do that. We just put the liner on top of the cover so that we can use the same cover through multiple diaper changes. We use cloth when we're sitting around at home and when he's at daycare, and use disposables when we're out and about and overnight. I buy about half the amount of disposable diapers as other moms that I know.",

I have also used these on my almost 3 year old son at night time and the fit was great on him - he did leak though (heavy wetter) and I didn't have room for an additional insert (we use 2 inserts for both son and daughter). The colors are great and the inserts actually find their way out of the pockets in the wash (almost always) so you don't have to touch them when they are dirty. Overall they are super soft and the fit is really good",
