I also love the natural sandstone look, and the fact that as natural products they're all slightly different.

They are also heavy enough to not slide around too easilywhen you want them to stay put. I will purchase these again for other areas of my home!",

Having bought the Cinnabar Thirstystone Natural Sandstone Coasters, however, I'm a believer. Dripping condensation from my iced coffee makes a wet spot on the stone and goes no further. This design is very attractive and the cork bottoms are perfectly centered and skid free. I haven't seen what would happen in an extremely wet situation but for now, I am completely satisfied with this purchase. One note: the coaster / holder combo was not available when I bought my set. Buying both together appears to be a pretty good deal.",
