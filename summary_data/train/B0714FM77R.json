      "DETACHABLE REGULATOR & SPOUT: The design of growler allows you to detach both the regulator, spout and faucet while keeping keg contents under pressure for storage. Our upgraded regulator can save 35% of Co2 compared to standard model. It is more precise than all other mini regulators and ensures that you can monitor the PSI and adjust the pressure from the regulator gauge.",

      "CERTIFIED FOOD-GRADE STAINLESS STEEL: Every single part of the faucet distributor kit is made of food-grade 304 type stainless steel to maintain a clean and bacteria-free environment for your beer. This material also provides a robust, long-lasting build.",
      "JUST ADD A CO2 CARTRIDGE: The only thing you need to get your barrel up and running is a CO2 cartridge.Threaded CO2 Cartridge System (3/8\" CO2 Cartridge) - CO2 CARTRIDGE NOT INCLUDED!"
