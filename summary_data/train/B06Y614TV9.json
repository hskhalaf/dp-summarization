      "text": "We really wanted to be able to make beer butt chicken (it seems wrong to be typing that in a review) so I was happy to find this little setup with the other additional options - if I'm going to store more stuff in my kitchen it better serve more than one purpose! With the exception of the jalapeno tray, I do wish everything was a little bit bigger - there aren't enough skewers and when we grill veggies we tend to do a lot more than what fits on that tray. For the price though it's totally worth it. I like the little bit of versatility, it is easy to use, clean and store.",

I really don't know what the big deal is The chicken was not infused with flavor I did think the meat was very moist which sometimes roasted chicken is not. The BBQ aid was easy to use and the chicken remained in the upright position but all the juices did not land in the drip pan under it. They were all over my oven causing smoke in the house and a 4 hour oven cleaning . The piece cleans easily in the dish washer. I probably will use it for shiskabobs and maybe for the chicken on the outdoor grill",
