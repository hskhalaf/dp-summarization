She'd let me brush her teeth for 5 minutes straight with this if I chose to (though we usually keep it to around 60 seconds). Because it's a Sonicare you know it is doing a good job too. I couldn't recommend this more highly.",

Let's not forget that there's a button on the main screen that will instantly delete a profile. The app also doesn't work properly with Android so if you leave it running it will deplete your battery over a few hours, while also helpfully rewarding brushing by giving kids virtual candy.",

Interactive app is interesting at first, but then just becomes entertainment. More often then not, I find my kid watching the little critter brush it's teeth with glassy TV eyes while keeping their own toothbrush in one spot. Not sold that this actually helps kids brush better - but maybe if you struggle with your kid getting the brushing done at all or if it's a fight to brush, this might ease that a bit. In the end, I think the regular sonicate is fine - no gimmicks and it lasts longer.",

Pros: -She enjoys using it - she brushes for a lot longer now Cons: -replacement heads are pricey - like other reviewers, we had mold grow behind the stick-on plate. I caught it early and was able to just remove the plate. The sticker on it was cute, but my daughter doesn\u2019t mind using this as a plain toothbrush.",

It's soft and just the right size for kids (have a 7 and 5 yrs old). Kids are enjoying the app that can be downloaded with the toothbrush and its great at teaching them the correct way to brush their teeth. The beeping sound lets them know when to move to the next section. It's a great interactive toothbrush.",

I can honestly say that getting her to brush her teeth is no longer a fight, and she loves the timer that tells her when to switch sides. Easy to set up, easy to use. Very happy with our purchase. Only wish that It came with more than 1 brush. Would be nice if it came with atleast 1 replacement.",

The app is interactive and shows kids where to hold their toothbrush in their mouth as well as making sure they are brushing long enough. Every time you reach a brushing goal the child gets a prize.
