Shipping didn't take long at all! So I give it 2 stars for the shipping and look of it. Within 24 hours of my daughter getting it and playing on it, it randomly freezes up. We have to turn it off for 24-48 hours, then it will go a bit without freezing up. At times it doesn't show a game is in, even though it clearly is. Not really recommended but it is what it is.",

They replied me promptly and gave me contact information of the person i need to contact. Turns out it is a problem with the charger. I couldn't be bothered to get an exchange as the shipping will cost me a lot more than if i go to the local game store and purchase a replacement charger. Once that is done, the device is perfect.",
