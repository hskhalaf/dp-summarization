They are deep and will hold quite a bit, but the opening is very narrow making it difficult to put things in.",

The loop is very secure, and I can lift a packed large bag with impunity. They expand out exactly as shown in the picture. It can be awkward with the zipper down the side and how the folds open up, but these ABSOLUTELY fit way more than you'd think in there! They pack down wonderfully small and very foldable. I liked them so much, I bought several more sets. Definitely recommend.",
