It goes fast enough to keep him entertained (10 mph), but slow enough to be safe. It can make sharp turns, so not having reverse really isn't an issue. He can even take it in our field and does fine off road. Overall we have been really satisfied.",

In fact, the quad is so slow and sluggish I can walk slowly beside it at full throttle, and it will hardly climb the apron of our driveway. I suspect the batteries are bad, or maybe we purchased a lemon. I will contact Razor tomorrow. Probably will try to return it and purchase another dirt bike. Feel bad for my Grandson who was quite disappointed in the way it ran.",

We followed the instructions and did the long first charge and have always charged it immediately after use for a minimum of 12hrs as instructed. He has used it about 15 times and now the battery will only last for 2 minutes.... Doesn't seem like the battery should have gone bad already. Also, we have issues with the brake rubbing due to the assembly being bent from the start. loosening the screw as illustrated in the instructions did not solve the problem. I had to disengage the assembly so it wouldn't rub any more...Disappointed to say the least",

It takes a little getting use to the throttle after they get use to that they will be on their way. It can be unstable when turning for young ones. And if there not careful it will tip over, if they turn to sharp at full speed. If I was going to add anything it would be a reverse, but its easy to add it yourself. Maybe make it a little wider.",

Tubular steel frame, pneumatic rubber tires, real mono-shock rear suspension, disc brake, and a twist throttle, set this quad worlds apart from the competition. Enough torque and traction to traverse rough terrain. Twice the speed of the other electric kids atvs, but not too fast for a 4 year old (with some riding experience). This is a well made machine that simply works! Just don't forget to charge it after each use. It even has enough power to pull two 5-year-olds at once around along a bumpy off-road trail. I highly recommend this quad for kids ages 4-8.",

This is his first time stepping up from a power wheel vehicle but he has spent the last year watching videos of 4 wheelers and perhaps that helped, but he jumped right on and after an hour of dad going over \"training sessions\", was as natural as could be. Great size, not to big. Much faster than power wheels but not to fast. He handles brake and throttle just fine.
