The login system is broken in app and on their website. The Facebook connection required to live stream is broken (apparently from their forums it\u2019s been broken for 5 months). Streaming is impossible. The other company who had an app for live-streaming with this camera have gone out of business and their app is no longer on the stores. Their website still looks slick, but look at all the complaints on their forums. Total lack of support and no response. Looks like the company will go out of business soon.",

The software is not great but it does it job. You can follow your favorite views and create a regular 2D film out of the recording. 5 stars for sure. BTW, customer service is excellent. I had a 360fly HD before which died. 360fly simply sent me a new one and also extracted all of my footage, Very cool!",
