      "text": "The bag itself seems pretty nice and well made it\u2019s just too small.. over all it appears it would be a large bag from the outside. The downfall is finding a container that even fits in it and once you add in the ice packs or heat packs there\u2019s even less room. We use basic food prep contains and they do not fit what so ever even without the packs. Great concept just would\u2019ve been so much better if it actually accommodated containers or came with containers that fit. Really disappointed this wasn\u2019t what I expected at all.",

I prefer to take home cooked food with me due to dietary limitations - and this bag really keeps my food warm with the 2 red heat packs. Having an excellent cooler for cold drinks is a bonus. It is a large lunch box, though.",

Aside from that, the two compartments are too small or oddly shaped to fit a typical, standard food prep containers. The pictures showing full size meal prep containers are deceptive, there's no way those actually fit in the bag based on its dimensions.",
