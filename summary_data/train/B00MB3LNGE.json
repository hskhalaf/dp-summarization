I have contacted the support team and, after an hour, we are able to get the cameras working but they usually fail to make a connection again within 24-48 hours. Piper should really consider either fixing the existing software or rolling back to the last version (when they had \"Vacation\" mode). That software was much more reliable.

The ability to view and control piper from your pc would be most helpful. I am considering returning this product and possibly get the one with night vision, but amazon does not sell it. Overall great concept, if the company makes some needed improvement soon this would be an awesome product.",

My phone disconnects off of LTE data and connects to my wifi. in this transition... if you are already in the app it has issues securing the connection and therefore my quickest solution which still takes a minute is to force quit the app and re open it. I see the potential but if you can wait until the next model is release I would recommend that.",

Of course they will blame our wireless router or anything except their unit. We have this unit in our living room near our TV that gets wireless HD video flawlessly from our router and this thing can't stay connected. I cannot wait to return this piece of junk.",

It combines an HD camera, panoramic video, Z-Wave home automation, two-way audio and environmental sensors into a single, elegant product that you interact with on your Android/iOS device.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nPiper is the first all-in-one home security and home automation device. It combines an HD camera, panoramic video, Z-Wave home automation and environmental sensors into a single, elegant product that you interact with on your Android/iOS device. Piper transcends traditional security with no monthly contracts or fees, and there is no installation required; it is ready out of the box. One of Piper's main features includes fully customizable security through its wide-angle camera that lets you watch over what matters most. Set up rules for what Piper does when you're at home, away or on vacation -- \"If motion is detected while I'm on vacation, sound the siren, record a video, and send me a text message.\"-- and know immediately what's going on. Piper also features alerts so you can get notified when things happen at home with a phone call, text message, or email and watch a video of what got Piper's attention. Within the camera view, watch live video and talk directly to occupants in the room. Piper is ideal for communicating with kids after school, pets while at work, house sitters while away and for checking in on elderly parents or grandparents. Lastly, Piper features smart hardware and comes equipped with a motion detector, microphone, piercing siren, and battery backup for constant protection. Its built-in Z-Wave controller enables you to control, automate and schedule lights and small appliances, so your home can manage itself. Z-Wave accessories are required in order to enable Z-Wave functionality.",
