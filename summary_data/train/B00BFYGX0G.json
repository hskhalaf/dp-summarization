I purchased my first Pelonis heater about 3 years ago for my bedroom, so I could just take the chill off before heading off to work without having to heat the whole house. My second purchase was for my dining room. This room has lots of windows, so my little heater keeps the area way from the heat vents more comfortable for my guests from the South who find some of our entertaining cooler than they are used to. It is easy to set the settings to the desired temperature.",

The plug melts the wall socket or turning it on for the first time gave off and bad smell with smoke. I usually only set the timer to be on for 1hr so there are no outlet melting hazards. It is sensitive for when it is barely bumped, and will turn off. Good feature. Even though it's has its issues, I will continue to buy this. When u get one that operates well, it makes for a great heater",

The thermostat part doesn't turn it off when the room temperature is warmer than the set/desired temp. I tried product registration on the Midea America website with my phone/laptop and it won't send the Email. Tried to email customer support through their website and it didn't work, either. Hopefully actually sending an email to their customer service email address address goes through and I can get a replacement /refund",

Only complaint is that I wish that it didn't beep so loud when you press buttons on it. Edit: the main middle button broke after less than a month of owning it; amazon was able to get me a replacement",

Don't like the beeping noise it makes when turning on because sometimes I put it in baby room in middle of night to knock off chill while baby is sleeping and don't want the beep to wake him up. Other than that it's great and I can deal with a beep here and there for the quality that this fan offers!",
