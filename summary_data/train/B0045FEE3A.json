One difference though is that the newest two I ordered have a sync button on the outside of the battery cover. It allows you to sync the remote without removing the battery cover. Also there is a small hole in the jelly cover to allow you to press the button without removing the jelly cover as well.",

When we have the grand kids lay them down for dinner they know which is theirs. It comes complete with strap and cover. The only thing I wish it had that it doesn't is a rechargeable battery. But I knew that when I bought it. Will be our next purchase.",

So we were constantly changing from WiiWheel to Motion Plus to plain remote (the Motion Plus accressory adds weight to the unit which makes point and shoot games harder for them to control). All of this changing was frustrating for them and for their parents. This Remote Plus reduces the transition time considerably without any sacrifice of play quality. I highly recommend this product to anyone buying additional or replacement remotes for their Wii.",

    "description": "Color:Blue| Edition:Newest modelSimple. Intuitive. Easy to use. The Wii Remote Plus is a unique controller for the Wii video game system. Now with the increased sensitivity of Wii MotionPlus built-in. The button pressing of typical controllers is replaced by the natural, fluid motion of your hand. The Wii Remote Plus senses your every action and makes you feel less like a player and more like you\u2019re part of the game. With Wii, anyone can play. Some games may require additional accessories (sold separately). See game instruction manuals. Wii MotionPlus accessory not required.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\nINTRODUCING THE NEW STANDARD WII CONTROLLER\n The Wii Remote Plus Controller is the new standard controller for the Wii gaming system, shipping with new Wii systems as well as available for individual purchase. Like the original Wii Remote before it, this new controller utilizes a triple axis accelerometer along with a built-in optical sensor that works in conjunction with the Wii sensor bar. Together this enables the recognition of player movement as well as gives the controller the ability to act as a pointing device used in-game. Yet what really sets the Wii Remote Plus controller apart is its incorporation of additional gyroscope technology. \n\n Wii Remote Plus gyroscope technology provides on-the-fly rotational motion recognition, once available only to Wii players who purchased the additional Wii MotionPlus accessory for the Wii Remote. The Wii Remote Plus controller contains all these motion-capturing capabilities within the body of a single controller. To top it off the Wii Remote Plus controller maintains the same compatibility to games as the Wii Remote, so you can play most of your old favorites with it. It is also the same size as the Wii remote. Taken together this means no more extra accessories to buy in order to experience the full effect of past or future games designed to take advantage of advanced Wii MotionPlus technology; no more compatibility issues with existing Wii Remote peripherals and skins. Just sync up your Wii Remote Plus controller and have at it. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n * Moving forward the Wii Remote Plus is the standard Wii controller, shipping with all consoles\n * Incorporates the functionality of the original Wii Remote and that of the Wii MotionPlus accessory in a single controller\n * Comes in a variety of attractive colors, many of which match existing Wii console color schemes\n * Maintains the same compatibility and backwards compatibility as the original Wii Remote, meaning that you can use it to play these games even if the game contains no advanced motion-control features\n * The Wii Remote Plus controller is the same size as the Wii Remote, ensuring compatibility with all existing Wii Remote peripherals and skins\n\nADDITIONAL SCREENSHOTS",
