      "HDPE Slick bottom to intensify the performance driven by the board.

Its EPS core, bottom rear channels is for great execution and a crescent tail to enhance it more. Choose your best-loved colour and use the size chart (on the pictures) to know what will suit you.",
      "You will be receiving your purchase together with printed instructions written by us (with photos of course!) on how to install your leash and use your fin tethers. We'll also tell you how to look after your WAVE WEAPON Body Board by leaving the board 'white side up' when in the sun. (This is the same for ALL 'soft' surfboards, Body-boards and SUP's as this stops air pressure building up within the board).",
