I looked at returning that one, but Amazon will refer you to the manufacturer instead of replacing it again. So I smashed it to pieces, and ordered another. I fully expect the third unit to have some flaw, after which I will have to go back to Toro brand leaf vacuums and their lousy, fragile collector bags. America was once able to make and sell quality tools and appliances. Black and Decker, a Chinese sellout, is typical of today's quality, sinking fast and faster.",

The manual doesn't cover this use case, but you can attach both the vacuum adapter and the blower tube at the same time. This allows you to simultaneously shred and pile up large volumes of leaves without worrying about emptying the bag. The vac/blower setup is powerful enough to shoot leaves 20+ feet.",

So your no longer left cleaning up big leaves out of your rocks, you have tiny mulched up leaves to try and pick up! TERRIBLE PRODUCT! Fortunately Amazon let me return it, with a $25 shipping fee.
