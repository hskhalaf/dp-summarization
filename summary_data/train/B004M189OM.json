When I'm on my home wi-fi, there is no lag, buffering, or picture quality issues.... it's gorgeous HD quality. If you can overlook the minor setup frustration, it's a better bargain than the Slingbox at twice the price. I'll post more reviews as I use the Vulkano more and see how it holds up electronically.",

      "text": "I got the device and was excited to use it over the slingbox pro hd, unfortunately the wireless would not work. The wired portion worked fine but the tv i planned on using it on was not in the same room as the router. I set it up directly connected to the router but as soon as the ethernet cable was removed the connection would be lost and it was not able to be regained. If the wifi worked I'd give this item a great rating but it just wouldn't work for me so I'm returning the item.",

Sling Box's service is almost like being \"BLACKMAILED\" for technical assistance. I purchased the Vulkano Flow and have enjoyed better service and support without pulling out by credit card for assistance. I only paid $84.00 for the Vulkano Flow and it performance has been better than the Sling Box Pro. I suggest that when you can not get adequate assistance from the Sling Box Technical Staff PURCHASE A VULKANO PRODUCT TO REPLACE THE SLING BOX and fight against \"Planned Obsolescence\" and \"poor technical service\" exhibited by Sling Box!",
