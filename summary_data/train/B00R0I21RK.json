First and foremost, these swaddling blankets are breathable, so even if the kiddo manages to get out of it, bunch it up, and get it all over their face, they can still breathe through it. These are also not as hot as other blankets, so the kiddo won't bake while swaddled. Second, they are much larger than the regular blankets, so you can actually swaddle the your baby as long as they need to be swaddled.",

These will hopefully hold up, but good grief they are scratchy. I don\u2019t even like holding them with the baby. I\u2019m keeping them to wash and wash them in hopes they soften up, but we are on wash number five on most of these (at LEAST) right now and no signs of softening. Shame.",

I no longer swaddle, but I also like these as breathable, regular blankets. The Bambi prints are gorgeous and look even better in person than they do on the screen. I also have and recommend the \"Global Garden\" prints which are lovely without being too typical.",

At 47\" they are actually way too big and on top of that these are stretchy and super spongy. That makes it difficult to make a tight wrap and even when you did, it gives so babies can wiggle loose. Perhaps they are good for older babies (mine is 10 weeks and 12lbs now) but then again the older babies need less swaddling. But yes the cloths are very soft except for the stripe one cause of the dye material they used to print makes that one stiffer and rougher than the rest.",

He has moved on to the aden + anais sleep sacks (which I LOVE) but I still use the blankets to cover his carrier and have tied it around him when he has had to sleep in his bouncer.

Pretty much everything except swaddling, haha.

Super-duper soft, light, hold up great through countless washes--my daughter is now almost 16 months old and she still cuddles with one of these blankets every night as her \"blankie\".

Now we use them as blankets, burp cloths, nursing covers, peek-a-boo sheets, stroller covers, and anything else we can think of. They hold up great and just get better the more you use them. The star pattern is pretty large which is a nice change from some of the more \"cutesy\" prints.",

Great for summertime when you need something to cover them from the sun because it is so light weight. I ended up buying two packs but do make sure that they are the larger ones. I have seem them at target but if you look at the sizes they are different.",

I would say if you can get a deal on these, sure, get them. They are light, breathable, and very large which is great for swaddling.

Great as a blanket anywhere! For cooler weather, I swaddle once and wrap a second blanket rolled around the swaddle. I bought 2 sets (8 total).
