If you want a portable gaming computer, this is the way to go. you might be thinking about getting the Razer Blade but it wont have the power to run high graphic games. you will need to buy the accessory that increases your GPU power and the accessory itself costs a fortune. with this you wont have to worry about that.",

The HDMI port doesn't work properly if you close the lid - you get audio problems with a lot of apps and frequent hard crashes.",

Only criticism I do have is the colour on the keyboard has started to come off. This means that I can see the lights inside the laptop. The extra fans is a good feature, but they can be noisey - headphones usually rectify this issue. I have to date player MW3, Black Ops, Warcry, Ghosts, Battlefield and they all seem to work perfectly even on high resolution.",

Overall its a every powerful gaming computer and love it, Just wish i could fix that one problem! If anyone - or creator can help it would be gratefully taken.. Thanks",

Currently playing skyrim on ultra settings with a sold 40-60 fps, mostly 60. it does get a little warm after playing for a while but it's to be expected. The only downside with this is that it comes with an American keyboard. No \u00a3 symbol and the @ symbol is in the wrong place. Other than that I would highly reccomend this to anyone looking for a well priced gaming laptop.",
