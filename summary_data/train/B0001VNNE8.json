However my lower rating is just to flag this: THE CONTROLLER DOES NOT COME WITH THE RECEIVER I don't know if it was my receiver or controller that died, but I now wish I had saved the receiver. Again, DID NOT COME WITH RECEIVER. It doesn't really say it does, but what good is it without it? Others note that many sellers don't sell the receiver, I'll have to track it down myself.",

The controller is larger than your wired controller, but not objectionably so. the range is excellent and the battery life is quite good. I have used it for several hours on a few different games and the thing performs as well as my wired controllers. I see no lag in action, and I completely forget I am using a wireless controller when I play the games. That is one of the touchstones I use for wireless devices: do they function well enough that you don't have to make accommodations and do they \"disappear\" when in use.",

Connection is easy, no messing with manuals or buttons, it just connects right out of the box. All the buttons and controls feel smooth and responsive.

      "text": "I got this for my husband because his old controller (with cord) wasn't working properly. After looking at the all the reviews, I decided to chance it. My husband is an avid game player, and he really enjoys this controller. He says it works just like the one with the cord, and it feels pretty much the same. He said he has no complaints. When I asked him how he'd rate this controller, he said, \"Great! Wonderful!\" I'm happy that he's happy, and appreciate the other reviews that were written so that I had something to base my decision on.",

The only other thing is that the receiver was/is designed for the older play station. It tends to be a bit thicker than it needs to be for the slim version and it raises it up just a little.",

Take my word for it, I would buy this controller even if they were $50. You won't be disappointed!!!",

I wish it had a rechargeable battery pack instead of taking two AA batteries, but the batteries will last you a good amount of time before they need replacing so it's not much of an issue. I highly recommend this controller to anyone who still plays their PS2. Not being limited by a cord is amazing, and for under 30 bucks you really can't go wrong.",
