      "verdict": "Being compared to the Adidas Copa Mundial, it seems that Nike made the right move when they created the heritage-inspired Nike Premier. Praises flowed for the soft goat and kangaroo leather upper from the majority of the cleat\u2019s users. The ball touch is also excellent says some of its buyers. Perhaps the only hitch for the shoe is its sizing. A consensus from reviewers is that the shoe comes in a size small. So, it is suggested by most to go a half-size up to get the best possible fit.",
      "pros": [
        "An expert reviewer shared that the Nike Premier soccer cleat provides an excellent stud penetration due to its stud configuration",
        "A number of commenters praised the amount of comfort brought about by its goatskin leather upper",
        "A significant number of reviews loved the classic look sported by this Nike soccer shoe",
        "The pair is a tad lighter than the Adidas Copa Mundial which is its direct competitor",
        "A soccer cleat critic expressed delight in the Nike Premier soccer cleats\u2019 apparent quality",
        "One player mentioned how the firm ground shoe brings an excellent ball touch"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "While not necessarily heavy, the Nike Premier soccer cleat is not the lightest cleat in the market, weighing at 8.6 ounces",
        "There have been mixed reviews regarding the cleat\u2019s fit as some say that the pair is true to size, while others argue that one needs to go a half size up for a good fit"

      "title": "Superb - great for comfort",
      "text": "Not usually a fan of Nike football boots, I opted for the Premier as they were cheaper than my preferred Puma King boots. Probably the most comfortable sub-\u00a3100 boots I've ever owned, the insole moulded to my foot after two games, meaning long-term comfort. The tongue is soft so that it doesn't dig into the front of your shin/ankle and the inside of it means striking even a hard ball doesn't cause any discomfort. Playing on a 3G pitch, the sealed toe portion means that black beads haven't ruined the sole just yet - which hopefully means they'll last a long time. Can't fault them, and I'll likely buy another pair.",

      "text": "I'm a big fan of these boots for football refereeing. I am typically a size 11 for running and normal shoes, but went size 12 this time around in these: Size 11 would be WAY too tight (as in 'ouch') and 11.5 was borderline and I ended up with black toes last season. Size 12 has been absolutely perfect and they fit like a glove with no comfort whatsoever, right from the beginning. In short, when I am wearing these, I forget I am wearing them and just get on with the game. That's the mark of a good boot! Plus, they have a great classic look.",
