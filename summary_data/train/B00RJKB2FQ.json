Also, the carrier does not have wheel studs pressed in, rather it uses carriage bolts., which means that you must hold the tire up, slide in a carriage bolt from the back of the carrier, then screw on the lug nut. Takes a lot of effort to perform what should be a simple task. So I spot welded the heads of the carriage bolts to the back side of the carrier plate. Other than all that, made well enough.",

This comes with brackets with lots of different hole spacings to bolt to the tongue of the trailer. I had already added a cheap trailer jack from HF, and I was able to re-arrange the brackets so that both the trailer jack on the left and the spare tire on the right could share the same mounting bolts. This worked really well and saved space. A great deal at this price, sturdy and well finished.",

      "text": "A little disappointed in my research, because I thought this would side-mount to the trailer bed. Nope, it's intended for the trailer tongue as advertised. Fits well, I step across the tongue a lot and didn't want to contend with a tire mounted there. I'll probably modify later. I reamed the jack mount holes for the supplied 3/8\" bolts and bolted the holder to the opposite side (see photo). Good quality, nice welds, thick material, 3/8\" dia bolts, built to last. A little over-engineered for a small spare tire, but I'm okay with that. Buy this.",

Of course you can not use lock washers with Lug nuts. so you have to put the bolt thru the bracket install Flat Washers, Lock washers and the afore mentioned Hex nuts. Then you can put the wheel on and use the lug nuts to hold it.....",
