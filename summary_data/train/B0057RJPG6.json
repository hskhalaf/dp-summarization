When the sand gets down to the last few moments the sand stops going through, so all of the sand does not go through. It must not have enough weight for the last minutes worth of sand to go through. Other people who have left one star reviews are spot on, I have no idea how anyone else could leave a review of anything less than one star?",

The brass looks as though it has been in my home for many years and blends well no matter where I choose to put it. I highly recommend this hourglass.",
