Works great plenty of power and unit itself and fan are very quiet. All-in-all I am very pleased with this microwave. As for the breaking handle I find this handle to be very secure no problems with quality. Also this unit is one of the higher rated microwave ovens in many unbiased reports, and has one of the lowest repair records.",

This is an energy saving feature and when you touch the energy saver button is reappears, but only for another 5 minutes. I do not like this feature and would like the time to remain on at all times. The microwave is powerful and cooks and reheats the food well. The timer only goes off one time and does not repeat to remind you. The microwave lacks a safety feature to prevent it from starting if the door has not been opened and there is no food in it.",

The main problem is that after only a year-and-a-half of regular use, the magnetron stopped working entirely (light, fan, turntable, and keypad, but no microwaving). Thankfully, Assurant is issuing a full refund because I am still within my 3-year extended warranty period, but it's a shame since the microwave still looks great.",

We've had it for a few months and couldn't be happier with it. No problems at all! Heats quickly and we love the one-touch buttons. The viewing window is a bit small, but who really watches their food cook? You'll be happy you bought this!",
