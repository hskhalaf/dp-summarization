They worked great for the sectional sofa, but you don't need the extender to move everything. We used the FF on three separate moving occasions and they've held up great. Works for oversized furniture, heavy dressers, tall bookshelves and mattress and box springs. Navigating inclines and stairs was a bit tricky.

Sadly we just couldn't get these Forearm Forklifts to help us. I was fortunate to have them there to help me. I've heard they work great (even by my uncle who helped) but not for moving a piano.",

Tip: Watch the video in the product description several times before you use them. It really helps protect your wrists and hands from injury. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the middle section of the straps where the lifted object rests can sometimes slip, especially on smooth surfaces, causing the object to fall. This product could be greatly improved if there was a non-slip material sewn onto the middle section to grip onto the lifted object.",

The size & shape of the equipment is such that the equipment wobbled around a bit when being carried, however, the Forearm Forklift made this move extremely easy otherwise since we were able to lift the equipment using our forearms and to avoid bending forward in order to lift this equipment using our backs. The Forearm Forklift is well worth the cost and should be kept at the ready for these occasional heavy lifting exercises.",

To avoid accidentally buying an inferior fake product, be sure the offer above reads, \"Ships from and sold by . \" If it doesn't, look under \"Other Sellers on \" and choose as the seller. IMPORTANT is that you have Forearm Forklift branded products when you move heavy furnishings. Forearm Forklift Lifting Straps are a pair of straps that are ergonomically designed to encourage proper lifting techniques and are OSHA accepted to reduce back injuries due to heavy and repetitive lifting. These straps employ leverage which makes the items being carried seem 66 percent lighter. This makes it much easier to go up and down a flight of stairs, and to turn around corners. Forearm Forklift Lifting Straps save floors from scratches, dents, scuffs and scrapes that dollies and hand trucks leave behind. They are adjustable up to 48 inches so you can easily carry small (SM), medium (MED), large (LG) and extra-large (XL) items. Forearm Forklift Lifting Straps are portable and they can conveniently be stored in a drawer, tool box, or under a truck seat. Forearm Forklift Lifting Straps are affordable, safe, ergonomically designed, adjustable, and portable.",
