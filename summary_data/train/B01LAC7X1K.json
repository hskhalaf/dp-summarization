It is very simple to operate and no special software is needed. Just plug it into your computer and the appropriate software will open (either your music player or your video player). It is simple to pop the disc in and play. It's also very slim and doesn't take up a lot of room. I would recommend this item as a good value, especially for the price!",

Any suggestions?\" It turns out that the adapter needs to be pushed pretty hard into the thunderbolt port. It was not completely seated at first and I had no power. Once it was properly seated, everything worked fine. HOWEVER, if you have thunderbolt ports you will need a usb3.0 to thunderbolt adapter, which adds $8-$10 to the total cost. Not a big deal but something you should know. Product info should make it clear.",

When I pulled the plug and reset it, it read the DVD. But it would not read the next one (actually froze). I am returning unit for a refund. I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap in, cheap out.",

I have been trying to burn CDs however, the does not seem to be functional. it is difficult for me to determine if it is a device or a computer issue. It however, is frustrating, to say the least! I want to say how great the customer service has been!!! I still don't know why it stopped burning cds, but the company has been great and has replaced the drive. I am increasing my rating by a star. fingers crossed, it will work just fine. the customerr service is truly 5 stars.",
