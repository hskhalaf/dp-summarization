I dont know if it was with all the lenses or maybe just mine... but after i tweaked the \"micro focusing\", I was/am happy with my purchase. Struggles a bit with low light focusing so i change lens for my night shoots on the beach. The sweet spot is 5.6... it is super sharp at that aperture. So once again... definitely worth the price",

I can't compare it to the Canon 24-70L because I've never used one, but for the price, and if you are not a pro (even if you are, imho), you can't go wrong. If you get a bad copy, Amazon is easy and free to exchange. I adore it.",

I don't like the hood and have had lens flare when shooting somewhat into the sun, but I still block w/my hand and it's been great.

    "title": "Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 IF EX DG HSM AF Standard Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras",
    "description": "Style:Nikon Digital SLR CamerasThis large aperture standard zoom lens covers focal lengths from 24mm and is housed in compact construction. The latest optical design provides an overall length of 94.7cm /3.7inch. It is ideal for general photography such as snapshots, portraiture and landscapes. The Super Multi Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting. ELD (Extraordinary Low Dispersion) glass, two SLD (Special Low Dispersion) glass elements and three aspherical lenses provide excellent correction of all types of aberrations. Superior optical performance is ensured throughout the entire zoom range. This lens incorporates HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor), ensuring a quiet and high speed AF as well as full time manual focusing capability. This lens has a minimum focusing distance of 38cm/15in and a maximum magnification ratio of 1:5.3. The rounded 9 blades diaphragm creates an attractive blur. It is possible to attach the included petal-type hood to block out extraneous light.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\n\nCOMPACT LARGE APERTURE STANDARD ZOOM LENS EQUIPPED WITH HSM FOR THE LATEST DIGITAL SLR CAMERAS\nThis large aperture standard zoom lens covers focal lengths from 24mm and is housed in a compact construction. The latest optical design provides a compact construction and is ideal for general photography. ELD (Extraordinary Low Dispersion) glass, two SLD (Special Low Dispersion) glass elements and three aspherical lenses provide excellent correction of all types of aberrations. This lens incorporates HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor), ensuring a quiet and high speed AF as well as full time manual focus capability. This lens has a minimum focusing distance of 38cm/15in and a maximum magnification ratio of 1:5.3. The rounded 9 blades diaphragm creates an attractive blur.\n\nEXCELLENT OPTICAL PERFORMANCE\nELD (Extraordinary Low Dispersion) glass, two SLD (Special Low Dispersion) glass elements, two molded glass aspherical lenses and a hybrid aspherical lens provide excellent correction for all type of aberrations. High image quality is assured throughout the entire zoom range.\n\nLARGE APERTURE STANDARD ZOOM LENS WITH COMPACT CONSTRUCTION\nThe lens has a compact construction with an overall length of 94.7mm (3.7\"). It is ideal for many situations such as portrait, landscape and general photography.\n\nF2.8 LARGE APERTURE OVER THE ENTIRE ZOOM RANGE\nThis lens offers a large aperture of F2.8 over its entire zoom range. It provides freedom of creative expression and is ideal for photography indoors or in dim lighting.\n\nHyper Sonic Motor HSM (HYPER SONIC MOTOR)\nHSM indicates lenses equipped with a Hyper Sonic Motor, driven by ultrasonic waves. HSM ensures a quiet and high speed AF as well as full-time manual focus override by rotation of the focus ring.\n\nINNER FOCUSING SYSTEM\nThe polygonal shape of a conventional iris diaphragm causes outo-focus light points to appear polygonal. A rounded diaphragm is designed to produce rounded outo-focus light points when opened to near maximum aperture. This creates attractive bokeh effects in many situations, such as when photographing a subject against an out-of-focus surface of water from which light is being reflected.\n\nNo Super Multi-Layer Coating (left). With Super Multi-Layer Coating (right). REDUCED FLARE AND GHOSTING\nSigma's own Super Multi-Layer Coating suppresses flare and ghosting by preventing reflections within the lens. All DG and DC lenses in the current Sigma range feature this original technology. In digital cameras, flare and ghosting may also be caused by reflections between the image sensor and lens surfaces. Here too, Sigma's Super Multi-Layer Coating is highly effective, assuring images of outstanding contrast.\n\nPETAL-TYPE HOOD\nThis lens is equipped with a Petal-type hood to block out extraneous light and reduce internal reflections. LENS CONSTRUCTION\nIn a conventional lens, focusing requires an extension of the entire lens or the front lens group. However, to better accommodate autofocusing mechanisms and closeup photography, a need has arisen for lenses that do not change their length during focusing or suffer from focus-dependent variation in aberration. Therefore, Sigma has developed focusing systems that only move elements within the lens barrel. These incorporate smaller and lighter moving lens elements which help improve auto-focus speed. With their unchanging barrel length and small variation in the center of gravity, these lenses also enhance balance and stability for the photographer. Furthermore, since the front of the lens does not rotate, polarizing filters can be used with extra convenience.\n\nLens Construction 14 Elements in 12 Groups Angle of View 84.1 -34.3 degrees Number of Diaphragm Blades 9 Blades Minimum Aperture F22 (Rounded diaphragm) Minimum Focusing Distance 38cm / 15.0in. Maximum Magnification 1:5.3 Filter Size Diameter 82mm Dimensions Diameter 88.6mm x Length 94.7mm / 3.5in. x 3.7in. Weight 790g / 27.9oz. MTF CHART\nView Larger Image MTF (Modular Transfer Function) is one of the measurements that evaluates a lens' performance, and it contrasts sensitivity at different spacial frequencies. The horizontal axis is in millimeters and shows the distance from the center of the image toward the edges, and contrast value (highest value is 1) is shown in the vertical axis.\n\nThe readings at 10 lines per millimeter measure the lens' contrast ability (red lines), repeating fine parallel lines spaced at 30 lines per millimeter measure the lens' sharpness ability (green lines), when the aperture is wide open. Fine repeating line sets are created parallel to a diagonal line running from corner to corner of the frame, are called Sagittal lines (S) and sets of repeating lines vertical to these lines are drawn, called Meridional (M) line sets.\n\nDISTORTION\nView Larger Image effective distortion: When you take a picture of a lattice pattern, it will appear as the blue dotted line shows. the red line illustrates how the lattice pattern will appear in the actual picture when any lens distortion is taken into account.\n\nrelative distortion: In this chart, the horizontal axis shows the ideal image height (the distance from the center to the edge of the image [mm]). The vertical axis shows the extent of distortion. The extent of the distortion is represented by how much Y, which is the actual image height, grows (or shrinks) against Y0 which is the ideal image height.\n\nExtent of distortion: D[%]=(Y-Y0/Y0)x100\n\nWhen you take the picture of a square object, if the distortion amount show a minus value, the image will be seen as expanded (Barrel distortion). If the distortion amount is a plus value, it will be seen as a recessed (pincushi on distortion). When the distortion value is close to 0, the appearance of distortion is very minimal.\n\nVIGNETTING\nView Larger Image The horizontal axis shows the image height (the distance from the center to the edge of the image [mm]). The vertical axis shows the amount of light in the image (based on the amount of light in the image center being 100%). If the peripheral amount of light is lower than the center, the four corners of the image will be darker (vignetting).",
