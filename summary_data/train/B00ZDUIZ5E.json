I used to go with the Gel Kayano shoes (another great style), but I decided to give these a shot last year...and I haven't gone back. They are much lighter than the Kayanos, and they seem to have more cushion/bounce. They don't have quite as much stability as the Kayanos do, but they are adequate. They also don't last quite as long as the Kayanos have for me. Side notes: Be careful running on wet surfaces with these shoes--I slip almost every time. Also, I prefer these shoes over the Quantum 360s; the 360s have way too much cushion for my feet.",

Also, buy thenm one half size larger, they run small.

    "description": "Set your stride soaring in the ASICS\u00ae GEL-Quantum 180\u2122 running shoe! Predecessor: None. Support Type: Neutral to underpronation (supination). Cushioning: Maximum cushioning. Surface: Road. Differential: 10 mm. Light, breathable textile and synthetic film upper materials. Nearly seamless upper design helps reduce the likelihood of irritation. Lace-up closure. Padded tongue and collar. Soft, breathable fabric lining for a great in-shoe feel. Removable ComforDry\u2122 X-40 sockliner features antimicrobial properties for a drier, healthier environment. Solyte\u00ae midsole is lighter than standard EVA and SpEVA\u00ae designed by ASICS. Its responsive nature provides a supremely cushioned ride and makes it highly durable. Rearfoot and forefoot GEL\u00ae cushioning systems work together to better attenuate shock during impact and toe-off phases, and allowing movement in multiple planes as the foot transitions through the gait cycle. 180\u00b0 of GEL\u00ae cushioning disperses impacting shock and sets the foot up for a buttery smooth transition to midstance. Heel/Toe: 22 mm/12 mm AHAR\u00ae rubber outsole delivers supreme durability. Trusstic System\u00ae offers support and a highly-responsive ride with each stride. ComforDry\u2122 lasting supplies underfoot comfort, exceptional breathability, and antimicrobial technology. Imported. Measurements: Weight: 11 oz Product measurements were taken using size 7.5, width B - Medium. Please note that measurements may vary by size.",
