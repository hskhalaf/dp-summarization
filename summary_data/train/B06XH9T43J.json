Very uncomfortable even for short distances. Pedal looks good but I\u2019m returning mine. They are sold as a pair.",

I do miss the toe clips I have used since I was a teenager but I will get used to not having them in time. My one complaint is that they don't spin freely. While it doesn't make the ride much different I would think it is taking up a little bit of energy with its resistance that should be making it the ground..",

That being said these are not for hardcore off road mountain biking and are not meant for that as their pins will not eat through your shoe soles, I use them on my track bike or my commuter road bike, my racing road bike has clipless. My only issue is that if I wear soft shoes like say boosts or something soft when Im putting down power I can feel the rod in the center of the pedal because it doesn't have a flat top. If I wear skating shoes though this is not an issue. So I would recommend to a friend.",
