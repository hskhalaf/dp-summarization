I have always hated glass screen protectors. I have bought cheap ones, I have bought expensive ones, but this one has been the first I have truly liked.",

A removable screen cover is much more convenient (and cheaper) to replace and repair than a trip to the Apple store. Good value, highly recommended.",

I only gave 3 stars because I only got 1 day of use out of the product, which was disappointing. However, it is possible that it would stand up better with a thicker case (extends far enough out in front of the phone).",

Both times my phone was dropped, this screen protector absorbed the impact and protected my phone\u2019s screen. It was also easy to remove after it shattered both times. Installation is a little tricky, as the iPhone X has a curved screen so the screen protector is a little smaller than the phone screen. Getting it lined up was a little tricky but not too difficult. The touch screen works great with this protector and there is no noticeable extra glare.",
