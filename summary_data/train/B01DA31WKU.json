This brand does not and takes up a lot of space in the RV storage area. The hose it's self seems fine but you can't flex it into the position that you might what because it is so ridged. I will be going back to the last brand that I had the next time that I need one.",

It seems more durable than any I had seen before, and the ends are definitely beefier. It says 10ft on the box but it expands to probably twice that or more. I don't think I will have to worry about leaks with this one, as it seems quite durable yet flexible. I just hope it can endure the Texas sunshine, heat and rocky terrain.

We, so broke, were just heartbroken. I realized a Thetford I had as part of our 2-line RV system was 'still' not cracked and got the picture. Someone in our home did accidentally stretch our main Thetford hose way too far for some crazy reason & it stayed that stretched size. Just don't over-forcefully stretch them..",
