The vet said he just had a sensitive stomach or maybe a food allergy. We tried food after food. I bought this stuff because nothing else seemed to make any difference. As usual, he gobbled it down, but this time no barfing! I waited two weeks before reviewing just in case it was a fluke (he's crafty like that) but he hasn't vomited since the food change. He also loves the taste, so happy cat AND happy person!",
