These moccasins however are starting off snug. Its difficult to get my foot all the way in the shoe so my heel does not hang off the back. I am hoping that with use it will get easier to get on. Of course they are super comfortable and warm once my foot is all in the way in. I just wish they made half sizes!",

I threw some suede protector on them and was able to wear them outside in light, wet snow today. I had great traction on the wet ground, the wool kept my feet warm, and they still look brand new. I am pregnant and due in three weeks, so these help so much with avoiding struggling to put warm boots on and take them off. I highly recommend. :)",
