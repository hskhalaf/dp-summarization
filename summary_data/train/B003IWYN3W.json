I fixed this by buying some of the gel inserts, but don't feel this should be necessary in a new product. The fit seemed to me to be a little large, after a little trial and error I discovered they were more comfortable if the strap across the front is a little loose, when pulled tight it cuts into my ankles. They do keep my feet warm!",

So I sent them back, they don't do half sizes so I ordered a pair of 11s. Got them, tried to put them on and they were so tight, I could barely get them on (and this was with regular socks)! I'm not sure what happned here, if this was a fluke or what but I literally can't even own these because one size won't go on and the next size up falls off my foot if I pick it up.

These boots are not water resistant at all- so at the slightest moisture level they became saturated and haven\u2019t been totally dry for months- despite leaving them in front of heat source whenever not in use. Trying to take out, dry & then replace the liners is very difficult and time consuming. After removing them once they never fully went back in right.

The velcro ankle strap can be loosened if needed to slide feet in with ease, then snug for a secure fit. The construction is solid and sure to be durable.

Each pair has made it through 2-3 kids before needing to be replaced, so great quality for the price point.",

They worked great especially when I would sink two or three feet into the snow, never once did I worry about getting wet. They held up nice and also gave me enough grip to walk on some ice. Overall great boot and great price",

If you are buying Kamiks for a kid or teenager, they will outgrow them before they wear out...excellent for hand-me-downs. One year I went cheap and bought some off-brand at a department store; will NEVER do that again. The off-brand started coming apart after the second or third wear on my son. These Kamiks hold up to even the toughest kiddo. I know...my son is one of them! :0) There is only one negative I can think of.....the boots are a bit heavy. Other than that, they are 5 stars in our book!",
