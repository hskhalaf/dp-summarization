(The original, non-flavored variety seems to be thicker, so would probably still pour, but might require some beating/shaking.) When I close the lid, I get a little puff of creamer that I've stopped wiping off of the brim because it blends in anyways and it's not that serious. Not much else to say, I'm just glad I finally found something that does what I was looking for.",
