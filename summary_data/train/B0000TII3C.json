The water resistance never fails and I have never had the night light quit in any of the watches. And I use the night light daily after dark and when I wake up in bed.

Gives plenty of links to adjust to wrist. This is for my Dad of 87 years. His other watches are Eco's and not keeping time as well. (they need light and motion) I kidded him he should get a watch like his pacemaker, 'takes a licking and keeps on ticking' like Timex. He put his nose up to that.

It's very easy to read, and has a great backlight; that lights up the whole dial, day and date too! This has become my go to watch. I'm liking it's old fashioned, manly look.

The day and date could be a bit more readable, but perhaps not at this cost. The Rolex I once got a relative had a little magnifying glass built into the lens but otherwise performed no better. Superior quality for the price and excellent time keeping at any price point.",

I purchased a Timex 3 years ago and continuously use the Indigo light at night and I have never had to replace the battery in those 3 years plus. The battery in these are guaranteed for 10 years. All in all this watch is well worth the price you pay for. They were quickly received when ordered online through Amazon. No regrets whatsoever.",
