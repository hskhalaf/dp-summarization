For this one, I kept my darts from getting too dull. This board lasted only 2 MONTHS. I am now switching to the DMI Bandit, staple free dart board and we'll see how that goes. Also, my other Blade boards shipped fine but THIS one I had to tap in both bullseye rings with a deadblow mallet. I was very surprised this was necessary. UNACCEPTABLE.",

After that it gets some hard spots and some holes in your heavy use areas(triple20, bullseye, etc.), making bounce outs occur. When the board is in good condition a dart never hits the ground. We love the design of the beveled wires to deflect darts into the board, whereas round wires bounce the dart out onto the floor most of the time causing bent tips and dart damage. We replace our board yearly because we love it. They arent meant to last forever.",

You sink a small bracket into the wall, preferable into a 2x4 and then the dart board hangs from it. What's sweet is that there are three feet that screw into the backside of the dartboard allowing you to adjust the dartboard very securely from the wall. Maybe that's a common mounting system, not sure, but it works excellently!",

To keep track of scoring, we just downloaded an app on our phone that works great. Definitely worth it",

    "title": "Winmau Blade 5 Dual Core Bristle Dartboard with Increased Scoring Area and Improved Dart Deflection for Reduced Bounce-Outs",
    "description": "The Blade 5 Dual Core is the pinnacle of dartboard technology and innovation. Exclusive Dual Core technology features 2 layers of sisal \u2013 the outermost layer features lower compression fibers for increased dart penetration and fewer lost darts, while the inner layer features higher compression fibers that offer greater durability. This combination gives players the greatest level of dart retention and the highest level of performance and durability in one board. The face of the board also features a high visibility playing surface that offers perfect vision for increased scoring potential. The new wiring system of this professional-level bristle dartboard allows for 9mm2 extra scoring area in the doubles and 6mm2 extra scoring area in the trebles, with a 14% reduction in web surface area than the previous generation Blade 4 Dual Core for higher scoring. The Dynamic Sector Wires are 20% thinner and the Radial Wires are 10% thinner for the greatest scoring potential of any dartboard in history. The Blade 5 has optimized the razor wire angle, reducing the blades by 30 degrees to increase dart deflection in the scoring bed. In addition to the thinnest wiring available, the Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) of the dynamic sector wire has been increased by 20% to ensure that dart points glide past the wire and into the scoring bed. A new bullseye and 25 ring feature carbon diffusion technology for an ultra-hard surface and improved performance and durability. The Blade 5 now features Rota-Lock, triple wheel lock-and-level system, creating perfect radial alignment and leveling and enabling easy rotation to increase the life of the board. Since 1997, the Winmau Blade series has delivered revolutionary technologies that have set the standard in darts. Experience the best that money can buy with the Winmau Blade 5 Dual Core dartboard.",
