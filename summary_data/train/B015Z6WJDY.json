But it doesn\u2019t...not even close. I really can\u2019t explain what this tastes like, other than I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna like it if you like mango Hibiscus. But if you like bitter, nearly undrinkable things, go for it. By the way, mixing this with the regular mango hibiscus ruins the sweet mango hibiscus and makes it taste just as bad as the unsweetened version. Not a good purchase for me.",

This was a great alternative way to get a 12 pack shipped directly home. No more hassle of carrying heavy items and the cost was better than at brick & mortar. Thanks Amazon! As for Pure Leaf, please look at doing more unsweetened flavors. Many of us can't use artificial or non-sugar sweeteners (allergies or don't like the taste) and once you are accustomed to no sugar added, its hard to drink anything that is loaded with sweetness.

These have always arrived quickly and in perfect condition each time I have ordered. For those who have not had it previously, it is a pretty sweet tea hence the \"Extra Sweet\" but it is not overly sweet whatsoever. No complaints at all from this shopper.",

The only problem is if you're following the American heart association than this is absolutely too much sugar intake. 1 bottle has 46g of sugar. For women the daily intake should be 25g. For men it's 37.5g. So going by that chart alone this bottle contains more sugar in one bottle more than our intakes should be. I always assumed tea is always healthy but apparently I was wrong.",

The first couple of shipments with the foreign substance in it contained maybe one bottle or two so I thought they may have broken open in shipment. But the last three shipments I have received have over 40% of the bottles with the issue. Seems like there is a major quality control issue here and if you don't see it and open the bottle and drink it watch out. It is a horrible experience. Seems like a health issue as well.",
