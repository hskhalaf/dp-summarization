I was hesitant for price but wow, what a difference. My hair is thin but frizzy. This thing does a fabulous job. I followed instructions and found about 300 degrees works well for me.

      "text": "I bought one 5 years ago and used it weekly for me and my girls. It had dropped on my hardwood floor too many times and the ceramic plate separated from the back. As far as the new infrared Croc, I was disappointed that the red, infrared strip has been reduced to 1/3 it's width from the one I bought years ago. It still straightens our curls like the older model. The ergonomic design is the same and allows for a better grip than other flat irons that are just oval or rectangular. I love my Croc flat iron.",
