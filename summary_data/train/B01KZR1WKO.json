This is the first quick release front tire I've worked with and it took me a while to realize that you don't loosen the nuts on the wheel to put it on the bike, you insert the quick release gizmo through the wheel. Solid Bike, looks great and a joy to ride from my daughter. Even the seat is comfortable for her. NOTE: We did buy a kick-stand for this bike as it does not come with one. That seems strange to me.",

Also have to finish set-up of brakes once handle bar is installed. Gears worked perfectly with no adjustment required. Only complaint is that rear rim was out of round, so had significant wobble, which made set-up of rear brake difficult. Had to adjust spokes to reduce the wobble to acceptable level, but still not perfect Front rim did not require adjustment. Would not recommend purchase unless have experience with this type of issue, or know someone who can help. Not worth the hassle of sending back for this issue, since no guarantee a replacement would be any better.",
