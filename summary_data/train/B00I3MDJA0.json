About half sticks over the top, but its fine. I can still move it. The original pump died during the second use, but amazon support is amazing and looked up the blower rating and sent me a comparable one overnight for free since this was for my daughters 3rd b-day party. Keep an eye on bigger kids (over 4?), if they hang over the rail near the top of the slide they could topple out. Overall, love it. would buy it again.",

Both about 50 lbs. they have had 2 more kinds in it. It will move on you if you don't stake it. It's not easy to fold and store, really heavy. We roll it up after it deflates the. Fold it into a shelled storage bin. It did get a small tear I. It about a week after we got it. Most likely from my trying the fold it into the bin. I used some sealer to stop the tear and it worked great.",

It\u2019s easy to set up. It\u2019s not easy to roll it back up and store it. The big negative is the mesh walls don\u2019t provide a strong resistance. A few times kids have jump into the wall - only to tip the wall enough that they land on the grass - while still on the mesh. Like in a pocket. No injuries but the walls should be not so movable. Less wild children would be safer on this. My boys are wild.",
