I was shopping around for an entry level SLR, the canon rebel xt, but decided on the G7 instead. I'm not a professional photographer so I figured I wouldn't be using all the features on an SLR camera. If you're in this 'tweener category (between point and shoot vs SLR), this is the camera to get. There are so many features that I can't even begin to list them all. Amazon offers it at a great price. I also purchased the waterproof housing and I can't wait to go snorkling with it.",

      "text": "The main reason I purchased the G7 was for the full manual mode. I take many macro shots and the G7 is capable of getting very close. The Manual focus takes a little getting used to because you are adjusting a dial and not the lens. The image quality is crisp and the color depth is incredible. The G7 has a quality feel and nice old-school design but It's not a pocket camera. It's small but has bulk. The extra ISO dial makes it quick and easy to change film speed. The G7 also has a nice zoom that can be increased with add on lenses. I really like the G7 for its design speed and quality.",

Price from Amazon was also excellent and cheaper than store prices. I was afraid the camera would be bigger than it is, but it's actually a convenient size - not so big to be obnoxious to carry around, but big enough to be comfortable in my hands when taking pictures. Highly recommend the G7 to anyone looking to upgrade from a standard digital camera without the extra size and complications of an SLR. The zoom is great, too!",

However, any owner of the G7 should be pleased as it's a great camera. I'm coming from a G4 and it's been extremely dependable and the G7 was light years in improvements.",

It produces excellent image details even when printed large and also enables several new benefits such as Digital Teleconverter and Safety Zoom. \n\n6x Optical Zoom Lens with IS\nFeatures a 35-210mm equivalent zoom lens with image stabilization. Designed specifically for the 10-megapixel CCD, this lens features a new internal focusing system and an advanced dual-sided aspherical lens element for the best possible results. \n\nDIGIC III Image Processor\nTakes the performance and speed of DIGIC II to even higher levels of processing power including new face detection function, up to 1600 speed ISO, high-ISO noise reduction, lower power consumption, increased speed for SD media cards, and higher resolution image processing for enhanced LCD viewing. \n\nFace-Priority AF/AE\nIntelligent Face-Priority AF mode reliably detects faces and focuses on them. Detects three faces when shooting in standby and up to nine when shutter button is pressed halfway. When faces are detected the exposure is also biased for proper facial illumination while maintaining overall scene brightness. \n\nLarge 2.5-Inch Color LCD Monitor\nEnjoy composing and reviewing images with wide view 2.5-inch LCD monitor. With this size LCD screen, it is quite easy to navigate through the menu and utilize the direct printing features. \n\nHot Shoe\nVersatile design allows for use of any current Canon Speedlite including macro flashes and wireless TLL. (Off-camera flashes and accessories not included--must be purchased separately.) \n\nDigital Teleconverter and Safety Zoom\n\"Virtual teleconverter\" simulates the effect of a 1.4x or 2.3x physical teleconversion lens. With Safety Zoom, digital zooming is initially limited to preserve maximum pixel resolution. \n\n3:2 Guide and Widescreen Mode\nHelpful 3:2 guide masks the LCD screen to reveal the printable area of a standard 4 x 6-inch print. Also, capture still images in a 16:9 aspect ratio to view on widescreen computer monitors and televisions. \n\nMy Category\nImproves playback experience by allowing user to put images into seven categories: People, Scenery, Events, Category 1-3, or To Do. With My Category deleting and protecting images has never been easier. \n\nWaterproof Case\nExpand creative photo opportunities with the waterproof case WP-DC11. Take up to 130 feet underwater and still utilize all of the controls the camera has to offer. (This case is not included. It must be purchased separately.)",
