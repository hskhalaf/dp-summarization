The largest pot strainer fits inside the IP with around 2\" to spare at the top for the lid to close. The tongs handles well when boiling, and the egg boiler helps keep them steady. I've put everything through the dishwasher without any issues. I wish it came in more colors.",

The egg bite mold is a bit smaller than if you bought a baby-food mold, but will work for the same purpose and your egg bites will be equally delicious. The egg cooker rack is great and the steamer will be exactly what many recipes call for. The springform pan is also a necessity for a number of fun recipes m so all in all, the pieces are exactly what you\u2019d buy separately, however with this kit, you\u2019ll save a bit of $$. I\u2019d recommend for all new Instant Pot users.",
