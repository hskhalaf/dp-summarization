      "text": "This is one of the \"lighter\" tasting flax seed oils I have had. I was worried when it was delivered sitting in the sun on a 90 degree day but it was completely fine. I'm a bit more then half done with the bottle after a little more then two weeks and the taste is about the same as when I started (I know these tend to \"go bad\" quickly). Little pricy though...I may look around locally for a better $/oz ratio.",

I was surprised at how full I was after eating it in my regular breakfast. It has definitely helped reduce my appetite and after reading about the other benefits on line (reduce joint inflammation, cholesterol, triglicerides, etc), I am hooked!",

    "description": "Pure, unfiltered and unrefined. That\u2019s music to our ears at Barlean\u2019s, and our Organic Lignan Flax Oil is all those things and more. With its wholesome, nutty flavor, Barlean\u2019s Lignan Flax Oil provides a whopping 7,230mg of plant-based ALA Omega-3 fatty acid per tablespoon. Omega-3s are vital fatty acids that cannot be produced by the body, so we need to get them from foods or supplements. Barlean\u2019s Organic Lignan Flax Oil is an award-winning unfiltered organic flax oil, freshly pressed in the Pacific Northwest, and protected from damaging heat and light from seed to bottle. It includes nutrient- and antioxidant containing flax lignans, great additions to a healthy diet for the whole family. Pro tip: you\u2019ll want to give the bottle a vigorous shake before using since we\u2019ve left in some of the flax particulate which can settle to the bottom between uses.",
