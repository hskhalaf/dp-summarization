Fast forward several frustrating hours of trying to figure out why the PC wouldn't see the full volume of the drive, instead only showing 250GB available space. Went back to double check the box. Upon closer inspection realized that this was NOT a 1TB drive, but a 250GB drive, mislabeled as 1TB. Very angry that this inventory screw up derailed my weekend. Pissed that the replacement is not being expedited, especially since the issue is completely Amazon's fault.",

Labels on the SSD itself also look legit for a Samsung device, but its not. Amazon return policy sort of fails here. The only choices are 'return for replacement' or 'return for refund'. If I choose replacement, how would I know if I would get a genuine device since their supply chain is obviously compromised? What I would like is a replacement that they guarantee is correct. Looks like the safe choice is to take the refund and take my business elsewhere.",

Still, I couldn't figure out why throughput is still no more than 500MB/s. Maybe it has something 2 do with my MacMini's firmware.",

This is a PCIE 3.0 so if you want the full speeds and all of the benefits, make sure you have a motherboard that supports PCIE 3.0 for the m.2 slot! I have quite a few games installed on this. Batman series from Rocksteady, WoW, WoW Classic, Oxygen Not Included, BF4 and all xpacs BF5, MK9-11, etc and I still have a little room left over. Would like a 2TB though but I dont want to pay $400 for it.",

      "text": "I just installed this drive as an upgrade in a Dell 9550 machine that had a Samsung PM951 512 GB NVMe PCI-e drive. The specs on this are vastly superior and even under slight loads, the specs are amazing (see attached graphic). You can use this drive with NO issues on a Dell 9550 or Dell 9560 in AHCI mode. It is vast and the Samsung controller works wonders. It will boot and be recognized in secure boot mode with UEFI active. No issues there whatsoever. Make sure that your Windows 10 boot disk was designed for UEFI and secure boot mode so this will not be an issue.",
