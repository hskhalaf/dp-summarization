For my needs, the smallest only makes the images clearer but not by much and not much larger either (in my situation). The price paid is reasonable for these and yes, I would and will buy them again because of the smallest one. It is a shame that you can't buy just one of these if you know the magnification you need at the time of purchase. Would I recommend this, yes!",

They are light in weight and use 2 AAA batteries. The led lights up nicely so you can read small print easily. My eyes are not as good as they used to be and have didficulty teading the fine print on labels. Thank you for a fine product at an affordable price. The set of three was only $16.95 . I feel it is an excellent value for the price.",

She was absolutely thrilled because it helps her so much. Even if a person doesn't have poor eyesight, because of the lights on it you can see tiny details that you otherwise might miss.

There are a couple of things to be advised of however. The off-On power switch can be slid off and on very easily, so if you store this magnifier in a drawer with other items, choose a spot where nothing could touch it, thereby turning on the light. If this happens, then the (2) triple A batteries will be depleted the next time you start to use magnifier. This happened to me is why I bring this to your attention. I hope this review helps.",

Time and again I pick up a Vivatar, it fails to enable viewing whatever I'm trying to see, I go fetch the UltraOptix and voila! I can see that tiny print! I don't know why but the UltraOptix works better. That fact plus the Vivatar's annoying battery cover that will not stay on are my reasons for bypassing these cheap magnifiers.",

Figured a second one at home would be handy. Having those small LED lights in my old (and these) magnifiers are extremely useful. Haven't had these long enuf to see how they hold up. Should be no problem. As one other reviewer stated - only (minor) defect is the switch - too easy to accidentally leave the lights on. I don't see need for 2 light level settings. .",

While not a Nikon medical grade lens, they are not priced in the same galaxy either. For the money and price point I have not encountered a better deal. The dual light options are a very nice touch, it allows users to select two different light levels/brightness's",

My kids have dropped them onto wood floors repeatedly without breaking them. I bought these to really inspect a metal edge when sharpening my knives. But I realized quickly, I need something with more magnification. I use it but I keep telling myself I need something stronger. Once I get a stronger one, I'm sure these will be fun for the kids.",
