      "text": "I am a peanut butter addict, and powdered pb is the best way to get my fix without all the extra calories. It's great mixed into yogurt, smoothies, peanut stir frys, or even just mixed with milk and used as a dip. This is one of the better powdered peanut butters I've come across because it doesn't have any additives (ie sugar, salt etc). It's just pure peanuts. If you feel like adding sweetener,salt, or cinnamon you can do it yourself so it's more versatile. Hoosier farms is the cheapest per oz I've been able to find, so this is my 5th order of the stuff. Soooo good.",

Blend it all into a chocolate icing/mousse, pudding - add nonfat cool whip for super luxury. The peanut powder stretches it without guilt.",

It is only a quarter of the amount of calories as regular peanut butter. The only thing I didn't understand were the instructions on the jar on making the one serving. It states to use equal parts water to powder. I found that to be way off, but I have been making 6 cups at a time, adjusting the measurements until I get to where I want it. I add the sea salt, and I have delicious peanut butter......DELICIOUS!!!!!!! Will continue to purchase this item..",

But, depending on the recipe, I've found that a blend of 50/50 real peanut butter/peanut flour works really well to maintain that creamy texture but reduce the fat & amp up the protein. This is a great value compared to other brands - my only qualm is that the container is super bulky and takes up a lot of space in my cabinet. It'd be great if it came in a resealable bag.",
