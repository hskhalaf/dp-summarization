Asics quality is getting worse and worse and it's really sad. Definitely not worth the money in my opinion. I'm not sure I'll ever buy Asics shoes again after this.",

      "text": "Bought this shoe a couple of months ago for my husband. He walked it in inside the house, then used it for our 1 hour walks 5 days per week. We walk very fast, but do not even run. First, all was great and shoe felt good. Since the last week the back of the shoe seems to deteriorate and has given him blisters. He has not changed the socks he wears nor have he had any change in the way we walk. Very disappointed for a shoe of this price. We have bought Asics before and were happy with their shoes. I wished there was a way to contact the seller directly, but I don't see it.",

If you wear long socks it might not bother you, but I usually wear no shows and it's bound to irritate me. Asics are my go-to running shoes and I was really hoping to love these especially considering how much I love this style, but I'm not going to drop $160 on less-than perfect shoes.",

It's too bad that ASICS ditched the nice knit upper for some sort of a synthetic plasticky few, but at the same time it's a great opportunity for the consumer to get the older, and in this case better, releases with their now lower prices.",

Great traction and the souls contour to whatever surface you're walking or running on. These souls give you a more natural feel. These sneakers are designed for comfort and durability! The price could always be better though",
