There is no way to fix it yourself because the parts are permanently attached. Will be returning for another.",

They have been dropped a bunch of times and barely show any scuffs. My only complaint is that they are a little bulky/wide (but that seems to be par for the course with helmets).",

The adjustment in the back only makes it tighter front-to-back. I'm ordering a size up, but hopefully it's not so big then that it doesn't stay on.

I had planned on overlooking it but once we took it outside on the sun it showed up almost pink. I have no problem with him wearing a pink helmet but he was upset it didn\u2019t match his bike and the color on the site was misleading. We are exchanging it for the black one.",

Though it actually is a bit large for my daughter's head, even though she measured right in the middle of the circumference range; - the adjustable wheel in the back helps, but the straps can only be shortened so far and it fits her looser than ideal. I'm glad it will grow with her a bit, but do wish I could adjust the straps on both sides, rather than just one. Overall, an excellent value, no need to spend more.",

At Joovy, we believe teaching children early about safety and creating good safety habits is an essential part of parenting. That's exactly why we developed the Noodle helmet. The Noodle helmet is for children with a head size between 18.5-20.5\" (47-52 cm)(Small Helmet) and 20.5-22 (52-56 cm)(Medium Helmet) . We recommend using it when children ride bikes, trikes, ride-on cars, scooters, bike trailers and other activities like these. The Joovy Noodle features 14 air vents, with integrated bug mesh in the front vents, extended visor for maximum protection, nylon straps, pinch guard chin strap, and an adjustable fit dial.
