      "text": "Yes, strange headline, BUT (or BUTT lol), my senior German Shepherd has had loose stool for a while and had gotten worse as the years went on. I went to the vet and they suggested both a grain free diet and a pro-biotic. We changed her food to Taste of the Wild and also added in Probiotic Miracle. And it worked! Her stools through out the day are solid and easy to clean up. Plus she isn't pooping as much either. I chose this particular probiotic because of the reviews and the price. Plus, you only need a small spoonful to add to the food.",

I do intend to buy this product again along with some vitamin supplements and I think this should do the trick. The great thing is about this product is you add it to the food they are already eating and that's it.",
