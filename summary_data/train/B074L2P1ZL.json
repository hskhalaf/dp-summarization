I have 3 small kids and the lock work without issues with theirs thumbs. It take some trial and error understanding the process of adding users but once you get it is pretty simple.",

I thought about buying a keypad door lock, but I was concerned the kids would share the number with their friends. Installation and fingerprint enrollment was a lot easier than I thought it would be. These fingerprint door locks are the future. I'm probably going to buy another fingerprint door lock for my office. I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it..",
