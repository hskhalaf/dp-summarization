I listen to books on tapes and no matter where my phone was the bluetooth worked well too. But if the the speaker doesn't work at all, well it gets one star.",

Harman sent me a warranty replacement (REFURB - which was a bit disappointing) The REFURB unit lasted about the same amount of time and...you guessed it, charge port failed on that one too. Harman declined to replace it again. Totally bummed that a product with JBL name reputation and normally puts out great product would not rectify this defective point of failure. Many reviews here state this same issue.",

A JBL speaker should last more than 6 months. I bought the first one in June 2015 and now on 12/15/2015, the second one doesn't work. Needless to say, don't buy from this seller. Buy from a reputable source like Best Buy or Fred Meyer or sourced from Amazon.com. Buyer beward..",

I really like the sound of this. An added bonus is that you can orient it \"landscape\" or \"portrait\" based on your available space. Bluetooth setup was a breeze, and it works fine with a cable as well. I have to admit that I have not tried competing products, but at this point I have no need. Very satisfied.",

JBL was kind enough to send me a new one, but I'm having the same problem again with this one, sadly realizing this was not a one time fluke. Once again the USB has come loose and I can no longer get it to fully charge. Waste of money.",

The only strange thing I found is that when used with an Apple device, the volume control on the Flip also controls the volume on the device , but when used with an Android device, the volume controls work independently.

The speaker has no problem filling a large room with sound. I figured that the room acoustics made it sound great, and wondered how it would perform outdoors. Once again, I was pleasantly surprised with the volume this speaker puts out. I've heard that JBL has great products, but had never owned anything of theirs before. After owning the Flip 2, I would not hesitate to consider their products again.",
