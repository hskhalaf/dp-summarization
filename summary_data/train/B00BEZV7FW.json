In fact I have not had to replace the bag yet Tonite, the hose became unglued from the end that fits inside the vacuum and also attaches to the accessory. In other words, without the hose connected the machine or the accessory-it is useless. The glue just gave way-nothing broke or tore. I would like to have to hose replaced. If this is not possible, I'll need to return this vacuum and the additional bags I bought. By the way, I've been pleased with the suction.",
