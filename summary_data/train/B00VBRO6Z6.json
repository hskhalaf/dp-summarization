The rices were all burnt and the inner pot became very difficult to clean. The cooker's switch was faulty and unable to go back to the WARM mode automatically. I've been using various rice cookers for over 20 years, I've not experienced one with such poor quality like this. To say fairly, this rice cooker is easy to use, and the size is perfect for small families with max. 2-3 people.",

This also knackered my dinner - burning my house down is okay, stop me from having dinner is a major sin ;) Would I buy again - hell no, something is badly wrong here from the QA side.",
