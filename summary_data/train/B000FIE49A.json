Topeak is a reputable company, and the tool was created for people like me, who use their bike to commute to work, or, like me, have had heavier \"real\" tools stolen that were kept on the bike while locked up at the train station. The main functions I was looking for were ability to tighten crank arms and light weight (to be carried with me on the train daily). After I replaced my crank arms, the left one loosens occasionally (which is common). This tool fits the bill perfectly for the need to tighten that arm on occasion.",

However, this one is extremely light and stronger than the others. It may not have a million parts but this has all the basic tools you need as a cyclist. It hardly takes up any space and barely adds any weight to my bike ride. My only complaint is that the 8mm allen adapter is slightly loose, so make sure you don't lose that.",

Each tool feels sturdy and secure while applying torque and the whole thing is just really well made. I highly recommend this for cheap insurance when your miles from anywhere and just need to tighten up your handlebars or seat post.",

I haven't had to use it yet as I've just received it but looking at the construction, I think it will handle job well in emergency out on the road. It's got some heft to it but considering 9 mini tools, that's reasonable. Comes with a nylon case which is good so it won't snag inside your saddle bag. Overall I am very satisfied but if I had to do it again may opt for the kit with chain tool included. I do recommend this tool.",

Despite the size it has enough leverage to undo or tighten any bolts on my bikes. But don't expect it to be a shop tool. This is for well working bikes with properly lubed bolts. Don't expect it to undo a rusty 10 years old bolt with this. Also, due to the size it may not reach bolts that are located deep, out of reach. For my needs it's perfect though.",

It's in my left pocket of backpack, so I just grab it when I need to screw/unscrew smth and put it back. It's designed to be used like that, in road situations. Obviously you need to use the each tool under 90 degrees, so that you can easily turn it. This is such a tool, that I think even any girl could easily use it (and be my potential wife lol)",
