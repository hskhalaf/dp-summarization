So I did more muffin tops with less batter in each and they turned out more of a cookie shape so my son wasn't really thrilled with it. It's a great pan if you really want to make muffin tops, but you probably need to completely fill it which takes a lot of batter.",

I follow the manufacturer's cleaning instructions. Full disclosure: I spray Pam before baking and bake the regular pancakes at 425 degrees (F) and bake the potato pancakes 450 degrees. The pan works, but do know that in a few months it most likely will not be as non-stick (but still usable).",
