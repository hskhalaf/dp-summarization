The VPRO500 is somewhat larger than my previous model and the all-plastic exterior doesn't immediately communicate high quality, but the proof lies in its quick acquisition of target, immediate indication of precise range, and otherwise high functional performance. I'm quite happy with this purchase!",

I had a problem locking onto the flag stick, but the owner and customer support were very helpful. They pointed out to me the correct use of the Mode button. VERY important. Make sure you click the Mode button so that you see the Flag icon in the bottom left of the view finder. After that, it locks on flawlessly. I am very satisfied with my purchase and have compared it to the more expensive Bushnell, and I would recommend the VPRO to anyone who wants a terrific product at a great price.",

I've also compared it to my friends Garvin watches and bushnell range finders and it's dead on accurate. Haven't found anything to complain about yet. I've used it for about 6 rounds now. What also seems like really good customer service that cares about your opinion of their product.",

Took a minute to figure out how to get an accurate reading but if you turn on the pinfinder(press mode and you'll see a little flag appear in bottom left) and hold down the button you can zero in on the pin, otherwise you might be getting the ground in front of the green or the trees behind. Got it for my husband as a gift. He's played for years without one but it's kinda nice to compare his guess at the distance with the actual distance and has helped choose which iron to use many times.",

I don't want all the extraneous information like slope, club recommendation, etc. I just want to shoot the flag or other objects like bunkers and know the yardage. Display is sharp and clear. I could not be more satisfied and would recommend this TecTecTec to anyone. Why pay hundreds of dollars when this one works great at a fraction of the cost of other \"name\" devices. I'm a 4 handicap and this product is all I need. Very impressive.",

That day it had a bit of trouble picking up the pin, but it was more to do with being steady vs. The machine's abilities. I haven't had any issues with it, it has been 1yd Max different than either a bushnell or leupold that the other teams had, or playing partners. I also, have had very quick responses from the customer service/management teams at Tectectec. Hope it helps someone, also for 1/2 the price of a bushnell, you couldn't go wrong.",

I wore the case on my belt so I had the VPRO500 with me all the time. Light weight and case closed/opened easily with a half zipped effort. This does exactly what the range finders do the cost 2 time more. Da !!!!",
