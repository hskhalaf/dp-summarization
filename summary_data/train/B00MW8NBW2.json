The only thing I have to be careful about is that once i start cutting, sometimes the cutting board slides, so a thin rubber padding at the edges would be great to keep in place. Other that that, no problem so far and i would definitely recommend.",

As with everything else, and most especially any wood product, proper maintenance is a crucial part of ownership. To extend the board's longevity and help prevent splitting, it is absolutely essential that you regularly apply a generous coating of food grade mineral oil.

I use my 1971 cutting board 4 times a day at a minimum. I do a lot of cooking as a caregiver 24/7. This use of that heavy board added to the pain in my shoulders. Not good. So I purchased this cutting board. Yes, it is easy to clean. Yes, the knives do not leave a mark on the bamboo, so far. Yes, it is sturdily made. But best of all, the board is light.",

Cons: There were some splintery fibers at first, but after scrubbing it under hot water with an abrasive sponge and then oiling it with mineral oil, it's smoothed out. I suspect this is going to be a common thing with most bamboo boards since bamboo is inherently composed of long, straight fibers. Make sure to season it with mineral oil (or other oil that doesn't go rancid) according to the manufacturer's directions.",

My family uses this board primarily for fruit and veggies and a slightly thicker board for meats (for segregation) although I am sure this board would stand up to meat carving as well.
