That being said, even with other people in the locker room, if someone made a shim at home and brought it to the gym, it would only take them seconds to shim the lock. Therefore, I am giving these a rating of 2, in order to caution others before buying but also recognize that they have some deterrent use.",

Didn't expect the shim resistant feature. Not sure if it's real but if someone really wanted my underwear in the gym locker, I think they'd just cut the lock.",

They don't feel especially sturdy, and they can be a little resistant to lock again once unlocked. The internals get stuck or something. They unlock very easily though. I probably wouldn't recommend them if you need to lock something out in the open, you could probably break the actual lock fairly easily compared to the bolt, they feel kind of cheap in a way. But for lockers and gym bags this is a perfect lock.",
