      "text": "I've been getting food made by Diamond for years. I have two mature beagles (~10 years old) and while they aren't picky about food, you can tell when they like it and when they don't. Our boys will hammer this kibble, so you know they enjoy it, and their digestion, energy levels, coat, and teeth seem to be doing well. I know it can be intimidating choosing a dog food, as it seems that the affordable stuff is of questionable quality while the cost of the \"best\" foods can make your eyes pop out of your head. But I (and our vet) have been nothing but happy with Diamond's dog food options.",

The second bag came with giant clumps of black mold in it, and more fungus gnats. She eats anything like banana peels and peanut shells but she would barely eat this garbage, and also went and ate mud out of my pond instead after I switched her to this food. If all natural means it shows up rotten because it doesn't keep, that isn't good for anything, unless you have a dog that can eat a 35 pound bag of dog food the second it arrives.",

A lower quality food with lots of filler is not absorbed well and stools are large. With the Diamond Naturals I am feeding less, higher quality (and better quantity) stools. The dog cleans the bowl and her weight is steady. BUT the most impressive thing is her COAT. Unbelievably shiny - noticeably so after switching to Diamond Naturals (I use a Senior formula for my 7 year old Border Collie). I am very impressed.",

Anyway, I highly recommend this brand and line for those with older dogs.",

Her teeth are not good at all, so while this food isn't very soft, she has no trouble eating it. It doesn't seem to give her coat the gloss she gets with salmon foods, but she definitely likes it better, so it's a 5 star in my book:).",
