It's great in to keep available in the nursery, but also easily rolls up for compact storage, or to take along with you for longer trips. The zippered case lets you take on-the-go items with you on everyday trips, making it easy to find these smaller essentials when you need them without having to search through every corner of the bag. It also helps keep the comb and other items clean and free from those cracker crumbs that seem to make their way into every parent's life during this stage.",
