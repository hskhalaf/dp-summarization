I love that it's got a crumb catcher because that's easily the worst part of slicing bread. It's easy to put together and it's really adjustable... like I used it to slice dinner rolls because I wanted to try it out. You can change it to suit the width of your loaf in a snap! It's definitely a nice kitchen tool and the packaging is really nice... it'd make a great housewarming gift.",

I worked diligently to center my thin bread cutting knife between the slates and could not. The sides of the slates had splinters from the knife cut. Maybe some type of very hard metal but then I wouldn't want metal shaving either. I'm back to uneven slices made by hand.",
