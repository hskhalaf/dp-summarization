I use the machine 2 x\u2019s per week and the drive shaft has warped and is not powering any of the attachments.

But after unboxing and assembly I had a chance to put it through its paces, and man was I surprised. To start out with the engine is quiet, much more quiet than I was expecting. And it produces plenty of power which allows you to operate it at a lower rpm . But it is heavy, this not a machine for the weak of arm. Wearing the harness helps a lot with this. The build quality is on par with other high end Chinese merch. All in all I am very happy with my purchase.",
