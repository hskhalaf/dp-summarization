The built in memory of 32 GB was the minimum I was looking for as Apps and NETFLIX will only download to the main storage. This can be expanded via the built in micro SD card slot (up to 128GB) provides good amount of storage space for files, movies, etc. I wanted a thin, lightweight tablet for when I travel. The 8 inch screen is perfect, just the right size and it fits into most pockets on my carryon luggage. Great battery life. Buy a lightweight case (Moko is good) and protect your investment. Well worth the money I paid.",

No negative comments regarding the speed of operation though! The OctaCore does its job.
