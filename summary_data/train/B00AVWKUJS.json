I tried cleaning the print heads with warm water and unplugging the machine for 5 five minutes as instructed by tech support. When that didn\u2019t work I was told that I would need to ship, or deliver the printer to a service facility and pay them to troubleshoot it. Also, I was informed that the B200 error is a generic hardware error that locks up the whole machine so scanning, faxing, making PDFs... etc, all are not accessible until the error is fixed. Apparently this is a common error for all Canon printers.",

Text is blurry, and all black is printed \"double-struck\", exactly as shown in this forum discussion:  . I worked with Canon technical support, and they say that the printer has to be serviced or replaced. Yeah, that's exactly what I need as I try to print my family Christmas letter. What is it about inkjet printers such that they die about every two years?",

Color prints bear no semblance to the original file whether photo or text, the color is completely off. The B&W text is good, but if I try to copy something, the printer will insert a vertical line down the whole page. Scanning is marginal and fails frequently. I am very disappointed with this version. Don't waste your money.",

When it worked, it worked fine for my needs, but I'm not going to buy another. This is my second Canon to die in some mysterious way.",

Used the copier to copy one sheet yesterday after which an attempt to print a page failed with 1403. I pulled the print head, cleaned it, several times to no avail. Tried to find a viable replacement at a nominal cost: Found one for $150 and it ships from China. May arrive in 2 weeks and if I have problems with it, then what? Try to find support for it on the Canon Website?!?! Forget about it!!!!!. No thank you. No more Canons!",

The MX870 has a rear feed tray with a simpler paper path for envelopes, photo paper, and other such occasional, odd-sized, or stiff media; the MX922 does not, and that's my one complaint. (Well, and that it doesn't use the same ink cartridges as the MX870, but that concern is limited to multi-printer environments like mine.) The MX922 has a second front-load paper cassette, but that seems less valuable than the rear tray unless you routinely use the *same* second media. It can directly print optical disks, but it's been years since I've burned an optical disk.",

This is what makes this so disappointing. it takes ages to setup and every time I use it I have to add the wireless network over and over again. I just did it yesterday, printed a page and I am doing it again. Its ridiculous that it does not performed as promised. I am looking for a network, and I know is connected and can't find it. Then I have to do advanced setup and put the password all over again. For scanning is no differtent.",

You have to contsantly clean the print head and that realy wasts ink. Plus its not user frendly. You try to print over wifi and it says and error acurded. So you have to shut your PC of and the printer to be able to print. Most times it remembers the error and you have to keep doing the same thing over and over again $200.00 piece of scrap. I will never purchase another Cannon Printer.",
