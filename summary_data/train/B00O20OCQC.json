Because of this, we need to send it back... but because it's crammed in the box so tightly, we nearly destroyed the box pulling it out, and spent 20 minutes just trying to cram it in back the box and taping it back together. Don't know who's responsible for adding product descriptions, but they REALLY need to pay more attention to what they're doing.",

Due to the light weight construction, the stability is slightly compromised. The wheel brakes are great. Handles are just fine. Comes with cup holder and rack to store baby stuff.

It is light, very sturdy, easy to fold and travel with, great storage under, and has several seating positions that my 4 month old loves. I am giving it 4 stars because there is no cushion for baby and the canopy could be lower to block more sun. To assist with these issues, we add a cushion to the seat and purchased a canopy extender. Both were inexpensive.",

The jogger was simply too big. This stroller was priced well for what we needed and it retains the benefit of dropping the back into the laying position. Most umbrella strollers do not. It\u2019s very easy to compress and expand, although I was a bit concerned upon arrival that it required some assembly. It was easy to put together, though. I wonder how long my relatively short 18mo old will be able to use it; the seat depth seems fairly shallow. Hence, 4 stars.",

And it\u2019s great that there is a mesh pocket to hold things. Only downside about the pocket is that when the seat is reclined, you can\u2019t access the pocket.

It does not hinge at the stroller frame allowing it to be adjusted at low angles. It was very frustrating.",

      "text": "great stroller for tall people. easy to tote around on travel. a few drawbacks, no single handed recline. straps are a little tricky to adjust with a squirming toddler, center of gravity is a bit to the rear, so you shouldn't latch your diaper bag to the top part of the handles; stick it in the basket - although the basket opening is a bit limited. i just end up carrying the diaper bag. that being said, this was a godsend for me while traveling alone with my LO. easy to operate and beyond adequate to get the job done. definitely a top choice umbrella stroller for tall people. i'm 6'1\" and the other ones left me hunching over.",

This would be a great umbrella stroller if it weren't for a few design flaws which led us to return it. 1. The hood is too far up and not big enough. It's actually pointless and doesn't protect baby from sun. 2. The seat is too small and shallow and it looks and feels like the child is sliding out forward out of it. 3. Pain in the butt to fold up. If your child is older this may be a good option. Not good for smaller babies. My daughter is 10 months.",
