Many of the guests were commenting on how nice the basket was. No need to wrap it - just add the card to the top. I highly recommend this!!!",

Includes the plates, utensils, cloth napkins, and the plastic wine glasses. Used it for the first time over this past weekend for my wife and I; and with a bottle of wine in the basket, space starts to get tight... so definitely a picnic basket for two only. I packed a bottle of wine, cheese/fruit/nuts flight (small tray 7x7\"), and four small (4x3x3\" ) small plastic containers and the basket was basically as full as it could get. Considering it is only $44, I am pleased with the quality, size, and value.",
