This athletic-shoe inspired footwear keeps the foot supported by the traditional H-strap feature found on the sides. The classic sneaker with adequate features comes at a budget friendly price. Although it has components that bring comfort, its width might cause problems for people with wide feet. It also doesn\u2019t have enough support for individuals with a flat foot.",
