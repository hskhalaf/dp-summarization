I do not use this product as a meal supplement but rather use it to add additional calories to my already high-caloric diet. I have a high metabolism and this has abled me to get past my plateau's without needing to change anything in my workouts. Mixing Tip: Let your just-made shake sit for 5 additional minutes before consuming and shake/mix again just before drinking it. I've had a lot of success with making it very liquidy by letting it sit for a couple of minutes.",

I get stronger gradually and build endurance, i just cant gain weight. Its just genetics. Mass gainers do help, ive gained about 15lbs with various mass gainers, and this one is fine.

As others have stated you do kinda have to let it sit and soak or else you will be drinking powder clumps. Overall I think I will have to stay away from this brand.",
