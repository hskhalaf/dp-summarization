He checked out each piece, examined the board (like a little kid explaining each place!) The coins were a nice touch. A bit confusing after awhile cos you were either very rich or very poor haha. They were pretty durable. Hard cardboard. One thing I would change is maybe adding more chance cards. We ran through all of them rather quickly. I loved the fact that they infused the GoT theme but kept the Monopoly theme. And he got a kick out of the Throne and the music box.",

Something different from the regular rules are the chance cards - different types of cards that are not your typical cards. Overall fun game and crowd pleaser!",

It reminds me of surprising plot twists in the show. I don\u2019t love the monetary system-gold dragon=5, silver stag=1- or the breakdown of pricing. Basically, this uber-simplified bank where $1 is so valuable renders the lower-cost properties obsolete pretty early on. Think playing regular Monopoly with only $100 and $500 bills along with a price scheme to match. Either the higher-cost properties remain out of reach for the majority of the game, or the lower-cost ones become a joke nearly immediately.",

It has additional elements which can really shift the game on a dime. The playing pieces are awesome the music element is awesome the throne is awesome. It plays more like a European game than an American one. I'm so pleased with the value of this game it's totally worth the price. If you like the series you will really enjoy playing this game. It's theme elements are right on target. The chance cards really makes it up. A lot of fun for everyone.",

By the time properties are bought your broke in two trips around the board. The game ends just as it gets started. We adjusted the amount of coins, doubled the \"pass go\" amount. Tough to get out of jail if you don't increase the coins at the start. The rules are a lil different but easy to understand. The chance cards are kinda lame and repetitive. Though not totally impressed, with a few minor adjustments it's ok. We thought instead of \"jail\" they should have made it a dungeon.",

Best part of this game are the random twists in the chance deck. We had 2 major upsets and both times were shocked but also had so much fun. Highly recommend. My only grievance is the house siglis are made super cheap and it\u2019s really hard to tell them apart when 6 people play. I\u2019ll be painting them w nail polish for future games.",
