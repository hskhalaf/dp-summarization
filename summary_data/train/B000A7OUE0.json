For $30 you should be receiving a fairly high end ball (Evolution balls can sometime be found for $45). I've had $20 balls from Walmart that have had better grip indoors and outdoors. The very first thing I noticed about this ball is how it picks up dust super easily -- I found the ball feeling almost like it was slipping out of my hands on every shot because of the amount of debris/dust that sticks. I'd say either buy a Wave (same/cheaper) or pay a few bucks more and just go for the Evo.",
