The Lemongrass scent is wonderful and it lasts a long time making your kitchen smell clean and fresh. We live in an RV so our whole house smelled very nice all day. It did take a couple of applications to get rid of the \"critters\" but so much better than having to have the chemical smell from other products.",

I thought \u201calright, good so far\u201d. Then I sprayed all the corners and the floor to kill or repell any remaining ants. The bottle says it kills, repels and prevents pests... it barely does the first thing. I have to spray 1 ant about 5 times for it to stop and die. It repels nothing, and the smell is overpowering and annoying. I thought I would like lemongrass but it\u2019s just too much. 1 out of 5 stars. I still have ants.",

The scent is rather strong for my nose when the product is used too many times and the smell will NOT fade away on whatever surfaces the spray has been used on so get ready to clean, wipe, Clorox, and/or febreeze your home when buying this product.

Anyone who lives in a small apt may have the same problem I am having with the scent completely taking over and may be hard to sleep, and eat for awhile because of the smell on my hands. Works pretty good , but I feel I am not putting enough on because of the smell. Better than poisons though, so Thank You for this product !",
