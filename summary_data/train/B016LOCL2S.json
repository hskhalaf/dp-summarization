      "text": "Well after reading previous posts about it being half full I got mine and it seemed half full so I was mad. I ordered some shampoo and conditioner from the actual website and it came with a free dry shampoo (same size as amazons) and it felt the exact same as the one from Amazon. Soooo I don\u2019t know if they were BOTH half full or if that\u2019s just how they come. Either way, I do like the rice starch base, it doesn\u2019t burn my scalp like the others. I will be buying again",

Me, not) I have chemically treated blond hair, so it works excellent for me so I don't have to shampoo as often. Gives it a bit if a root lift, too!",
