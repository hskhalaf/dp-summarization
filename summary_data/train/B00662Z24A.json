Grab some polishes to go along with this, because it does come with one color it's so easy you'll definitely wan a few! I was really suprised that my manicure was lasting three weeks at a time with NO peeling or color issues. I absolutely love it and will continue to use it and save money!",

If applied correctly (the key is to apply very sparingly!), it lasts for around 2 weeks and looks exactly like a professional manicure. It takes some time and patience to do, so don't order this if you aren't blessed with time or patience for this kind of thing.",

The results were NOT as stellar as Red Carpet's polish. [BTW, Walgreen's offers a money-back guarantee if you use a cosmetic product and then don't like it, but I had misplaced the receipts.

      "text": "Ok as a starter kit but you're better off buying components seperate. The pre/post clean is just alcohol. The remover is acetone which you can buy a bigger bottle at a beauty store. This leaves the polishes (only red color in lit) and UV light. The polishes are in a very small bottle and the UV light is too small to fit your entire hand. So if you are looking for convenience and one stop starter this is a good kit. If you are looking for long term supplies get the components seperate.",

I'm rough on my nails, but it lasted easily a week without chipping, two weeks with minor chips + beginning to outgrow. A note to users: you can easily patch a nail and it looks 80-100% like the original job, so touchup is easy! Just watch for getting it on your skin. You do want to take it off prior to putting it under the magical blue light. Definitely a good product.",
