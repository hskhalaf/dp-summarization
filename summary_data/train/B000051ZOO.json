It is very accurate, fast, safe, and FUN! It doesn't handle the 1/8\" thickness so well in my experience, but everything else does very well. I have had pieces of wood with knots snap while going through this planer and still NOT have any snipe! I don't even know how that's possible but have seen it on a couple occasions. This tool is worth every dollar and I would definitely buy it again!",

In an nutshell, it is definitely quite and about as simple to use as one could imagine. I didn't need to read the manual and had it working perfectly within minutes. HIGHLY recommended.",

The results at first are great as the blades are new and very sharp. As they get worn the wood isn't quite as smooth, but that's to be expected. Or, replace the blades, which I haven't done yet. My orbital sander does the rest and I'm happy with what I get out of it. For the occasional DIY'er or low volume woodworker this will be a nice tool to have around. I've done some reclaiming of wood which has been a nice benefit also.",

So far the reviews I read are true, great planer with results as good as the industrial planers I have used in the past. Now my issue - Before plugging the planer in for the first time, I opened up the blade access door and found wood shavings inside. I'm worried that I was sent a used item.",

The boards were jerking along, actually stopping and starting. My first thought was the rollers slipping but looking with a flashlight, the rollers were actually stopping. To make a long story short, the grease on the drive chain under the left cover had stiffened up from the cold (and age?) that it was pushing itself over the roller sprocket. Very simple fix, pull the drive chain off, into a can of degreaser, once clean and dry, install and oil. Back to cutting perfect.",
