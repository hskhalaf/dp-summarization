They have worked wonderfully, and my husband was very pleased. We have had them for about 8 months now, and he has put them to the test on multiple jobs. My husband wanted me to put that they are great for getting in smaller spaces. Would definitely recommend!",

SEE: IMAGE The wrenches snap in and out of the storage rack with a twist. They have a lifetime warranty and are made in Taiwan. Sockets are nice but the little devils can find places to hide that wrenches can't.
