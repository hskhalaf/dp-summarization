I\u2019m very, very happy of having spent this money, best purchase of 2019 no doubt!",

      "text": "I searched really good headphones for 1.5 months and I bought that at the end, because there was a really good discount. Indeed, the product is really satisfying the users because the noise cancellation feature is one of the best in that segment. That's why I highly recommend this product. The sound could be a lil bit better, but it doesn't mean it sounds bad. On the contrary, sound, comfort, and noise cancellation combine is really high standard and easy to use. I highly recommend that headphones to those whom are looking for good sound and comfort.",
