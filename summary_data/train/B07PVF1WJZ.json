      "text": "So far a good computer. The only issue I had was with the battery not charging properly. I called Toshiba customer service and after an hour, the only thing they could say was send the computer to an authorized dealer (nowhere near me) and generally about 10 days later they may have it back to you. I would have to have erased everything to do that and be without a computer for 10 days (if lucky) or more. Unacceptable. I contacted Amazon and they took care of the situation and got me a new battery. It works perfectly and I have had no problems now. Thank you Amazon!",

Extras would have been worth the extra money but I decided what I really needed was the memory and DVDRW drive. I have a huge music collection and windows 10 pro comes with latest media player (free at Microsoft store). The ability to just ask what you want to search for (song recognition if playing a song), is Nice! Well worth the price on Amazon and better than anything I have found in 6 months of research.",

      "text": "It's a good laptop, but I can't believe I paid this much for a laptop and Toshiba doesn't provide a back-lighting on the keyboard. I thought it wouldn't matter much, but it's really annoying in low-light situations. Not just in the dark, which I would expect, but even in dimly lit rooms it's very hard to see the keyboard. My previous Toshiba laptop cost hundreds of dollars less and had a back-lit keyboard, so I'm not sure why Toshiba dropped that simple feature on a higher priced model. I won't buy a laptop without this feature again.",

It\u2019s just that I hate that if my printer is low on color ink, the printer function is inoperable even for black and white only copies. That\u2019s a function brought on by this specific computer, because when I use the print function on my other Toshiba PC, it will print. Also, the way you have to use two fingers on the touchpad to scroll is a royal pain. I find myself going back to my very sturdy earlier model Toshiba. The flimsy plastic this thing is made of is a joke on the consumer who just paid $1300 on a laptop ... namely me! Super disappointing!",

I looked around for the same brand which they call a dynabook now. I saw it was used mostly by students but kept reading the reviews; it had what I wanted including a DVD. I like to watch movies and sometimes play games. Mostly got it for writing stories, and articles for my blog, and research for same. Am also working on a book. It's a lot lighter than the older laptop and thinner. Very pleased, and would recommend others buying this laptop.",
