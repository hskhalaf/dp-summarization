They worked well for the first two months. The next couple months they would work some days and not others. The last month they have not worked AT ALL. I only purchased them just over six months ago. Now I am shopping for new speakers. Do not waste your money on these. Also, when I bought them on June 24th they were $44.99. Now they are above $100. Ridiculous markup for something that will not last. Please save yourself money and frustration and let me live vicariously through you.",

It is much better than the normal speakers that most laptops have. The only problem is you can't use it for smaller laptops as the screens aren't strong enough to handle the weight. I had a 15.6\" Lenovo that had trouble staying up as the speaker kept weighing it down and eventually it damaged a screen hinge of that laptop. The Asus ROG and a couple of HP 17.3\" laptops that I also used had no problem handling the speaker's weight.",

Separate small speakers--like for a desktop--are clumsy and impractical. This speaker delivers everything it promises: good sound, easy to use, good value. You won't get a booming bass or room-filling sound, but you're not paying for that, either. If you something that will bring your movies to life and enhance your music while you do your homework, this is it. One cord, to plug into your USB, and a spring-loaded clip to attach to the top of your laptop and you're ready to go. Definitely recommend!",

Pros: - USB cable for easy plug-and-go use - doesn't block your laptop's webcam - sturdy carrying bag - and of course, great sound! A nice balance of treble AND bass. Turned all the way up, there is no distortion, and I can hear it all over this 17'x 36' room Cons: - laptop screen might block some of the sound",

They are very loud and worlds better, galaxies even, than my Sony Vaio speakers.

What I like about the speakers: the cord is contained inside for storage, good sound, strong clip to attach to laptop, easy to carry because it is shaped like a tube (not bulky). What I don't like: the speakers direct the sound to left and right and not toward the laptop user & the speakers makes the screen slightly top-heavy, so the screen has to be close to 90 degrees or it will fall in the direction it is leaning toward. The best feature is the ease of use - there is only one short cord and the speakers move with the laptop.",

Digital streaming from a local classical station provides completely enjoyable listening, Pandora stations play beautifully, and I'm hearing sound effects in games that I've never heard before. So, before you spend money on a speaker system that requires its own crate to move, give this a try. I can almost guarantee you won't be disappointed!",

      "text": "Excellent speaker, both in terms of size and performance. Much better, louder sound than what is possible on my Mac Pro 13, plus decent bass. This is great for office presentations as well as listening to Pandora in private as the sound booms! I also think the size is perfect for travel vs. two separate portable speakers. My only wish is that there was somehow bluetooth and battery-only capabilities, which is why I gave 4 stars, but for the price, this is hard to beat. Also, having a single stereo speaker is far more easy to travel around and much more durable/resilient in a packed computer bag. The travel pouch is a nice touch, and helps protect the speaker.",

To install all I did was plug into the USB and within a minute it was installed and playing. I am 72 years old and the volume is more then loud enough. The sound is really soft and comfortable to listen to. I would recommend this product to anyone in the market for speakers for their laptop.",
