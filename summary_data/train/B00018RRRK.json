Impossible to completely clean the grinding disk. The Ugly: In my case the Cuisinart tech support the Amazon connected me with. She couldn't or wouldn't resolve the technical issue. So she just disconnected the call. The product is made offshore and the assembly is shoddy. Bottom line I would not by this product if you are a coffee lover, buy one with conical burrs.",

We chose this as an inexpensive replacement for a blade grinder (the problem with blade grinders is that they re-grind the coffee that is already ground and leave a lot of variance in your grounds, making your carafes hit or miss). It's been doing well but I definitely recommend getting a brush to clean with. Hopefully it will last a long time.",

      "text": "We bought one one these 20, or more, years ago and it was great until it died. A pretty good run. The new one is the same model but doesn't operate nearly as well as the old one. The grind and amount settings aren't remotely similar to the old machine, this one is much noisier, and coffee grounds are all over it inside and out. It leaves a small amount of ground coffee all over the counter with every use. I wouldn't buy this one again, sadly, the old one was great, the new one, not so much! I'll be researching other grinders in the near future.",

Didn't work this last time so I bought another one. For a small appliance, the amount of use it gets and the fact that it was 10 years old, I didn't feel cheated. I like to perk coffee sometimes so being able to adjust the grind is a feature you don't find in many coffee grinders.",

I understand the more you spend on a burr grinder the better it is, but I an very pleased with this little inexpensive model.

The only thing about it that annoys me is the transfering of the grounds into another container. The brush that comes with it is a useless tool. The brush just adds to the static. The grounds are so static, they get in your hands and countertop. I would say I'd lose about a 1/4 teaspoon of coffee. I feel like that would happen with any big coffee grinder though. I got mine when it was on sale. Totally worth the money.",

Also it asked for an \u2018easy to clean eating\u2019 which I had to give a 3 because I have no idea one way or the other. I\u2019ve literally never tried to take it apart to clean it (that\u2019s probably gross... pretend you didn\u2019t read that). But really.. we love this grinder. Definitely worth the price.",

      "text": "If you don't like a messy kitchen, don't get this. Not sure if this is a 'feature' of all burr grinders, but the static build up with this grinder makes using it a messy proposition. Once ground, the coffee sticks to the lid and the removable grind box. Once you open the box coffee goes everywhere! It will leave your counters and shelves covered with coffee. I've even resorted to opening it over the sink to cut down of the mess a little. After two months I can't take it anymore and will be replacing this with blade grinder.",

      "text": "This is my second Cuisinart grinder and I basically purchased it for parts. I altered my other one, so it would make a finer grind for my espresso machine and wanted to make sure to have spare parts if anything should happen to my first one. Oh yeah, and I am using the grind chamber, as I chipped the old one (it alone would have cost me almost half of a whole new grinder!). With the alteration it makes a perfect in-expensive alternative to way more expensive grinders needed to make fine espresso grind.",
