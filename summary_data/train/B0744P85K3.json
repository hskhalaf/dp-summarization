The two T20 star drivers that came with this set stripped within the first couple of hours. The jig itself is awesome and is very easily adjusted to the thickness differences of the wood being used. As compared to the Kreg Jigs I already own, this is a simple easy jig to use and should be considered as a first pick when looking to buy a portable pocket hole jig system. I would however switch over to Kreg square drivers and screws.",

A bigger static jig might be nice if you're going to make a big assembly line but for a hobbyist, this is all you need. I do recommend getting a good metal clamp that takes advantage of the magnet, it makes things way less frustrating. Also make sure you have a strong drill and don't overheat the drill bit too much. My ancient black and decker is getting a little weak so drilling can be a little tedious but it gets the job done.",

I already own a kreg k4 jig and got this one for a more portable option and have been extremely satisfied with it so far. I like that it includes just about everything you need besides a clamp. The only downside I've seen with it is the screws that come with it and the driver bits are torqs head, I usually prefer them but most pocket hole screws out right now are all square drive.",

Haven\u2019t used it yet, trying to get a replacement. Update: Upgrade from 3 stars to 4. Contacted Milescraft and sent them pictures of my defected product and they are sending a new one in its place. Customer service was awesome! Knocked a star for obvious reasons, otherwise a 5",

      "text": "This product just does not work and is a waste of money. Wish I had done better research before buying it. The provided drill bit is thicker than the pocket hole and got stuck. Overall low quality product as the manual and product do not match. As shown in the picture the groove should have been on the opposite side, as per the manual. I bought the product and it kept sitting for a month and I did not get to use it then and now the return window as expired and now I am stuck with it.",
