Additionally the gpu fan has been making rattling noise recently... I am not even talking about sudden weird temp rises here and there. Sending it back to Acer support is going to cost me more than 300usd which doesnt make any sense as I am in a different country other than US. I am so disappointed now ..",

Their ability to diagnose and repair is horrible when all they do is re-install windows for you both times. This is over the process of almost 2 months. I'm now going to buy new RAM sticks and do the repair myself. And for that reason, DON'T buy this laptop. UPDATE: Acer replaced mine with an identical factory new laptop. The issue wasn't hardware, it was the new windows update",
