While there are slightly faster ones to be had for quite a bit more money in everyday use for most people you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Still a massive improvement over a rotating mechanical hard drive - this made my ThinkPad T430 go from a total dog (yay 5400RPM laptop hard drives) to nearly as fast as my Core i7 gaming/workstation laptop. So far this SSD has handled everything I've thrown at it just fine - everything from simple stuff like browsing the internet to heavy virtualization workloads! Would recommend.",

      "text": "What's not to like? Your computer will run twice (or more) as fast, cloning software (downloaded from WD website) was quick and easy, installation on my Dell Inspiron One was simple and only took a 1/2 hour to complete, quiet operation and works with less power. Rebooted with no hitch. Just remember to buy a USB 3.0 to 2.5\" SATA III Hard Drive connector with the SSD as you will need this to clone your drive. Super product ... well done WD!",
