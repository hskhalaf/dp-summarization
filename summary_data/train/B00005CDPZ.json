(As with everything, I recommend doubling the vanilla.) We also rolled and filled them to make little cannoli which we took to a party, but they got slightly soft over the time they sat in the fridge. So make sure to fill them at the last minute.

Found the 3 1/2 setting made them a little light for my taste so I cranked it up a bit and got perfectly browned pizzelles. Love that the little green light lets you know when they're done.",

Once I got the timing right, I ended up with delicious cookies.",

I enjoy this one very much, no aerosol to spray oil/butter, no mess and simple to clean. Our friends enjoy the pizzelles dipped in chocolate and on the top of vanilla ice cream.. By the way, the appliance was delivered quickly. Try it, you and your family will love home made cookies on the cheap.",

    "description": "The pizzellepro express bake 835 bake three party sized pizzelles in less than 60 seconds! These thin, delicate, pizzelle cookies are ideal for entertaining.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nUnlike an old-fashioned pizzelle iron, this electric pizzelle baker stays hot--you don't have to wait for it to reheat after you bake a pizzelle. It churns out three 3-inch pizzelle simultaneously in 45-60 seconds, and then is instantly ready to bake three more. The nonstick plates clean easily and release pizzelle readily, and are surrounded by an overflow channel for excess batter. (A precisely calibrated batter spoon is included.) Electronic controls add convenience and flexibility. There are \"heat-up\" and \"ready\" lights--there's even a dial so you can choose exactly how brown you want your pizzelle. When warm and pliable, pizzelle can be formed into baskets, cones, and cannoli for holding sweet fillings. (A wooden cannoli dowel is included.) Or they can form sweet sandwiches. Accordingly, accompanying the 1,000-watt appliance are recipes for variously flavored pizzelle and for cannoli fillings. The baker measures 9 inches wide, 3-1/4 inches high, and 10 inches deep, stores upright, and has a cord-wrap underneath. --Fred Brack",
