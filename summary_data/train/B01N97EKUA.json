You'll need 18 AA's (you're welcome), but the batteries will last a good length of time. You set them for x-number of hours when you turn them on, then leave them on and they will come on at the same time every night until you reset the time. They are dimmable and you can set them to flicker or not. These are way better quality than some similar ones I was gifted. Anyway, really lovely buy and I'll be back for more, especially if any thicker ones are available.",

It's not a huge deal as you can turn them on/off manually from the small switch on the surface of each candle, where the batteries go in.. Also, this being my first experience buying flameless candles like these.. When you go with a darker color (VS White /Cream/Ect), the white 'flame' is very visible/obvious during the daytime/when not in use. That part looks very 'fake-y', if that bothers you. But overall, a good price for the real wax look, the amount of candles you get, and how they look when they're lit. Very nice.",

Not super bright, but had a ton of fun with my 2 year old hiding the remote and pretending mommy was magic turning them on. Like that it comes with 2 remotes. Great for hygge ambience and can be mixed and matched in several ways. Love the cozy feeling they give a room just wish they were a little brighter and that they had all worked. Would have been a great value for the money if they had all worked, but maybe I just got lemons and that\u2019s on me for being too impatient to send them back.",

Two remote controls (in case you want to break up the set and use in two different rooms) that control the timer feature, the brightness of the candles, and whether they are steady or flickering. a great value for the price! I had looked at something similar in a local store, and it would have cost me about three times more to get the same number of candles. A tip: for a less uniform flickering and a more natural look, take a few candles into a different room and get them started. Then the candles will flicker more naturally and not so synchronized.",

Can't speak to battery life since I've only been using them for a week but still running thus far.",

I love that I can change the flame from a steady burn to a realistic flicker. The 2, 4, 6 hour options are good, too. And I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they are dimmable as well. My only complaint is that the color is very orange, and not a yellowish glow that would be slightly more natural looking. But all-in-all, I'm very happy with this purchase.",

I run mine eight hours a day, with the flicker on, and in the three months I've had them...I haven't had to change the batteries once. Don't know if I can endorse another product here, but I use IKEA batteries to save money and, like I said, 720 hours of non-stop faux candle light later, their still going strong. The remote control gives you a ton of options and one remote will work at least two groups (or more) of candles with separate programs. Well worth the money!",
