The best part is that it comes with a paper insert that you can tape to the wall to use as a guide. Just make sure the paper is leveled out and you just drill directly through the paper. This will take away the 10 minutes you'd normally spend measuring, measuring, and remeasuring. Plus it's about $20 cheaper than the ones you might find at Lowes or Home Depot.",

The bars are loose (they roll in circles). Not sure if it's an install error or the way the bars are. The bars are a cheap plastic. The ends that the bars attach to feel more sturdy and better quality. I think they're fine. I will probably get someone to help reinstall them and then I may update my review.",
