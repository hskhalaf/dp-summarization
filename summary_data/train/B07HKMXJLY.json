Overall it was a great purchase, which has allowed me to have more than just Modern Warfare installed lol. Highly recommended if you need an easy boost in storage space for your PS4! Hoping the format of this will carry over to the PS5. But that won\u2019t affect my review, seeing as this is advertised just for the PS4 anyway. Which it works great for!",

Small flashing light (but that's how you know when it's being accessed) not a bother as it can simply be turned around.

I turned off my PlayStation, unplugged the drive, turned it back on and I had video. But of course it wasn\u2019t disconnected properly and required repair before the drive could be used. Hopefully this was a one time incident but essentially, having the drive plugged in rendered my PS4 completely uselessly for a moment",
