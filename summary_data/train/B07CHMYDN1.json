      "text": "I absolutely love this dual holder! I have more headphones than I know what to do with & different types of holder's too but what set's this apart from the other's is the tray at the bottom, in case you have wired phones, it keeps them more organized along with a place to wrap or hang any type of related wires in the upright part of holder! I found that very useful! It's well made & ain't gonna kill your wallet. Assembly is very easy and comes with everything you need to do so! I highly recommend!",

There are two trays at the base of the stand to hold little things like paper clips and such. There is also a place to hang a wire if you have a wired headset. I would recommend this stand.",

Some comments said it tipped over when taking the headset off but I haven\u2019t had a problem so idk if my headsets are just light but it works perfectly. The cord in the back is a nice touch since I have 2 headsets it makes it look nicer and organized when they\u2019re sitting on my desk. Worth the money",
