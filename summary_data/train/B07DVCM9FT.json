I used the mask to do two refinishing jobs in small spaces where fumes were very strong. With the mask on, the fumes were mild at worst and provided a safety. I highly recommend this mask with the VOC filter cartidges. It was a good value and a must for the situation.",

It does has a little rubber/silicone smell when I first open it. But that\u2019s gone. Anyway all for all it\u2019s a pretty nice product for the price.",
