      "text": "Bought it for my husband because he is constantly spilling sticky stuff into every single keyboard we own (which is a lot because he works on computers) . He was never a speed typed and was always a \"key poker\". So this was perfect for him. He was thrilled. Easy as cake to set up and pair, as long as you don't retry to read the awful translated directions. Just plug in, it will pair it Bluetoothly. Can only pair with one device easily. Can be switched to a difffefr not device but the translation is terrible on the instructions. But he loves it!!",
