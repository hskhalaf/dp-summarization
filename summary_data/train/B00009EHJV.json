Plug it into a USB port, click on the microphone button and off you go, pretty self explanatory. A friend thought this was expensive for the product, but I have found that I get clean, crisp sound, no real ambient noise, and it serves it's purpose. I have had this microphone for four years with absolutely no problems, that is exceptional in this day and age. If it collects dust, I just wipe it off. Very little care for this microphone, and a lot of positive aspects. Recommended. prisrob 06-05-15",

Previously I used the microphone from a Microsoft Video Conference Camera. I found that by switching to the logitech microphone, positioned much closer to the mouth than the Video Conference Camera is, that the accuracy of dictation improves significantly. With respect to the logitech microphone: Set up was simple on Windows 7 - plug and play - one minute to set up. The microphone is nicely weighted, and doesn't tip easily; I find the on/off button is very handy; and overall, the unit just feels well made. I'm very satisified. Great price/value.",

If you have kept your Vista current with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and subsequent updates, you should have no problem. For the record, I am using Vista Home Premium with SP1 and all updates through June 5, 2008. And a note for Linux users: My preferred operating system is Ubuntu, version 8.04. I can report that the Logitech USB mic works perfectly with this OS too. I have used Audacity under both Vista and Ubuntu to make excellent recordings with this mic.",

I'm surprised so many people haven't noticed this, but it is a serious design flaw for the analog section to be picking up this noise. Other than that, the audio qualities are excellent for a $20 desktop mic. Almost no hiss, good directionality, and good fidelity.",

Pros: Plug and Play no driver necessary, Cheap, Arcs forward closer to you, Hardware mute button that lights up when it not muted. Cons: Naturally you have to be somewhat close to the mic to use it.
