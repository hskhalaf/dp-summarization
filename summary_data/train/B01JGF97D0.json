However, about the ninth time using it l, it stopped working and I discovered that it had suffered a major failure that burnt up all the insulation within. Additionally, despite hearing good things about Masterbuilt standing behindo their products, the company refused to replace the faulty smoker and instead were just wanting to send me a replacement box that wouldn't show up for over 3 months. Very disappointed in Masterbuilt! Be warned.",

      "text": "With a few minor adjustments this smoker is perfect. First I took the chip tray rack out to let it sit directly on the coils. I flipped a bracket that is over top of the heating element and put it below. Lastly I drilled about 12 very small holes in the chip tray. After making these adjustments this thing started rolling out smoke. Did two whole chickens and they turned out fantastic. For the price point its worth making the few adjustments, highly recommend for any home smoker. Only complaint is that the digital controls are hard to read when in direct sunlight but this is a minor inconvenience.",

The only reason I gave it 3 stars if because nowhere does it let the user know that it doesn't really generate smoke below 180-200 degrees. So if you're doing sticks, or salmon or a slow roast brisket, you need to always spike the temperature, generate smoke and then turn it back down. If you want a first rate smoke experience, get the cold smoke generator with it. It costs $60 more but you'll have a 5-star smoker for a great price price. If you plan on smoking above 200 degrees, this is a great unit all by itself.",

But they will sell you one if you can wait. It leaks grease and water so best to place it somewhere you don't mind getting greasy.

This unit will not burn those chips. You have to make slivers, like the size of match sticks to get it to smoke. Keeping the smoke going requires a lot of effort and attention. If you're going to smoke a turkey be prepared to be on top of it all day long.",
