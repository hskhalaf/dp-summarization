      "title": "Was happy with it",
      "text": "Bought the rear wheel to replace the stock which was bent. Was happy with it. The front wheel didn't look right in comparison so I bought this to match the rear. The wheel is alloy, which makes it lighter than the original stock. Being alloy, it improved the braking which is a definite plus on the old schwinn 10 speed. The wheels I received were straight and didn't need any adjustment. I didn't repack the bearings, which some had recommended. After a short ride to disperse the grease, they spin freely. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.",

They were lightweight, provide a better braking surface than chromed steel, are already trued (at least in my case), and had the skewers for the quick release.",

You need to be comfortable with adjusting the cone nuts if you want a free-spinning wheel. Once you add rim tape and adjust the cone nuts it seems to be a good wheel (for Schraeder tube valves.)",

      "text": "Sta-Tru's front wheel is an excellent replacement for beat-up or damaged wheels. The wheel can take a beating. This is my third wheel purchase by the company as I'm rebuilding yet another steel-framed bike for commuter use. It's a little wider than the wheels it's replacing, but it's more stable and less apt to be damaged on the cracked and buckled pavement that is common in many urban environments. I wouldn't suggest too much curb jumping, but that's up to the individual rider. Overall, great product.",
