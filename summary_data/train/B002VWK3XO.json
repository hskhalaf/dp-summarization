Not only is this great for getting in houses that aren't accessible, you need it for getting up on curbs, and it's unbelievable the businesses that don't have proper handicapped access. I comes in its own carrying bag. Anybody that happens to be around when I use it, is wonderfully surprised. If you transport anyone in a wheelchair, you should not be without it!!!",
