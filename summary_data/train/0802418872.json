Reads like a paper, lacks heart and the advice is all things anyone who exists has heard before (like try giving your kids options, groundbreaking). I follow the author on social media, but this was a hard swing and a miss from her and Moody. It was a draggy read that I kept falling asleep to. You know when you're talking with a friend and accidentally zone out after a long long story? You begin to nod, utter \"mmhmm\" over and over, and kind of glaze over? This is the book equivalent of those conversations. 2 stars because I like the author personally, this book just lacks any heart or actual oomph for homeschooling bravely.",
