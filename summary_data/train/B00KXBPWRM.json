      "text": "After researching the Amazon reviews and internet I found the St Pierre company which advertised their Bocce Balls as Made in the USA. However, when my \"Professional\" Bocce set arrived it clearly states Made in China. That is not disclosed on Amazon and certainly not mentioned on the Company's web site. In fact, it turns out you can't buy the Chinese made balls from St Pierre. Also the Amazon seller ships this set directly from Over Stock (which offers the same set a few dollars cheaper with free shipping) So they are simply marking up the price and placing your order with Over Stock!)",

We recently joined a Bocce league and thought it would be good to buy a set & practice. We immediately went out with friends to play. Another group arrived and asked if we purchased the \"senior\" version because the balls were larger & lighter than the ones used for the professional league. I can't tell you how disappointed everyone was. Why do you state \"Professional\" if these are not league regulation?",

Also, a bag that was strong enough to hold the balls; all problems that were noted on cheaper products. The balls scratched badly on 1st throw and without the cardboard box to hold the balls , the bag is floppy, Never follow Amazon recommends again",

I received the set and all the bocce balls were in great condition - they are a traditional colors, perfect weight, nicely made and run true. I did have a problem -- the jack was missing. I contacted the seller and they immediately responded and over-nighted a jack to our home. I gave this set a 5-star rating for the overall quality of the set and importantly for the excellent customer service. Since the set is new I really could not easily assess its durability however given the 'feel' am confident it will be a 4+.",

The green and red colors have a deeper gloss than other sets I have seen. Instructions are included with the set. Most others did not inlcude game rules. The black carry bag has the logo embroidered on the front and on the handle closures. I am very happy that I chose the St. Pierre Bocce set..and they are made in the USA!!!",
