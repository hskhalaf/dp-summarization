Pro tip: don't carry the watermelon outside without putting it in a bag or something first. I carried it out by hand thinking it was empty. In reality, there was a lot of fluid leftover and it all came spilling out when I chucked it into the trash. Now it looks like I murdered a raccoon while he was asleep in one of the chairs on my front porch. I really should have just thrown it into the shrubs but I didn't want ants. Every day of my life is Hell.",
