FIFA 15 is my first FIFA series in PS3 and PS4 era. FIFA and PES is quite different from each other. I was played PES for a long time, so PES is friendly to me. But, FIFA 15 if fun to me. I like their micro control, and new defense system. Maybe I'll play PES15 later, because PES 15 got a great review. Nevertheless, I'll keep play FIFA series. It is difficult, but fun.",

It's fun to play the computer, but playing against live competition is a blast. It also has a career mode that is highly entertaining and easy to navigate. I certainly reccomend this game!",
