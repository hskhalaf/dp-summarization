They won't win any beauty contests, so just close your eyes and listen; you won't be disappointed. I paired these with an RSL Speedwoofer 10S, and powered them an Onkyo TX-8270. This combination work amazingly well together. I listen primarily to vinyl on an Audio Technica LP120BK and streaming music via a Sonos Connect and could not be more happy with the purchase. I picked these up back in early January for $350 each, and would still easily recommend them at full price.",

The speakers are not perfect, but for $700.00 I have never heard this kind of quality. Kudos to Andrew Jones and Elac. I hate hype, but in this instance it is deserved. (These are 4 ohm speakers. They need clean power!!! Do not buy them if you're not willing to invest in a decent amplifier.)",

Andrew Jones focused on designing the components with three way technology - Google it. The cabinets are basic but functional for the sound. The value for these speakers is unmatched. The sound is incredible. They are 4 Ohm so make sure you have a receiver/amp that can do them justice. As a true Audiophile, I highly recommend the Elac -Andrew Jones- UF 5s or the UB 5s.",
