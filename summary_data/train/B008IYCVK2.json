They lied of course to get sales, as this is only loosely based on the original. It is however a great game in its own right. The strategic side of it has been severely dumbed down for the console generation, but the tactical side of the game is fantastic. I have played it for over 100 hours now since the expansion has come out, and I'd definitely recommend it.",

It has great potential for management of your base, your troops, and you feel you have near complete strategic freedom. The AI is quite competent, and as you progress it feels like it is somewhat adapting. The only problem with this game is that it is seriously glitchy at places. Sometimes camera angles could end up through the floor and beyond, sometimes there is unexplained slowdown when progressing a turn. This is not game-breaking but this is the most recent patch and it is about 3 months after release. Indeed very addictive, and very involving game...",
