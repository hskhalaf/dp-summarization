Even though my phone gets the same wi-fi signal, and works in that location, this device did not report back (send an email) when I tested it as suggested, by getting it wet on the bottom. Will be doing more testing later, moving it closer to the hotspot. If it works, I'll need a repeater. My only other comment is that this device is expensive at $90. There are other less costly devices that I would try first.",

The freeze alarm stopped working on one and when I reported to customer support (under warranty) their answer was that it doesn't monitor temperature and shouldn't be used as a freeze alarm. My other two were working fine at the time as a freeze temperature monitor and freeze alarm. After several attempts with customer service, I finally gave up. Since that time the unit has stopped sending any alerts (I tried using it for a water alarm). I'll just throw it in the trash and find something that works. At this point I still have one unit that works.",
