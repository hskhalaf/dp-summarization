Since it was made there, it uses the old 3g and not the new 4g signal meaning setting it up with a U.S. based carrier will not let you use the high speed band. If you don't use that much data or just use is as a second phone it is ok mid range phone. Specks arn't great but it will get the job done. Do not get this for your daily if data is an issue.",

I also really love the feel of it in your hand - for some reason it feels more \"solid\" than other models with similar price. Cons - Being an international model it only runs on lower bandwidths that I am told are being phased out in the US. Long story short, it doesn't work with T-mobile. I have the same screen timeout issue that others have reported where it times out way too fast arbitrarily. No SD card slot which was a bit disappointing as well.",
