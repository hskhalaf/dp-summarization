I took out the bike again the next day and the dust cover for the AUX and the charging port did the same thing (there when I started the ride gone when I got where I was going). Build quality on this product is not the best. May have just gotten a defective unit but I am not satisfied with it at all.",

We always lost one person and without any pattern or logic. One day it was the last person paired and another day the second and so on. I would say we had good quality 4 way comms about 30% of the time. The rest it was hit and miss. The times we did have the most success was when we were close together and riding slowly. Overall I would give them a 2 to 2.5 star rating and would not recommend them for anyone with more than 2 people.",

Basically just hold down the pair button on the SENA for like 12 seconds and it goes into a 3rd party pairing mode. Routing the speakers was a breeze. I installed the mic right in the front of my helmet and people can't even tell I'm on my bike when on a phone call....unless I send it... :) I'd recommend this unit for sure.",

      "text": "Very impressed with this unit. did a lot of research of both more expensive and cheaper models and rolled the dice on this one. i was most suprised at how i can make calls with little motorcycle noise. It also made it great to talk to my passenger (not at the same time). One thing though is that the speakers only project sound in one \u201cstraight\u201d direction like a laser. at first i had the speakers slightly tilted and thought this sound volume stinks, then i straightened the speakers and had to turn down the volume a lot lol.",

Other option is using your phone and distance is unlimited based on cell signal for 2 riders or a group call. I dont like that you have to have a special charge wire because normal ones dont fit. So dont lose your wire. Battery is good. Music plays a t okay volume but sounds like alot of reverb. No real base in these. Maybe if you got them closer they would sound better",

The only thing I didn't like about this is the hard mic velcros on the side of my helment cause I have a half helmet. The velcro would not hold the mic in place it keeps coming loose and falling down. There needs to be some sort of clip like the one used to hold the main receiver of the unit to the helment.",

I can easily toggle between the intercom channel with her and my phone's navigation! Exactly what we were looking for and great value to boot! We did have a minor complication with the battery. However, I reached out to customer service and I am super impressed with how professionally and diligently they resolved the issue for us. Back on two wheels with FodSports! Great product and great company!",

Battery life did not let us down on 6 hour trips. Signal strength was good albeit got disconnected in the twisty trails in the woods and hills being front and rear of a four person group with no communicators in between. Overall happy with the purchase and my group will be purchasing more to include more in the conversation as well as bridging the distances between us.",
