I'm fine just using one side, and I don't want to through the hassle of a return, so I'm going to keep it. It's disappointing though, and hopefully not a sign of things up come. Everything else about the board seems good. Putting it together was pretty easy, it seems very stable, and it's pretty handsome for a whiteboard. If you get one without a bubble you'll be very happy with it.",

The rolling wheels have on occasion fallen off too. Other than those small annoyances...the size, double sided & magnetic features, and overall appearance are great. I would buy it again.",

As other's have said no instructions so flying a little blind results in things (questions?) like do i put the casters with the locks on the back or the front? But eventually you'll power through. Only real ding is the screws that hold the tray in place don't grab on to anything, they just spin. So the tray is precarious at best. I got one screw to sort of stick so the tray will stay on but wobbles and wont support much weight.",
