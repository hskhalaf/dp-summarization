Recently with the algae problems we didn't want to incur lacerations on our feet and incur life threatening infections. Thus purchased these. They fit exactly as expected and were as pictured and described. They are comfortable even when wearing for long times, and quick drying. The non slip sole works well on wet rocks and boats. Most water shoes are slip on which does not work for me due to foot deformity. The laces stay tied even with the roughest of use. Very pleased with these and will purchase again if needed, however these seem to be well constructed and have not shown wear thus far.",

The holes near the heel are sizable which can collect stones that you can feel. This occurred during normal wear lakeside. Overall, these are a good product.",

These tennis feel wonderful on my feet, they are extremely light, I forget sometimes that i am using tennis and not splippers, I use them all the time. The plastic holder is the major issue of the shoe, because the spring isnt strong enough and sometimes it gets stuck; yes it sucks, but you can tie the cords and it works just fine. Until now money very well spent!",

But I am keeping it because when I use it forbthe water park its a perfect 5 star shoe. DO NOT buy if you plan to be in sand, dirt, pebbles etc. Perfect for places like Sea World or Raging Waters where you're going to get wet, but need a comfortable breathable shoe that expels water.",
