The bowls are much thinner and the glass covers do not fit at all, they slide off the bowls way too easily. That's a real hazard when you are taking them in and out of the oven. Very disappointed. Perhaps the quality issue is that they are being made in China. What happened to \"Made in America\"!",

Buyer beware.. without the \"handles\" it is slippery to remove a dish from the oven.",

It is still a decent enough product but I would not have bought it if I had read the reviews first. This is not something you will collect and pass down to your kids.

I too, had the old Corningware, back to the Cornflower pattern. While these are not quite the same and slightly smaller, that is the lifestyle of kitchens today. I think they are perfect for the new convection air fryer toaster ovens! I, of course, will put the bakeware in during preheat, to avoid problems. I would agree Corningware would be well served to do testing with newer cook methods and add their results to the sales site and perhaps add additional information in the directions. However, these are made 10X better than similar bakeware. Buy Corning!",
