Upon opening the box, we immediately felt the mugs looked different, specifically the mugs kinda looked dull. Then when we flipped over the mug, we found that the bottom that said \"Strawberry Street\" was sticker that peeled off easily. The original ones had them printed on the bottom of the mug. Who puts their brand name for a mug on a peel-able sticker anyways? You guessed right, the fake ones. Check out my video for the demo. We are returning them. These are 100% fake.",

I have 3 authentic 10 SS mugs remaining from sometime ago. They are much higher quality and their logo on the bottom of the mugs is fired into the mug itself. These cheaper fake versions put a plastic sticker on the bottom of the mugs that emulate the genuine 10 Strawberry Street mugs. Needless to say, it is very disappointing to realize I cannot trust vendors on Amazon. There are more and more of these kinds of shams. Be careful!",
