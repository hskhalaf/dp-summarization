      "text": "If you plan on buying these, do not do so from this seller. They are not an authorized dealer by the manufacturer so Master & Dynamic will NOT honor any warranty. After approximately 7 months of use and care, the microphone and toggle buttons have suddenly stopped working for me, the sound quality also seems to have decreased somewhat. The seller nor Master & Dynamic will take responsibility for the sudden loss of functionality. The sound quality, comfortability, and design of the actual earbuds are very nice but with the issues of actual longevity I can not recommend them. I would seek out other options and make sure that any seller is authorized by the manufacturer.",

My ears did get some fatigue after 1 hour of moderate loud listening with Oppo amplifier. Little concerned about the microphone tearing over repeated travel use/pack/unpack. Case not well deisgn, extreme bending of wires to put it in. Over the EAR headphone of B&O H6, B&W P7/P3, Audio Technica M50x, Sennheiser Momentum, Bose Sports, Jaybird X3, Audeze LCD2. For price it ranks behind B&W P3 and above audio technica. thanks",

The jack seems not to fit securely into the socket, I am not sure if this is a quick release feature incase it gets caught on something (as this does not affect the sound). The carry pouch has the capacity to attaract stains and dirt tather quickly, and does make for easy use of storage as well.",

They don't stay in the ears. I've tried all the earbud sizes and none of them hold the earphones in place. In fact, as i'm writing this review I can feel them slowly slipping. It's a constant distraction. 2. Every bump on the cord can be heard through the earphones as a rustling sound.",

I would not recommend using these for anything but listening in a very controlled environment in order to protect the fragile cable. If these were in the sub 100 price range, I would have much better sentiments towards them. However, as stated before, I find that these headphones are not especially practical (for my use), and the sound quality can be found and exceeded at lower price points.",
