      "verdict": "Fashion and comfort collide with the Performance Expert sneaker from Hush Puppies. Crafted with a sleek and soft upper and a cushioned footbed, it has the comfort of a sneaker combined with a dressier edge.However, people with wide feet need to take note that they may have to order a \u00bd size larger than usual and in a wide width to achieve a comfier fit since it was reported as tight in fit. Overall, it is a great and comfortable shoe recommended by most reviewers.",

The removable insole is very comfortable on my feet with good arch support. The sock liner is a great idea to avoid having the shoe rub up against your heel and ankles. They are also light as a feather. Will definitely be purchasing more hush puppies shoes",
