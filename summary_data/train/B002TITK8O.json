What a difference it makes to have your own dolly, especially when moving in Covid-times when you are trying to minimize contact and streamline everything you do. This moving truck was a godsend. We also used it to transport heavy shelving several blocks on the street. It's sturdy and easy to maneuver (pull it, handlebar first... that works better than pushing it). Great product.",
