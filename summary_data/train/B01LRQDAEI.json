Obviously will not charge it all the way since it only puts 30w out through USBC, but it'll buy you 6-7 hours from 85% charge + 1-2 hours that it charged while your computer was running light videos and word documents. That's pretty good in my book, and it has more capacity than the dell power companion to boot!",
