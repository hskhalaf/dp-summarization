      "text": "My wife and I took this on our 30 day tandem cycling tour down the pacific coast, Canada to Mexico. We loved it so much!!! It's study and cozy and warm. When rolling it up we learned to fold it in half not thirds, put the fatter side in first, and use the compression straps to make it shorter. Once you get into the hang of it it's pretty easy. We used this 30 nights in a row and it is still almost good as new! It is definitely a worth while investment. We are so happy to have this for camping in years to come!",

The description also tells you the size but don't be fooled, I figured I could replace two sleeping bags in a pack w/ this one but that's going to be impossible. At least with the compression sack it comes with. I plan on buying a separate nicer compression sack and trying to fit it in that and see how it goes. I will update the post if i find any success.",
