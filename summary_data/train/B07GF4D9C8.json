Even though the glass is borosilicate, it is very thin and I don't just drop in the ball ice cubes (or any ice cubes for that matter.), but I tilt the glass and gently let the cube roll in. Stick them in the fridge before using and your drinks will stay cold! Happy (but responsible:-) sipping!",

I would definitely buy this again if I need a gift.",

The packaging is top notch and was super impressed with that portion of the product as I have designed packaging myself. The only thing about these glasses that makes me nervous is they're so light. It feels as though one wrong bump or rough placement and they could get damaged but so far so good and we haven't crossed that bridge yet.",

I love how the ice ball fits perfectly in the bottom and seemingly lasts forever. It also doesn\u2019t sweat on the bottom. Useful for mixed drinks too since it has ounce markers. Couldn\u2019t be happier with this purchase, love sharing these glasses with friends!",

Just dropping in the ice ball (from the molds included in kits) cracked the bottom of the glasses, it happened on two of the six I purchased, I won't use the others for fear of the same thing happening. These glasses needed to be manufactured with durability in mind, instead they are cheaply made. Good concept, terrible execution. I would appreciate a full refund.",

      "DOUBLE WALLED INSULATION - We've crafted a superior whiskey and spirits glass. Our unique vacuum insulation helps keep your whiskey at the perfect chilled temperature for literally hours on end. Our hand-blown borosilicate glass is lightweight and comfortable to carry or hold.",
      "SMOOTHER TASTE - Our unique bell shaped cocktail glass is designed to give better aromatics and ethanol aeration than traditional low ball glasses or nosing glasses. That means your whiskey, scotch, bourbon or alcohol of choice will taste smoother and more easily express its subtle flavor profiles.",
      "PERFECT POURS - The duo glass features specially patented integrated measuring lines so that you can perfectly measure cocktails and mixed drinks without using a shaker or jigger. Each of the 8 lines perfectly matches 1 oz of liquor or beverage. Now you can easily make consistent drinks every time.",
      "A SPECIAL GIFT - Each duo glass kit comes in a premium padded gift box with 2 unique hand-blown glasses and 2 silicone ice sphere molds. Give it as a gift to a special cocktail connoisseur you know or as a housewarming, groomsmen, or graduation present. Give a gift they'll actually use and enjoy.",
      "FREE PREMIUM ICE MOLDS - As a special bonus we've included 2 easy to use silicone ice cube molds. They make smooth ice spheres which perfectly match the unique duo glass bell shape. That's awesome because it means most of your liquid is always in contact with solid ice for a hearty chilled drink."
