Oster is a great name which made me free comfortable and was delivered and felt like this is a high quality blender. The jar is nice glass and feels like it should be more expensive. The blender has been great for milkshakes and protein shakes so far. Smoothies are the next plan. Blends well and been easy to clean as well which is a plus.",

For this reason I gave it 3 stars but really if you are in the market for something powerful, this is your machine.",

Put it to use when making red pepper hummus, a toasted walnut spread, or creamy potato soup--or to prepare toppings for a homemade pizza, like chopped onions, green peppers, and other favorites. Of course it also blends strawberry smoothies and chocolate milk shakes to utterly decadent perfection.\n\nSTAINLESS-STEEL ICE-CRUSHING BLADE\nTransform your home into party central. Fitted with a stainless-steel ice-crushing blade, the powerful blender transforms ice cubes into crushed ice in seconds. Thoroughly crushed ice with no large chunks means smooth, delicious frosty drinks are a snap to make, any time. From margarita Mondays to Friday night daiquiris--a festive frozen drink can set the tone to any successful soiree.\n\nIn addition to crushing ice, the versatile blender with its sharp stainless-steel blade also functions as a grinder. Use it to grind peanuts, pecans, almonds, and other hard nuts--or to grind coffee beans for a rich, flavorful brew.\n\nALL-METAL DRIVE SYSTEM FOR LASTING DURABILITY\nMade in North America, the Oster BLSTDG blender provides the superior quality of an all-metal drive system. The system's two connecting pieces are made of durable metal (instead of plastic), which means reliable, long-lasting, high-quality performance from one party to the next, year after year. \n\nSOFT-TOUCH ELECTRONIC CONTROL PAD WITH 6 SPEED SETTINGS\nThe blender's easy-to-clean soft-touch electronic control pad comes with pre-programmed settings for consistent results and simple one-touch operation. Choose from six speed settings: low, medium, high, pulse, ice crush, or drinks. The \"pulse\" setting allows for precise blending; the pre-programmed \"ice crush\" setting pulses on high for 30 seconds then shuts of automatically; and the pre-programmed \"frozen drinks\" setting runs on high for 45 seconds then shuts of automatically.\n\n7-CUP BOROCLASS GLASS JAR\nUniquely designed, the included 7-cup glass blending jar comes fitted with an easy-pour lid with a snap-open spout--simply lift the spout cover to pour; there's no need to remove the entire lid. For added convenience, the jar's oval shape allows it to fit neatly in the refrigerator door--great for keeping mixed drinks cold during a party.\n\nThe blending jar is both dishwasher-safe and scratch-resistant, and it's made of Boroclass--a glass that's been thermal-shock tested to withstand extreme temperature changes, which means the jar can be pulled from a steamy hot dishwasher and safely used to blend up a frosty cold beverage seconds later. Other highlights include a generous side handle, a drip-free pouring spout, and measuring marks up the side.\n\nEngineered to impress, the BLSTDG blender beautifully merges savvy innovation with user-friendly simplicity. You'll be in awe of what you can create. \n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nOster BLSTDG blender, 7-cup glass jar with lid, user manual",
