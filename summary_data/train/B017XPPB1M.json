But no problems here besides those small inconvenience. (:",

In the future I'm definitely changing my computer case, but for now I'm fine with this as my current case, since I've had it for about 2 years with no problems.

I had to use 3.5mm screws from the assortment kit that were supposed to be for hard drive mounting. I used Corsair CW-9060007-WW Hydro cpu cooler and the radiator does sit low when mounting out the back which caused me to install the GPU in the lower slot.

Aside from that, this case met my needs and then some.",

However, the side panel used for cable management isn't exactly the best, but you can probably work around that with enough twist ties and patience. Overall, great case!",
