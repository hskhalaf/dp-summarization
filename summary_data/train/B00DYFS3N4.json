Length adjustment is very easy and straight forward, no tools needed. One note, this probably would not fit every bike out there.

      "text": "This looks like it would be a terrific kickstand, very sturdy & well-built and smoothly operating. I was impressed by the build quality for under $11. However, the kickstand does not fit on my (very common) Giant Roam 3 bike, so I never got to use it. There are small, undetachable clips welded into the bike frame that hold brake cables and those clips block the mounting hardware. We tried everything, but the kickstand is now in a drawer & we've ordered an alternate BV model that attaches to the rear forks. If not for this incompatibility -- which was impossible to predict from the photos & description on the product page! -- this would easily be a five-star review.",

The allen needs to be LOOSE, not part of a multi-tool, or you'll probably never get it in there. My socket-set allen would not fit in there either.

      "text": "Frustration became statisfaction once I went to my bike. This product came with no directions. The directions are below its Amazon description but are not clear to a person unfamiliar with bike repair and/or this product. Once you look at directions and compare your bike and then place the bracket in the assumed location, the installation becomes obvious.You then tighten bolt, adjust kickstand to pereferred length and its a done deal. Bike has its proper lean and I dont have to lean it against walls or flip it upside down to rest on handlbars and seat.I recommend this product, I havent rode because of temps yet, but it clears pedal.",

Just make one head, the bolt with a hex head and that\u2019s it. A 30 second job turned into 30 minutes of total frustration. Stupid.",

It will chew the hell out of your bike causing it to rust and wear prematurely, possibly do great damage to the frame in a wreck.",

Ordered this and it looks as good as stock and does a good job of supporting my 51 lb e-bike. Can't speak for durability but at this price if it lasts a year I'm good.",

I would like it to be a bit thinner, but I understand that it wouldn't be adjustable that way. I would even consider this as an upgrade from a bike that already had a kickstand. Great product!",

The spring-loaded latch lifts up, allowing the foot to smoothly glide along the kickstand and lock into place when the latch is closed. A steel hexagonal bolt prevents the foot from sliding off completely and deters vandals. Adjust the kickstand without any tools, anywhere, anytime. \n\nMade of aluminum alloy, the kickstand is designed to fit most lightweight, midweight and cruiser bicycles 24\" to 29\" and easily installs with a bottom bracket mount that fits on a bike's chain stay neck. Riders can adjust their bikes to rest at any angle, which is great for balancing bikes in places where the ground is uneven. It is available in ED black or V-Polished silver.\n\nThe reinforced plastic foot has a non-slip sole to prevent slipping on wet surfaces and sinking in mud.\n\nSpecifications\n\nMaterial: Aluminum Alloy\nBicycle size: 24\"-29\"\nDimensions: 14\"-16.5\" x 0.5\"-2\" x 1.5\"\nWeight: 0.56 lbs.",
