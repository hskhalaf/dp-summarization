While it only took 5 minutes and $2 in self tapping screws....it was pretty disappointing it needed extra as it is far from cheapest model available. I added zip ties to the cables as they get caught in track making it hard to open. This is same as Backflip 2 according to the guy on the phone that helped me with an install question.",

The company sent me new seals, but there is no way I would be able to replace them, and have them look at all near the way they looked when I bought the cover.
