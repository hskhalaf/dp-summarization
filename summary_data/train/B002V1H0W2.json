You could carefully blow this up with an air compressor but I blew it up myself and it still only took a few minutes, so it\u2019s totally doable if you don\u2019t have one.",

Anchors are not enough to keep it steady if the wind begins to blow, but you can always add rocks or other items in them to help. Ball is 'beach ball' style, so it is light and won't be bothered by water; works well if you do not inflate it too much.",

Kids had fun playing with it whenever they used it. I just put some big river rock in the bag not any small ones that could fall out and it held the net in place pretty good. I wish the net wouldn't bend in on itself so much but it's an easy fix and that was my only problem with it, besides the hole in the beginning. It was delivered in a timely manner as usual with prime membership",

I did think it was wider and we could tie it to each side of the pool because the pool is only 15 feet across. Nope! Probably want to invest in a heavier ball this one will blow away or if there is a little wind it definitely won't work for volleyball. Great product for the price. Like others recommend I take the net down when not in use so it doesn't dry rot or fall apart.",

There isn't really an effective way to keep the net in one place, so it ends up moving around in the pool. Additionally, inflatable volleyball it comes with is pretty useless -- it's small and way too light to actually be used as a volleyball for a game. The product title says 6+, and I can imagine that this product would be fun for kids, but if you're actually want to play any kind of a legitimate volleyball game this product is not what you're looking for.",

Taking that into consideration and how much it cost, we definitely like this product. The netting is a bit oddly crafted. The weaving is not consistent and because of this the top portion of the net is already falling apart. This happened on day one during installation. The sewing job on the top of the net is different than the rest and causes for a weak point to break. This sort of thing is to be expected at this cost. Still, we love it and are happy to own it.",
