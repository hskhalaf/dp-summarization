The space for bills is too short so all of the bills get folded meaning you can't put much in there. The card slots are sized ok but there seems to be something that grabs the cards when trying to pull them out, glue or something so that's a hassle. In short I'm wishing I had not made thia purchase. Back to the old fossil wallet.",

Also, you can keep bills and coins. A lot of small wallets usually don't have the feature. Also, the material is really nice, and it doesn't look cheap at all. But if you have to keep more than 10 cards, it might not be the best for you. Probably 8-10 is maximum. I found it at koehl's, but it turned out it is way cheaper in Amazon. So I returned it to Koehl's and purchased it here. I am so happy! : )",
