The goggles did not fit my head, not even close, and I couldn't focus on the picture. I don't wear glasses normally, but apparently, I need to! The controller is also quite small and perhaps not suited to a fully grown adult. If you're buying this for a smaller or younger person, I'm sure it's going to be great. If you're not smaller or younger, you might want to get a full-sized controller and try a different set of goggles. The quad itself, just look online for the reviews and you'll see it's generally pretty good.",

On my 8th flight in I'm in mode 2, so the learning curve isn't bad. Super stable powerful motors. Crashed into ground several times no problem. (Grass) A must have in your drone Arsenal!",

It is a big step up from the ones you buy at local stores that a consumer grade, vs this one being more professional feeling. Very fast. Only complaint is that on of the fly settings is a little hard to learn. Most notably, the drone is programmed to flip if you push the right stick too far, so that can make it hard for a beginner to learn when trying to correct. Battery life is not that long, maybe 8 minutes, but they are cheap and you can charge any at a time.",

Overall, the system works beautifully together. The transmitter was a little easier, for me, than a bulky block style transmitter. The goggles had my heart pumped after the first flight! Good aspect ratio, signal strength, etc. It does, however, get a bit heavy on the neck after flying about 4 batteries in a row. Would recommend! (Googly eyed drone shot VERY related, btw)",
