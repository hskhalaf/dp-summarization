      "text": "I have owned this camera since it first came out and continue to love the results even in 2016. It has a very big sensor however it is smaller in the hand than many compact cameras with inferior tiny sensors. If you combine this with the 16-50 zoom, you have a super tiny form factor camera, and the lens has image stabilization. Also this model, unlike many of the later \"improved\" models, has a touch screen, great for picking your focus points. A good used model is the best camera deal going today.",

Originally, it was only 0.7 stops, which is pretty much useless. Now, it's an incredible camera. One minor nitpick-- the viewfinder is sold separately. It's an excellent viewfinder, but it's an extra outlay of cash. Another one: There's no hotshoe. Well, there is, but it's a Sony proprietary slot-thing that is a pain in the neck to work with in the field. I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.",

I recommend buying the largest and fastest Micro SD Card you can so it doesn't take long to write to it.

Coming from a Lumix G2, the NEX-5N is a nice upgrade. For those with large lens investments in other formats, you'll find the lack of e-mount lenses for the NEX-5N disappointing, especially when you see the price of the lens adapters. If a family of lenses for every photo situation isn't a problem, there isn't a better camera.",

I say \"infuriating\" because when paying $700 you don't expect to have to settle for a defective product. Other than that, the pictures are simply amazing, especially in low light, and I feel very sad that I have to return it to Amazon (unless they exchange it for a non-defective unit, but I doubt that is possible).",

    "title": "Sony NEX-5N 16.1 MP Mirrorless Digital Camera with Touchscreen - Body Only (Black)",
    "description": "Style:Body OnlyThe performance of a DSLR, in about half the size and weight. The NEX-5N is the interchangeable lens camera that fits in your pocket. Enjoy Full HD 1080/60p or 24p movies, astounding low-light pictures, continuous shooting up to 10 fps, incredible panorama shots, and 3.0-inch tiltable Live View touch screen LCD.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n NEX-5N \n\nThe performance of a DSLR, in about half the size and weight. The NEX-5N is the interchangeable lens camera that fits in your pocket. Enjoy Full HD 1080/60p or 24p movies, astounding low-light pictures, continuous shooting up to 10 fps, incredible panorama shots, and 3.0-inch tiltable Live View touch screen LCD. \n\n\n\nDSLR quality in your pocket \nThis is the world's smallest interchangeable lens digital still camera using a large APS-C size sensor (as of Aug 2011). The removal of the conventional mirror box and viewfinder results in a camera body that is about half the size and weight of a standard DSLR camera.\n\nUp to 10 fps shooting \nCapture the decisive moment in sports and get the ideal baby photo. Up to 10 fps continuous shooting at full 16.1 MP resolution. Standard continuous shooting speeds vary based upon shooting conditions and memory card speeds.\n16.1 MP Exmor APS HD CMOS image sensor \nYou get incredible detail and gorgeous enlargements. Thanks to the APS-C sensor size and Sony Exmor APS HD CMOS technology, the camera achieves high resolution with no penalty in low-light sensitivity or sensor noise. \n\nBIONZ image processor \nThe brain of the camera is a refined version of Sony's BIONZ image processor. Its chroma noise reduction delivers high-resolution, low-noise photos even at ISO 25600 sensitivity. Also enables fast processing for up to 10 fps continuous shooting of data-intensive 16.1 megapixel images, 2D/3D Sweep Panorama modes and 6 image layering.\n\nFull HD movie shooting 60p/24p \nRecord Full HD 1920x1080 video in a variety of frame rates from 60p for super smooth action to 24p for a more cinematic feel. The NEX-5N utilizes the AVCHD codec, the industry standard for high quality HD video capture, as well as the MP4 codec for easy upload to the web due to it's smaller file size. \nPhoto Creativity Touch \nThe Photo Creativity interface enables you to easily enjoy the creative expression through direct photographic control in an easy to use interface. Changes can be combined/removed and viewed in real time on the LCD making it a breeze to make adjustments. \nTiltable 3.0\" Touch LCD \nSony's 3.0\" Xtra Fine LCD monitor has 921K dots for superb resolution. The TruBlack screen includes a special resin layer to suppress internal reflections, increasing contrast compared to conventional LCDs. Sunny Weather mode boosts visibility even further in bright sunlight. Tilts down 45\u00b0 and up 80\u00b0 to frame high- and low-angle shots that would otherwise be hit-or-miss. \n\n\nObject Tracking AF via Touch LCD \nObject Tracking AF can lock onto a specified object and maintain focus even as the subject moves. This hassle-free mode allows unpredictable subjects to stay in focus even while zooming. Letting you concentrate on the scene and composition without having to worry about focus. The subject on which to lock focus is easily selected via the touch screen or the center button of the control wheel.\n\nWorld's shortest release time lag (0.02 sec) \nIn photography, shutter lag, or release time, is the delay between triggering the shutter by fully depressing the shutter button and when the photograph is actually recorded. By initiating the exposure electronically instead of with the traditional shutter mechanism, release time on the NEX-5N is reduced to just 20 milliseconds - helping you to capture the decisive moment.\n\nOptional XGA OLED viewfinder \nThe optional FDA-EV1S OLED Tru-Finder offers a large, bright and wide-view of the scene. With high resolution 2.395K dot, and unprecedented speed, contrast and color accuracy, the FDA-EV1S provides an extraordinary view.\n\n11 Picture Effect modes \nThere are 11 picture effects modes to choose from: Posterization (Color, B/W), Pop Color, Retro Photo, Partial Color (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), Soft High-key, High Contrast Monochrome, Toy Camera (Normal, Cool, Warm, Green, Magenta), Soft Focus, HDR Painting, Rich-tone Monochrome, and Miniature. Each is unique and each gives you a new and exciting way to make your images and videos pop. \n\nPeaking AF display \nThe Peaking AF display makes precise manual focusing much easier by highlighting the edges that are in focus in your choice of three colors ( white, red, or yellow). This is especially helpful during macro or portrait photography where your focal plane can make or break your shot.\n\n3D Sweep Panorama Mode \nCapture vast scenic vistas and 16:9 shots in spectacular 3D. As you sweep across the panorama, the camera records separate right-eye and left-eye images that make landscapes come alive on your 3D television. Records both JPEG and MPO file formats. \n\nSweep Panorama Mode \nCapture expansive landscapes automatically. Press the shutter, sweep vertically or horizontally. The camera does the rest, continuously shooting images and stitching them together. Up to 23 MP image size. Up to 202 degrees maximum sweep angle (16mm focal length).\n\n6-image layering \nThe camera leverages the large, APS-C image sensor and captures six images in a fraction of a second. The camera then combines the data from the 6 different images to create a single image. This method is used to control blur in Anti-Motion Blur mode or to get cleaner, sharper nighttime pictures in Hand-held Twilight mode.\n\nAuto HDR \nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) photography captures more scene contrast than a single exposure can handle by combining the best highlight detail from one shot and the best shadow detail from another for one incredible shot. Until recently, you needed a computer and editing software. Sony builds HDR in. Handles severe backlighting and other high-contrast scenes. Captures in a split second. (Recommended for still subjects.) \n\nP/A/S/M operating modes \nThe NEX-5N offers a full range of controls for video and still shooting from the beginner's iAUTO mode to P/A/S/M: Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual. On-screen prompts help you refine your skills, build your confidence and exercise greater creative control.\n\nIntelligent Auto Focus \nPre-focuses as you compose the shot, further reducing focusing time to a bare minimum.\n\niAUTO mode \nUnifies and simplifies Sony intelligent technologies. Takes advantage of Intelligent Scene Recognition, Face Detection technology, and Optical SteadyShot image stabilization without leaving auto mode so you always get the best shot.\n\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) \nDynamic Range Optimizer improves results with backlit subjects and recovers details hidden in shadows. Settings include Auto, Level with a choice of five operating levels and Off. \n\nAccepts Sony E-mount lenses \nCompatible with Sony's E-mount series of smaller, lighter lenses designed specifically for a compact interchangeable lens cameras. Opens up a world of creative options.\n\nPhase Detect AF for E-mount bodies w/ adapter \nBoth the LA-EA1 and EA2 adapters (sold separately) allow you to attach A-mount lenses to your E-mount camera. However, the LA-EA2 is the world's first adapter to leverage Sony's exclusive Translucent Mirror Technology to provide super fast and accurate Phase Detection AF as well. The LA-EA2 adapter has a translucent mirror built-in between the two mounts that directs a small portion of the light to the phase detection AF sensor in the bottom of the unit.\n25-point Auto Focus \n25 sensors cover a very wide area of the scene, for accurate focusing even when the subject is far from the center of the frame.\n\nHDMI output \nEnjoy HD movies and stunning still images on a compatible HDTV. The camera includes an HDMI output.\n\nStamina battery power for up to 430 shots \nTake up to 430 shots on a single charge with Sony lithium ion Stamina battery power. Sony's InfoLITHIUM battery system enables you to see the percent of power remaining, so you can keep shooting in confidence.",
