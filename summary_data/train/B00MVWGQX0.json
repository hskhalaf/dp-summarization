Apparently, Amazon won't touch it after 30 days so when contacting the manufacturer, they want you to box it up and pay for shipping before they will send a new one, and of course you have to give them your credit card info to pay the shipping to receive a new one!

I had one unit that lasted a few years before it leaked, but the last one only lasted 8 months. The upper high temperature silicone hose that connects the tank to the heating element is very short and the two connections are slightly offset, therefore putting constant strain on the tube which is already stressed because one end connects to the hot metal heating element tube. If you buy this for $100, you would be wise to invest in the $14 four year warranty plan.",

The very fact that they want me to pay shipping really irritates me so I will use this coffee maker until the plate chips more then in the trash it will go . I will also NOT buy another Cuisinart knowing there warranty is a pay one . Below you can see what less than six months of use has done to the hot plate .",

We ran 20 water-only cycles (we counted) to get the pot used to hot water running and take out the plastic taste some reviewers said they had. After 2 weeks of brewing coffee, no luck. Our coffee had a plastic-like aftertaste and we simply couldn't take it anymore. Returned it. I decided to use our French press -although not as convenient. PRO: the coffee did come out piping hot!

We purchased this pot because of the stainless steel carafe but would not recommend it or purchase it again",

The reason is that you have to turn the carafe practically upside down due to a ring under the spout. In addition, there is no easy way to clean the inside of the carafe given the very narrow opening. The worst Cuisinart product I've ever owned.",
