I thought it made sense to expand my collection to try their other wonderful-sounding scents. Unfortunately, I found that my favorites from previous sets smelled nothing like what I'm used to - they went from something really enjoyable to something totally unpleasant. Several of the new oils I was excited to try had an overpowering lemongrass or citronella smell - so much so that they were completely unpleasant and smelled identically bad. Such a disappointment.",

More for medicinal use than aroma therapy. I would add a few drops to an Epsom salt bath or foot soak. *Breathe--smells like eucalyptus. *Headache--This has a warm, minty smell.",

This oil is not edible, like 'Young Living', but for distilling it works perfectly, and the price point is hugely different.

I purchased this set after attending my first Young Living party and realizing I couldn't afford to pay $20 per body for those oils even though I fell in love with the product. I'm no expert, however I couldn't tell a difference between these oils and the name brand when using them in a diffuser. I haven't tried them in any other form yet but I haven't been disappointed with how they work in the diffuser. If you're curious about essential oils but don't want to pay an arm and a leg before your certain if they're right for you, then give this set a try!",

The stress relief smells strong of orange oil and I'm not a huge fan of the smell but it is very relaxing. Good night smells great and is very calming helps me get comfortable and fall asleep and stay asleep. I've added the deep muscle to some coconut oil and arnica cream and feels wonderful on sore muscles and I love the wintergreen smell. The others seem to work well for their purpose. They just don't seem very strong I have to add more drops to my diffuser more often as opposed to other oils I've used.",

Breathe Blend smells like peppermint and eucalyptus. And, the Head Ease Blend smells most strongly of lavender and mint. The Good Night Blend and Stress Relief Blend smell the best.
