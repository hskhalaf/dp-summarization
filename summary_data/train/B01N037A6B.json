But after a few days you start to understand how the tools really work. For folks like me, our ears produce too much ear wax and need to be cleaned out occasionally before a buildup occurs which affects the hearing. So this beats shoving a q-tip down your ear, using ear drops, or going to a ear specialist every day of the week.",
