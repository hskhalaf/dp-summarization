This is an excellent quality tool, well made and as of yet I have not had any problems and to be honest dont expect to have any",

Manual mentions to contact manufacturer for additional information, but no phone, fax, email or address is provided. Doing a search for the manufacturer on-line just brings you to an Amazon advertisement.
