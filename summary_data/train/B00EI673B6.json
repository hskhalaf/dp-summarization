      "text": "I just ordered the All-Absorb pad, it's noticeably thicker than the Amazon Basic pad. If I didn't replace the Amazon pads regularly (like after 2-3 uses), it would start to leak onto the floor from saturation. The Amazon pads are a little less expensive (thinner, about 1\" smaller in one dimension), so if you replace after every use or two go with that one. If you like the flexibility of a more absorbent pad or have a bigger puppy, this one seems better. Will try these out tomorrow. In the photo, All-Absorb on left, Amazon Basics on right.",

I found some from a previous order and the difference in thickness was very noticeable. So, Why would I pay the same and have to use twice as much. Have to start shopping around.",

Plus I'm finding myself cleaning up more accidents because my dog doesn't like stepping on them. Will be going back to my previous brand as soon as they're back in stock on Amazon.",

These pads do a good job of soaking up a decent amount of liquid, but the plastic liner on the underside prevents way more moisture than another brand I've tried. Also, I don't smell as strong a urine smell with these pads as some others. Will buy these again if we continue to need them.",

This isn't a big knock on Amazon Basics because I haven't had any bleed through with either pad. I'm just pointing this out for those with bigger dogs who may expel more urine than my 9-pound terror.
