The item came with directions that were completely wrong and of no use. You literally have to put the entire thing together from scratch including the wiring. Luckily my husband has some knowledge of wiring and was able to figure it out but it took more than a few hours. He did find a youtube video demonstrating how to put it together but it was in Chinese so only moderately helpful. Like I said, it looks great but it is not a quick assembly product and requires a bit of electrical knowledge.",

Yes, it took a bit of assembly but the sellers sent me a link to a video to watch and that made it pretty straightforward to put them together. Just make sure you have your tools on hand and about a half hour per light, and be patient. But it's not a very complicated assembly if you take your time. The only wish I have is that they'd send some 6\" rods along with the 12\" rods so I could have a bit more control over hang-length. Don't forget you also have to buy a dozen bulbs per light, so that adds some cost, too.",

The price was low enough that I understand why you would need to put it together yourself but the directions were really confusing and hard to follow. It took about 1.5 hours just to get it together and then hanging it took another 20 minutes. My husband is a contractor and has hung plenty of our chandeliers in the past and said this was the most frustrating. I think if the instructions were written more clearly it may not have been such an issue. Otherwise, the light itself looks nice once it's up!",

Then each giant bundle has to be connected to the main black and white that comes down the top rod. Buy some larger electrical connectors to make this easier and a more secure connection. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the instructions are really bad.",
