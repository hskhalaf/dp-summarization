A note on sizing: I'm usually a medium in most bottoms but a small in Spanx shapewear. But based on comments here I ordered a medium for these leggings. It was a perfect fit, actually tighter than my current leggings which are Athleta mediums. So they are fairly true to size for leggings, but consider ordering up a size from your Spanx shapewear size.",

These are BOMB! smug and comfy, thick and yet loose enough to not make me wanna go postal at random moments like some of my other ones.. the only thing I would change is I would like them to be just a bit shorter so as not to hang out of the bottom of my skirts but thats minor.",
