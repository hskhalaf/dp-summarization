Using my calipers I get expected 11/16\" diameter (.6875\") 3/16\" thickness (.1875) actual .708\" diameter (17.99 mm) .198\" thickness (5.02mm)",

I plan to craft my own magnets designs (by creating miniature felt creatures and gluing them to the magnets) and they are the perfect size. Big enough to be sturdy and hold onto a good amount of paper to a fridge, and yet small enough to be unobstrusive.",
