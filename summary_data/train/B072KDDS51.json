The step is small, which makes it harder to train her that she should use it to walk on.

The previous owners used a heavy wood structure that looked similar to a pallet as an extra step to make getting into the RV easier. The weight and space it was taking up in the storage compartment just didn't make sense for its purpose, so I tried this little step. This worked perfectly! It is light weight and when folded, takes almost no room. It flexes a little bit under adult weight but not enough to be concerned about. If you need just a little extra step somewhere in your life, I would recommend this item.",
