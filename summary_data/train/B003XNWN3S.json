I've only used it once and now with out a flat surface its more than just a table with holes in it. Does not fold easy, but when it does it is compact. the 'velcro' pen pouch had already fallen off before I unpacked it. I do not recommend, not worth it.",

FIrst of all the sticker or paint that is written on each side of the table, some of it was already coming off when we first opened the table. We played one round of BP and one of the legs collapsed on us, meaning many cups of beer and water were spilled on our carpet. To just clarify points, the legs were not sturdy, the paint was coming off, the table itself is flimsy, and therefore not worth your money.",

It's literally only for beer pong, which is a pity because it's a good-sized table that could be used for other things. I'm trying to figure out how to cover the holes and use it as a crafting table. I mean, how often do you play beer pong?",

Dry erase works well, cup holders work (but prevent certain custom stack arrangements), and customer service is super nice as well. The only thing is, the legs stick a little.

The hinges on the legs are thin aluminum, and it only takes one too many beers for someone to forget the hinge lock and try to fold up the table - bending or breaking the hinges in half, rendering the table useless.",

Putting that aside unless you are one of those people who love to make your own, this is a great buy.",

Either way this thing has paid for itself this summer and I foresee it continuing to do so during football season.",
