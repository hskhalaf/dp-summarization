Sitting in southern Florida with two panels perpendicular to the sun on a clear day. Using MC4 Y branch connectors for parallel feed to 10ft of 10AWG cable to 99% efficient controller. Result is 7.9 amps/13.2v (about 104 watts). What gives?? Why not approaching max of 8 amps? Very disappointed in this low output performance. Tempted to return just because output is misstated",

The panel feels sturdy and I think it is well built. I have not had any problems with the solar panels.",
