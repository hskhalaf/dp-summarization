It is VERY effective at removing excess calloused skin. Use after shower/bath once your feet have been dried off after a couple minutes but the water has still plumped your normal skin. That way the soft skin does not scrape off easily but the callous will. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT! use on bone-dry feet: you will think all is well but will remove TOO MUCH skin. Then you will hobble about in pain with raw, exposed tissue for 4 days. Trust.",

Be sure to file lightly and check often to make sure you don't file too much the first time. Check after each pass back and forth or your feet could be tender and sore the next day.

It just kind of gets unwieldly if you're trying to attack smaller areas of your feet and it doesn't really angle well. Again, if you have flexible feet this isn't much of a problem, which is why I like it. But if your mobility's more limited you're going to want something smaller that can angle better.",

Spent about ten minutes on each foot with this thing & was amazed (along with slightly grossed out) as how much dead skin it took off. Little intimidating at first but once you get going it\u2019s extremely easy. Did this with my feet completely dry prior to showering, once in the shower I applied a foot cream scrub then used a pumic stone & applied lotion when dried & done. Feet feel brand new & did not have to pay salon prices.",

Originally I went to a doctor's office and a person shaved it down with a blade type callus but it came back. Not sure if the person was a doctor or a nurse practitioner. The person who shaved it down actually told me it would probably come back. I used a blade type shaver on it myself several times but it always came back. When I got this file I used the blade type shaver again on the callus and then finished with this file and the callus hasn't come back since. Also works great removing cracked skin around the heels.",

Just beware... once you start you just want to keep going, and if you're not careful you'll end up going too far and you'll have sore/raw feet. I recommend doing a gentle first pass, then give yourself a day and see how things look and feel. But if you want smooth feet this is the ONLY thing you need.",

It was amazing seeing how much dead skin it took off. Amazing. Can't wait to brag about it and my new soft feet lol",

      "text": "I've always had issues with dry heels. My sister who has similar feet issues recommended this product to me, and I bought it skeptically. I've tried a lot of creams and pumice stones all with so-so results that didn't last. I have to say though, it works as great as she said!! You'll be amazed at how much dead skin comes off when you use this product. After you do a good filing of your feet the first time, I've found I only need to use this about once to twice a month in order to maintain. My heels also have never returned to being as bad as they were before I got my microplane.",

I've already bent mine after about 4 uses. The planer stays sharp and I'm guessing it will outlast the handle. FYI, your feet need to be dry when you use this planer and you should be careful as it's easy to shave off too much skin and leave your foot sensitive.",

You spend 15 seconds of light rubbing and ALL !! dead skin is gone. The only concern is to do it lightly enough that one doesn't lose an ankle. Cannot praise it enough.
