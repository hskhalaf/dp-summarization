If you read the wording for the forward foot piece it says use a 2\" bolt but references a 23 which is a 2 1/2 , and again the upper seat bolts call for a 2 1/2 inch but references a 24 which is a 2\" bolt. Reverse and assembly is smooth, I haven't used the stand yet so can't review that part yet.",

Theyre comfortable to sit in for 4 hours or more and the shooting rail doesnt go up so far that you cant shoot a crossbow at 15-20 yards without really leaning over. I would always recommend this stand, unless you want something taller.",

Overall think this was a great purchase.",

But pretty disappointed that when we got to the last step of attaching the seat, we realized the seat was sewn on backwards, so the design was facing the back instead of the front and looks really stupid. But after spending the hour or so putting it together, it's not worth sending back so we'll have to just deal with it. Too much money for something so lazy and careless to be pushed through.",
