Indeed, its waterproofness, arch support, and minimal break-in period also score well with outdoor lovers.On the other hand, the hiker\u2019s warmth may be a deal-breaker for some, especially those who value breathability during a trip. All in all, the Merrell Moab 2 Prime Mid Waterproof may be a compelling option to take outdoors, as long as weather conditions aren\u2019t dry or humid.",

      "text": "Having tried on every available option I this style, this is by far the best of Merrell's Moab 2, in my opinion. Main reason is the all-leather upgrade on this new release. It adds a little more weight, but gives it more of a boot feel...where the others with mesh material feel more like high top hiking shoes. That said, this all-weather make is hotter to the foot and doesnt breathe quite as well. I recommend a cotton sock. If your foot sweats hard, these may not work for you unless it's really cold outside. All in all...I really like these - fantastic boots.",

These Merrell\u2019s I purchased for him.. more expensive might I add than the Keen\u2019s, we were both excited for them to arrive and try something new and we really hoped they\u2019d last at least as long as the Keen\u2019s. N.O.P.E.... they didn\u2019t even last 3 weeks before the sides came apart. The rubber from the material. We are SO disappointed and want an immediate refund. Absolutely disappointed that we wasted our money. Trial and error I suppose. Big error. Will not be purchasing any more Merrell\u2019s.",

One thing, i did size up 1 size account my normal shoe size my toes were just too close to the front of the boot for walking long distance and sure glad i did it.",
