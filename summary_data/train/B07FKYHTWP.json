I must have turned that crank a million times, but it never failed us, and when it was all over it went right into the emergency supplies to be ready for the next one.",

      "text": "This was a Christmas gift to my husband. I suppose I should've researched it better but we discovered there is no headphone jack on the unit. So there is no ability to listen to the radio privately. Second disappointment is that when you tip up the solar panel to optimize catching the sunlight the LED light panel underneath it turns on. Which totaly defeats the solar charging purpose. We have found no way to turn off the LED light panel. It simply turns on when tilted up and turns off when laid flat to the unit. Other than that the radio and flashlights work well. It is to early to see how durable the unit will be.",

By using the product I could charge my cell phone which would allow me to contact resources needed in that emergency. Similarly, the unit light and radio would be enormous help in in those situations. I am glad I got it and plan to donate one unit to another family member Thank you Joseph",

The SOS warning on this is LOUD(duh), but is controlled by a switch on the bottom that i fear could be bumped accidentally with relative ease. The charging indicators light up for both solar power and hand crank power, though I'm fairly doubtful they generate any useful amount of power. Though overall a useful little device that could be invaluable in an emergency.",

But this nifty radio has a USB port, VERY bright beam, and ability to take either rechargeable lithium batteries or regular batteries. I bought a set of lithium batteries so that the solar and crank powers can recharge them. The batteries are good for 20 years and do not leak acid when they get old. What could be better? We live in No. CA where we are experiencing massive wildfires and we just went through 5 days of power outage to AVOID fires. This radio will come in very handy.",

The solar worked and the crank worked although I don\u2019t know how much you have to crank to keep it going, but at least I have options.",

It's very durable and has a rugged exterior - and the LED lights very bright. To top it off, the USB is great to charge those cell phones. We'll definitely be buying more for our family.",
