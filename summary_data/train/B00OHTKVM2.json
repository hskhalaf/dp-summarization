It is very lightweight, great for buyers who have any physical handicaps. It is easy to store and empty. Would recommend this and plan on buying one for several family members. *Update-be sure to remove the filter liner that has the blue velcro tab on it. Underneathe it you will find more dust to empty out. If you don't do this, you will lose suction on your vacuum and it will not pick up as well.",

The suction is SO STRONG though that it actually holds the cannister on without it being latched! So as long as I'm careful I can still use it. I will probably buy again once this one is worn out. I would only recommend that purchasers be careful with the latch, it is a very small piece of plastic and was broken pretty easily.",

I returned it, though, because the one we received had a high-pitched, loud motor. I couldn't stand it - but I'm sensitive to sound. Also, our man vac is a Miele which is very quiet. Perhaps I'm spoiled. But my hoover cordless doesn't make such a squeal.",

My \u201creturn period\u201d was over at the end of February, so I guess I\u2019m stuck with a $40 piece of junk? Original review: Vacuum picks up well on hardwood, and alright on a flat rug. My biggest beef is that it is SO LOUD, so I can't use it often with a 6-month old. Otherwise it's okay.",

Used it on hardwood once but it couldn't pick up kibbles left scattered by our cat unless you placed it directly over the kibble and waited to hear it get sucked up. Small enough to fit in a cupboard or hang on a hook in a closet. This will never replace a full size vacuum for a house or large apartment but it's a good addition for a portable option.",

Works great on high pile carpet also and makes those nice lines to show everyone you were actually paying attention. 5 stars for sure!",

I have two very large dogs that shed alot and this vacuum was strong enough to pick it all up in one go (I didn't have to go over the spot multiple times). I love the detachable hand vacuum too. It is perfect for all my furniture and getting the dog hair out of my sofa. I even used the detachable piece to clean out my car. Worked way better than my shop Vac since it is light and easily movable.",

One of the attachments got a crack where it attaches - so I have to use more force to keep it on or just hold it on with one hand. I'm donating it to a charity and going to replace it. Very disappointing.",

I can see this being a problem for anyone with nice, new, easily scuffed or damaged floors. That is the point deduction for me. It's not too bad for me because my floors are in desperate need of rehabilitation, but for others, the scuffs could be a deal breaker.",
