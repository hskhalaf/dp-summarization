I'm a true size 7 in sneakers and ordered size 7 for this and it fit perfectly! Even with socks it didn't feel tight on my feet, just right. The top part of the shoe (the elongated tongue) also provided cushion for when I do roundkicks on the bag. Only annoying thing is that when doing mountain climbers, it feels like my shoe might slip off but it may just take getting used to as it's the first day I've broken them in.",

In my opinion they run perfectly true to size. I would recommend ordering your normal size, or trying them on in store first. They are extremely comfortable shoes.

As a dancer, I put these to the test by dancing for 3 hours straight at the studio. They're light enough to jump, turn, run, train, etc. My only con for these would be that only one shoe was packed with the shoe shaper thingy and paper. I like to keep those to keep the shape of the shoes while they're not being worn. Other than that, I wish I brought these sooner!",
