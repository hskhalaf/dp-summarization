I have been so impressed with how clean and soft my skin feels after using the Calendula Face wash. It doesn't dry my skin out and I use it daily. It has cleared up my skin. I am on the well seasoned side of life, so a product that works so well for me is a keeper. I highly recommend Calendula Deep Cleaning Foaming Face Wash.",
