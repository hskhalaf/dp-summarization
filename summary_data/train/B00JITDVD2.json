Previously, I had been using the Norelco 8900 series shavers at about $200 for the shaver and cleaner package. By comparison the 4500 shaver shaves faster and with less irritation, especially if you don't shave every day. Also cleaning is easy, since all that is required is to flip the shaver head and run it under a stream of warm water to rinse the stubble that collected during the shave. This cleans the shaver for the next shave. The flip up side burn trimmer is much easier to use. In summary, for $60, this is an excellent shaver and performs better than the $200 Norelco shaver.",

I only knocked off 1 star because the flip-up sideburn trimmer is a flimsy design and must be used at a very specific angle to avoid having the mechanism fold back down on you.

It is extreme,y difficult to thoroughly clean and reassemble, gives a poor shave after 10 minutes of shaving, and. appears go be poorly or cheaply manufactured. I will keep the razor,bjut my old Remington razor which kit. 6 years old gives a better shave and ks easier to clean and reassemble. Due to the above, I cannot recommend this razor... On the positive side, it is very quiet and if you don't mind shaving for over 10 minutes , it will give you a fair shave.",

One negative is that it doesn't work just with the charge cord. When the batteries fail; the shaver is done. Bad design! Ergonomic design is adequate; but an Asian hand does not usually resemble my hand. You have to take extra care not to drop the shaver. The charge cord/adapter seem sturdy.",
