Smart phone control is nice but really only for the fact of changing the direction it blows, other than that it's just taking up space on my phone. The live air quality readout and auto setting is neat but doesn't makeup for the heafty price tag. Wish I would have just bought a regular fan for a fraction of the price...",

We leave it on auto and it immediately turns on when I air grill or pressure cook something. I had no idea it spread so quickly and had so much particulate matter. I also removes chemicals and freshens the air. Great quality and well worth the money. Indoor air is often much worse than outdoor air. This changes that dramatically!",

But it baffles me that a company like Dyson sells a product like this and has no idea why their machine just dies. I should have bought a regular fan instead of this fancy device.",

    "description": "Color:White/Silver| Design:Pure Cool\n\nThe only purifying fan to clean a whole room properly.1 We design our purifying fans to go beyond test chamber conditions and focus on real home conditions - this is more than just having an efficient filter.1 Dyson engineers and research concluded that to clean an entire room properly, you need to sense pollution events automatically; capture ultrafine pollutants; and project cleaner air around the room using Air Multiplier technology. Only the Dyson purifying fan is designed and tested to do all of this.2\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n\n * SENSES: Automatically senses & reports air quality levels on LCD display on purifier, including ultrafine particles (PM 2.5), allergens (PM10), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) & Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2).\n * CAPTURES: Sealed HEPA and activated carbon filters capture pollutants.\n * PROJECTS: Air Multiplier technology delivers smooth, yet powerful airflow throughout the whole room. Up to 350 Degree of oscillation.\n * DUAL-FUNCTIONALITY: Forward airflow mode purifies while cooling you as a fan. Backward airflow mode purifies without cooling you. 90% of allergy sufferers surveyed would recommend a Dyson Purifier.3\n * NIGHT-TIME MODE: In night-time mode the machine monitors and purifies using quiet settings, with a dimmed display.\n * ALEXA ENABLED: Voice control using Alexa to turn on/off, turn on auto-mode, and update you on the indoor air quality\n * Other product listings for non-authorized 3rd party sellers are not covered by official Dyson warranty.\n * Warning \u2013 unauthorized replacement filters are not tested or verified to perform at HEPA standard. Only authentic Dyson filters are recommended to ensure a sealed system and proper functioning of the machine. The official Dyson replacement filter can be found by searching \"B07HJFXFNL\" in the search bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n1The AHAM AC1-2015 standard sets out how air cleaner manufacturers can define their performance by \"the relative reduction of particulate matter suspended in the air in a specified test chamber\" - this means their performance is based on cleaning efficiency rates only.\n\n\n\n2Based on air projection tests and oscillation capability.\n\n\n\n3Based on a 2017 Dyson survey of self-reported allergy sufferers after use.
