I wouldn\u2019t necessarily categorize these as flip flops but extremely comfortable sandals and perfect for the pool and Fitness Center and I find myself wearing them around the house all the time when I am in bear feet. A little harder to wear socks but doable. The Velcro can get tangled with the socks but with a little adjustment they work fine. I just use my regular supported leather sandals instead. In all honesty, their may be laziness involved here and easier to switch than adjust. The only complaint is there is no arch support at all, just flat. Still very comfortable and serves just as advertised.",
