Along with that, the screen was defective flickering white and also unable to locate the drive. MacBook Pro was also oddly enough missing from the lower bezel of the display. Issued a return, and am quite disappointed with CTMA.",

It cuts down on size and weight. Plus these days you don't use them as much as you used to. If you do need these options, you can buy them separately very inexpensively. This machine is crazy fast.

It has signs of wear and dents on appearance, little bit of dust, but so far the functionalities are working fine. Will update my review in case my observations turned around. For now, I am happy with my purchase.",

I am also glad it doesnt get too hot when left on for an extended period of time. The battery life is good, even with using high profile software like Sibelius 7 for a good half of the day. Overall, the performance and specs are definitely great for the price compared to other laptop of the same price, which make this Apple purchase a worthwhile one.",
