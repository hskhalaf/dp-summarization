The off white ones of same model are fantastic and mine lasted for many yrs. So I had to return this black one and get my money back. I bought the newer model and it works better than older one. Only wish I had with it is I wish it had those grip bottom things on both upper and lower of the bottom of them cooling pad so item doesnt slip around on some surfaces.",

I have an Acer Aspire E 15 Laptop that I've had for about a year or two. I bought the Pad because I didn't want to overheat my laptop, and when I plugged in into my USB my laptop turned off and wouldn't turn back on. I tried to plug in my charger and turn the laptop on but it wouldn't take a charge. I was told that Belkin was a pretty good brand, but I didn't know that it was so good that it would have shorted my laptop.",

He shot it through the palm rest. My blood lead level is less than.3 mcg/dL and this cool pad, if inhaled, would elevate blood lead levels to .4 mcg/dL. So not a big deal, since it is just skin contact, but still, just so everyone knows it has a surprisingly high lead content. The tech said they use lead as a release agent in the plastic molding and as a UV resistant.",

We just got our new one today,also from Amazon, a Syba with a huge fan for less than half what we paid for the Belkin, wow what a difference it's REALLY quiet and is in no way wobbly which was another problem with the Belkin. My advice is don't bother with this product, check out the Syba.",

It wouldn't take much for this company to add a screen cover on the blade housing to keep this from happening. You definitely cannot use it on a blanket, like laying in bed, etc. Fortunately they are cheap.",

It has a great curved design that fits smoothly in your lap. I also plug it in every time I am watching something on my laptop, just to make sure I stay cool and my laptop stays cool. It makes some noise, but nothing that would distract me from what I was currently doing. I suggest this to anyone who has a laptop that heats up every once in a while!",

It became a little bit louder though, but I use it every day for several hours so it's not a big deal for me. Some time ago, I ordered the same product on Amazon as a gift for my sister. I'm sure she'll love it.",

The stand that holds it up can fall down with a little push from the front, and it's a little noisier than I'd like particularly since I listen to a lot of music. It is however extremely simple to use, just plug it into a USB port.",
