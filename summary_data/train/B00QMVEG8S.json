I made dinner last night and 3 meals today on one tank of propane. You have to play with the buttons to get the correct temperature other than that I can honestly say that it has served its purpose!",

This is very reliable and I have no doubt that it will last long enough for me to hand it down to my kid, and then some. The flames are true and the controls are just perfect. I saw a few other brands that had sharp edges unlike this Coleman Triton. I would recommend this not only to first timers but to seasoned campers.",

      "text": "Having had Coleman stoves most of my life, (my last one lasted 30 years), I had to get a Coleman stove again. There are things that I like and things I don't like. The splash plate under the burners is nice. Makes for easy cleanup. It is also light weight, easy to light and overall I like it. My big concern is the heat adjustment. There isn't any. It seems to be only hot or off. If I just need a low flame I can't figure out how to get it. There is no heat regulation. I find that very frustrating as I don't like to cook everything on high heat.",
