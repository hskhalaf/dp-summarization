I\u2019m not a PC seller but you can\u2019t beat their chopper for the money. If you are looking for a good quality chopper don't by this one. It's not good. Buy a Pampered Chef chopper. I've been using the same Pampered Chef Chopper for 15 years. I bought this chopper because I figured my 15-year-old Pampered Chef chopper blades were getting dull from the years of use. My 15-year-old chopper worked better than the OXO Good Grips Chopper. Don't buy this one!",

Cleanability: I got cabbage shreds stuck behind where the blade is attached. Took several minutes to get it out.",

It also eliminates my eyes from watering/burning while chopping onions. I would recommend this item to anyone who chops onions or any other vegetable on a regular basis. Huge time savor. It also chops to just the right size for most of my recipes.",

Use the Chopper directly on your favorite cutting board or with the included easy-measure cup. Simply place your ingredients inside the cup and press down on the non-slip knob to chop. A tab rotates inside the container to keep food from sticking to the sidewalls, while the built-in bumper absorbs shock and reduces noise. Scoop out chopped ingredients with the included spoon, or snap the lid on to save for later. The wave-pattern blade cartridge easily unscrews for quick cleanup, and the knob locks in closed position for simple storage. BPA-free. Removable blade is dishwasher safe.",
