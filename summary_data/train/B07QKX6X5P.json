My husband has super oily skin , and I decided to use it on him for fun . I did mainly his T-zone and the amount of oil this device extracted was pretty incredible (and gross). I had to wash the nozzle out about 4 times to get the oil out . Disgusting , but it worked!",

Many other machines require batteries and after a few uses, they don't seem to work as well. This charges rapidly and will hold a charge for mulitple uses. Second, the different levels of suction allow both my son's rough facial features and my daughter's sensitive skin to be cleaned comfortably. We are very happy with this product.",

It's just enough suction power so that it pulls the dirt out without feeling like it's sucking out my soul. It also doesn't leave my face red and irritated which is another issue I have with other facial cleaners. Overall I would recommend this product. I will update my review if anything changes. :)",

At first, I was in disbelief about the good things being said about this handy tool, but after a week of using it. I am with the mass. This tool is incredibly easy to use and removes my blackheads with ease. The suction is awesome, but I wouldn\u2019t mind it being a tad bit stronger too. It is alittle tricky to clean, so I like to use a small brush to get into the bottle neck part of the suction head while running it under water. Otherwise, it\u2019s a great buy!",

Also, it can redden or dry out your skin, especially if you have sensitive or thin skin, so I would use a soothing lotion afterwards on your face.",

I have fairly sensitive skin that gets oily sometimes and have large pores. The 3 to 4 setting works well for me. Before and after using this vacuum I use a face wash which contains Salicylic Acid. There are now noticeably fewer blackheads and my pores appear to be shrinking. Will continue using as directed max twice a week.",
