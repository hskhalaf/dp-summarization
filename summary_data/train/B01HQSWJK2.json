Good looking jacket that I even wore on sunny, yet cool days as it was easy to ventilate. Well constructed with a hide-away collar hood. I was surprised that the collar has a light fleece coating which was a bit bothersome on warm days but I certainly see times this Fall & Winter when that fleece will provide needed warmth and wind protection. Also bought one for my wife & she's totally satisfied.",

I bought this jacket to bike to work through the rain and my front side is soaked and my phone got wet. I\u2019m very upset right now and I won\u2019t use this jacket for rainy day at all. It\u2019s bright lime green so that I could be seen better but on dry nights from now on.",
