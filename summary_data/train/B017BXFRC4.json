The room in it as I stated was great with all the zipper compartments. From the looks on our suitcases when we arrived this bag and contents did great. We were going to put in the overhead but they offered to check it for free due to the crowded flight. Again it survived the abuse from those gentle bag \"people\"",

However, as expected some of the clothes got a little wrinkled. (When you fold the bag you have to expect a little wrinkling. No bag can guarantee no wrinkles.) Hanging them up as soon as you get to your hotel or your destination in the closet right away fixes most of the wrinkles.",

If the manufacturer used a rubberized pull tab, it would be a 5 star item. They are cheap and can be found for between $5 and $10 easily. You could even use some paracord if you're the type that has it laying around. Sincerely, \"accidentally jingle bells.\"",
