TIP: When loading the wand with the product for application, swirl the wand in the tube like you would with mascara, don\u2019t pump. It\u2019ll cause the concealer to dry out too quickly. Enjoy!",

      "text": "Product came in traditional packaging, but was less expensive than what I usually pay for it in the store. The shade is fine, and the makeup itself is fine, but the tube/container does not scrape the applicator when you pull it out, so the entire applicator stick is coated in a quarter of an inch of makeup. Makes it very hard to use and to cleanly get the applicator back into the tube. I\u2019m wondering if this is the reason it was so cheap; maybe it was a close out?",
