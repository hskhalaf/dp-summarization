It definitely is very heavy duty and I know I will be using it every year for a long time! It was super easy to clean after baking the turkey and ham! The only thing I was disappointed with was that it listed that there was an electric knife that was came in the kit ... I didnt receive that ..I got just a regular carving knife.. I couldn't return since I needed the set for Thanksgiving.",

This is a high-quality stainless pan you'll be passing down to the next generation someday. It's great for large casseroles as well and not just roasts and large birds at holidays. The shape of the roasting rack allows air to circulate so the whole bird gets a cooked evenly. The lifting forks are something I would not have purchased separately but now would not want to cook a large without. My only tip is to have an extra thermometer on hand.
