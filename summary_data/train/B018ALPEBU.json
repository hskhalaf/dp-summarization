This should've been part of the Limited Edition Dino Charge Megazord like it should because in Kyoryuger's toyline there is an ALL BLACK version of this via seen in the Kyoryger v. Go Busters movie (which featured the Dino Ranger teamup compraising of Zyuranger/MMPR, Abaranger/Dino Thunder and Kyoryuger/Dino Charge). Wait until I get the Limited Edition Dino Charge Megazord and attach the Black versions of the Stego and Tricera Zords, then there would've been the TRUE version. Other than that, Awesome to have.",
