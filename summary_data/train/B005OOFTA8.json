The full mesh palm is breathable material and the new design with extended knuckle padding protects fingers while training, with synthetic leather construction for durability. The only drawback is the stitching on the inside of the glove may tear into your index knuckles after extended heavy bag workouts, although this may very well have more to do with punch technique than with use of the product.
