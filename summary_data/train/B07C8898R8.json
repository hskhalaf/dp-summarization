A good nights sleep is important on the trail. It can be compressed with a sleeping bag if needed.",

I gifted the friend I'm traveling with, who also found it really comfortable. It's not big, but it's large enough for sleeping comfortably. It's NOT flat. It doesn't flip you around like the air pillows, it's not hot like some pillows, it packs neatly and nice into about 9\" x 4 1/2\". It's a super light pillow. It will work great for camping, canoe camping - everything except for the \"ultralight\" camping folks. I highly recommend this pillow!",

Both pillows were whole and intact when we opened them. No holes rips or tears. Both were easy to place back into their bags by one person (but having a second pair of hands definitely made it even easier) the only downside is how small it is. Definitely better for a flight or long car trip because of its size. We got mediums. If you combine two mediums they make a normal size bedroom pillow.",

      "text": "The pictures of this item are misleading. This camping pillow is actually pretty big. I bought it for backpacking and it would be way too big to fit in my pack. The item is difficult to get out of the stuff sack and good luck getting back in. The cover feels cheap. Also the pillow is also lumpy and misshapen due to the way they\u2019re packaged - didn\u2019t puff up evenly after being left out either. Also, has a really weird chemical smell that doesn't go away. Literally nothing good about this item! Don't buy it!",

I make a return and got an new orange pillow. But it's the same problem. The pillow content is so hard like wooden pieces and flocky. The blue was after some time soft and okay. But the orange not. I'm wondering is this a orange pillow problem or I was only lucky with the blue one.",
