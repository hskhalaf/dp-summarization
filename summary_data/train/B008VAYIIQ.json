The remote is easy to use (not backlit unfortunately), with the \"input\" button right on top, so you can switch back and forth between TV, Roku, DVD, etc. My only complaint is that you have to reset the picture size every time you change input type. If your expectations are high, I'd recommend something fancier; if you just want to watch Hulu or Netflix, this TV will do just fine.",
