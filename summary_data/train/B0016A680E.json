I make about 4 or 5 at a time and freeze them and my son loves it. A tip though, if you have trouble with them coming out perfect, just try a different kind of bread. My first few were very sloppy looking and it was because it was really thin sliced bread.",

Treat it like a cookie cutter and \u2018slide\u2019 it on a cutting board to separate sand which from crust.",
