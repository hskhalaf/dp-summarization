They do have black writing on them, and I didn\u2019t want that to transfer to my coat, so I placed each one in a white sock to insure the writing wouldn\u2019t bleed. Not a traditional use, for sure, but they were perfect for me!!",

I wish it was made of something else rather than rubber because it gives the ball extra bounce that you didn't expect it to, when it's pitched.",
