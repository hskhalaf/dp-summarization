I use them 4-5 days for at least 2 hrs. each workout and wish everybody at my gym had a pair. 1-2,combos, 1,1, 2, 3,3, combos - spinning back fist. Dude these are as good as my Cleto Reyes Gloves. Reyes are pretty pricey,these feel good & when I hit it's solid. I got the 16 oz. because I'm 180lbs. & don't want to really hurt anyone while sparring... Anyone that's into combat sports knows, when you catch a solid shot you feel it. The weight of the Glove is so we get quicker and build endurance. Thanks! Randy \"Brito Kickboxing\".",

My fingertips have torn through the inner lining on both pair of gloves, which subsequently allows the lining/padding to slip and makes my hand wraps shift a little and tear the skin on my knuckles. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re bad gloves though. I think they fit pretty good, they\u2019re pretty comfortable and they are a great color/design.

My fingers aren't incredibly long, but my wedding ring is 13.75 (to give you some perspective) and these things are a very tight squeeze with wraps. Without wraps is a lot better, but at the cost of a lot of wrist support. If you're heavy handed, it'll provide the knuckle support most people need, but I have found it to be hard on the wrists and not provide enough wrist support, you definitely want to wrap your wrists well before putting on these gloves. Of course your milage may vary depending on the type of training you're doing, your form, and how hard you go on bag",

They can be a bit stiff around the wrist at first, but it improves with use. Also, I initially purchased the smaller gloves but ended up swapping them out for the bigger ones. If you're something other than a stick figure, get the bigger ones.",

I have fairly large hands, and the Large/Xtra Large provides a really snug fit with hand wraps. Also the extra reinforcement in the wrists provide welcome stiffness, and the velcro wrist straps are well designed to get a snug fit without needing assistance. As for durability, we'll see.",
