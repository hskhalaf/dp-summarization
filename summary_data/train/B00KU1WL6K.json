      "text": "Took it for a workout on my Heritage 9.5 Featherlite kayak a couple times this last weekend. Worked very well for recreational yakking with a little touch of whitewater splashes thrown in. Easy to slip on the kayak (which I definitely can't say for a lot of skirts on kayaks I've used over the years. Fit the Featherlite perfectly. Stayed up on my torso. Comfortable. The only extremely minor item of gripe is common with all lower end recreational kayak skirts I've used; water pools up a little on the skirt. No real problems as the material didn't leak at all and I could raise my knees to knock the pools off as needed.",

Just noticeable because it was winter and a little bit of a shock from the cold. This isn't designed for whitewater anyway and is not really expected to be waterproof. But this price cannot be beat for the quality this product is. Fits my Dagger Stratos 14.5L very well.",
