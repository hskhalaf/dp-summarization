      "text": "Some waffle makers don't get hot enough and you wind up with steamed waffles that take forever to cook. This maker heats up fast, cooks fast and makes big crispy waffles. You can completely trust the indicator lights too. When its ready its ready. The non-stick coating is very good as well. You won't need the mess of non-stick sprays. Really love this machine. Pretty easy to clean too with wet or dried batter wiping right off the surfaces. The overflow tray at the bottom could probably be a little bigger since batter can still drool onto the counter top. I put paper towels underneath for each cleanup.",

Overall, I think that it is a major design flaw, and I have had better flip waffle makers in the past.",

It also wouldn\u2019t close fully, even from the first waffle. Just overall a ridiculous experience. I had high hopes for this, and am still holding out hope that it was just a manufacturer\u2019s defect.",

It's not that easy to clean but if you use waffle makers regularly then you already know that. lol Bonus points for the little drip plate underneath that comes with the maker. It's handy.

I think a better option is to pour the batter outwards, than just in the center. I\u2019m not giving up though. It\u2019s still a good product. I just need to work with it more.

Due to this flat design, the pockets or wells often have holes which will not retain syrup. I recommend using the imaging magnifier to check the surfaces for this flat design flaw in all manufacturers, and look for a small recess where the quartering divider meets the outer batter retainer IF you want a classic waffle. Instructions should be READ FIRST, as they explain many unknown facts such as never to use cooking sprays ! They tried, but Black & Decker should stick to manufacturing tools.

I was worried after reading a couple of reviews that maybe there would be issues, but I had absolutely zero problems. I gave consideration that no matter what, you will come across at least one bad review no matter how good the product is. Since there were more good reviews than bad ones, I went for it. Glad I did.

One has to guess, EACH TIME, how much more time is needed if it is desirous of a darker waffle than the \"standard\". The grill is not forgiving of less than a full amount of batter to make a waffle. The waffle will drive the mix to a few sections and leave some sections very thin and undercooked. A positive is the lights that indicate the iron is hot and ready and a separate light to indicate when the waffle is done cooking. I have yet to determine the value of \"flipping\" the waffle.",

The flip is key as it ensures your waffles are cooked equally on both sides. Handle folds for easy storage. Considering the price, I'd say you can't go wrong with this. Just make sure to follow the directions in terms of first use as conditioning is important and you don't want to eat factory dirt with your first waffle.",
