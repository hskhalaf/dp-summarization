Lid looks to be secure but still not too tough for this 80-year-old's hands to open. Really like the recessed wheels on bottom. Some other products had wheels but they had to be attached by user and then protruded from bottom quite a bit. This unit has been well designed and I could not wait to sit down and pound this review out! Very pleased! Thanks!",

It does have a latch to lock the lid down and keep the dogs from helping themselves to a snack. Overall for the price, it is worth it.",

      "title": "Excellent Container for Pet Food",
      "text": "This bin holds slightly more than advertised, and keeps dog food fresh for a long period of time. The rollers work well and make it easy to move the bin around when it is full of food. It's easy to scoop out of and it is very sturdy. The only downside to this container is that sometimes it's a little difficult to latch. When you close it, sometimes the latch doesn't click all of the way and I find myself having to press on it to make sure it's completely airtight. Even with this, it's still a five star buy and totally worth the price!",

You really have to tug the container out practically which I did not want out of the aspect of it. I just got this item today so I cannot speak on how well it keeps the items fresh inside.",

Even though they rate this for 25 lbs...our 30lbs fit in here easily.",
