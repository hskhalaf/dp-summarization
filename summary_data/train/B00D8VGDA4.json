      "text": "First encountered this, Sahale Snacks Classic Fruit and Nut Trail Mix, on an Alaska Airlines flight. It was super delicious, so I decided to track it down when I got home. This is the same exact product, same size bag, same great taste. Purchased Oct 2019, product expiration date: Jul 10, 2020. The first ingredients are cranberries and apples (with sugar) so it is on the sweetish side, but not overly sweet. The almonds, cashews, and pistachios balance the flavor. It's very tasty. The listing did not have a photo of the ingredients panel, so I uploaded it. I also have a photo of everything that is in one bag. Tastes amazing, highly recommended!",

The lemon infused apples are very different, they taste almost like candy- the texture is like dried fruit candy- soft and chewy and they are very sweet but not too sweet. There's a lot more almonds in this than cashews, but I don't mind because cashews aren't the healthiest nuts anyway. Exp date is 2020 which is nice. I bought these for a healthy snack instead of eating chocolate or cookies, there is only 150 calories for 1/4 cup serving. All around a great product, happy I found these on amazon but a tad pricey.",

Actually very good, nice flavors, but there seems to be a lot more toasted coconut than I was expecting. I like coconut, but I would have preferred to have more nuts or blueberries. The price was reasonable and one bag is 210 calories, so they seem to make for a really good snack. Looking forward to trying other flavors.",

I wouldn't call it a trail mix; I don't think it's as salty as most trail mixes, which is refreshing. It's a little on the sugary side, so sometimes I supplement it with extra cashews, which also makes it last longer, because my family and I usually eat the entire pack the day it's delivered. We took it on a walk today, and my daughter shared some with our neighbor. When we walked away, my neighbor texted me asking what it was because she wanted more and needed to buy some for herself. It's addictive!",

It does have a lot of flavor but it is unbalanced flavor. What little sweetness remains from the teeny, tiny pieces of mango, for instance, is completely obscured by the excessive heat of spice. Rather than enhancing the flavor of the various components, the spiciness is in fact all you can taste. If that was the intent, job well done.",

The blueberries are the best bit, and the apples are also ok tho they have no real lemon flavor at all, and both are sweetened. The coconut sadly is not sweetened at all, and really has pretty much no taste! Both nuts are good quality, but have no salt to speak of!! The very few grains of salt in the mix have all stuck to the fruit, which is a bit odd mixed with the sweetness of them. I wont be buying this again!",

Cashews, almonds, pistachos, and fruit (apple and cranberry). I feel like every bite has a good amount of both nut and fruit - Salted but not overly salty. Only 3% DV sodium.",
