We are full time RV\u2019ers and when we acquire a new cooking appliance, it is a big deal because we have no room for things that aren\u2019t necessary. But, this is necessary! I have made fall-off-the-bone ribs, pot roast, steamed fish in foil, veggies, chicken and dumplings, and on and on, and the results were far superior to ny other way I have made these things!!! I love the pressure cooker, and I have used the slow cooker, and it works well, too. It sears the meat prior to cooking so that you truly have a one-pot wonder!",

We made chili last night and in 40 minutes it never actually pressurized. We spoke with customer service on the phone and still werent able to resolve. Also, there is only one setting for Browning which made it difficult to time meats vs veggies. Finally, the manual in general is a complete POS. 2 ivy leaguers couldn't make quick sense of it. And there are no online tutorials or guide. In summary, terrible product and made us think twice about ever buying Black and Decker again.",

Another thing one has to be careful is that when open the lid, make sure you wear padded glove so that you won't get burned. I love this product. I would recommend it.",

What I will say, is that steamed vegetables come out PERFECT right around 11 minutes with 1 cup of water and a little butter in there. It's also very easy to clean and reassemble.",
