The locking mechanism on the can opener (instead of the traditional squeeze shut to connect the blades to the can) is enabled by turning the knob which is also used to open the can: it first locks on to the can and then unscrews the can. It unlocks by turning the knob in the reverse direction. After a few months of use, the lock mechanism will no longer engage when turned, and the product is now nonfunctional.",

      "text": "We own an OXO Good Grips Smooth Edge Can Opener, and since it is several years old and starting to wear out, I ordered the Kuhn Rikon as an eventual replacement, and to test it out of curiosity. The Kuhn Rikon is much sharper, and does a very neat job cutting the lid. That said, I must admit that the OXO is much easier and more comfortable to operate with its big rubber grip that is offset and rotated 90 degrees. I don't think you'll go wrong buying this can opener or the OXO. At this point, though, I'd probably say the OXO wins by a nose. But we'll see how well the Kuhn Rikon wears over time.",

It quite easily separates the lid from the can with smooth edges every time. Just follow the directions and only go around the can ONCE. The other reviews on here talking about metal shavings are because they ignored this and continued to cut into the can after it was already open. You will feel when the lid releases, then just wind the handle back a quarter turn to disengage the opener. Then just use the little pincer to remove the lid. I'm never going back to a traditional opener again.",
