I used this to make a beautiful cheese, meat, and fruit plate. Our deli lady told me to freeze it for a few hours first and that worked great. It cleaned up afterward easily.

Soap stone crayon is easy to use and washes right off (just be careful not to throw it away as it's tucked into the styrofoam packing inside the slate box!). Highly recommend!",

Slate is a fragile resource so I'm not quick to point fingers at the product, seller or delivery...it's a gamble for sure haha. So a little dab of glue & some tape to temporarily secure it, wash & cover lightly in mineral oil...the fix was hardly noticeable! The little soap chalk was easily found & wrights nicely. I'm so excited for Christmas! I'll post pics when I can!",

Also, the chalk was included and had a bright piece of yellow tape on it so the company must've fixed that flaw (I noticed a lot of people saying they couldn't find the chalk.)",
