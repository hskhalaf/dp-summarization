My motorcycle compartment is very tiny so I needed something small but dependable. I\u2019ve looked for helmet locks and nothing quite fit what I was looking. This gun lock does the job perfectly. It tucks away nicely and when needed I loop through the rear peg set and the helmet. I know it\u2019s not fullproof but it\u2019s definitely better then leaving just sitting there or having to carry it everywhere.",

It can lock up pistols, semi-auto rifles, lever action rifles, and bolt-action rifles. Not only are these cheap and sturdy locks but they are also California DOJ approved. That last part really only pertains to Becerra's fantasy on how to run things in California, but hey when you're a man working for the CA DOJ I'm sure it takes a lot to get you off. But anyway I really like this product and I will recommend this to any of my buddies that are looking to stay safe with their firearms!",
