I contacted Beats technical support and we attempted to update them using the Beats updater and the updater wouldn't recognize the headphones. They attempted to walk me through the same steps for a reset with that same results. Since neither the updater or the reset worked the way that it should have, they determined that these headphones were fake. Do not buy.",
