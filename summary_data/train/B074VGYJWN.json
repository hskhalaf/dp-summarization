It looks amazing but it is the cheapest quality printer I have ever purchased, just don\u2019t touch anything or be careful when you move it around or the cheap plastic will fall apart. The setup process is comical, it is a combination of your laptop, their 2inch lcd screen and the front panel . Other than that this is a great printer. Update 10days later, the wireless stopped working, after spending 3hours with the support I finally gave up and returned this piece of junk.",

So far this thing seams great especially for such a low price.

I kept thinking it would be ok, when it worked it worked fine but I can't tell you how many hours me and my husband spent trying to make it print. The setup was easy this is just a finicky flaky printer that is very hard to make work. Tray is so flimsy it always has a error from the tray. I need to buy something good!!! FRUSTRATED!!!",

I downloaded the software, set up the wireless and installed the printer driver on my computer. All in about three steps. I didn't have to futz around trying to enter my wifi password on the printer which is always a pain. Once it was installed and connected to wifi it worked on my iPhone and iPad as well.

It comes with a disc (which I couldn't boot up) and the strangest things I've ever seen...like a flip top thin piece of plastic to access the operating panel. Or a paper tray that juts out on the front, under the flip top piece. It's too much trouble to box it all back up and tote it to UPS to return it (I really AM old), so I'll keep it for a few months and then sell it used on FB. Then I'll buy from another manufacturer!",

What's the purpose in having a wireless printer. Amazon was great with the return. I was refunded within one day. I was able to buy a non-Canon printer locally, with 24/7 tech support.",
