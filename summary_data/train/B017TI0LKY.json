I had another leather leash previously that was 7 years old. My Pit pulls and after all that time it broke. I am looking for another leather leash that is just as strong as my first one. I am going to be returning this Leatherberg leash for that reason.",

It has no strong smell, and the black color has not transferred onto my hands or clothes. The clasp is strong and stays locked in place well.
