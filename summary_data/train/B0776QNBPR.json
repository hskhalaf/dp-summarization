Accuracy of finding items has been great, it has helped me find coins, rings, and random metals. The green LED lights turn on when close to an item and vibrates - I find this very useful when item is deep gives you indication if you're getting close to it. There is also small light that is close to probe that comes in handy when metal detecting late in the day. Its really simple to use, single button.",

      "text": "After I bought a Garrett Ace 250, I started looking for pinpointers. Most were almost as much as a beginner-level, full size metal detector. So, finding this one was a lifesaver. For $50 you get a pinpointer that could easily stand up against giants like Garrett and Bounty Hunter. Not only is the price great, the quality is also outstanding. With just one 9-Volt battery, you get a flashlight, a notification sound, and vibration to help find objects on the edge of a hole. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE GUYS!",

As a disclaimer, the manufacture offers a free gift to purchasers that write a review, but in my case I would have given it five stars anyway, for in all honesty it is the best pinpointer for the money. It also comes in very handy for locating studs in walls to hang pictures, so it has more uses than just detecting. Sincerely, Ossie Weinert",

Poke around with a pointy object and voila, you've found the thing in about 20 seconds. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 only because the thing gives the occasional false alarm.",

Did a test run with it and it was very useful in finding where to dig when using the metal detector. Seemed well made, basic, held up to being run through the dirt. Would have liked clearer instructions as it had a tendency to go off in mid air and when pressed into the ground, but i would assume these are calibration errors. Came with a nice bag and holster as well. My mom says this would work great for ghost hunters.",

It literally is a pin pointer, it gets you on the item quickly once in the hole (sometimes even through dirt before digging once you have a location with your main detector). After you dig a little this also helps you find the item in the dirt you removed quickly to keep you from digging more than you need to. I am glad I bought it every time I use it, time is precious and this thing saves it!",
