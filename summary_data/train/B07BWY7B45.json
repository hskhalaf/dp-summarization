Once the existing algae was removed and I started using this ionizer, I have had no new algae growth and I am using less chlorine for sure. I highly recommend this product.

    "description": "Original Solar Powered Pool Ionizer. Requires less Chlorine in your pool and Prevents and Kills Algae. We have an industry leading lifetime replacement warranty - see below for details. Other products offer an extended warranty, but charge extra for it.\n\nDetails\n\nThis automatic pool cleaner uses solar technology to produce electrical current, needed to ionize copper electrodes. The copper ions help govern the growth of algae and other microorganisms. The unit floats in the pool and produces copper ions, while being exposed to sunlight. Within about a week, the product efficiently regulates copper ion level for pool water.\n\nThis product makes maintenance incredibly easy, cutting back on time, energy, and money. It is important to note that your pool will still need chlorine and chemicals, but the amount needed is much less than without use of this pool cleaner for in ground and above ground pools. The copper electrode will last for approximately two years.\n\nDepending on the size of pool, you will save anywhere from 250.00 - 750.00 per year in chemicals.\n\nVisit us online (details on package) for detailed instructions. With our lifetime replacement warranty, if your unit is ever broken or stops working, we will replace it for free for the first year and only 50% of sales price after that. Be sure to register the product online within 30 days and you'll automatically receive a 50% discount for copper anode replacement kit.\n\nOutstanding 24/7 Customer Service\n\nFollow the instructions on the package to contact us or simply text 247SUPPORT to 474747.\n\n If you have a larger pool over 35K gallons, you can buy our newest model CopperFlo Solar Pool Ionizer by searching by ASIN: B07V9P7XRN. It is a high capacity Solar Pool Ionizer and also comes with the same lifetime replacement warranty.",
