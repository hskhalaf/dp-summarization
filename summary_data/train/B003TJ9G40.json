Indeed that MIGHT be an issue, but I still prefer the lightweight aluminum and it certainly looks and feels very strong in that area. I'll simply stop prying if it gets so hard that I think there might be a breakage possibility.",

The angle helps seeing where you have to go into the ground. The handle is very comfortable. One solid piece below the handle makes it strong. One piece of advice - easier to get the entire weed with root up if the soil is wet (i.e.., after it rains). Highly recommend. I even bought 2.",

I did not have any dandelions to use it on and I can see where it would work much better than pulling dandelions! It simply isn't what I need for my type of weeding. I might as well use the weeder with a V shaped head like this that I have on a long handle....much easier.",
