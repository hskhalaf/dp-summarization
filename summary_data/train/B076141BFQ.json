One aspect of the instruction sheet could be upgraded. The section that describes moving the bearing in and out of the tube air path is a little confusing. We figured it out, and it works great, to plug and unplug the air line to prevent leakage, but it took us a little time. Thank you for providing a high quality product! Best regards, Dennis",
