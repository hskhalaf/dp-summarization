I have insanely oily hair after a day without washing and in day 3 this really did make my hair feel like I had just washed it. 10 stars my friends!",

This has been the only dry shampoo that doesn't leave any type of white residue on your hair and it doesn't weigh your hair down. It has a very pleasant scent to it, it gets rid of the oiliness I get and actually gives my hair some bounce and volume without stickiness/tackiness. This is by far the best dry shampoo I've tried. I'll be sticking with this brand.",

I do notice it leaves a little white residue, but once I brush it through, you can hardly see it. I highly recommend it.",
