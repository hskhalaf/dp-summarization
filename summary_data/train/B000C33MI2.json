The particulates in the oil sample were <0.1 percent and at the limit of the measuring equipment. Comment from Blackstone apart from being astonished at the condition of the motor as indicated by the oil was that the filter was doing an outstanding job. Hat tip to Fram, you get what you pay for, buy Fram top of the line and skip the $5 junk sold by this and other manufacturers. This filter has synthetic media, silicone anti drain back and easy grip cap. Sold all day long for $8 at WalMart.",

I ran this one out as my old 10K OCI's were showing I was throwing out perfectly good filters. This is overkill but shows you even with conventional oil these are the best filters on the market.",

      "text": "From what I can tell as a shade tree mechanic who has changed oil in a variety of vehicles for 50+ years, the Fram Ultra Synthetic is a top-of-the-line oil filter that compares favorably to other top brands. Appears to be very well made and has a quality silicon anti-drain back valve and filtering media designed for long-life synthetic oils. The SureGrip is a nice feature that may assist with removal, especially if access is tight. As to its claimed life of 15,000 miles, I'll never push things that far because good engine protection demands more frequent oil changes - even with synthetic oil and a quality filter changes in the 6,000 to 7,000 mile range are good insurance.",

Hopefully the next time I need to remove the filter, it will be easier than the OEM installed filter. The latter is torqued on so much and has no grip to unscrew the filter.
