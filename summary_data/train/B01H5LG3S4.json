Adjustable speed control on the handle and select from the bagger or mulching options. I bagged grass for 2-3 weeks before trying the mulcher and it works fantastic! Electric key is another great feature for this machine. This model also has the larger GCV 190 engine which means plenty of power to get you through the thickest grass.",

I'll try to sharpen the blade I guess, but you really shouldn't have to do that with a brand new lawnmower. Also, emptying the bag is a PITA. To fit it in the big brown recycle bags I have to take the frame out first. For the money, I really expected better.",

If youtake the bag off the air pressure is not strong enough to shoot it out so it just clogs the outlet shoot. Had Honda Service the machine and replace the chute and they say that's just the way it works... Or rather the way that it doesn't work. Terrible R&D and design on your part Honda. A ton of money wasted.",

Its a little too fast though,I have mine set to the slowest speed and its almost too fast to keep up with,other than that its a perfect mower.",

After one mow I\u2019ve already scuffed up the sides pretty bad mowing close to a block wall. I ordered the protective guards instantly at around $21 shipped. I just feel with mower north $700 before taxes the guards should be standard equipment out the box. The balance is off with a full bag of clippings. The mower will wheelie. That can kinda be dangerous in the right scenario so be sure to empty the bag frequently.",
