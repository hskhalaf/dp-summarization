In almost all games today the left and right trigger buttons are extremely important to have them not built properly. I contacted the seller about this and they told me it was normal.

Occasionally, putting pressure on the controller or jostling it the wrong way can cause phantom Start/Select inputs, which I can only assume is because of a lack of padding between the board and controller shell.

      "text": "The controller feels well-made and looks good. It works immediately upon plugging into a windows 10 machine, which is nice. However, the inputs randomly cut out for 0.5-2 seconds at a time every 30 seconds or less. This makes any game unplayable and so it's a really useless controller. This happens on steam both in regular and big picture mode across games. Another user ran into issues and found drivers for the controller on a completely Chinese site - these drivers were not provided with the controller. They didn't fix my issue however. I'm not sure how this controller is rated so highly and am suspicious of how genuine these other reviews are.",

Thankfully, I've remedied that by placing a small sticker over it. It wasn't enough of an issue for me to dock a star though.",

The shoulder buttons are pressure sensitive also which was unexpected. This is a great value for a budget controller and will by a couple more. Only downside is that the direction pad. When pressing left or right, it will press up by accident. It's a real hassle when playing games that rely on it, like fighting games.",

Overall the controller isn't bad per say, but I would recommend a different one. I have a Xbox one controller with a USB adapter that is more comfortable and more satisfying and also is apparently more durable. I recommend checking that one out for a little bit more money.",

In other words, if you squeeze too hard while playing a game for a long period of time, you will end up sending multiple commands and doing weird things in-game. Other than intended. Oh, also don't bother using the vibration option, it shakes the unit and causes the same thing to happen.",
