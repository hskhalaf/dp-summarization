Thin and easy to travel with. Just downloaded the Arc app for my Surface and it worked immediately. Virtually no delay in connecting when I wake up the Surface and \"arc\" the mouse (turn it on). And I shopped Amazon Warehouse deals; the box was a bit hammered but saved over 50%, and the unit was fine; haven't had any issues.",

Clean, smooth, responsive, easy to install, and rarely looses connection, though it can sometimes be slow to connect/reconnect following sleep/hibernate modes.",

I normally would mark it down for this, but the app restored the 5th star due to its reverse scolling feature, so now the mouse scroll works like my touch pad (and old macs) and the tablet swipes.

Overall: would not recommend. I find that using the trackpad on the SP4 keyboard cover works much much better",

The strip in the middle is useful for scrolling.

This is important because I have very luggage space when traveling (one carry-on bag when flying, two small saddle bags on my motorcycle). That said the product is bluetooth and paired with no difficulty. It works smoothly on any surface I have tried it on. I would recommend this product to others. I've only had it a short time, so I will post an update if required.",

This way, I can still have a mouse attached if I need to use it to bring up a website, etc... during a presentation. Great product.

All the basic functions you need in a mouse and comfortable in the hand.",
