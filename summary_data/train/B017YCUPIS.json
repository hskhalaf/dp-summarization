Looks sporty with a removable visor and the airflow is great as well. After searching and finding helmets for $80+ the reviews on this one are great and so is the price for the impact rating. Customer service is also A+. I highly recommend this product for anyone and especially if you have suffered a head injury. Worth the money.",
