        "decent battery life",
        "displays Word and PDF files (with zoom), shows most image files, and plays MP3 and AAC audio",

It is easy to carry and I spend a lot of time sitting in doctors waiting rooms and it makes the waiting easier. It would also be nice if it had share capabilities.
