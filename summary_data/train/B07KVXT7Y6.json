Looking for more such electronic products that I could gift him. I would definitely recommend it.",

I wish it would not go offline and not show last location. It needs a lot of debugging and wish it could have software updates... Pros it may beep sometimes to find if you are within range and it feels like it wants to be found. The app also DEMANDS you have location services on all the time (so your phone battery may drain) and have to send you notifications, albeit these are something unrelated about the finders location or something relatively important. Keep trying I guess.",
