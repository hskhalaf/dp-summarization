The plastic rollers cannot handle the friction of normal use. See the attached photo and the log which shows all use from Day 1. I weigh 185 pounds, well below the weight limit, and I averaged less than 20 minutes a day. $200 for 17 days is $4294 annually; a professional-grade machine will cost half of that and endure years of punishment.

It takes a little getting used to, because it makes big use of the hamstrings, but once you acclimate them to the workout, you'll feel more vigorous after doing the Maxi-Climber than anything else.

I sweat all over it though, so it's to be expected. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with the climber. I'm a much happier person than I used to be.

I'm returning mines,I didn't feel much of a workout to me it felt like walking, I even use a heart rate monitor to measure my heart heart to see how much aerobic activity, (I used the fit band) my heart rate stayed within the range that I usually achieve with walking. I'm not even in shape (5'5 180 gal). I no longer want to keep it. Maybe I'll buy a elliptical where I can change the resistance instead and get a more intense workout.",
