And forget using it as a destination for Windows backup. The WD2GO \"private cloud\" concept is marketing hype. You need to supply the router admin password everytime you link to the router. Really? And the performance is terrible. The Android W2DGO app does work though. Indeed, it actually works quite well. Why WD can't get the Windows WD2GO app to work as well is beyond me.",

I like the ability to generate personal pass codes for all ands and profiles. However the set up of the backup storage is harder, and ability to do backup on Microsoft outlook very painful. The dual band shows up on the wireless link but is useless over distances of more than 50 feet. In adjacent rooms it does not work hence video streaming will not work as suggested. Range limitation reduces the effectiveness of the dual band promise.",
