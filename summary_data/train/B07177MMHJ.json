While it's perhaps safer & easier to install by attaching glass globe last after making electrical connections, for some it might be better to test installing glass globe on the ground first.",

The in-fashion clear fixtures have too much glare for me. Pros: 1) Easy to install. 2) Quality construction, no defects. 3) Simple and functional design. Cons: 1) Screws on fixture can be challenging to remove to change light bulb. One needs a very short screwdriver. 2) The bulb needs to be higher wattage because of the frosted diffusion of light.",
