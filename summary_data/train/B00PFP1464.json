There have been times where he just doesn't want to be in his stroller when we are out, so I always bring the sling with us. I tried a wrap with my first son, and it was just too much material to be convenient anywhere outside of our house. I also had C sections, and I found that a sling is much more comfortable than the wrap was. I like the material of this wrap, it's lightweight yet not at all flimsy. I wish I had this with my first and second children, it's really a nice product.",

If you get one of these, the fabric is kind of thick, but very pliable and comfortable. Get one that has color coated sides, when you try to tighten this thing it is hard to be able to tell which end is top and which is bottom because they are the same color.",
