      "text": "I got this at a 1 day sale with rebates and customer coupons for a song. I basically unpacked the box, plugged it into my existing wired network, plugged in the slim power adapter into the 110 volt wall outlet, and in about 1 minute, my existing 2 wireless PCs reconfigured their proxy settings (running Win2000ProSp3 and WinXPProSP2) and both were able to use Internet Explorer and Outlook email with very fast downloads. Netgear supplies a slim zippered padded case that fits the router, power adapter, and all the supplied cables. Throw it into your PC case or your shoulder bag and be ready to go online wirelessly wherever a wired Ethernet port is found while traveling.",

Not cheap.",

    "description": "Have you ever felt like using a wired Ethernet connection in your hotel room was not much fun? Was the desk or chair uncomfortable, and sitting on the bed or soft chair preferable while accessing the Internet wirelessly? Have you ever wished to have convenient wireless access for a group of people in a conference room? NETGEAR has the perfect solution for your wireless Internet access needs away from home. The WGR101 54 Mbps Wireless Travel Router is as small as a deck of cards, yet provides 54 Mbps wireless Internet access as well as routing functionality and security. Use an external switch to select configuration, or to enable either single or multi-user access. A convenient carrying case is included in which to carry the traveler's router along with other essentials.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer Untethered wireless connectivity in your hotel room can be critical to your productivity(and sanity) as a mobile professional. Conference or hotel rooms with only one Ethernet port are no longer a problem because now you can bring convenient wireless networking with you. Netgear's 54 Mbps Wireless Travel Router is lightweight and compact, and it provides both single and multiple users wireless access without any need for a direct cable connection to the network. Expertly designed and protected with Double Firewall security, this portable high-speed travel router is your best insurance for wireless access wherever you go.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee a detailed diagram of how the Netgear WGR101 Cable/DSL Wireless Travel Router works. Turns your hotel room into a hotspot so as you travel you can count on peace, privacy, and wireless connectivity while you work. No larger than a deck of cards, the travel router is compact and convenient to carry while traveling, with an internal antenna so there's nothing to bend or break during packing. It comes with a small-scale power adapter and an attractive carrying case with extra compartments for other essentials. \n\nDelivering up to 5 times the speed of 802.11b networks, the 54 Mbps Wireless Travel Router creates a wireless network from an Internet connection in a hotel room or conference room. Works with both 802.11g and 802.11b devices. \n\nAn external switch lets you select between single-user, multiple-user, and configuration mode. In single-user mode, next door guests cannot access your wireless network. Multiple-user mode allows more than one person to simultaneously share one Internet connection.\n\nComplete security with Double Firewall Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI) and Network Address Translation (NAT) protects against malicious hackers. Supports IPSec and PPTP pass-through for Virtual Private Network (VPN) and 64- or 128-bit Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption for maximum security, plus wireless SSID broadcast on-off capability as an added safeguard.\n\nSee more",
