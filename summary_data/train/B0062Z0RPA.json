After using the wire pin brush to get the layers straightened, the Furminator is good for working all that loose coat out.

So when I saw this FURminator and that it has longer teeth I thought this might just work. That was a huge understatement as it works amazingly. If you have a pooch that has longer hair/fur then you NEED this Furminator straight away. It will save you a little bit of sanity during shedding season.",

Surprising affordable (I want to say I paid around $7-8 for this one) compared to the other style Furminator that I paid $40 for (but worlds great on her shorter fur/ main coat.) Recommend for long fur, especially when very thick.",
