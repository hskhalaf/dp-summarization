I love this product for everything that it boasts, unique design, powerful motor, easy-carry handle, dome ice shaper! I totally recommend Snowie products, and I love all the information provided by Snowie on Youtube and the website; it makes me feel there's help available if needed. Sincerely, Lorrie, S.A. Texas",

It DOES what the company claims, but what you don't know initially is that it's loud when shaving the ice, but I love the desserts it makes with the ice so I will take the good with the noise.",

Just wipe it! Hope it lasts because the kids from the block all want snow cones now so we use it so much almost every day.",

Once syrup applied, the snowball did not melt quickly. A perfect treat for these hot summer days.",

The only reason I give 4 vs 5 stars is because I can\u2019t seem to find a cup to use with it that prevents ice from falling all over the counter when making them. Perhaps it should come with cups or maybe the design should be tweaked slightly to reduce this issue.",

The newer version of that machine wasn't as good. it was a much cheaper machine that produced small pieces even though it was a shaver. So I balked at this more expensive product.
