The only drawback to this item was that it may not be compatible with the current doorbell wiring at your house. I was on the verge of returning this product. However, after doing a lot of research, I came across the ELK TRG2440 24VAC, 40 VA AC Transformer with PTC fuse and it did the trick with getting this installed. I wish I had known about this a tad bit earlier so that I did not waste all of my time trying to install it before getting the transformer!",

Instructions are easy to follow for installation ... be sure to download the Ring Video app on your smart device as part of your set up. Product comes with 3 different doorbell cover colors to help match the exterior of your home. Device is small enough that it doesn't look too obtrusive by your front door. HD video quality is impressive ... a very solid product.",

The \"Ring\" let me know to check my NVR if I wanted to see a particular video. 4. One year after end of warranty, the unit no longer connects to wifi.

Just got back from thanksgiving with family, realized a package was stolen and can\u2019t view any history without forking over more money. Thanks for nothing ring!!!",

      "text": "My Ring Doorbell pro worked great for 14 months.. Of course 2 months after the warranty is up, my doorbell shuts itself off daily after 5:00 PM. I have to do a hard reset by holding the little side button in for 30 seconds to get it to come back. Stays on until right after 5 PM daily and then just shuts off. Tech support has no idea why. Can't send it in for repair but they offer me a 35% discount on a new one, which they never sent me by the way. Update..tech support realized what an odd situation this was an are sending me a replacement.",
