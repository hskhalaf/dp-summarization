The keyboard is really easy to get used to and the big trackpad makes interacting with the device much more pleasing. One of the most underrated features of the 2018 model over the 2017 has got to be the True Tone screen: the auto white balance makes the screen easier on the eyes while creating a natural looking image despite the varying color temperature. If you want a portable Mac, this is as good as it gets. It is thin, fast and a joy to use.",

I wanted a 15 inch laptop that was NOT widescreen because I use it for writing documents not watching movies. There's so little choice out there. The obvious competitor is Microsoft's Surface Book 2. But that's about the same price and has a detachable screen I don't need. Plus I can run Windows easily on this if I want. Some people hate the keyboard. I don't find it bad at all. Apple got my money again. It's a lovely piece of kit. Rats... caught again.",

However, this did cost near \u00a33200, so is NOT cheap- and I've already had to spend \u00a340 on an adaptor just so I can import photos from an SD card- it only has thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports.
