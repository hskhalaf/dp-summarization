Set the bubbler to the side and rigged up my own to avoid any explosions \ud83c\udf0b\ud83d\ude01 the capper, bottle cleaner and bucket and sanitizer were and will be helpful later on. You could prob get away with just buying the things separately as you find you need them which I\u2019m doing anyways but it\u2019s a good easy start. I brewed beer so maybe you use more of the stuff for wine. We will see and update review. Good starter kit though. 4* for now",

Sometimes it's put too low and knocks against a flat surface, other times it's too high and you have to tip the buck a lot to get all your brew dispensed. This has not been an issue. The bottle capper has finally broke but this has been after 3 years of use. The carboy is a great quality. Dropped it a few times without it breaking. If you get this for your first kit, it does not come with a handle or harness for the carboy so make sure to get that too.",

I'm not a big fan of aging my beer on better bottles, so the glass carboy as a secondary fermenter is ideal for me, also the ease of the plastic bottle when handling the wort is great.",
