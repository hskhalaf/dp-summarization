      "text": "really love the camera, but my TS3 bit the dust from being in water which is bad for a waterproof camera. I used to keep it in the water for several hours before it died. I didn't do that with this one to avoid that but lost this camera a few months ago after having for about a year. Panasonic recommends yearly change of the seals to maintain waterproof which is cost prohibitive and hard to do for us country livers... that's my only complaint as many have lost these cameras from using them in the water. I replaced with a TS5 when I lost my TS4 so I do really like the camera otherwise",

While my son didn't wish me to post a negative commend, I felt obligated to do so. Panasonic should be obligated to refund my purchase price.",

Additionally, it offers an option called \"iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode\" which does not work properly on many times. Until now I always used sony cameras, and this time, I tried to try another brand, obtaining results far from the quality of photos you've always wanted. I have not had the opportunity to test the underwater camera, however, do not expect very good results based on the experience I've had until now.",

It has MANY features that will take some time to get used to. I mainly purchased this camera for water use. I have yet to submerge it under water and will update my review once I do.

I've used the TS4 for a while now and find it much better than the Olympus and really like the GPS, compass, altimeter features an added benefit. Have not had the opportunity to try it out underwater yet but like the added depth this model provides versus the Olympus.",

The temp change cause fogging and even enough condensation to eventually mess up the camera. But I did use this camera probably 5 times a week for a year - half in the Caribbean and half in San Francisco Bay. That camera is now my back up as the one I just purchased has a three year warranty. If you only use this camera for occasional vacations it should last for years.",

After a week in Hawaii, this little camera exceeded my expectations. The video quality was great, all of the picture turned out nice as well. The menu is easy to navigate and it even has manual settings (which I love because I normally shoot with a canon 5d markii). I fell while getting out of the water and landed on sharp lava rocks, the camera broke my fall. It got a few scratches but nothing major, I am impressed with not only the quality but the durability of this camera as well.",

If you are going to buy any underwater camera my advice is to use it right away so if it becomes inoperable you can return it within the 30 day window.
