The product lists the old version which is what I was hoping to recieve when I ordered a case. Misleading thinking I\u2019m getting a healthy honey sweetened treat when they add sugar and glucose now. Gross. Such a let down, I had already subscribed to them months and will have to cancel now. I hope the company will refund me. Update** I reached out to company Nov 13 2 days ago still not heardback",
