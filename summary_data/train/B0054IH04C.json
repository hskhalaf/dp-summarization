Also going to put IPhone 6 there as I go about my day in Prague. A very good product for a woman for traveling solo. Will put my mind at ease if I sleep on plane or as I enjoy my vacation",

      "text": "I was very excited to find this travel money belt. I loved the two pockets, the lightweight fabric and the comfort when wearing it. I wanted something to conveniently and safely hold my cash, cards and passport and this fit all three easily. What I didn't expect was for the seam in the bottom pocket to fall apart on my first trip using it. Thankfully I didn't have anything in that pocket at the time or else it could have fallen out as easily as the business card shown in my picture. I'll sew it to repair the seam but definitely am annoyed that I have to go to the trouble so soon after buying it.",

I felt carrying the belt a little bit more on the left side was the best spot for me.

It can fit a passport, credit cards, smart phones, etc. Though, if you pack in too much stuff, it kind of defeats the purpose. I usually keep the bare essentials (passport and emergency credit card) for getting home in the event I were to lose everything else. It's an all-around solid choice for backpackers.

It lays very flat and has 2 zippered pockets, more than enough room for your passport, credit cards, and Euros or what ever currency you will be using. It is adjustable so it will fit anyone. The only thing I will say is that the color is more of a beige than rose but it doesn't show anyway so it doesn't matter.",
