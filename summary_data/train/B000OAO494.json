Nintendo memory expansion pak expirience: inatially i wanted the ds lite version memory expansion pak but got the ds original memory pak(fits a little big on my ds lite but it works perfectly nintendo ds browser works porfectly with my nintendo ds lite) Experience with the nintendo ds browser: The web pages runs slower but you cant expect much from the ds original or ds lite it also doesnt sport flash player but its not that important, however for reading web pages and seeing pictures is pretty decent and plus pages and pictures shows up very colorful. Thank nintendo and opera for releasing web browsing for our nintendo ds",

They've created an interface that works quite well for the device, and that's what you need. (This is especially great for traveling, as then, if worse comes to worst, you can always play Pokemon during your two hour layover, time sitting during the rainforest's enthusiastic daily rain that made you reluctant to bring your laptop, etc.)",

I switched my nytimes subscription to weekends only, and just read the weekday news on the ds now. Unfortunately that's about the limit of this device's usefulness. It's simply not practical for regular web surfing or reading link-ridden blogs.",

Ebuddy is the only one that runs fast. But if you have time on you hands and want to wait for the loading this is the game for you. I Love this game. I hope this Helped.

Using the stylus is neat for clicking on links, and the touch screen keyboard that pops up for use when you need to enter information works well too.
