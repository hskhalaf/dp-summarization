New Balance raises the medial side a bit higher than the lateral side so the overpronator rolls towards the elevated part of the shoe to curb overpronation. It has superior comfort and breathability. The Fresh Foam Vongo is one of New Balance\u2019s best lightweight trainers.",

        "Shoe breathability is afforded by a very breathable mesh and a perforated midfoot saddle",
