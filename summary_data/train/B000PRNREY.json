Simply moving it caused the light to flicker, and my bedroom now smells of electrical smoke. Looks nice, but I don't think I'll be purchasing Adesso from now on. And we'll be avoiding paper shades that don't have much breathing room from bulbs if we can help it.",

I have bought flimsy lamps from ikea and this lamp for the price is a great buy. Highly recommended for those seeking a modern/contemporary touch.",

In some pictures of this lamp the shade looks square, but it's actually round. Although it's kind of nice, and fills the spot I needed light for, I think in retrospect the price is pretty high for what you get.",
