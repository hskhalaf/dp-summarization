As the description says it is water proof I risked my phone in a tub of water for this review. Another it works with prepaid services I'm using AT&T and it requires a Micro Sim card also can use extended storage. This box also came with Sony brand headphones WITH adapter",

The 19 pixel rear camera is as good as anyone would expect from Sony; and I look forward to trying out some of its many special effects and features. I'd like it if Sony could pare off a few grams of weight without compromising any of the phone's deluxe features--otherwise, I can't think of any complaints.",

I've talked to Samsung owners and many have the same problem with location it's really a matter of gettinrg use to it. I think it took the first half of a day to hit it every time. No issues. There are a lot of updates lol. But a great phone at a great price upgrading from the ultra1. This phone plays games fast with no lag. Multi-task ability is great as far as I'm concerned. We'll worth the buy!",

It's so slick, I constantly dropped it because it just slipped out of my hand or slipped off whatever surface I put it on. If the surface wasn't flat, even the slightest slope would cause it to eventually slip off and fall to the ground. But i don't worry about it too much, since I always put a case on it anyways, which stops the slipping. The battery life lasts forever. If I leave it sitting on the counter doing nothing, it can last 3-4 days on a single charge. As for the OS and features, it's very similar to any other android phone.",
