I have 2 major issues and the response from BLU in the US was a copy/paste email on how to hard reset it, losing all data & apps. Real helpful! I've just finished a chat session with Amazon Tech and they had the same suggestion. Real helpful again! The phone was fine until a week ago, now it simply won't sync email, texts or Whatsapp unless it's rebooted time after time after time, every day. The Amazon service is beyond disappointing and I can only advise anyone thinking about buying this to be VERY careful.",

The battery is great also, lasting the entire day with playing music, Bluetooth and YouTube for at least 8 hours. Brilliant. Thanks. Ian M.",

It started slowing down, then kept losing the wifi connection, started turning itself off and rebooting for no apparent reason. Then swelled up blowing the back side clips off and the screen bulged forward. It is only the phone case holding it together. When fully functional this is a good phone. Sadly it started going wrong within a year. Being an online purchase, there is no go to support for help at a high street store, so sadly this phone is destined for the bin. I won't be using BLU again.",

In all honesty it has absolutely blown away my expectations with an amazing camera, battery life (lasts all day from early morning til midnight when playing music and games consistently) and is a really good budget smartphone that I'm enjoying alot.",

It had more storage than my previous phone so I have had no problems with installing apps. Battery lasts quite well - probably 2 days if I used it sparingly although I charge it daily.

The only way to get it working again is turn it off/on again, which can only take a second or two, but frustrating if you have security features set up (pin, face recognition, finger print etc). This happens in the middle of all apps, so writing a text, email becomes painful. This happens over 10 times a day, which takes away from what otherwise has been a good phone brought as a cheap replacement for my previous one. Camera is very average, but then for just over a \u00a3100 can you complain?",
