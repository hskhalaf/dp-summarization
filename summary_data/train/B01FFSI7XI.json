My skin is really sensetive so have to use an aftershave balm afterwards, but other than that no problems what so ever. It shaves to about 1-2 days post shave and the process is smooth. I have recommended as a gift to many people and everyone seems to love it so far.",

This device, however, is different. Mechanically it is the same as a beard trimmer, with two toothed blades, one of which has a lateral oscillation to cut the hair. The difference is the blades are much thinner than on a beard trimmer which gives a much closer shave. The result is a shave that looks almost, but not quite, as close as a razor. And with no rash. Essentially its the best compromise between closeness and irritability I've found to date.",

      "text": "I've tried are around 6 different stubble trimmers over the past 12 years and this is the only one that works. You also don't have to force it into your face to trim your hair. The 3mm trimmer is the best, the bare blade for the side and bottom of your neck is brilliant. Baby soft skin, no rashes and no ingrown hairs! It also works great on body hair trimming / shaving. All round a great product, I'll have this for the rest of my life",

(I need a shaver for work), As i have to shave a lot with sensitive skin, i wey shave in an evening and dry in a morning. Doesn't matter how much i spend, all shavers i have tried have never given me a pain free shave. Unfortunatly :( This PhilipsOneblade has given me the best shave so far in a morning. Its comfy to hold and use. I would recommend as i have spent over a \u00a3150 before for the same shave.",
