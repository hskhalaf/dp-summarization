When it arrived I was disappointed because the light is covered in black dots as other reviewers have mentioned and shown photos of. However, we quickly realized that the light is bright enough to show through multiple layers of paper, so now we use it with a white sheet of paper and it works great. In the picture I attached, it\u2019s on the dimmest of 3 brightness settings. We can even put an X-ray on the blank paper and then cover the X-ray with yet another sheet of paper for tracing the shape of the bones!",

The light levels are really going to be helpful... and I can use it for calligraphy, and other artsy things I do where I need a bit more light or want to back light a grid.

I\u2019ve seen many other light pads but decided to choose this one due to the fact that when you press the button again and again it goes brighter which is really good for my eyes! So far it\u2019s been working very well. Came in so quick, I didn\u2019t realize it was so thin, Ives used it twice already for tracing my patterns and it\u2019s so easy instead of holding up to the window.",

I was unaware that the light source was not homogeneous but, discontinuous - sort of linear row pixelated. Placing the the tracing paper that came with the device on the platen did not provide any improvement but copy paper did. The colors are not true when scanning but I intend to try other scattering media - maybe opal glass will work. I am quite satisfied - can be used for many other illumination uses. If nothing else the grand kids can use it for tracing. May purchase another (maybe larger) just for them.",

Cons: -I don't really have any cons. I do get nervous about it cracking if i do anything wrong because of it's slim size, but i would say overall, that is a positive feature.",
