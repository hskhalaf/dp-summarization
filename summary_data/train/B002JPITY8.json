It's a shame that Microsoft just couldn't get the recipe tuned enough for a broader market. The device is still snappy and the UI is slick, the drive size is plenty for my kids' music and movies, it's just unfortunate there is no longer any more support.",

My 1st zune was returned with display fault - a gray/black line across the screen but Amazons return policy quickly replaced it. The zune seems to be \"the business\" rather than a trendy toy. Wireless connection works well and the occasional internet use is useful. I don't need video or apps but some photo portability is nice. Easy to use - I haven't read the instruction book at all. I had to get an in-car charger and audio cable to complete the portability. Very happy with my choice.",

You cant watch videos online with it. Not a huge deal since its a fraction of the cost of an Ipod touch but still just a little more effort and this would have been an amazing device, as is...Well Im glad I bought it but next time ill save up and get the Ipod.",

By far the Zune is an excellent product and with the large 32GB, I can place many genres of music on it and even watch movies. I absolutely love the ease of WIFI connects and with the optional docking station, I have set it up so that if automatically syncs with my music files and automatically update my music files. With the added feature of HD radio, that makes this an item that is well worth the money and the convenience of having your Music and Videos too!",

I would be lying if I said apps don't matter. While they don't matter to me. They do matter to the vast majority of consumers. The only reason I can think of as to why MS didn't release an SDK was because the Zune HD came out before Windows Phone 7. If they had released and SDK the Zune HD would not only be competing against iOS but also WP7 for developers. Overall it's quality device.",

Only reason for 4 stars is that there is not software to use on Mac where all music is stored, have to use emulation software to access. Beautiful screen with excellent UI. Replay of video is also beautiful and thanks to large capacity can carry several at a time. Compact size, charges fast, accessories may not be easy to find in stores but probably cheaper thru Amazon anyway. Have not used radio yet but this can only be a plus.",

Gives artist information on demand without disrupting music play, allows applications and games to be played, though limited selection available on the marketplace.
