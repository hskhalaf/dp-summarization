The FSA headset is good stuff but not the one seller claims. I should have known by the price.I was wrong, just went to fsa website and this is the big pig. There is another called the big fat pig, maybe that's where amazon got the picture. The pig graphic isn't on the big pig. Also MSRP is $27.99 so price is actually good for this exact model.",
