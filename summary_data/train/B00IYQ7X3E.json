The large size is perfect for dog walks as it covers me and my two little Shetland sheepdogs. It didn't take them long to figure that out! The fabric is a nice substantial weight, the pole and slider are solid and it operates smoothly. I like the vented top as it makes it easier to control this big umbrella in windy conditions. The bright red color makes us highly visible when we're by the road as well. What more can one expect from an umbrella?",

This umbrella did not break, blow inside out, or otherwise fail. Not even one broken rib. It is also a decent size. More than enough for one person and just big enough for two people standing still (like during the above-mentioned storm when my spouse and I were watching one of our kids play a soccer game). And the storm was so strong the called off the soccer game at half time!",

The top is vented and will withstand minor to moderate updrafts without even starting to flip. However, any umbrella will flip in the strongest of winds, but this one won't be damaged by that, like the cheap ones with cheap metal frames will be.",

The umbrella opened smoothly at the press of the button and it also came with a matching umbrella cover, which I had no problem using. I haven't had a chance to practically use it in the outdoor elements but from looking at its build-quality, I don't suspect any reason for it to fail.
