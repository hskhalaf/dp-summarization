Very heavy and heavily built, essentially a huge sheet of metal with rolled up edges. I don't use the belt it came with but use \"Speed Harness Vest w/ 9' Pull Strap by CCS,...\" that does great. Although I have not used the ones with tubes, I think this should be better, especially when going through rougher terrain. I also have not started using extra weight on it as it is heavy enough, but will soon.",

I was originally looking at a Rogue sled, but saw this as an alternative a good bit cheaper. There were no reviews when I purchased it, I'm glad I got it. It's built like a tank and works great. The tow straps that come with it are just general tow straps. Don't expect much from them, but they work for what you need.",
