No. Shut off the water at the nozzle, find the kink(s), try to straighten, or \"flip\" them to get the water flowing. This make the watering of pots and plants, in a 30x30 area, a much longer task than needed. I don't think I received a damaged item, just one that doesn't do the job promised.

Apparently, they no longer make their hoses with Brass Fittings, which when purchased in 1992 cost $98.00 each from Lowes. Now they make the fittings out of Aluminum. Do not know about fitting durability. What a shame, I would pay that price again for the same service life.",

Yes, but not too badly, although it would be less of an issue if the hose didn't have so much \"memory\" (which hopefully will lessen over time). The biggest issue is the aluminum fittings. They seem well molded, and at least mine were not sharp. But compared to brass, they scratch incredibly easily on stone, cement, brick, etc., so I do question their durability.

When you unpack the hose there are kinks of some sort because of the bands and packaging. Up coil the hose on the lawn, connect to faucet and fill with water in sun for a hour or so to remove kinks and memory. Never leave a hose under pressure in hot sun for long periods. The sun will soften the rubber and cause bursting under pressure. Common sense people",
