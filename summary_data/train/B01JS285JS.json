They recommend installing it between 5.5ft - 6.5ft, but mine is installed much higher, closer to 10ft and works fine. I would prefer to leave it on setting 1, which makes it stay on full brightness until the battery is depleted but I heard even on a full charge it will go out within 5 hours or so. So I leave it on setting #2, which is dim mode and full brightness upon detecting motion at night.",

I worry what will happen with repeated freeze-thaw cycles given brittleness of plastic. That said, they would make nice lights for a pergola or a fence.

If you disassemble these lights they have really well designed gaskets, except for one critical flaw. The switch on the back is pretty much wide open with no seal, so water can slowly seep in through here. I've had these in use for about two years and two of four are dead as a result. To be fair this is in WA where it rains a lot, but I think the switch should have a flap or cover over it.

The specs on this like looked ideal for my needs and, indeed, does seem to meet my needs very well. There is easy one screw mounting - I did replace the steel screw with a stainless steel one, the motion detection works well and the light is very bright; especially for the very few times I need it to operate. I've had it about a week and, so far, am pleased. We'll how well the batteries and solar cells work as the product ages.",

I bought two of these about a year ago and they have worked well every night. I have them set to just stay on dim rather than go completely off. On the dim setting they still provide enough light to let you see as you approach. When they detect motion they really light things up! They only stay on for about 20 seconds unless you are still moving within the range of the motion sensor. You can't beat 'em for the price (~$10-$12 each when on sale)",

      "text": "Update: 2 years after purchase. Bought 2 lights. One works sometimes and sometimes not. The other seems to work most nights but the light is not bright enough to be useful. 2 years and 3 months after purchase, company sent one single unit unsolicited by me. No notice, no explanation...just a package at the door. I'll find a use for it if it works better. Motion detection works sporatically. Brightness is not sufficient. Plastic base can easily break if getting screws a bit too tight.",

      "text": "UPDATE: I received a new light from the seller which fixed the mounting issues and the light is still very bright at night. Again be sure to place it somewhere with no shade and lots of sun. The light is great, but it will easily brake off it's mounting because the top is just thin plastic. Also, if you do break it there is really no alternate way to mount this thing. The single hook at the top middle allows it to swing around that axis and allows for the light to become askew. Also, don't mount it anywhere without direct sun exposure, because it needs about eight hours of unblocked direct sunlight to work well.",
