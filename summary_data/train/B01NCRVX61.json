Although it\u2019s also sturdy, it measures only 2 feet long, so Charlie can\u2019t fully wander around the patio without getting caught on a flower pot. I have added my own extra length to the chord by purchasing a ln extra 2 ft bungee chord. This has made all the difference. Now he can wander freely and enjoys sunbathing.",

So far this is the best one I\u2019ve found that also is comfortable for large cats. The only complaint I have it it\u2019s harder to put on than some of the other types. My cat doesn\u2019t like to sit still because he gets excited. This makes it hard because the clips on these are pretty small. But once it\u2019s on, it\u2019s great! He has tons of flexibility in this and it seems not to bother him. We go on walks all the time!",

Our smaller cat started walking with it after a few attempts of just sitting with it on at the park. The larger older cat is still not used to it yet but I think he will enjoy it after some time. Nice packaging. Overall very pleased for the money. Perfect price point.",

We got this for my indoor cat who enjoys being outside but we didnt wana make him and outdoor cat , so each day we take him out on his harness. I do wish the leash was longer, but over all great product! I highly recommend it for Cat parents, and obviously it takes time for the Cat to adjust to it. But our little guy knows now when his harness is on its outside time and I feel okay knowing he won\u2019t run off.",

Scary moment, we threw it away immediately afterwards.
