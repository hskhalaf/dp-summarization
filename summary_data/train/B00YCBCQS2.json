I think he's more aggressive as he's not worried about hurting his hands. The improved grip and hand size help with his throwing ability (once he got used to them!) They seem a bit delicate so we take very careful care of them, but they lasted an entire season and seem like they will last at least 1 more. He'll probably outgrow them first.",
