The Honda engine did start on the first or second pull as expected (Key Buying Factor based on owning other power equipment with Honda small engines); however, after trouble shooting the unit directly with Simpson they determined that the \"mixing valve\" was the problem. This is a flimsy ball-and-spring check valve that is supposed to allow the cleaning fluid to be drawn up into the flow path and out the nozzle. Simpson's response was to send me an identical POS mixing valve that did not work. Great customer service by Amazon in refunding our purchase - great small engine by Honda - DO NOT BUY A SIMPSON PRESSURE WASHER.",

It does a fantastic job, but due to the very poor engine balancing and mounting, you'll spend far more time keeping the unit where you put it than actually washing your house.

My husband purchased this (he is 6 foot) and he has a really hard time bending down to move it. Overall it works great, but we both hate moving it around. Also the hose always gets in the way and caught around the tires. So if you plan on using this in one place its great. Otherwise not so much.",

      "text": "Purchased May 2016, used for 2 summer cleanups around the house without a hitch. This summer, 2018, the unit would not pressure pump at all. Engine works perfectly but when I pulled the pump apart the plastic cups in the piston assembly were all melted onto the springs. I never ran the unit without water flowing to keep it cool. Seems like others have had the same problem. Without that many hours of run time this seems to be a serious weak link in the construction. Replacement pump assembly is about $135.00 on Amazon, curious to see how long this one will last. Hoping the materials used have been upgraded.. I will update future findings.",

Called Amazon and was referred to Simpson (the one year warranty). Then Simpson said it's a Honda engine issue and was given the names of local authorized dealers to investigate the problem. (I was told Honda has a two-year warranty against manufacturer's defects.) I have not yet scheduled a time to get the problem diagnosed. Should not cost me anything except my time.",

Like many pressure washers the high pressure hose and the garden hose attachments are right on top of each other which makes connecting them very cumbersome. In addition, the handle gets in the way. If your hands are child sized, no problem. Also, the handle itself is way too short. At 6' tall I can barely pull the pressure washer because the handle is so low to the ground. The Honda motor is great, starts on the first pull every time. Finally, the fitting on the pressure hose is brass and it screws to an aluminum fitting on the pressure washer. It seizes. Mine is now permanently attached now because it won't unscrew.",

The first 30 mins it was working great and then the pressure dropped off slightly and I noticed the pressure relief valve had water coming out of it.

Also when you stop pressure washing, the engine governor cocnstantly cycles the engine speed up and down for 15-20 seconds before it stabilizes. I will try it one more time, and if it continues to leak and cycle it will be going back in box for return. The other comments about the motor not running smoothly and vibrates is accurate",

I didn't find one among the items in the box so I had to buy one to put it on. It was only a cheap 30 cent part but it would have been nice to see all the parts included especially one that holds the tire on. After I fixed it it worked well for the thirty or so minutes I used it. I'll update if there are any other issues.",
