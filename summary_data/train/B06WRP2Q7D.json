I have advice for those finding that your heal won't stay seated all the way back, simply criss cross the bottom two straps by clicking the second strap where you would normally click the first strap, and vice versa. I thought I might have to return it because my heal would slip around, but the cross straps have worked wonders. Good boot, will update in a month or so.",

As a result, it didn't keep my foot and ankle secure during sleep. I wished theyd move the foot strap closer to the ball of the foot keeping the foot strapped down and in place. Also keep in mind, if you use this during sleep, your going to have cold hard plastic clips brushing against your opposite foot and leg.",

This one does a much better job. Between the brace and self-administered ASTYM treatments, My Achilles is recovering faster, and a lot less day to day pain. I want to reiterate a tip from another review if you feel your heel slipping in the boot. Crossover the foot and ankle straps so ankles straps goes to foot buckle and foot strap goes to the ankles buckle. This will help hold your heel tight in the boot. This boot is worth the money.",
