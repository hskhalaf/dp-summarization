I even laid on it, it's almost as comfortable as my actual bed. My 150 pound English Mastiff looked at me like I was the meanest person in the world when I moved his old bed out of the way. After a few hours, he finally laid down on it and immediately started snoring. Definitely worth the price.",

He had surgery to remove a cyst earlier in the day and it's great to see him sleeping comfortably. I'm so glad I found your company. There was no smell at all, and the bed is clearly well-made, Glad it is made in America! Wouldn't have bought it otherwise. HOWEVER - no liner comes with the bed and now I have to spend another $69 to buy a waterproof liner. The cover that comes with it is NOT waterproof, which it should be, and I know the bed will soon be stinky if I don't spend even more money on it.",

Purchased the XL for my GSD/Rot/Lab mix KNOWING that the Beagle would be using it too. They seems to really like it. No more getting up every 1/2-hour or so and turning around trying to get comfortable. Snoring from BOTH dogs didn't take long. Customer Service was friendly, fast and responsive.

The Big Barker orthopedic bed also appears to be very well made, and I believe will stand up to years of puppy use. My only complaint, and it's easily overcome, is that the suede material cover really attracts dog hair. I simply added a blanket over the top and tucked in the sides. These are a pair of happy dogs!

She loves this and when she gets up from her nap she is better on her legs those first few steps than she was on the old bed. Great support and love the long zipper for putting it back together after it is washed, which is weekly with this breed. We also bought the liner which is very nice and does it's job. Pricey product, but you get what you pay for and it is made in the USA!!!",

The minute I set it on the floor, he curled right up and felt right at home. Reagan has had ACL issues (strains/sprains) and since getting him a Big Barker Bed, we see definite improvement with him getting in and out of bed. Great Product!

Well worth the price as his previous one was not much cheaper than this one.
