Having spent many hours behind a computer 'stacking and registering' shots. The A55 does this internally, incredible time saver and great results. Very satisfied with my purchase. I have read the negative reviews for the A55 and wonder if they thought they bought a 'point and shoot' instead of a real camera. Sometimes you have to read the manual. Bravo Sony.",

This was my transitional choice from film to digital SLR or in this case SLT. I have been pleased with the choice. The camera has exceeded my expectations.

Despite some friends' recommendations to buy a Nikon or a Canon, somehow I'm \"married\" with Sony considering it a great and innovative brand. The camera fits perfectly my needs and though the lenses are quite expensive and limited, I don't complain. However, I should warn buyers to consider buying it with some other kind of lens instead of this 18-55mm. It seems to have a mechanic flaw when trying to adjust the range. It doesn't slips smoothly and will take you a little more time to fit the picture at your range need.",

The audio on the video is crisp and clear, just don't you [the photographer] say anything because it will be very loud in comparison.

However the lack of an optical viewfinder killed the deal for me. The LCD viewfinder was just not something I could get accustomed to. It may just be my eyes or something but I had a hard time looking through the viewfinder and not seeing strange LCD color effects. If possible try this camera out in person before ordering to make sure you are comfortable with the LCD viewfinder.",

    "description": "Style:Body OnlyCapture your perfect moments with the world\u2019s first Translucent Mirror Technology DSLR enabling simultaneous focusing and capture. Continuous shooting is an amazing 10 frames per second, complete with continuous auto focus. Auto focus is also visibly faster in Live View and HD Movie modes.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nChange the way you shoot pictures with Sony's new Translucent Mirror Technology DSLR camera. The SLT-A55V Alpha DSLR camera features professional-grade continuous shooting at 10 fps and visibly faster, more accurate focus in Live View and HD Movie modes. Compose your shots on either the LCD monitor or electronic viewfinder with 100% framing accuracy. Advanced features including Auto HDR, Sweep Panorama and 15-point Auto Focus make it dramatically easier to get the best shot. \n\nSony Alpha a55 Highlights \n\nUnprecedented Image Capture\n\n\n\nUnlike other DSLRs that can either shoot or focus with the speed and precision of Phase Detection AF, the SLT-A55V is the world's first DSLR that can do both simultaneously1. Featuring an unprecedented Translucent Mirror, the a55V DSLR camera is able to feed both the image sensor and the Phase Detection at the same time. \n\nProfessional Class Shooting Speeds\nBy transforming the fundamental way DSLR cameras work, you'll experience best-in-class speed3, up to 10 fps continuous shooting at full 16.2MP resolution with exposure fixed at the first frame. This is made possible by a Translucent Mirror that always stays in place. You also get standard continuous shooting at up to 6 fps. \n\nAstonishing HD Video Capture\n\nExperience a revolutionary breakthrough in video capture when shooting fast-moving subjects. The a55V is the world's first camera with the precision of Phase Detection auto focus (AF) for HD Movies1. Translucent Mirror Technology not only enables full-time phase-detection AF for photos, it also delivers the same speed and precision for Full HD movies. \n\nSpectacular Resolution and Detail\nFeaturing a large 16.2-megapixel Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor, you'll achieve beautiful image quality during both still-photo and movie shooting. Rich tonal gradation and highlight/shadow detail are assured by the BIONZ image processing engine which supports high-speed continuous shooting, advanced digital compositing, and Full HD movie recording. \n\nAdvanced Still Shooting Features\nExpand your creativity with advanced imaging features including built-in Auto HDR, which captures more scene contrast by combining the best highlight detail from one shot and the best shadow detail into one unbelievable shot. Map your journey via an integrated GPS receiver, or use 3D Sweep Panorama Mode to automatically capture expansive landscapes. \n\nVersatile Shooting Options\n\nUse both the LCD monitor and Electronic Viewfinder to compose your shots. An all-electronic design enables a wide range of shooting information to be displayed in the finder and on the LCD monitor. Both provide a what-you-see-is-what-you-get preview of white balance, focus, depth of field, exposure and 100% framing accuracy, plus on-screen displays. \n\nWhat's in the Box \n\n *  Alpha A55 digital SLR body \n * Shoulder Strap \n *  CD-ROM \n * Battery Charger (BC-VW1) \n * Body Cap \n * Rechargable Battery (NP-FW50) \n * USB Cable",
