It got him to stay occupied enough to break his time on his belly. I think as he grows into it, he would have more fun with squishing the toy and respond to the noise it makes from the inner bulbs hitting the wood pegs. Once major concern is that there is a little splinter sticking out where the ball meets the stick. It seems to be glossed over, but I will be sanding it down and more-podging it myself.",

However, the elastic between the rods prevent it from going in the baby's mouth too far. In the end, I opened it that day it was an instant hit. It's very light, makes rattle sounds, chewable and great for developing fine motor skills and still usable beyond 12 months. I will definitely buy this as a present for other young babies.",

One my favorite parts is that when the wooden beads move up and down the rods, they make an almost musical noise.

I got it for him when he was about 4 months old and he is still using it at 1 year. He likes to gnaw on it and pull the stretchy strings. It gets used heavily and has never fallen apart, and none of the strings have snapped or come undone.",

Just had to get one for my newest grandson...so, I searched until I found the manufacturer Manhattan Toys. It arrived quickly and became a big hit. He loves the noise, the colors, the easy grip & hold, and watching the balls move. Manhattan Toys has many neat things for little .",

As they got a little older I had to put it away for a month or so because they kept hurting themselves as they shook it around. But now we've had it out for a few months again and they like it. The elastic is really strong, so it is hard for the babies to squish it flat, but they still like to shake it around and suck on any piece they can get in their mouths.",

It is very easy for them to hold and the colors of the beads are beautiful but so far they are not interested in it. They have held it and tried to chew on it but quickly become bored. I am still hoping they may become interested though so am holding out for that to happen perhaps when they're a bit older.",

The color and shape of the toy catch immediate attention -- a lovely little artwork in and of itself. Highly recommended.",

I suppose that the strings make grabbing it quite easy for a 4-6 month old. It is very sturdy and the strings are really cords and not in the least able to be bitten and broken. I was concerned about that. It is quite colorful, so I'm sure it will attract a 5 month old. If it doesn't go over, I will update and let you all know!",
