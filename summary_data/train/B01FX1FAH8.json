I've struggled with very severe body acne for years of my life. I've never been able to get it under control or get rid of all of the pigmentation that has resulted from it. After using this for a few months, my back is almost completely clear of all acne scars. I could not be happier. You will absolutely not regret buying this product. It's 11/10 stars for me and I'd recommend for anyone with pigmentation and scarring from acne.",
