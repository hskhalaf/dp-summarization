The detachable keyring does not come off easily, no worrying about losing that. Just press the little silver button and pull the keyring off (even with the button pressed, the keyring doesn't just slip off without being pulled slightly). Easy-to-use. I would definitely buy these again if I needed more for anything.",

For the more than reasonable price (less than $8.00 for five lanyards!) I highly recommend that everyone who is active outdoors (skiing, boating, biking, etc.) purchase them.",
