So easy to set up; very intuitive; you don\u2019t have to be a computer genius to set this up and it works with Alexa; the sound is as better if not better than my prior high end compact speaker.",

The worst is this thing can\u2019t hear me when playing at moderately loud volumes (Alexa volume 4 or higher). I literally have to yell at it from across the room for voice control. My recommendation. Do not get sonos one with Alexa. Get a sonos and a separate echo that will be much better at receiving voice commands.",

A SONOS system gives you a ton of options and It will be difficult to add voice control to the complexity that SONOS offers, but the product is working well at a simple level and It is likely do more with a quick internet upgrade.

I also don't know why you can't incorporate it into multiroom music with the echos. I would love to have it link up to my TV but this isn't supported either.

The only workaround is to use the Alexa app to get to the Pandora stations and select it the old fashion way by clicking on it rather than by voice - first world problems to be sure - so I'm not sweating it too much...",
