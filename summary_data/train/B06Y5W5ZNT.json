The longest dimension should correspond to how a person's foot will be placed on the board. On the fact of dimensional appropriateness, Great job. The stretch angles are very appropriate for those not affected by joint mobility issues. Durability appears to be solid thus far, time will tell the whole story. Two facets I would like added are a carrying cutout and locks to secure the board. The lack of those features is not something an interested buyer should balk at. This board works well to stretch the calf.",

The material covering the part of the board where you step on is very grippy to ensure a stable position. Being large I have found this board can hold my weight easily and surely.
