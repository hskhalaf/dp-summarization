Cons: - Will clash with other colors that aren\u2019t brown, beige, white, or black. If you\u2019re wall has other decor that\u2019s not in that theme, it will clash hardcore! - Up close, print is kinda blurry but it is to be expected when you order such a huge tapestry of a painting! No worries tho! Very nice looking!",

Although, the material is different I actually like it and wish more were made of it. It is smooth and up close looks like a vintage blur, but far away it is so pretty and if paired with white christmas lights, it is stunning. 10 out of 10, I love it and receive many compliments on it.",
