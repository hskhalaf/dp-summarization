      "text": "I loved that I received this very promptly and the design is outstanding. What I didn't like, (and this may just be my fault for not reading details more carefully before I ordered) the interior of the thermos is a clear shiny plastic and I try to minimize the amounts of plastics I use, especially when using something acid or something hot that might tend to leach chemical compounds into the liquid I drink. I was impressed with how quickly this was delivered and how easy it was to return. If the plastic lining isn't something that bothers you, I would recommend it in every other way!",

Although the whole thing is a bit big for backpacking it wouldn't be too difficult to just take the flexible top silicone piece and reusable filter and use it with any backpacking cup that you have. The bonus of this coffee maker is that it collapses to all fit in the base for camping.",

I find it difficult to use with a paper filter cone, perhaps because I don't like to wait any longer than I have to for coffee and getting the water to boil is already trying my patience. However, by setting my GSI JavaMill to coarse grind I can use the included filter without much issue with grounds. I had grounds in my coffee from my percolator so no big deal.",

Really needs a lid and the ability to use as a mug after brewing. The key to saving weight when backpacking is selecting products that have multiple uses. The design of this assumes you have a seperate mug for your freshly brewed coffee. Might be fine for car camping, but then it probably wouldn't have the capacity needed for multiple campers, so I don't really see the point of this design.",
