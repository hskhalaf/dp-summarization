I took him to the vet and the vet said there was nothing wrong with him and that he recommended changing the food. Not only did it make my cat sick but it's an impractical waste of money.

I'm not sure if it's the bag we received or the flavor. She has traditionally enjoyed and stomached turkey with no problem in other products. Not saying it's a bad product and won't work for you, but it just didn't for us. I'm a little leery about trying the chicken again :(",
