They came carefully packaged so that no scratches or dings would occur in transit. I ordered two sets of four and both sets look so amazing in my home! We have 5 at our kitchen table and 3 at our dining room table. I am pleased with the height of the chairs and also the comfort. My husband and I both really like them! I highly recommend these chairs. You won't find a better price for a set of 4 like these.",

I had to tape socks on them to keep the from scuffing up the other chairs, while I worked on them. I have assembled IKEA furniture with less trouble. But I do get a lot of compliments on them.
