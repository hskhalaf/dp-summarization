      "text": "HEADS UP. . . The speaker grille is only for one speaker. Don't get confused by the picture like I did and think it's for a pair. It's kinda ridiculous the speakers dont already come with grilles but for $25 after tax I figured I'd buy some just in case. $50 is pushing it tho and is pretty absurd especially after already spending so much on the speakers... 1 star for the fact that they are gouging us for speaker covers, but the speakers themselves get 5 stars for sound/ build quality. Thus my 3 star review",

For some reason, I thought \"Uni-Q Driver Array\" type on the speaker rim would be back lit, but wasn't. I am very happy that it wasn't. Sounds extremely clear. Hi and Mid are smooth and rich. Wish there is a bit more bass, but perhaps adding subwoofer is better idea anyways. It does what it suppose to do very well. Great product. Very satisfied. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "I've been listening to the Q350's for about five weeks and the woofers are still not broken in; that warm speaker feel and sound hasn't come to fruition yet. I'm confident with more time they'll loosen up, and warm with time. I use an iPad Mini 4 as the sound source and have found the \"rock\" setting in the equalizer sounds best overall. The integrated amp I use is the Yamaha AS-801 and I need to turn the bass knob to about \"two o'clock\" to get the warmth I like to hear. The only track I've seen to actually work and move the woofers is Rocket Empire's 'Cruising the Galaxy', loud.",

And they always came with the grilles Somehow kef decided to make you buy the grilles separately. that's 50 bucks for 2. however the q 350 is one of the best speakers ever at that price level. That's the deal with kef at this price level you cannot do better however at higher levels you have many speakers equal to their r and ref series. I would say the r series is probably one of the best also in it's price range and the ref too. but if you have the speakers you need these so get em.",

They are priced moderately and perform well however I must admit their sound is not exceptional. No they are not bad but somewhere between better than average...(way better really) and good. A little thin -- something of substance is lacking. Stereophile Magazine has given them a very strong review as one of their recommended components. Maybe with certain amps or other associated equipment that is true. I can only say in my system I find them lacking.",

The New Q350 boasts a revamped Unit-Q driver array with a damped tweeter loading tube designed to smooth out treble frequencies, and reimagined crossovers to provide cleaner and more accurate bass. Architecturally, the Q350 benefits from a New port, which has been moved to the rear of the speaker to improve audio clarity, and the Unit-Q driver array has been relocated to the middle of the cabinet to reduce unwanted internal resonances. These changes between the Q300 and Q350 have transformed an already breathtaking bookshelf speaker into one that truly needs to be heard to be believed. The Q350 is available in sleek matte black and White vinyl finishes. Grilles for the Q350 are sold separately.",
