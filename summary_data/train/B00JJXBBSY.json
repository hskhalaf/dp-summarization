      "text": "Just installed the radio this past weekend in our Yamaha Rhino. The radio is very compact, which is well suited to the small area behind the dash panel. The radio connections were labeled and pre-stripped which made my work soldering much quicker. I can't comment on the waterproof nature of the radio yet, but rest assured it will be tested. The only negative I have encountered thus far is that when power is removed from the radio and then re-applied, the radio will not automatically power back on. I had planned on wiring the radio to the ignition switch. So basically, you have to press the JBL power button every time. Not a huge deal.",

I purchased the boss gauge style unit and returned it due to condensation but boy did it pack a punch compared to jbl. The boss sound is far superior and even has a amp botton for more power. Just wish I could get a quality product. I guess I'll try the kicker or clarion next. However the buttons on the jbl are easier to press with more response than the boss. I also sell the cheapest and best Ttops, Bimini, wakeboard towers in Texas. See last photo.",

Gave it only four stars for low sound output (even though ya can't expect to much out of such a small package), and streaming on Bluetooth the volume is considerably lower than FM or usb, you have to really crank it up, not really an issue but shouldn't be like that, no other complaints, great unit for simple, clean stereo on my boat.",

Plenty of hook ups for 4 speakers and I run 2 amps off it as well. It's been completely submerged while on and still works great.",
