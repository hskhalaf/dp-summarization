THE WIFI CHIP STOPPED WORKING and now i have to use teathered internet which is somewhat convenient if you really need it. It has some cool features such as a USB host, with cable, Blue tooth, headphone jack. The power jack sucks. You need a separate cable for it. I think one star is the most i'd give it.",
