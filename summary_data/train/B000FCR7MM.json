The scent is amazing, as it is a bit beachy and outdoorsy, but not perfume laden. Appropriate scent for both male and female Fantastic product.

Thankfully one of the pumps was functional so I was able to re-use it for the two bottles that were broken. Needs to be packaged better so they won't break during shipping. This would be a 5 star review if it wasn't for the unusable pumps.",
