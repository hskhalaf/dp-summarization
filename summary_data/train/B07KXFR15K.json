After reporting the issue to Venom, they sent me a new charger! So end game is this: Chargers under $100 ish are very cheap. However when you have an awesome company like Venom that has your back, you can buy with confidence. Thanks Venom for standing behind what you sell!",

Something that my Venom Pro 3 couldn't do. This charger can do it. Fit and finish looks good, it's very light for what it is. Seems easy enough to navigate. Another reviewer said it didn't come with two of the same plug. They aren't wrong, but here on Amazon the Venom charger plugs are $7 each at the time of this review. You won't find a more reliable, easy to use charger capable of charging two batteries at the same time in this price range.",

I am sure it must have an automatic timer switch. Being a two port charger I feel it should have two set of cables. A couple are doubled but not all. Of course, the one adapotor I needed did not have a double in the box. I had to order adaptors already before my first battery charging. I know they're coming out with smaller Digital chargers and they claim it works better, fast exc. I like this hands on style. It gives the user better/finer control.",
