It\u2019s no wonder that people view it as a worthy purchase regardless of its steep price. On the flip side, there a few setbacks especially with the laces. Nevertheless, a little modification on the lacing can put the Salewa Wander Hiker GTX on the list of the best day hiking shoe for wide-footed adventurers.",

        "Several outdoor addicts were stoked with the performance of the shoe regardless of the type of terrain",

        "A good deal of adventurers praised the Michelin outsole for its reliable grip",
        "According to numerous satisfied wide-footed wearers, the Wander Hiker GTX fits them perfectly"

      "cons": [
        "A few wearers were disappointed with the very long laces",

I would say the quality of these even beats the north face shoes which lasted years. Time will tell of course but very happy. The Michelin soles grip well. They look great in my opinion and super comfy. Also bought a pair of Keen mid heoght boots but I'm so impressed with Salewa I'm thinking of selling the keen and getting Salewa boots as well as the shoes.",

I wear an Adidas terrex shoe at size UK 11 and the salewa shoes are perfect at size UK 10.5 I prefer lightweight shows and this one is slightly heavy but not an issue. Laces are high quality but are too long Could be wider but will probably break-in in time",

However, they\u2019re a bit pricey for what you get, and in my opinion they are let down by the flexi heel - which can rub against the back of your foot - and the fact that they don\u2019t have a fully gusseted tongue.",

      "text": "I needed to replace an old pair of big brand shoes after they lost their waterproofness pretty quickly. I tried these on a whim having never heard of the brand, and I have to say they are great. The fit is pretty perfect and they feel very comfortable. I can slide them on and off without undoing the laces which I like. Tried them on a walk on a wet common with lots of boggy grasses, etc and the shoes performed much better than my previous shoes. If you are willing to try a new brand and can overlook the dodgy English on the labels, these are great shoes. I expect I\u2019ll buy them again.",
