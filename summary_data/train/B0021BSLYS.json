Took me about 45 minutes to put it together, primarily because I was doing it by myself and also I misread the instructions. Having someone to help would definitely make this quick work to assemble. A lot of reviewers are complaining about the fill plug. I used a little bit of white lithium grease on the threads and had very little issue getting it to thread into place, using a pair of channel-lock pliers for encouragement. My one issue was that the \"5/16\" nuts were actually 1/2\" nuts.",

After emailing pictures, the manufacturer sent out a new drum and threaded plug and they were both fine. I was told to only screw in the plug part way so it just clears the side support rail and that the plug was designed like this to allow for wear. I'm not buying that answer and why isn't any of that in the instructions? Others have had the same issue with the plug - my opinion is this is a design and/or quality problem the manufacturer needs to address.",

I had no problem with the plug once I wrapped the threads with two or three turns of silicon thread tape, using a large channel lock plier's. Good quality, good price, Should last a lifetime, Mine anyway. I recommend .",
