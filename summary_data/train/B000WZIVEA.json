The authentic product smells great and its long-lasting. Scarves I've worn weeks ago still have the scent on them. This product is FAKE. Also, Amazon won't let me return it.

The middle and bottom notes are not right. They\u2019re too fruity making it smell cheap, unlike the heady deep scent that smells expensive that it usually is. And the longevity is not near what it should be. Like I said, I know this perfume inside and out after using a small bottle once every 3 months for the last 8 years. This one isn\u2019t right. I\u2019m going to return it.",

Read some of the reviews on any 100% authentic perfume on here. Spending a lot of money for an unknown quality with no recourse. I will point out that I have received some very good quality perfumes, but they are usually from other stores advertising on Amazon. Pay your money and take your chance.",
