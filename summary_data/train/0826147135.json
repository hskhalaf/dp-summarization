Several things I liked about it 1: the overview of every topic that the test could cover helped me identify where I needed to focus. Things I already felt confident in, I could skip, and things I didn't know, I could review in more depth 2: the test was also super helpful in helping me understand why I missed what I missed and what I needed to go back and review. You will never feel completely ready for this LCSW exam, but this helped me go in w/ enough confidence that I didn't really have test day jitters and was able to pass!",

I scratched it off with great care knowing the reviews but there is nothing there! I will connect the information I get from this book to an app I paid for to help me study. So long story short.
