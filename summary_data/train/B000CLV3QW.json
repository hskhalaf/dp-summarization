My current truck is a 2015 Ram 1500 Hemi with the 65 RFE. The gasket is a rubber type of gasket that holds the 8mm pan bolts nicely for easy installation. Be sure to use a Torx T-25 on the sump (plate) filter. The plate filter comes with a small round seal that you can press in with a 3/4 socket with extension tapping it in place with a hammer. Can't go wrong with a Wix filter.",

Gasket works great, with no leaks, and it's much less of a hassle to deal with than rtv, especially since it's a pain to get the pan back on the commander (very little wiggle room). Filters seems to be doing their job just fine too. Do yourself a favor and buy the Dorman replacement pan for $35 that has a drain plug to make future drains a lot less messy. Overall I highly recommend these filter and gasket kit!",
