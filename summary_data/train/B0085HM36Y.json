(-)There is no shock absorbed, so you better expect bumpy ride. If your budget is $200 - $300, you can find the better scooter with everything above covered.

After all the scooter is just sitting there unusable for over a month... Based on the fact that the spring broke so fast and that it is back-ordered shows that it is of poor quality/design and as a result has a high failure rate. Razor, you have to do MUCH better!

Unfortunately, full throttle (on) accelerates very slowly to 10 MPH max, no where close to the 15 MPH claim. I guess I should've read the fine print which says UP TO 15 MPH, which could mean 1 MPH and they'd still be making good on their statement.",

My seven-year-old seems to like it so I guess that's what all that matters. On a different note I think it's past time that razor upgrade their technology to lithium-ion batteries. 12 hour charging time is just unacceptable in today's day and age.",
