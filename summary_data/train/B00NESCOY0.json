On top of that, you can't trust the avarage rating because half of these reviews aren't talking about mattress pads they're talking about other items. So the company just added this mattress pad to an old listing that already had a bunch of 5 star reviews (for the old items) which isn't honest at all. After realizing all this, the whole thing seemed a little too sketchy so I'm going to send it back. Do your research before you buy. I recommend finding something at Homegoods or Walmart.",

The premium, high-loft pads are for after the mattress has had a few years' wear. I bought a basic mattress pad, and I'm pleasantly surprised at the quality. It's not a premium, but it's certainly better than a typical basic line. It seems to be well-made, and the surface fabric is smoother than expected. The skirt will fit a deep mattress, and is of a much better quality than the one I just removed from the old mattress. So, two thumbs up.",

The meterial feels very durable on top and the sides are so not thin yoiu would think itnwould rip...best part, the corners syated on place and didnt come up from the mattress after 2 adults,2 kids, a 103 lb dof all took turns tossing and turning! Very pleased with this mattress cover, the shipping time and Utopia!",

I Highly recommend this company \"Utopia\". I purchased a comforter from this company a while back and it feels wonderful, washes perfectly in the washing machine and is so comfortable! Have a beautiful blessed day today everyone! Hope this helps! I am going to continue being a returning customer definitely. Thank you \"Utopia\" for putting out fabulous quality products!",
