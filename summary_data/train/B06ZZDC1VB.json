The metal has bent like a child's toy and can't even be slept on now. I am so highly disappointed, I don't have money to throw around to buy another frame as a broke college kid so now I have to go without again. I hope no one else makes this mistake.",

Will not recommend buying for the safety of anyone my fiance hit his head on the corner of the night stand cause that corner caved in. If i could get a refund it would be wonderful cause the quality and safety of those fruniture was not worth it!",

Using those, the mattress was comfortable, but a bit too soft, and it was always sliding around on the box spring. Changing to this frame is like night and day. The mattress is way more comfortable, since it's providing more support. It's also not sliding around now, and getting in and out of bed is a perfectly silent affair. On top of that, we have a bunch of new storage space under the bed! I'd definitely recommend this frame, especially to anyone with a memory foam mattress.",

Not sure if the mattress is designed to be larger or if maybe our king mattress is not actually a king size. Either way, the size is not significant enough to make it look weird, but I thought I'd mention it. Overall, a great frame for the money!",

There is easy instructions to follow and it took me 20 min. There is 16\" from the floor which gives plenty of room for storage underneath.

      "text": "We have this frame in a twin. Concerned about the bad reviews regarding broken welds, but so far it has held up well. No noise, no signs of weak welds. It is on carpet so no danger of sliding around. We do keep some things under there and appreciate the storage space now that we have gotten rid of the box spring. Relatively easy to put together and a good price. It only works with a conventional inner spring mattress; the thin metal slats won't accommodate memory foam or latex. The bed skirt needs frequent adjustment to keep hiding the legs. Will update this review if it breaks or starts to squeak.",

Detailed instructions were great. Only recommendation is to read carefully because I jumped ahead and pulled off all the white strips from the bars that were supposed to hold the mattress in place (whoops)! Turned out totally fine though. The frame is pictured here leaning against her old headboard which we kept for the aesthetics. On top of the frame is a box spring, mattress and topper. Managed to slide large suitcases under the bed\u2014plenty of storage under there. Exactly what we needed!",
