Now my fat cat is putting her paw in the tunnel where the food comes from and all that is stopping the food from coming down is a rubber stopper. If you reach in you can feel and if you lift it up a bit you can release a couple of kibbles at a time, just like my fatty does. Wish there was a fix for this.",

Awesome job with making this one!",

I have another feeder that doesn't have either of those options that I am considering replacing now. Also, the portion that I need to dispense on my other feeder is 1 1/2 cups. To get that to come out, I have to dispense 1 cup and then 1/2 cup five minutes later. This one can go up to 4 cups per feeding!",

    "description": "Style:Original Smart FeedYour smartphone is with you wherever you go and now, so is the ability to feed your best friend. The PetSafe Smart Feed Automatic Pet Feeder is a convenient solution that allows you to feed your pet instantly while you are at work, running errands or busy around the house. The Wi Fi enabled feeder connects to your home's wireless router (2.4GHz) to work with your iPhone or Android smartphone letting you feed and monitor your pet\u2019s meals anytime, anywhere. Simply download the Smart Feed app to customize your dog or cat\u2019s feeding schedule. The feeder holds up to 24 cups of dry food and allows you to plan up to 12 meals a day with portions ranging from 1/8 cup to 4 cups to fit your pet's feeding needs. With portion controlled meals, you can easily manage your pet\u2019s weight if you have an overeater. If your fur baby tends to eat meals too quickly, simply tap the Slow Feed button within the app to slowly dispense meals over a 15 minute period to prevent digestive upset. The pet proof design of the dispenser helps eliminate the possibility of prying paws opening the feeder to get more food between meals. When meals get messy, simply place the lid, hopper, stainless steel bowl and bowl holder in the top rack of the dishwasher. Just in case your Wi Fi drops, install 4 D cell alkaline batteries with the optional battery backup feature, to ensure that your best friend never misses a meal.",
