Now I'm making things in the kitchen with so much ease and control I was never able to do before. The whisk, brilliant. The chopper, my food processor now only comes out for big projects. Ever put hot soup in the blender to cream it? Ouch! Now it never leaves the pot. And the awesome milkshakes!!! The wife was skeptical but not anymore. I'd like to give it 6 stars. Update 2.5 years later and still going strong. Still very happy with this purchase.",

      "text": "Incredibly useful but there are quality issues. After a year of light use the interconnect on the blending arm failed and after another six months the interconnect on the whisk attachment failed. A careful look at the blending arm failure revealed that though the interfaces themselves look like they were designed to make a strong connection, when mated the two sides barely overlap so the gear on the arm simply stripped because there wasn\u2019t enough plastic to handle the pressure on the gear. Looks a lot like Kitchen Aid choose to save a few cents on the length of the connecting rod as the expense at the expense of durability. I assume the same if true of the whisk attachment.",

The motor isn't that powerful, the clearance on the blender attachments makes hard work of soups, the mini chopper lids doesn't fit properly so it leaks, the connection between wand/attachments and the motor unit is poor and loose so the blender can fall into your pot and there are too many metal to plastic connections which make it look and feel cheap whilst also wearing the plastic rapidly. Avoid.",

As other reviewers have said, the 5 speeds are controlled by the knob at the top and it took both hands and effort to move the knob.

The positives for this blender are the five speeds, the pot protector shield, the relatively long cord and the storage case. Next time, just a blender without the accessories will be just fine.",

      "text": "I own a large commercial stick blender for my soaping needs but when it comes to mashing potatoes or blending a soup, I wanted a standard kitchen model and this model is perfect. I don't really know the difference between the various blade heads as I haven't used them that much. It's seen about 4-5 uses total but when I did use it I loved its performance. I missed in the ad where it indicated it came with a handy case to keep all the parts together and organized, LOVE THAT!! I can stand it up in the upright organizer in the pantry next to cookie sheets and baking dishes.",
