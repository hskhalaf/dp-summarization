So in short no use of warranty.. for a $70 blender i need to pay more $35 to get it working. Just to replace the blade they charge 35 dollars. please dont buy this item.",

While you don't have the variability of the larger Ninja's multi-speed controls, IMHO a lot of that stuff is really overkill anyway. Highly recommended for smaller venues or for single folks where the larger Ninja is not appropriate.",

Didn't feel hot to the touch, but today it started smoking while I was trying to use it. All done, off to the trash thank you. Time to find another brand, which is a bummer because I had purchased extra cups and lids and stuff, and now all of that is trash too. :/",

Next, the motor runs very loudly. Lastly, since you need to hold the cup down to keep the blades turning, you can't avoid hearing it the whole time. On the positive side, the Ninja does a nice job of blending and clean up is simple.",

Now, I just pour the proper amount into the cup, twist on the top which has the blades attached, click into little machine and press down. I add some water and let it sit for a minute.....and I have their perfect mushy meal. Super simple to use and wash.",

I hand wash the blade piece with every use and remove the silicone seal about once a week to clean. As other reviews have mentioned, dont overfill and you'll have no problems.",

The rubber gasket isn't perfectly snug against the blender top, so you'll have to clean it each time you use it unless you like having old, decomposing food in there. You'll need to fish it out using a thin object. Also, having to continuously hold down the blender to make it run is a little annoying. It'd be great if you could press down and turn to lock it in place, but it's not a terrible inconvenience if you're blending is quick.",
