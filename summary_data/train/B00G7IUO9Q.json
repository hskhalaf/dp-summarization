The beacon severely underperformed in side by side range beacon test to detect transmitting beacon from 20-50 meters away. Device locked on target within 20 meter range however the range test was performed multiple times, resetting device (off/on), and still underperformed to detect transmitting beacon at the maximum 40 meters of range listed by the manufacturer. Sending back to the manufacturer.",

I take great care of my gear, and always take the batteries out of my transceiver at the end of winter. This is my second BCA beacon, but after this spooky experience that totally compromises the safety of myself and the group I'm with combine with the disappointing customer service of BCA I'll never feel safe or happy using their beacons again.",
