I'm glad i went with the larger size, as these definitely run a bit on the smaller side. They are a bit snug in the toe box, but nothing bad. I can't overstate enough how comfortable these are. I have worn them nonstop for 2 weeks, on my feet all day and walking around , without any pain or soreness whatsoever. And I get compliments every time I wear them. Style up or down, these are the best.",

Because of the high instep it can also be really hard to wear after time as it puts pressure on the top of my foot cutting off circulation. These however, I have zero problems with this and are so amazing comfortable. The color is beautiful while being neutral. I wear them all the time and have quickly become my go to shoe. I collect Nike\u2019s and these might be my favorite!",
