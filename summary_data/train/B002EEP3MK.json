So probably only watched a total of 10 movies. Recently bought a 4K TV and decided it was time to watch Masters of Commanders on BR. Booted up the OPPO and found pink screen. Did some troubleshooting and the tray would not return. tired of the headache so I decided to leave it sitting on my cabinet as a reminder of what expensive crap based on brand bought me. BTW my aching GoVideo system is still working on the basement TV at 1/5 the price.",

The Amazon page makes no mention that this disc is included with the player, so you do not need to purchase one separately. I did by accident, and had to do a little work to get all my money back, but I did in the end. The Oppo also includes the AIX records Audio Calibration Disc and an HD Music sampler.",

What is a surprise is how fast it operates, something the older model upconvert players were not known for. The ease of set-up, menu navigation, real-time video and audio playback changes, and online firmware updates makes this player intuitive to use. If you already have an extensive DVD library and want to add top-performing Blu-ray capability to your A/V system, the video and audio peformance of the OPPO BDP-83 player is unsurpassed. My DVD library has never looked this good.",

Unlike most players today an HDMI cable and calibration DVD are even included. The only \"problem\" I noticed was that the included manual does not say the unit will play DVD-Audio disks. It does. I guess that is why they tell you to download the latest manual in PDF format. I would highly recommend this unit to anyone who wants excellence at a reasonable price.",

The unit itself is a battle ship compared to the usual fare(Sony etc)and exudes quality beginning with it's shipping box! The picture quality is CRYSTAL CLEAR AND THE UNIT ITSELF IS SIMPLE AND ELEGANT! [...] And still researching for a speaker system to match my current choices. I'd recommend the Oppo to anyone looking for quality and ease of use.",

I even was able to update the firmware with a CD. No problem! I would have to say, this is probably the best disc player I have ever owned. My old PIONEER Elite Universal player is going in the trash. BRAVO to the wizards at OPPO!!!",

Bought what I thought was a flawed copy of \"Barber of Siberia\" in Kiev and it inexplicably wouldn't play on my Ukrainian dvd player there (unlike all my other foreign dvds). Brought it anyway to US when I moved. Tried it in on my Oppo BDP-83 and it played flawlessly. Recently upgraded the firmware and it still plays other region dvds perfectly. Can't praise this player enough.",

Besides the HDMI connection and if you have a quality A/V Receiver I recommend you to install this Oppo device with a high quality stereo cable for SACD or CD listening. It's an experience. Also would like to point the hight quality power cord that comes with Oppo.",

The Blu-ray and standard DVD performace are also excellent as expected. But even for sound alone, this one is clearly for the audiophiles. My unit paired with a Denon 2890 that can handle the DSD feed from SACDs for the best sound. The extra level of the DSD handling compatiblity is really quite nice to have, so if this is of intrest to you, research your own AVR specs to see if it can handle the DSD over hdmi. It will play just fine if not, but that way is the real deal for SACD.",

I have compared it to many other high end players including the Sony BDP-S5000ES. the Sony SCD-XA-5400ES, the Denon DVD-A1UD. While the higher priced players are also excellent, I prefer the OPPO because of its speed and responsiveness: and used as a transport I see no difference in audio or picture quality It also does things none of the other high priced players can do, like display and change its setup menu while a BD disc is still playing behind it! Highly recommended: this is the player of choice",

This universal Blu-ray player operates not only Blu-ray, but also SACD, DVD-Audio, DVDs, and CDs.

One Player to Rule Them All\nInstead of using separate players for your Blu-ray discs, DVDs, CDs, SACDs, and DVD-Audio discs, use the OPPO BDP-83 player to do the job in a single, handsome package. If you have videos, music, or photos on your computer, you can burn them to a CD or copy them to a USB flash drive, and the BDP-83 will play them without a hitch.\n\nWith a sleek, black design that features a brushed aluminum front, the OPPO BDP-83 will fit your home decor. And by replacing a myriad of other players, the OPPO BDP83 will save you space and will reduce clutter and cables.\n\nLatest Blu-ray Specs for Outstanding Video Quality\nThe OPPO BDP-83 Blu-ray Disc Player incorporates an award-winning processing chip by Anchor Bay that provides outstanding picture quality that is clean and true to life. The player provides full 1080p HD output, and can also provide output at 480i, 480p, 720p, and 1080i. It also supports Blu-ray discs that are recorded at 24 frames per second, so you can have a cinema-like experience anytime you want it.\n\nThe BDP-83 supports Blu-ray Profile 2.0, which means that it has special hardware, such as an audio/video decoder and one gigabyte of internal storage. This allows it to support BD-Live features such as Internet chats, scheduled chats with the director, Internet games, and more. Please note that BD-Live requires an Internet connection to work.\n\nUp-converts DVDs for a Clearer Picture; Converts Between PAL and NTSC\nThe same Anchor Bay chip that provides the Blu-ray processing also provides up-converting of standard-definition DVDs. By de-interlacing and scaling, the chip will make your DVDs look great on your HDTV, giving your DVD library new life.\n\nThe BDP-83 supports both NTSC and PAL systems, providing disc playback and video output. It also allows you to watch the content of one system in the output of the other; for example, you can watch a PAL movie on an NTSC TV (please note that this is subject to DVD and BD region restrictions).\n\n \n\n\n\nAward-winning VRS technology by Anchor Bay delivers outstanding picture quality. View logic board. High-Fidelity Audio for a Cinema-Like Experience\nIt isn't just the BDP-83's visual quality that will thrill you; you'll also love the sound the BDP-83 creates. With support for Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, you'll experience loss-free sound that is studio-master quality. The player supports bit-stream output via HDMI 1.3, and it can decode TrueHD or DTS-HD audio into LPCM and yield sound via HDMI or 7.1-channel analog outputs. \n\n\n Support for Audio-Only Formats Will Thrill Sound Lovers\nSound lovers will be elated by the BDP-83, thanks to its support for both DVD-Audio and SACD, two audio-only formats that provide stereo and multi-channel audio. These formats provide sound quality that is far superior to that of CDs, and they have greater sound depth and higher sound resolution. And with a dedicated two-channel analog audio output with optimized DACs and output driving stage, sound lovers will be sure they're getting the best audio they can.\n\nMultiple Connections to Work With Your Home Theater\nThe BDP-83 has plenty of connections to interface with your home theater system. On the front of the player, there is a USB port that lets you quickly connect a flash drive to view movies, music, or photos. On the rear, there is another USB port, along with connections for HDMI, component video, composite video, 7.1 analog audio, analog stereo output, and optical and coaxial digital audio. Whether you have a state-of-the-art home theater system or one with legacy connections, the BDP-83 won't have any problems interfacing with your equipment. There is also an Ethernet jack for use with BD-Live, as well as a hardwired IR in-and-out jack.\n\nBacklit Remote Control and Universal Power Supply\nWith clear labeling and an ergonomic layout, the included remote makes playback of all your audio and video discs easy. And because the remote control has a back light, you'll have no problems when using it in your dark home theater.\n\nThe BDP-83 has a universal power supply, making it compatible with the AC power of every region, so you won't have to worry about damaging your player with incorrect voltage.\n\nThe OPPO BDP-83 Blu-ray Disc Player measures 17.0 x 3.0 x 13.25 inches (WxHxD). \n\n\n\n\nREVIEW FROM HOME THEATER MAGAZINE\n\n\nREVIEW FROM HOMETHEATERMAG.COM: OPPO BDP-83SE\nWith all of the resources that are available to the Blu-ray Disc Association's major manufacturers, it's remarkable that the first company to cure the ills of standalone Blu-ray players was Oppo Digital with its $499 BDP-83 (HT, September 2009). Upon that player's release, many enthusiasts were using the PlayStation 3 for its speed and reliability. Standalone players were too slow and prone to disc incompatibility issues. They also had a hodgepodge of hardware profiles and decoding and interactivity features that bewildered consumers. When Oppo's BDP-83 came along, it did everything that a Blu-ray player should do, and it did it right and fast. In short, it was a next-gen Blu-ray player that acted like one. That player earned Home Theater's Top Pick of the Year in Source Components and overall Product of the Year for 2009 (HT, November 2009). Plus, it earned a check from me to Oppo. The BDP-83 I bought last year as a reference has been bulletproof during the time I've owned it. Compatibility issues have been few and far between. But when they've come up, Oppo has acted swiftly with hassle-free firmware updates from the Internet. It has been so bulletproof that it's difficult to imagine changing it out or upgrading it.
