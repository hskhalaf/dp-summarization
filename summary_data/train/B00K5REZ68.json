My dog normally loves this product, but he is rejecting the moldy product delivered by Amazon in my last monthly shipment. Buyer beware! It appears that product does not meet \"human grade\" standards touted by the processor. Update 4/3/2018: Only one bag showed up moldy out of six. New deliveries the next month were also mold free. The manufacturer's response was less than stellar however. They pointed out that no preservatives are used in the manufacturing process, but didn't expalin how the product rates a shelf-life of 18 months.",
