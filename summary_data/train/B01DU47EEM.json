I do not have a long-term review yet. This kit is ideal for a beginner in watch self-servicing. It can also be used as a guide to what the more expensive counterpart tools would be beneficial to have.",

They are not as easy to use. One bit had to be forced in and a second bit socket is actually loose. HOWEVER, these shortcomings are fixable! I am delighted with the kit and yes, would buy it again, or get it for a friend who wanted one. Oh, and Customer Service is EXCELLENT!! They really follow up and support you.",

Finding the correct batteries for my wristwatches has become an iffy chore but someone to actually install them much more difficult. So... I decided that it would be much easier to get the right tools and do it myself. This set was my final choice and after removing the covers (two screwed on and one snap on) with the proper tools was no problem. I ordered the batteries and replacement gaskets from Amazon and am awaiting those items to get the watches running again. The instruction booklet is a great addition.",

It is targeting beginners with watch repair so you may know some of what is in it but in my opinion unless you're professionally going to school for watch making, it's a good way to start.

I appreciated the notice, but several of the tools included are very low quality, where using them is difficult. The tool for removing a pin a bracelet is an example - super cheap quality. The wrench for removing the back of the case does not work smoothly at all. If I had it to do over I\u2019d spend more to getter better quality, and I\u2019m just a beginner.",

In under a minute I was able to open a watch case to replace a battery that I'd needed to replace for years. I have about eight watches to do next. The color manual WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE BOX was very helpful for those of us who didn't go to watch repair school. I'll update again after changing all the watches (and adjusting links on one). For now, five stars. I'm feeling so dumb that I paid like $30 to have a watch battery changed a few years back. No more!",

Thus, now I will have to purchase separately a set of watch repair drivers.
