It is a bit heavy especially bolted to a full frame lens so is a bit cumbersome for walking around with, but if you are used to holding a DSLR it isn't anything more than any other camera. Overall I am very happy with it - especially the swivel rear screen, it really makes taking photos from strange angles easy.",

Pictures need very little post imaging as generally the pictures straight out of the camera are great! People moan about the focussing points are grouped around the middle, no issue for 95+% of photos taken. The touchscreen works well and that has focus points around the whole screen! If you understand photographic theory, are familiar with your kit, and practice photography, you can get a good photo out of any camera!",
