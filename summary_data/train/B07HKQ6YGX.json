It has a good, solid, durable feeling in the hand and the sound quality is great. The volume is fantastic. On my bike I run it at like 4 out of 10 and it's blasting. If you're looking for a studio speaker this isn't it, but if you're looking for something to take out on your bike, or on a picnic, or out in the woods, or in the workshop then this is it. It's a fantastic speaker and well worth the purchase.",

Battery indicator only shows you charge level when you first turn it on. After that, pause, play, or change tracks to display the battery level. Sound profile automatically changes when you exceed a certain volume. Most people won't notice. But I'm sure it does this to protect itself. Bass is plentiful. The rest of the audio range can be tuned by your music app. First impressions are great. We'll see how long it lasts. JBL app requires GPS location. They are data mining. Don't use the JBL app!",

I do have one annoyance when changing volume levels. On occasion the step \"up\" or \"down\" is too great. Making the audio TOO LOUD for the room, or too soft. It needs an in between option, imo.

      "text": "I purchased a similar JBL speaker system for our oldest daughter for Christmas a few years ago and she has raved about hers ever since. She new that I loved music and when she realized that I was interested in this type of a system she urged me to purchase a JBL. In fact, she recommended that I purchase the model a step up from hers. I am thrilled and amazed at the sound this speaker can coax out of my phone! Instead of spending really big bucks on a sound system I spent use over a hundred dollars and I now own a portable music system that sounds like a million bucks! The Lord is good to me!",

Keeping it simple; I can tell you this is an awesome portable speaker for it's price range. I take it to the community pool, BBQ's, outdoor family events and it's perfect! Long lasting battery, good bluetooth connectivity and packs a pretty good punch in both volume and bass. I would maybe consider the larger JBL Xtreme 2 if it goes on sale, but in all honesty this Charge 4 is perfect for what I use it for. Portability to me is more important that a little higher volume and bass. Love the speaker! Well done JBL.",

JBL was the superior speaker for sound in my opinion. The UE speaker wins for features as it comes with a great App that allows for a more customized sound and user experience. Sound quality is what I care about most so I kept the JBL and returned the UE.",

I take it fishing, to parties, camping, kayaking, job sites, cookouts, etc. Its battery life is excellent. I dropped this thing off my kayak and it sank in 2 feet of water for probably 30 seconds and I lifted it out and it was still playing music. Love that you can pair multiple JBL speakers together for even more power. Totally worth the money.",

Out of the box it was lacking a little, but after EQing with my phone it is punchy and exactly what I am looking for. Large enough to carry the tech needed to produce quality sound, small enough to carry around or even throw in my bicycle bag to listen while riding. Not much I can complain about here. If I save up the cash I might buy a second one to get stereo sound, but I haven't honestly missed it that much. Buy one!",

Battery seems to drain on me a little quicker so I make sure I keep it charged after or during use.",

Just because you add some flexy vibrating cones on the ends doesnt mean there will be better bass!!!!!!",
