Tired of replacing the Campell so many times at over $200 each time I thought I'd try something new. At half the price so far this machine is amazing. Way cleaner and easier to maintain this machine does the job. The lather does seam to be a bit pricey but I'll try to mix my own Campell lather mix to see what happens. I took away 1 star because my box was missing the extra pump nozzle and since I need this for my business I just didn't have time to return it.",
