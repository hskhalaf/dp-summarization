I took this Cuisinart baby food maker apart and the heating coil looked disgusting. Check out my pictures. I only got 5 months of use out of this product. So much for using it for more than one child! Cuisinart would not replace it and did not seem to care that their product had contaminated my baby's food.",

      "text": "I like most most things about this product. There are two major issues: (1) After the food is steamed the blade needs to be re-positioned for the blender to work. This is extremely annoying because it means removing the (hot) food, taking the pieces apart and cleaning the machine. I think it's the result of condensation that gets between the blade and the motor. After wiping the post that comes through the motor it generally works. This sometimes doubles the active time it takes to make the food so it's a huge flaw for a busy mom. (2) The post/motor of the blade gets a yucky black residue from each use.",

I can tell you...it IS definitely worth the money! It is so simple. Literally, all you have to do is cut up the veggies or fruit, add the water, and then turn it on to steam. After that, flip the switch to puree. This is an awesome thing to have if you want to make your own baby food. Can't recommend this product enough!",

I was originally worried the plastic would stain, but it has not as of yet. I made yellow squash, carrots, and sweet potato. All came out perfectly. I highly recommend this if you are wanting to make your own baby food.",
