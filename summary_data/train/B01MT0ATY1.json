The pressure control knob did not work well. I could not reliably control the output using it so I had to use the knob on the propane tank to control output.",

Much better than the local discount tool store version, which the connectors kept getting loose as I used it leaking propane at the handle. This unit - no issues and works well. I want another for my left hand, twice the weed killing power!!!",

It shoots out a HUGE flame that immediately incinerates the edges of the plant in question. After a couple of shots, it blows itself out. It's also loud, and between the blast and the fire I fear it would draw a lot of negative attention, even if it stayed lit. One star. I am returning it.",

There was a confusing delay in the shipping ( and the notifications about the shipment) but the seller responded quickly to our concerns and the item showed up as promised. With so many people ordering Items on line there is bound to be some confusion and delays. The sellers quick response was reassuring that our item was on its way. The only thing I would improve on the item, would be a slightly longer handle.....otherwise we are happy with the product.",

This will knock down weeds almost instantly! Keep in mind, be very careful with this as it\u2019s easy to set anything a blaze. I love using this as my fire pit starter! Set up the fire and point this at it for about 30 seconds and BOOM! Fire started. I read this is great to sear steaks as well. Haven\u2019t tried yet but definitely see how this would be effective.",
