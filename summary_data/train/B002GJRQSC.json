They are both older controllers of course. I normally don't give too many 1 star reviews. But in this case, the controller is useless. If I want a 3rd one, I'm going to have to buy another one. I probably would refrain from the red ones since I've had bad luck with them.",

The only thing that might be a little annoying is that it doesn't come with a usb charging cable. You will also need to charge it before you use it because the batteries on these are about dead when you get them but the charge lasts for hours.

This is highly annoying when you are trying to play game like COD or battlefield as your guy wont stay still. I tried to return it but the seller only gave me a $5 refund. Stay away and but a used one from gamestop if you really need to save money.",

Purchasing original controller means better quality, feels great in your hand, the battery will last longer (almost a week, compare to the cheaper alternative that normally you will have to charge them everyday).",
