Folding it takes almost no space at all therefore it isn't a nuisance much like the Wii U's stand which is a major plus. A bit on the small side but the flexibility does make up for that flaw. Worthy purchase.",

It just barely doesn't fit in my case which is not a problem as I can just carry it. But it doesn't have a charging cable hole to go through it. As one who's charger space and wall outlets are limited, this does make it slightly more difficult and requires some thought, but it is manageable and doesn't detract from the rating.",
