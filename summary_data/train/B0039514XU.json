Very concerning; highlights the reason you should never leave a candle unattended I guess. Aftermath picture attached.",

Opinions have been divided on this one, though - I've heard this is a very fall/winter scent, which I can agree with, but I've also had complaints of a pumpkin smell. I don't get any pumpkin, and if I did I wouldn't mind (I like the smell), but for someone who doesn't like pumpkin this is probably not the right candle. If you like amber and bergamot this is for you, though. I have a couple other Nest candles (Ocean Mist & Sicilian Tangerine) and this one is by far my favorite.",

I was so happy to find something nice to fill the house with a scent of Christmas since we have a fake tree, but not something that smelled like fake pine. This isn't trying to copy anything like pine, or cinnamon, or apple spice scent, it's it's own fresh, light, lovely scent. It doesn't smell fake and chemical-ish at all. The candle lasts for many hours. I burned it daily for about a month and it was almost gone by the end. I'd highly recommend trying it.",

The wax burns as a whole - so you don't get the burned out tunnel - which may be why it costs a bit more than other candles. The scent is also fantastic! The quality of the wax and scents makes this my favorite brand of candle.",

I have found only the Henri Bendel candles to be as strong and similarly priced. However, I am not crazy about this particular scent. Very strong white floral that tends to become a bit cloying. Entirely personal preference. It smells beautiful but due to the strength of Nest candles, it's a bit overkill for me.",

I didn't even make it halfway through the first candle.",

I purchased this candle to replace last year's Mrs. Meyers Iowa Pine candle. ($12 w/ shipping for 25 hour burn time last I checked). I would say that the NEST Birchwood Pine is less sweet smelling than the Iowa Pine, which is good in my opinion. Overall, while it is a bit expensive, if you're looking for a candle that will remind you of winter and last all season, this is the one.",
