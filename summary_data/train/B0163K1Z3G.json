I tried my new unit yesterday and I do know that you have to seal the blades onto the plastic glass container rather securely. I did. However, quite a bit of my drink ended up leaking out and dripping down into the motor housing...what?!!? I'm not a weak person, and I do know how to secure the unit prior to mixing a smoothie...but it leaks, simple as that. Totally unacceptable, not to mention somewhat dangerous - I imagine. Returning item for refund. NutriBullet needs to use much more effective gasket, I guess. Roger",

(4) DO NOT put the blade assembly in the dishwasher because the heat from the dishwasher will warp the gaskets ...And warped gaskets can cause leaks. * Follow these 4 steps and you're golden!

The mailing step must be done before any claims can be made. Thanks for making things difficult. We are disappointed by all parties involved in this transaction.

This blender was the perfect substitute! It processed all ingredients smoothly, including kale, and I had the freedom to customize smoothies for my wife and I. The problem with the Vitamix is when you make a smoothie for two, both people need to drink the exact same thing. With the Nutribullet, I can have double the protein powder. The clean-up is easy and the attachments for the cups are great. Great purchase!",

The first lid broke mysteriously after its first use, and the second broke the day before the warranty replacement for the first arrived (the plastic tab that keeps the flip top secured *crumbled* in my hand as I handwashed it). This is a deal-breaker for me because I commute with a smoothie as breakfast. I was uncomfortable with NutriBullet's response to my warranty request - they sent me the lid replacement as a \"one-time courtesy\". Doesn't give me much confidence in their customer service going forward.",
