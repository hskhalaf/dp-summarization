You CANNOT install this fan from room side, you need access up above. Went in easily, the toughest part was the attic crawl and crouch! Installed it, tightened it down and it\u2019s nice and quiet compare to what it was replacing. Not silent by any means, but very reasonable. Good value for the money.",

The exhaust duct \"connector\", flimsy plastic piece, that slips onto side of box is junk. Had to screw it onto the body to keep it from coming off. The way the grill mounts to the light \"reflector/shade\" is junk too. There is all of 1/4\" of a lip onto which you would attach the grill and the pre drilled hole in the plastic grill puts the screw about 1/16\" from the edge of the light shade. Just a cruddy way to design something to attach.",

Even though measurements and everything were the same, we had to remove all the guts and re-install. Had I known we were starting over, maybe would have shopped for other options. The new fan is very nice though and a nice update to the same older model. We originally wanted a fan without a light because there is already a vanity light, and the fan light seems redundant. That lightless model would not fit in this casing (well, either would this one lol) so we just kept the light.",

We picked these fans because we wanted a fan that has some noise to drown out some of the bathroom noises. As for the light brightness, in one small bathroom, we also have a light fixture above the vanity. In the toilet closet we just have this ventilation fan/light and it's bright enough to read a magazine.",
