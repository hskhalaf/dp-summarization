It's too lightweight to function like that, plus there's only 0.68 fl Oz. What I DO use it for it works wonderfully: I mix a little in with foundation before applying it. Improves the spreadability and luminosity of foundations. Plus can help lighten a slightly too-dark foundation. And I appreciate there's NO sparkle or glitter effect thank goodness! \"Lumi Light Infusing\"? Yes definitely. \"Primer\"? Not really.",

When it first tried it on the back my hand, the primer has a very illuminating finish and it felt slightly oily, so I was a little concerned when I applied it to my face this morning (I have combination skin, oily T-zone). But OMG, it made my foundation blend so easily and stayed put all day. My skin also glows really natural and wasn't overly oily at all. I love this product. I think it fits me better than even Benefit's porefessional.",

It can be used as a primer, but I prefer to use my Smashbox primer instead and this Lumi primer after with my foundation. This is a great dupe for the MAC stobe cream, without the hefty price tag!",

It's not too greasy and seems to absorb into the skin moreso than just sitting there. It's worked well with all of my foundations though I do use FitMe the most. I do like that it isn't clear because I can see where it's going when I apply it. It does DRY translucent though.",

It actually is the base of your make up all day make up you do need a primer before putting all your make up on. Remember you don't need a ton just a pump or two shake well before using. You don't even need make up if you just want a little fresh look apply this for a radiant look before running out the house. It goes hand and hand with true match super blender concealer, also true match lumi healthy luminous makeup. Buy all three trust me!!!!!",
