Used for lots of items: pastas (of course), fruits, vegetables, powdered sugar over cakes (worked wonderful)",

They work well as colanders, which is important, but then they collapse down to fit super easily into the dishwasher. They take up a fraction of the space in a cabinet that a normal colander would. It's very easy to collapse and expand them, but they're sturdy enough that they would never collapse while in use. For anyone looking for ways to take up more space in your kitchen cabinets and/or dishwasher, I cannot recommend these. Everyone else should buy them now.",

Cons~ * No drain holes on the sides or even near the edge of the bottom * No feet to help aid proper drainage Pros ~ Collapsible, takes up little space, but so what? Since it doesn't actually function properly, it now takes up TOO much space since it will be rarely if ever used. I do not recommend this item.",
