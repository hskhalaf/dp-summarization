She doesn't like any wet food at all (nope, not even tuna) and will only eat this particular dry food. No matter how hungry she is, if this food isn't in the bowl, she will ignore all the other food and insist we fill up the bowl. (She has her ways of \"insisting.\" You know what I mean.) I realize it's not uber-gourmet health food like some other brands, but she won't eat other brands. She seems to be in great health despite her self-limiting diet, so we're okay with that.",

As an added bonus, the cats don't barf it back up and we don't have hairball issues in this house... and believe me, with all the hair flying around here, that is bordering on miraculous.",

It was like a fifty pound bag, it had to have gone rancid at some point. She really enjoys this stuff, I like that the kibbles are smaller, and it has the ingredients for indoor cats.
