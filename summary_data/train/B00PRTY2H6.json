As always bristles ware out after time .It may not have the curve sides as some others but that's fine for me. Highly recommend this brush .",

The two things it lacks are (1) bristle stiffness and (2) edge bristles. The softness of the bristles reduces the effectiveness of this brush. The lack of edge bristles combined with the broader head make cleaning in tight corners next to impossible. For flat surface cleaning, it works well. For wall cleaning, it is an improvement over standard brushes where you must apply force to maintain wall contact.",

It is a good product and solidly constructed in my opinion there is less downward pressure created than that of my old \"flap brush\" but it is still adequate to do the job well. Highly recommended especially if your pool curves in and out or for brushing horizontally along the upper edges which makes using a regular pool brush less effective because you are unable to get good pressure contact pressure with all surfaces. I think this brush will last well.",

I definitely prefer to use this over my old one but if it had a slightly larger fin, maybe it would push downward more forcefully. It's a good product and I will buy again should it need to be replaced. Just didn't live up to my hopes and expectations regarding improved wall sweeping.",

For the most part, it does hold pretty well to the surface material, but it occasionally takes more than one sweep to clean off algae. It's definitely easier to use than a regular brush that requires some serious upper-body strength to push the bristles against the surface. I would rate this about 4.5 stars and I would buy it again, but I think overall the Whale Tail pool brush is a little better.",

      "title": "Would not recommend this product for the advertised application.",
      "text": "The brush appears to be well made, but the design does not work well. When I attempt to brush the pool wall, the bristles hop down the wall instead of a smooth brushing motion. This is because when brushing the pool wall, the pole is parallel to the pool wall and the bristles are angled forward about 45 degrees. This causes the tips of the bristles to catch on the texture of the wall and the head of the brush hops down the wall. The bristles should be at a right angle to the wall to work correctly.",
