Positive comments surround the shoe in terms of comfort, support, and functionality. The fit of the shoe was also highly regarded by some. On the other hand, the Nova GTX received poor remarks on durability and craftsmanship, especially in the upper.Despite the few criticisms, many users still find the Nova GTX to be an average-performing shoe that is worth repurchasing in the future.",

        "The Merrell Nova GTX has a firm yet comfortable cushioning, according to numerous wearers",
        "The majority of users find the waterproof feature of the shoe to be highly reliable",

        "The shoe is described as lightweight, as well as easy to wear for extended periods, by many reviewers",
        "A lot of comments mention the Nova GTX outsole\u2019s excellent traction, especially on uneven and slippery terrain",

      "cons": [
        "A couple of purchasers have experienced getting a sore foot, particularly with pain at the sides, because of the upper material",
        "According to some reviewers, the outsole is not very durable as it has started to develop holes within only a few months",
        "Aside from the outsole, the upper\u2019s resilience is also doubtful to a few users, as they claim the stitching has fallen apart quite easily"

They look very smart and the mud is easily cleaned off. I will definitely buy another pair but I will buy them a half size larger in the future.",
