I tried contacting them via support@fugetec.com and their corporate address inquiries@lonestargrp.com and no response.

You have to unscrew the top to adjust the camera holder, versus a spring on the older Fugetek model, but this minor nuance is forgiven. Would definitely purchase again and it has been great for capturing photos and videos! Now, if only you can add a stabilizer it to it...",

I was delighted with the packaging, including a nice cloth carrying case. It is sturdy and has clip extensions for various stationary heights. Additionally, which I hadn't even thought of, it can also be used as a \"stick\" to use for selfie-like videos and photos. The Motorola Moto G7 Power is a heavy cell phone and this tripod can handle the weight. It also has knob adjustments for tilting and rotating. I recommend this highly. It is well priced too!",

      "text": "Made of alumni mostly. The feet are sturdy. The extensions have clamps to lock them in places instead of having to twist them to lock the extensions. The cellphone holder is detachable from a 1/4 inch screw, so I can mount a point and shoot camera to it and take selfies by either setting camera timer or using camera manufacturers apps on IOS or Android mobile devices. One piece of advice is to purchase a sand bag or ankle weight to place on the tripod to keep the selfie stick tripod from tilting over because of wind.",

Especially I was amazed how good the remote control quality was because it was able to withstand and didn\u2019t malfunction due to the moisture and water at cave of the winds at niagara falls I wa sable to take pictures right under the water fall. I didn\u2019t even realize this was not water proof and yet its working. Thats some good quality remote. I\u2019ll be using it for few more months and give a final update. For now I am totally satisfied with this product.",
