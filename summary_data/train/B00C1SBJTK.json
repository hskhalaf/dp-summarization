I need a product like this since Emeraude powder is no longer available but this is not the scent for me. It's a powerful scent - definitely not subtle. I was strongly reminded of the air fresheners used in public restrooms at freeway rest stops. Trouble is, you don't know that until you open the Amazon carton but it wasn't an expensive gamble. I'm still looking for a nicely scented feminine body powder because this one was not it.",

I'm happy they thought to put it in the baggie because the plastic container was smashed and it would have been a mess upon opening the shipping envelope. I was able to read the product label and it was talc and a bunch of chemicals. The fragrance is not that of lavender probably because there are no natural scents in it, just chemical analogs. Had I known. No need for me to ask for a replacement, there is no way I would put that chemical stew on my body. Fool me once...",

The lid neither screws on or snaps on, so I use a rubber band to hold it on in case it gets knocked over. The poof is a little to large with no handle and there's isn't a sifter at the top to just get a little talc. I purchased a smaller poof w a handle and considering looking for a better container.
