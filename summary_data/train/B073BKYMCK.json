It makes things super easy to clean and buffing cloth is very good at collecting residue and producing shine. If I didn't have two little ones running around, sticking magnets, and playing on my steel appliances that I would keep this hands downs. However, I do have two little ones and a less hazardous version would help. Not so much the skin or touching, but the possible ingestion after touching is a sure concern for the wife. So, we will use this one carefully. If this isn't a concern for you, then get this as it will help making cleaning things easier for you.",
