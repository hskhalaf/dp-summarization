I have bunions and went to a podiatrist and the only thing he could recommend was either surgery or wear orthopedic inserts. He also prescribed lidocaine and Volteran for the pain. I wasn\u2019t really happy with any of those options... So thought I\u2019d try these shoe stretchers. They work amazing! Now I can wear my favorite shoes, and not have to worry about trying to buy inserts that don\u2019t fit well, or make my feet hurt worse.",

If it had etched size meter on the screw portion and maybe standard narrow to wide range marks for with adjustments it would be more accurate. I'm going to measure my.foot an mark the screw shaft on he next pair and see if I get better accuracy with out the guess work. Overall good item and price.",

Lastly these shoe stretchers can help you with stretching your shoes in length or in width -- this is great particularly because sometimes ballet flats vary in length and not all manufacturers follow a standard length.

My old shoes were often uncomfortable but the next 1/2 size up was sometimes right and sometimes too big. You can only wear so many mules and sandals, am I right? This works for my fabric and \"man made\" material shoes which can be tough. Love that I can add parts to target a particular area, and it comes with a carry bag. Took me a couple minutes to figure out how to use it so the directions could be enhanced. Everyone should own this, life is too short to wear uncomfortable shoes.",

However, the expander options are helpful in that you can easily stretch for length or/and width. Overall, the device is a good bet for your money and I would recommend it.",

After stretching my shoes for a few hours, I went to remove the stretchers, one came out, but the other would not, I literally had to yank it out. I tried disassembling it and putting it back together - no luck. It's really sad, I wanted to like this thing, but it has been such a hassle : (",

Only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that the plastic inserts are in locations that I don't need. It would be better if they had more holes and plastic pieces for say the top of the big toe instead of the side. At least that's where I could use more stretch room in my shoes.",
