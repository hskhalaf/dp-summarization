But at that time the motherboard had what was needed (Generalizing) but no matter the SSD allows it to boot a lot quicker and it does what it meant too.(Minimizing) I'm not built for the \"Future\"",

No conflicts of any sort, and no crashes. The computer boots up and shuts down almost instantly, to say nothing of how quickly the programs start. I'm not a gamer, and don't drive my laptop very hard. I use it mainly for photo editing, and light duty activities like writing, bill paying, shopping, and general surfing. I'm waiting in anxious anticipation for the higher capacity SSDs to come down in price so I can replace the boot drive of my desktop that contains several space hungry audio, video and photo editing programs.",

They could have gotten a slightly better rating, if the mounting brackets had a few more holes in them allowing more mounting choices, but meh, whatever. I would have liked them to be mounted so they can be seen in my case, not so the the brackets can be seen. Good SSD though.",

If you are planning on migrating from a HDD to SSD, I recommend doing your homework. The process is long but worth it. I don't see why some suggest to do a fresh install when Windows 7 can do a backup and restore. Just make sure the aligment is correct, if it isn't, the performance of this drive will be hampered. It's a good drive at a good price.",

Great SSD when it works, but problem is you have no idea how long that'll last. I don't use my computer for maybe more than 3-4 hours per day and yet, I still get a minimum of 3 BSOD's per session.

I sent in two letters with complete documentation and missed out on 30 bucks. After emailing the company and receiving no response at all. I finally decided to give up on this company. After having such a satisfying product the company has left a sour taste in my mouth. I will be looking at a different company for SD drives next time. Advice to others would be buy the drive when the price is low without the rebate.",

    "description": "Size:120 GB| Style:9mmAs the third generation of the legendary VertexSeries,OCZ Vertex3 Solid-state Drives are designed and built to unleash the full potential of the 6Gbps SATA3 interface. The OCZVertex3 pushes the limits in both sequential and random data transfer rates, significantly improving your gaming, multimedia, and overall computing experience over traditional mechanical hard drives. In addition to maximized productivity, a Vertex3 upgrade makes a hard drive- equipped notebook more portable than ever with superior durability and reduced power consumption. Using the latest breakthrough controller and flash technology, Vertex3 SSDs work in perfect harmony with next generation platforms and operating systems to deliver the industry's best storage solution.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nUnleashing the performance potential of the SATA 6 Gbps interface, OCX leads the speed revolution with the next-generation Vertex 3 Series solid state drive. As the first SSD to feature the latest Sandforce controller design, OCZ created the Vertex 3 to push the limits in both sequential and random read/write rates to blaze past the competition when every MB/s matters. \n\nWith incredible random 4k file writes up to 60,000 IOPS, this SSD takes productivity, gaming, and multimedia applications to the next level to work in perfect symmetry with the latest enthusiast platforms. This model of the 2.5-inch Vertex 3 (VTX3-25SAT3-120G) offers 120 GB of storage capacity and a 500 MB/s maximum write speed.\n\nBuilt with the quality, reliability, and durability that lives up to the OCZ name, the Vertex 3 Series easily integrates into today's mobile and desktop platforms, and it features TRIM support to optimize performance over the drive's lifespan as the ultimate Windows 7 companion. It's backed by a 3-year limited warranty.\n\n\n\nThe OCZ Vertex 3 2.5-inch SSD with included adapter (view larger).\n\nSUPERIOR PC EXPERIENCE\nIn addition to maximum performance, a Vertex 3 upgrade promotes cooler, quieter, and more energy efficient conditions compared to traditional mechanical hard drives. With no moving parts, SSDs provide peace of mind with their superior durability and reliability. Read more about SSDs below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE SPECIFICATIONS\nRELIABILITY/PROTECTION\n * Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): 2 million hours \n * Data Path Protection: ECC corrects up to 55 random bits per 512 byte sector (BCH) \n * Product Health Monitoring: Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) Support \n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n * Serial ATA (SATA): Fully compliant with Serial ATA International Organization (Serial ATA Revision 3.0) and ATA/ATAPI-8 Standard Native Command Queuing (NCQ) \n * Operating System: Windows XP 32-bit / 64-bit; Windows Vista 32-bit / 64-bit; Windows 7 32-bit / 64-bit; Linux; Mac OS X \n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n * Native TRIM support (requires OS support) \n * Shock resistant up to 1500G \n * Low power consumption (3W active, 1.65W idle) \n * Included 3.5-inch desktop adapter bracket \n * Service & Support: 3-year warranty, toll-free tech support, 24 hour forum support \n\nTHE SSD ADVANTAGE\nWhether you're refreshing an older laptop or trying to maximize the potential of the latest platform, SSDs provide substantial benefits over traditional hard drives.\n\n\n\nGREATER DURABILITY\nSolid State Drives feature a non-mechanical design of NAND flash mounted to circuit boards, shock resistant up to 1500g. Hard disk drives consist of various moving parts making them susceptible to shock and damage.\n\nFASTER PERFORMANCE\nSSDs have 100 times greater throughput and instantaneous access times for quicker boot-ups, faster file transfers, and overall snappier performance than hard drives. HDDs can only access the data faster the closer it is from the read/ write heads, while all parts of the SSD can be accessed at once.\n\nLESS POWER CONSUMPTION, SILENT OPERATION, AND LIGHTWEIGHT\nSSDs use significantly less wattage at peak load than hard disk drives--less than 2W versus 6W for an HDD--delivering longer battery life in notebooks, less power strain on system, and a cooler computing environment. With no moving parts, SSDs run virtually silent in your notebook or PC case to eliminate distracting noises during gaming or entertainment. And SSDs won't weigh down your laptop, netbook, or tablet PC when you're on the go.\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nOCZ Vertex 3 Solid State Drives unleash the performance potential of the SATA 6Gbps interface, leading the speed revolution in this next-generation solution.
