It doesn't stay at your desired tension. You have to constantly tighten the straps. Last the threading where the Male clasp is just totally failed while on duty. Next thing I knew my taser was just hanging off my leg. Contacted Amazon and they will not help because it's been so long. I am contacting Blackhawk but my fear is that the product I received from Amazon is a knock off and not Genuine. Be aware this product slowly and surely fell apart in under a year.",

Flexible platform/paddle/mounting plate conforms comfortably to any leg. The \"Y\" shaped harness spreads weight for stability and comfort. Once you put this on properly, it can be removed and replaced quickly and easily by just detaching the quick swivel-clips from the belt points, and detaching the two snap-buckles from the thigh. Several mounting points for accessories. Winner!",

Aside from that complaint, the quality is excellent, and it takes every beating you throw at it. I personally removed the upper leg strap, and keep my holster riding mid thigh, I find that a good combination of comfortable and functional, just a personal preference.",

Also works well with quick disconnect holster to thigh system. The only thing I am not keen on is the adapter for quick disconnect is a bit too thick where the holster sticks out away from my thigh, in tight situations it'll not work well. Overall its a tough, reliable system.",
