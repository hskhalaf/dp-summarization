      "text": "I made the mistake of ordering this without reading the two ingredients. One of them is palm oil~the worst most saturated oil of third world countries and processed foods. Palm oil should be illegal. It is VERY unhealthy. I give this to my dog as a treat sometimes in a cone, but will NEVER order again. I just subscribed to Almondee~only one ingredient and MUCH tastier~and of course healthier! I love my dog, but I think the oil won't hurt her (a little at a time) the same way that it hurts the epithelial cells lining human arteries. Buy Almondee instead folks! :)",

It seemed to have a good amount of excess liquid at the top for a no stir nut butter and I don't like the taste as much as the cashew variety. The biggest issue is that on both Amazon and the Justin's website it shows that the almond butter is 190 calories per serving but the jar I received shows its 220 calories per serving. Not sure how this could be different from listed but definitely would like some explanation.",

That was pretty easy - Almond butter. The problem is that all the options in my local grocery stores are made on machines that also process peanuts! Justin's saved the day, by having almond butter that is processed in a facility that is peanut free! I already had tried, and this tastes just as great! Also, I didn't have any issues with oil separation. Just a bit of oil on top the first time I opened it, but no more separating after that.",

No other nuts added like many other almond butters I've tried which makes it ideal for me as we can't have cashews and other nuts in our household. It's simple and delicious...highly recommend. If you're a coconut lover, the Almond Coconut is absolutely delicious...just a touch more sugar though.",

Hmm, turns out that is because there is none in it. It is very dry and almost impossible to spread. I wanted it to spread down the center of my celery stalks, but basically I just have to put little dabs along the stalk, since it doesn't really spread. Having said that, the TASTE is great. Yes, there is some graininess, but not much. Just good flavor. Now to figure out a way to make it usable for my celery snacks.",

    "description": "Size:1 Pound (Pack of 1)Nut Butter Almond Classic Jar. It is a high quality healthy product. This product is good for health. This product is manufactured in united states.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nJustin's Products Our products are made with common sense and the highest quality. We think that selectively choosing fine, naturally delicious ingredients creates better tasting products. And we are certain your tastebuds will agree. Enjoy our naturally delicious, high-quality nut butters, nut butter snacks and organic peanut butter cups for their great taste, unique texture and convenient nutrition.\n\nNuts for Sustainability At Justin\u2019s, we strive to make more than delicious products; we hope to make a difference. To name just a few initiatives: Mindfully Sourced Ingredients, Pollinator Conservation, Hunger Relief Support, Organic and Rainforest Alliance Certified Cocoa...and many more! As we grow, so does our ability to give back. Join us. \n\n\n\n\nOne-of-a-Kind Grind It all started with a jar. With the help of a simple food processor and the highest quality ingredients available, Justin revolutionized the world of nut butter to create products driven by a passion for delicious taste, unique texture and quality ingredients. First, he created them for his adventures. Now, he makes them for you.\n\nFirst Ever Nut Butter Squeeze Pack As the first nut butter brand to market protein-packed nut butters in single-serve squeeze packs, Justin\u2019s provides a convenient source of nutrition for an active lifestyle. Available in 7 varieties, squeeze packs are perfect to enjoy on toast, fruit or right out of the pack. So, give your favorite nut butter a squeeze anytime, anywhere and on anything.\n\nPeanut Butter Cup Perfection What\u2019s more perfect than peanut butter and chocolate? By blending his artisanal peanut butter with high quality chocolate, Justin created a better-for-you alternative to the conventional peanut butter cup. 100% organic, Rainforest Alliance-certified, gluten free and delicious. Yup, it\u2019s how a peanut butter cup should taste. Available in dark, milk, or white chocolate, and miniature-sized if you're adventurous.\n\n\n\n\n#fueledbyjustins The story began in 2004 when Justin Gold, a lover of the active lifestyle, moved to Boulder, Colorado in his 20\u2019s. In order to fuel his long bike rides, Justin embarked on a mission to create new varieties of nut butter that not only packed the protein, but also tasted great. He began crafting the very first batches of his now-famous, culinary nut butters in his home kitchen.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Company Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nNuts. Fuel. Delicious.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nGiven that nut butter was a staple in my vegetarian diet, plain old peanut butter just wasn\u2019t cutting it. I started grinding my own flavors and an assortment of experimental nut butters began to fill the cabinets. After weeks of hungry roommates stealing my tasty creations, I wrote my name on the jar and Justin's was born.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nWhen I first started making nut butter, I didn\u2019t overthink whether it was \u201csmooth\u201d or \u201ccrunchy\u201d, I just made it because it tasted good, that is made with common sense ingredients and fills a lifestyle need. That\u2019s what I continue to do today, focus on making naturally delicious products. It\u2019s simple really. Simple, and delicious.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nIt\u2019s the creative and collaborative aspect of innovating that makes every day exciting. And, as we grow, we continue to invest in our commitment to corporate consciousness. We have the opportunity to truly be visionaries and develop great tasting products that people love.",
