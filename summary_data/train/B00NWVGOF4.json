The result (assuming you use a color laser printer) is a high quality, waterproof, non-smearing map that I can write on. The paper doesn\u2019t fold as neatly as wood pulp paper, but it is super tough and rip-proof\u2014you can stuff it anywhere and it comes out fine. I highly recommend if you want custom maps for adventures of any sort.",

Taking notes in the morning when there is dew on the leaves can be particularly difficult because paper gets soggy and some water proof papers smudge as the leaves rub on them. With this paper there are no worries as long as you use the correct type of pen. The ones we like to use are the UNIball Power Tank RT. I did a test one time and was able to write on this paper while running it under the sink with no smudges using the aforementioned pen.",

      "text": "After printing the ink was wet and would smear. I printed 6 sheets and let them dry over night. I ran them underwater and they smeared badly and kept smearing as long as they were wet. I then printed with National Geographic Adventure paper I have used many times. As always it came out the the printer dry and not matter how long keep it in the water it never smears. Yes, it costs a lot more but I clearly cannot rely on the TerraSlate paper. I now have a lot of tear proof but not water proof paper that I really have no use for.",

I tried a couple of No Parking signs to tape to a garage door to test the paper out. After a week that included high winds, lots of hard rain and exposure to the southwest sun, The sign looks like I just printed it. No runs or streaks of any kind. Time will tell how it stands up to sunlight. I will be getting more, only the 7 mil weight as 4 mil is like the 20# standard paper.",
