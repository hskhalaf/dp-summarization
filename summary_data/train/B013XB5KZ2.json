        "The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 has an eye-catching design and high-end hardware, and it takes great outdoor photos",

        "With a nonremovable battery and no external storage option, the Note 5 strips away some of last year's features",

If they are smart, they will release SOON a Note 5C (classic) with Note4 body, cover, battery, SD Card.",
