But be aware, compared to the B+ model, it has half the RAM, a quarter of the USB ports, and no ethernet. I'm using it to connect to my 3D printer via USB and to the network by Wireless, and it is great. Octoprint worked great on it, but I found an annoying bug in the image, so installed Repetier-Server instead, which works, but pushes the 512mb RAM to the limit, so may require occasional rebooting.",

Wouldn\u2019t recommend as an everyday computer. Browsing is a little slow but great for fun projects.",
