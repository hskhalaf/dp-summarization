The fact that while you race, you are searching for bubbles with treasures, is an added goal to achieve 100% completion on a level. We purchased a used copy, but it looked brand new and works wonderfully. We have now completed it and will probably start over. Very happy with this game.",

It runs smoothly, has a ton of costumes, imaginative tracks, great music, online functionality, the ability to create your own (and play others') tracks.

I personally loved this game (and I've played nearly ever blue-shell-infested mario kart, as well as Modnation Racers and Sega & All Stars RAcing Transformed.",

      "text": "I've only been playing this kart game for a few days, but I love it. At first glance, it seems pretty simplistic. It's not so easy to guarantee a victory. The more you play, you find strategies that will put you ahead and, more importantly, keep you ahead of the other racers. I'm finding that, to obtain all of the treasures of the game, there's a lot of skill required, but the game doesn't force you through anything like that. Even on the harder \"normal\" setting, a few races should net you the luck to place in one of the upper levels and proceed with the story but, if you aim for perfection, you'll find the game very challenging.",

So that was a plus. Very similar to ModNation Racers, but with LBP elements and style. Which is fine with me because I love both games. BIGGEST BUMMER is that in your pop-up, they mix together the items you have with items for sale and it really clutters up customizing your car/sackboy. And you don't get all the costumes/items/stickers you earned in LBP1 and LBP2, which I sort of expected since LBP2 supported the LBP1 stuff.",
