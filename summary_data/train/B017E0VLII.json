I like the fact that it has simple ingredients and is a USA product. There's some fragrance, but it isn't highly perfumed. I also like that it can be also be used for massage. On hot days, it does become runny, but I've found that shaking and pouring/running cool water over the tube resolve this issue. I'll be using this as my anti-chaffing solution from now on.",

It's got all natural ingredients, so I don't need to worry about excess artificial or dangerous chemicals leeching into my body. It smells great, too...not like chemicals and the lemongrass smell isn't overpowering at all. It just smells very fresh and clean.",

However, due to it's more lotion like texture it's not great as a long lasting chamois cream which is what I got it for. It had decent reviews, so I thought it'd be worth a try but I won't get it again. The consistency lets it just get absorbed into the chamois too easily to be useful on all day bike adventures. The ingredients are soothing and definitely make your skin soft, but it's not durable enough to be used exclusively as a chamois cream. I'll probably get the tried and true Assos cream everybody else uses next time.",

      "text": "I had previously purchased a product by Monistat that is great for preventing pudgy thighs from sticking together when wearing a skirt. I needed a replacement and in a hurry before a trip, so I ordered this product. It is not similar and does not meet my needs. Rather than allowing body parts to glide past each other, this product is sticky and feels almost like rubbing vaseline on my thighs. It has the opposite effect of what I was looking for. It may be a great product for athletic uses, but ladies, if you want to wear a skirt in warm weather without thigh issues, this is not what you want.",

    "title": "Ruby's Lube Voted Best for Triathlons and Ironmans Anti- Chaffing Chamois Cream | All Natural and Made in USA | Water & Sweat Resistant | Formulated by a 7 Time Ironman Winner - 3 oz Tube",
    "description": "Ruby's Lube is an ALL NATURAL lubricating anti-chafe balm, with 5 simple ingredients: olive oil, lemongrass, calendula, beeswax and benzoin. Ancient to skin care, these ingredients ease friction and chafing common to swimmers, cyclists and runners. Ruby's Lube works because the oils prevent friction while the beeswax keeps moisture and sweat away from the skin preventing tissue breakdown. \n\nRuby's is not only great for athletes but can be used by the entire family for any dry skin condition. Use Ruby's to moisturize dry feet and elbows, soothe a baby's bottom, massage sore muscles or enhance a romantic evening. Recommendations: Start with less, a little goes a long way and enjoy more as needed. Separation is normal in natural products, just squeeze the tube to blend. Use hot soapy water to remove from fabric and body. Apply before exercise or diapering. If you missed a spot and have chafing, apply to chafed area to promote healing. Store at room temperature.\n\n \n\n Chris McDonald, a 7 time Ironman winner, and a proud father of 3 children, makes Ruby's in a small artisan workshop in Boulder, Colorado with the love of his life, Erika.\n\n \n\n\"As an athlete, I love that Ruby's is all-natural, smells great, and above all else works amazingly well. I have competed with this product for 8 years, and I also use it as a diaper rash cream for all our children.\"\n\n \n\nRuby's comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If this cream disappoints, please let us know and we will make it right. Have questions about how to apply the cream before an Ironman? Simply message us and Chris will be happy to give you some helpful Ironman hacks (did you know that putting Ruby's on your wrist and ankles will help in taking off your wetsuit in record time?).",
