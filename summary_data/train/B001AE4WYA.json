I put it in the closet and after almost 2 year2 I took it out I turn it on and with no hesitation it printed up 6 amazing prints just as it did way back when. I read something about the ink being too expensive I guess that would be the case for any printer, remember you are printing from home not having to get in your car and drive to a store. Hope this helps.",

Next time I will do my homework. If you just want to use this for special prints here and there, then buy it. If you are an avid printer like me... forget this printer.",

The original ink cartridge that came with it is still in there, and I have already printed 30 or more pictures so it isn't going as quickly as some have posted (thankfully!). Overall, you can't beat the price, portability, and capability this little printer offers! I'd recommend it for those who aren't constantly printing, but like to print occasionally.",
