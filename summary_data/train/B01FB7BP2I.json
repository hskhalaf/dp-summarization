Seriously, this should be considered animal cruelty. I am glad they didn't send a queen, because we let the poor survivors go so they could live out their sad little lives in the sunshine, and real dirt in our backyard. Also, the weird blue wetish gel molds. DO NOT get this ant farm!",

Update 2/3/2019 Today I took the top off and left the farm on it's side under the trees. They have no queen so won't reproduce biting bugs in the yard.

Make sure you're getting harvester ants as they are the best for tunnelling etc. Per the instructions I mad three holes to get them started and they got to work immediately. It's been less than 24 hours and they already have a huge tunnel going down the side and another splitting into two. Our 4 year old loves it and we do too!",

We used popsicle sticks and a large Tupperware container to collect. Then inserted a small funnel in the top and used the popsicle sticks again to get them in about 2 at a time by lightly scraping them in without getting dirt mixed in. They started digging almost immediately. Per instructions, we helped with a couple starter holes 1/4\" deep or so. No dead ants and they are all very active and fun to watch work. Enjoy!!",
