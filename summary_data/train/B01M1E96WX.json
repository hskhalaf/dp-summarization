Still decent enough though. update: I went from 4 stars after the first couple weeks, to 3 stars about 2 months in, and now 7 months later, I'm giving it a 1 star. The cushion on this chair has just completely given up and has compressed into a thin, tough pancake. I ended up having to buy a seat cushion so my butt wouldn't hurt so much sitting on this. Do yourself a favor and buy an Alera Elusion chair instead. I got one at work, and its heavenly. Absolutely worth the $140 price tag compared to this junk chair at the cost of $100.",

      "text": "Great chair, very comfortable. The moveable arms are a nice touch. I am a big person and I feel comfortable in this chair, and it adjusts to the perfect height to work comfortably at a desk. One tip- when putting the chair together, ignore the instructions and build one side of the chair first. Attach the back to the arms first then connect to the base one side at a time. It will reduce your frustration during assembly.",

I only bought another one because my roommate borrowed it and I wanted a different color. I was so excited when I found the same chair but in purple. So she got to keep the old one. The first one was blue. The chair is easy to assemble except for getting the back on. I\u2019m not sure how you could do that with one person. Amazing chair for the quality. Similar chairs are 200-300 dollars.",

The lumbar support is nice, and the upper part of the chair cradles your shoulder blades nicely. It's also nice that the arms fold up so I can roll it up to my desk to save space. The seat cushion isn't anything special. There is no headrest, and minimal recline. After about a month, the support is already showing some signs of decline, so I don't imagine any back support will be left after about a year. Still, the chair is working for me and my herniated disk, but I only sit for 3-5 hours a day in it.",

When you recline in the chair you can hear the pressboard inside the back of it crack. This is some Wish quality furniture. Pros: price, looks nice. Cons: flimsy and unstable, cheap materials start falling apart almost immediately.",
