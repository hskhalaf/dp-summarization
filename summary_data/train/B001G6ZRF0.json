It is fantastic for posture. The minute I lean back against it, my back curves where it should which causes my abdomen to expand with each breathe as it should. The effect on my breathing is wonderful. I know it is sold as a back aid but it should also be listed as a deep breathing aid. And I have noticed that when I get up from the chair to do other things, my posture is much better. My spine feels great and I even feel taller.",

The item is simply way too hard, way too rigid and way too high of an arch for safe use by someone with any of these issues. I sincerely believe you could make such condition(s) worse and my experience was it simply is way too painful to be of any practical use.",

If you've got a lower back issue, put this on your phone and show the picture to your doc. It might be just right for you, too. It's also great for overall stretching and this little gadget is now quite popular at my house.",

The cushioning is soft but firm, with no pressure on your spine. After lying on it for few minutes, I can feel my body start to relax as tight muscles relax. You'll find you're stiff on it at first, then gently your body adjusts to your spine being in alignment. Great for back, neck, shoulder pain, or general stiffness.",

I purchased this back stretcher and the first time I tried it out I was able to pop the spots in my back I haven't been able to for a long time. I felt instant relief. Its a great sturdy product. Says it supports up to 250 lbs but I'm closer to 300 and it held up fine. You can use it on your side as well to get the hips and more stretched. Would definitely purchase again.",
