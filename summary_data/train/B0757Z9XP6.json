Expected a lot more for the money here, I wouldn't buy it again or any other pro version of this from Razer at this point.",

The intake vents are two small and exit vents are essentially blocked by the screen. I tried laptop cooling pads and elevating the laptop. Elevating seemed to help but after about an hour the laptop would crash. I owed the laptop for about two weeks and now Razer is replacing it. We will see if the new laptop will work properly. If not, I will continue to contact Razer to either honor the warranty or provide a refund.",
