But that being said, I highly recommend that you buy two and have someone help, because I can't think of anything in the house except maybe the refrigerator, that me and my girlfriend can't move ourselves. Up until now moving is hard because its bulky and it's tough to pick up. Most furniture etc is not all that heavy if you can get a good hand hold. We've moved a king sized mattress, a double wall oven, washer and dryer, a huge sideboard and many other items with these.",
