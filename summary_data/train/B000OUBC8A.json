The results speak for themselves. I\u2019ve been nothing but elated with my results! The left is the same routine/products before SOTC, the right is the same but with the denman brush. Amazing!",

And if you follow the directions and brushed your sectioned hair gently from the bottom up, THERE IS NO PAIN.

I also like using this Denman to dry-brush my hair in between washings, because the tight firm bristles really fluff my hair out, which I enjoy because I think it looks natural, healthy and voluminous! Best brush i've owned yet. This brush also seems very sturdy, high-quality, like it will last me years and years. I would recommend / purchase again.",

The brush also evenly distributed my hair products right after washing (when my hair is still damp) to loosen + soften the curls, while still retaining the spiral of the \"curl.\" I also noticed the brush is causing far less breakage, and is easier to work through my hair during the untangling process.

I have used it on my granddaughters' whose hair is long and fine with no problems as well. I look forward to many years with this brush. My old one was around for a very long time and this definitely is as well made.",

That doesn't do very much for buildup though. This brush helps to break up scalp buildup and stimulate my scalp! I absolutely love it. I want to buy one for my mom too!",

Now I believe I'm a 3b the way curly type, but I've tried this on my sister 4c and it detaches great but I didn't see any definition in her curls. Just a heads up from,what I observed",
