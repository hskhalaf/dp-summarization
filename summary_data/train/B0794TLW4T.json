I have 285. Sony makes a good product but you need to educate yourself on them first.",

Bluetooth is spotty, sometimes it will disconnect or sometimes it only lets you stream music but not make calls. The microphone is in the head unit and works well. No need to run a mic cord. Mp3 or aac songs on a USB memory stick play really good. Sound is great. Also will read the memory stick very fast. Remote takes a little bit to get used to. One feature I've never seen before on a head unit, this unit will display the cars battery voltage. Kinda cool.",

I had the speakers hooked to a jvc head unit previously and this Sony made a huge difference. Bluetooth works great - i love not having an external microphone and the built in one is more than enough. Set up and software are extremely easy to use which is a big plus. Only downside is I haven t been able to hook my Samsung to the usb and have it read it - might have to update my phone though. Head unit comes with installing tools, remote and dashboard sleeve. I definitely recommend this product",
