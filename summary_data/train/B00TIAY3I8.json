I daily turn on iHeart radio on my smart LG tv and listen to music. The Bluetooth subwoofer is nice because I have it across the room sitting on the bottom of a bookshelf. Very subtle - just needs an electrical outlet. The soundbar integrates with my TV and turns on with the TV. It doesn't turn off with it though?? It came with all mounting hardware and I have no complaints.",

Matched with my LG TV and a SONY BluRay with WiFi ans Bluetooth, watching broadcast TV, movies and listening to Pandora or my own downloads is outstanding entertainment. In retrospect, I should have bought this unit in the first place rather than the one i did at one of the big membership wholesale stores. Really, the quality of the sound reproduction rivals that of models costing two to three times as much.",

If the sub woofer wasn't messing up this unit would be perfect. This is the third one I had and none of them lasted more than a few weeks. Maybe I'm just cursed.",
