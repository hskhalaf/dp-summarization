The reservoir is on the LEFT side of the machine. This almost forces right handed people to pour with their left hand. If your coffee maker is to the right of a wall, refrigerator, etc., it\u2019s almost impossible to pour without spilling. Earlier Keurigs had a hatch over the reservoir so you could lift it and pour water inside. To add water, this Kerueg requires you to remove the entire lid.

We use reusable cups, sold by kureg, and water started overflowing the cups - which resulted in grounds in the brewed coffee. Contacted Kureg directly and they were of no help. Refused to address our issues or provide guidance on how to troubleshoot except to say we needed to use filtered water - which we do. We down graded back to the basic kureg in march and have been much happier with a coffee machine that actually works.",

The aluminum open/close handled and mechanism feels much better and more sturdy than the old one. The internal mechanism must be very different because it is much more quiet and pleasant sounding. The controls are intuitive and effective. I really like how you don't have to wait for it to heat after turning it one to make brewing selections. If you are thinking about upgrading, this version is much improved over past models.",

We have had Keurig brewers for some time, and have generally happy with them, but this K-Elite is very poorly designed. For example, there is no way of knowing that a special brewing temperature (e.g. 187F) has been set excerpt by going through the entire menu or waiting for the menu to stop blinking. Even worse, if the coffee maker brews first and then removes the pod and closes the lid, the tea maker has to wait (one full minute) until the size-selector menu stops blinking before the brew temperature can be changed. Very frustrating.",

Breakers for kitchen and baths are dual AFCI/GFCI and it trips those. Breakers for bedrooms, living room, dining room are ACFI only and it trips those too. This brewer looks good and has nice features. If your breakers aren't ACFI, then it will probably work without issue.",

This one worked fine for 1 month, but began acting up after that - water would heat, but the coffee maker would shut itself off after I pressed a brewing button. I called Keurig, with no success. This is the worst coffee maker I've ever purchased!",

The maker we replaced was very bad at not giving out the amount you asked for but this thing will ,just as often ,give out too much so you need a cup that can handle to over run. When this thing gets too unreliable we will not replace it with keurig.",

The K-Elite is quiet and we have been quite satisfied until it started leaking water similar to other customer reviews. It has leaked water twice and the coffee maker is not even a month old. Called Keurig Customer Service this morning and after a 10 minute conversation, Keurig is sending me a new unit. I'm hopeful the replacement coffee maker will not have the same issue. Will do a follow-up review after I receive the replacement unit and run it thru its paces.",
