This box is heated by wires underneath a cloth sheet that you lay the rocks on. This results in spotty heat, making my stones different temperature some cooler than others. It does not heat up much. It is also extremely hard to clean because of any oil gets on the cloth that covers the heating element your basically out of luck",

The difference between this 1 and my other 1 is that this 1 is bigger and comes with more rocks. Also the cord is detachable and has different settings. My last 1 looked just like it, just smaller and the cord was attached. Thats actually why it went out. The cord shorted out from being bent when packed. I love that the cord comes out so now i dnt have to worry about that again. It also heats up very fast and efficient. I love it. Great buy.",

The metal case is a bit thin, but it does heat the stones in about 30 minutes, and they stay hot for some time.

My only complaint is that the thin felt-like material on the inside of the case seems cheap; otherwise, the stone kit works as advertised.",
