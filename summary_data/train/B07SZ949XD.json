So if you're on the border of your size definitely go up by a half or full size. They're a kind of matt suede and are great if you don't want bling \"look at me shoes\" They've held up nicely in the few months they've been used, including being caught in a shower a few times. I'll update if they start wearing prematurely. Overall comfortable and nice looking shoe. Great for anyone who misses the old Vans!",

The muted black on black colourway works well, the sole is comfortably cushioned, and the tongue and ankle well padded. Unlike Faders or Lo-cuts, these seem to have less height in the toe box, and have a seam running the full width across it, so until you break these in it is worth wearing good socks, but once you do these are comfortable, keep your feet securely in place, and muted enough to wear in the office without obviously looking like you're wearing trainers (result!)",
