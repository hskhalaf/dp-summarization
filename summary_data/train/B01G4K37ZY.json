In other words, one bike has front wheel and another one had rear wheel in the rack. There is also space to hang some bags on the wall. The zipper glides smoothly and so far my bikes stayed dry in the rain.",

We relied on our camping day experiences. Yardstash was a good choice!!! It is sturdy and has an easy heavy duty zipper.",

Also, one of the Roof poles had the elastic rope (that keeps them together) snapped back to the first pole. It took about an hour to get it back through all the 3 poles.",
