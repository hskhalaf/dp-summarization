It works well, looks very nice and shipped very quickly. I have no idea about the quality of the horn - I only know that it sounded good to us and everything seems to work just fine. Amazon shipped this very quickly and it arrived in mint condition, with a great padded carrying case. Overall, we were very impressed and the price was less than 5 months rental.",

Apparently this is something they cannot fix. I am afraid I was sold a lemon, with plastic parts that do not have easy to find replacements. Of course, this all happened just outside the one-year warranty.",
