      "text": "I had higher expectations for goji play based on the description. Unfortunately, the games you can download for it are pretty boring and not very engaging to play so I lost interest in the system after only a couple uses. I tried about 10 games and everyone just seemed tedious. I got it to help make my exercise bike rides more motivating when I would do very long rides but listening to a decent playlist on my phone is more motivating than these games. I feel like this had a lot of potential but they really blew it. If the games were better, this could be a good thing.",

That was the interesting part. The disappointing part is the fact you are charged for each game. The free ones are pretty basic and the novelty runs out quickly. My hope as that as this product matures and the competition expands that the games offered will expand and they will stop gouging you for what should be part of the package.",
