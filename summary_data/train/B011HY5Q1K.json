The dial selector doesn't translate from the commonly established settings that everyone publishes on their packaging for the larger rotary spreaders. The Wizz does come with a little instruction card to do that but that's annoying to keep around. I've included a picture of that. I wish it was at least printed on the Wizz. 2. I wish it was a little bigger but that's a minor gripe. Otherwise it's a well made and designed product. I like the built in loop to enable it to be hung up as well as it comes with batteries already installed.",

Cons: 1)Less than 10lbs spread (when set on 3-1/2 or 4) on 4 AA Batteries. Batteries went in at 1.65v, it quits when they are down to 1.46v (remember these are 1.5v batteries!)- obscene usage. 2)Tried with with Barricade and Eagle (medium and small grain products). The angled bottom will not keep the hopper fed unless you tilt the whole machine downwards at a 30 degree angle-which is hard on the wrists. 3) the very small screw holding the battery cover on makes it a PITA to change the batteries; takes several minutes each time.",

If you pull the trigger in and immediately release it again, it normally closes and shuts off.",

The switch then stuck in the running position and I finally got the thing to stop. Boxed it up and it is ready to go to the UPS Store in the morning. I really like the design as it is much more ergonomically comfortable than a hand crank spreader. Unfortunately, Scotts did not put any effort into making the damn thing work!",

However, passing very large crystals through the chute tends to jam the mechanism. If you get the opening small enough not to jam the mechanism then sometimes the arm inside the bucket will get jammed. Maybe if you get really fine grained salt this won't be an issue.",
