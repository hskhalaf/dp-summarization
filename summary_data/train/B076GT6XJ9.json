      "text": "Bought this headset a few days ago and it has amazing sound and the ear cups are very comfy, but like a lot of people my ears press against the drivers inside, making them uncomfortable after a while. I contacted Hyperx directly about this issue with the cups and they said they have revised the design of the ear cups for this headset and said they will send me some free of charge. So if you do get this headset and experience some issues with comfort, don\u2019t worry, go to the hyperx websites customer service and ask about the new ear cups (they will be available at the end of the month 30/4/18 ish). Hope this helps people:)",

These have cables and a mic that detach, so if the cable frays (although the cable does seem a lot better made than the plastic coated ones I\u2019ve had in the past) or breaks you can replace it. Also very, very comfortable to wear (contrary to other reviews) they ooze quality and deliver superb, rich sound. Perfect for Call of Duty. More expensive than I\u2019d normally pay, but hopefully they should last a lot longer, and if the wire breaks, spares are available for around \u00a315. Recommended.",

They are as good as new still. The sound and mic quality are excellent. I'd recommend this over the Cloud X because of the detachable cable. My son damaged the jack on his last headset and that was that! With this any damage to the jack would just mean a new cable - so although slightly more expensive, the Cloud Alpha could be cheaper in the long run. Both the gold and red versions look great. Highly recommended for a great gaming experience!",

Not really what you expect when it costs around \u00a380. It was like this from new, and I haven't found a workaround. There's no sound card with this, so as far as I know, no way to update drivers. very disappointing.",
