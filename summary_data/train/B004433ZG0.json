      "text": "Very high quality. The cable or lock mech could easily be cut, but the idea is to make the equipment \"theft resistant\" not \"theft proof\". My laptop is less easy to steal so hopefully a potential thief chooses just to move on to the next office. The permanently affixed security stud is very unobtrusive when not locked down. Slim and low-profile. The stud can be easily removed when not locked up (unscrewed with the provided allen wrench) so if you decide you don't need the lock anymore, it's a 30 second task to remove it. I'm really satisfied that I chose to spend the extra few dollars for this upgraded version.",

      "text": "NOTE: This was bought for my iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2019) I've always had a laptop that I could stash in a safe when I wasn't at home, so I was kind of worried about getting a desktop computer that could stolen during a robbery. This solution puts me at ease. The cable is 1/4\" braided steel cable encased in rubber. I have it looped around a let of my desk. If someone really wants it, they could probably figure-out a way to get it off or cut it free with the right tools, but it will definitely discourage a crash-and-grab from bothering and leave them with an XBOX or something I don't really care that much about.",

Simply press the end of the cable lock onto the small knob (supplied) that you previously installed onto your computer and its locked. No effort! The key is only needed to unlock the cable. This simple type of connection ensures you won't get lazy about locking down your computer. I can't figure out what is not to like about this well designed system",

This was about 1/2 the price but better features. No looseness at the computer area where you lock it. Easy to install. Has a key which I think is better than a combo lock. But that's just me. I think the main benefit is that the small \"button\" that you put in the \"lock\" area really makes the lock tight when you \"plug it in\". I would buy it again or recommend it to family.",

The nub attaches easily and stays on, little sticky to attach/detach the cable, but still highly recommend this lock.

The coating over the cable and two cable collars thoroughly covers the metal to prohibit scratches on the equipment you're trying to secure, as well as the equipment's anchor. The cable will not stop a thief with large cable cutters or the tools to remove the anchor, but spontaneous theft should be thwarted. It does occur to me that a thwarted theft might turn into vandalism though.",

While the button that is left in the security slot may interfere with some of the form fitting sleeves, it makes it much quicker and secure while putting less wear on the computer body and surround. The keys are also a great size and while this is only a deterrent, this lock comes in at the top of my list.",

The cut-away section in the side could be a bit larger, so you could fit more than just 4 cords through it... and it should ideally have a rubberized inner-ring so it would not slip around so loosely... in my opinion... but I\"m splitting hairs. To be fair this is an excellent product, and there is nothing like it on the market.",
