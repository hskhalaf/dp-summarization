Eight hours later there was no ice left all warm water, and the water jug sweated at the same time I had another 64 oz water travel jug from a well known brand and there was minimal effected to that jug 90% of ice remaining ! The coldest water bottle sells for $43 ! I returned the bottle immediately... Test it for yourself......",

So I just top off with more ice and add ice water, and I can keep it going longer without having to fill the whole thing with ice. All I can say is try it,I guarantee you won't be dissapointed.",

My kids also love the carrying handle because it's the perfect shape and size to carry comfortably. It's also very durble. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the rubber strip around the bottom area ripped off one of them the first week.",
