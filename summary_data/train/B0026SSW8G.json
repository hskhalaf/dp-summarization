The 'return window' has closed and now we're stuck with the sprayer. We bought the extended warranty and that doesn't seem to cover anything. We have four hours of trouble shooting time and twenty minutes of total painting time.",

      "text": "I am an amateur painter. This unit worked really well. Reading directions is key to get it right - don't wing it. You'll regret it. I painted an entire 4 bedroom, single floor historical house in about 4 hours max it's that fast and good. Rolling or brushing would have taken days especially on overhangs and lattice crawlspace coverings. Painters quoted me $4k to paint the house so this saved me a HUGE amount of money. I suggest you buy the longest hose so you can really keep moving without reposition unit. For some reason, I could not get the extension wand to work. Possibly user error but something to consider.

The cleaning process is easy and fast. Cleaning is easier than opening up the old unit to lubricate it, all you do is put suction tube in the Pump Armor and your done. One more item I like is the sprayer hose gets pressurized and pump turns off. As you spray it turns on and off as needed to keep the sprayer pressurized, much quieter.",

Painting an exterior is not a simple DIY project but with this equipment it is doable and extremely rewarding. Highly recommend this sprayer.",

I wasn\u2019t sure of keeping this, and seriously considered rolling the paint on. After paining the garage in only minutes, I realized this was the way to go. As others have said this model is made for DIYers and probably not suitable for painting every day. That being said, it\u2019s an incredible sprayer and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased.",
