The first one turned on automatically whenever you closed the door so that went back but thanks to the amazing service of Amazon we had another on our step within 24 hours. It is spacious, not too bad looking, and does the job. What I find annoying is that the big buttons on this thing are for \"soften\" and \"melt\" which seems ridiculous. Why is it not \"start\"? On every microwave I've ever had, \"start\" was the big main button. But other than having a bit of a mess when it comes to keypad layout, it does the job just fine.",

We ordered another in hopes that this particular item was just a fluke, but I'm apprehensive that the replacement will work either.
