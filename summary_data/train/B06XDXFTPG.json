The company b.c wisely included a well-made carry bag t h.g at actually includes shoulder straps for portability. Maybe the one thing I didn't like were the stamped metal stakes. I picked up some better quality after-market stakes. All good. Excellent visibility from inside whether for hunting, bird watching, or wildlife photography. And the price is fair.",

Enough room for two traditional bow shooters plus equipment. Even better for rifle seasons; 4 people, plus equipment. Is a little heavy on the down side; about 35 plus lbs take it or leave it...using this blind you need to have another person to help you carry your bow and bow's equipment. With care, this blind will last for years. Hope this help you guys out my fellow archers.",

It\u2019s also super easy to set up. I love the hook and loop closure on the 180 window, the strap style adjustment of the gap, and the fact that me and my two kids hunted from this blind with plenty of room to spare! If you\u2019re looking for a big blind for multiple people, stop looking and click buy now, because you found it!",

The only problem I've had with it is the cary bag during the fitting of the steps to me it tore on the seam at the shoulders I can easily see it but if this happened in the field I would be understandably irritated at the poor quality of the bag material and its stitching but that's why I do trial runs before open season. Will update after it's been used through the season.",

Also the black out fabric is nice, cheaper ones have a black paint or vinyl that scratches, this is just black. Only thing I can recommend is a center pole as this thing is so big any snow weight and the top hub pops and the roof comes down. Good chance of breaking a rod or something if you try and push it back up with a snow load in it.",

    "description": "Style Name:Barronett Ox 5 BackwoodsIntroducing the ox 5 hub blind from Barronett. Featuring oxhide fabric, a unique 2-layer bonded fabric unlike anything ever used on a portable ground blind. Oxhide maximizes concealment on the exterior with a soft, no-shine, and color rich camouflage layer, that is permanently bonded to an ultra-durable, waterproof, woven polyester interior layer which is the ultimate in durability. In addition, the black interior fabric layer creates a dull black backdrop to conceal movement that will never scratch, crack or Flake off. The ox 5 is a five-sided blind that has a deceptively large interior giving the Hunter a panoramic view and enough room to stay far away from window openings to keep movement concealed. The all-new fully adjustable window design opens from the center horizontally across 3 sides and silently slides to the desired width or height.",
