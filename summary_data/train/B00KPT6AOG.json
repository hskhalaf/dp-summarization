CONS: - As an upright steam mop it is a bit unstable/rickety when storing, starts to lean. - When refilling the water compartmens, it tends to leak and go everywhere whilst trying to re install. - The detergent compartment tends to empty very quickly, could do with being slightly larger. PROS: - Cleans quickly without much going over. - The hand held detachment is very easy to use. - Great range of accessories for different services. - The head of the mop is triangular for cleaning corners with ease.",

Despite 2 year warranty Vax saying they will do nothing under warranty unless I get an independent report which proves it is a manufacturing fault.

The devise itself is easy to use, however, you have to keep turning it round to get the angle required for cleaning various surfaces. I feel that the attachments should be able to rotate at various angles so you don't have to keep turning the machine. Not the best purchase I've ever made & I probably should have bought separate devices.",

      "text": "Cleans the floors pretty well like a floor mop and once you are used to it and keep it moving you will find it doesn't leave the floor too wet. Doesn't really shift grime like you see in promo videos. Don't expect your grout that's been ingrained with dirt to suddenly become as white as Simon Cowell's teeth. However let's face it non of the other manufacturers steam cleaners will either. So all in all with all the attachments, it's very good performance and price I would still recommend this.",

The brush heads were totaaly flattened after just two uses and were of no use at all. The nozzle which attaches the brushes to the steamer loosens itself and flys off. Full marks to Amazon however who very promptly arranged for me to return this item for a refund. Have now ordered H2O HD steamer to replace.",

A few design issues though....the nozzle that is stored in the handle falls out, all the time!..... the cord could be a bit longer, it tells you to empty the water tank and the cleaning fluid tank after every use to prevent damage and when used as a hand held, it can be difficult to get to the bottom of things because the machine gets in the way. On the plus side, it heats up really quickly, all the tools are stored on board and it's easy to use and switch between the floor cleaner and the hand held.",
