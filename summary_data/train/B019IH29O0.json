I believe they are manufacturing remnants from where the resin was broken from a mold or other production appliance. Thus, they are not really defects, but are present on every footstool. Second, the lid on the table really sucks. It fits very loosely and the slightest bump jars it our of level. If the manufacturer puts a little more thought into this product, then it could be 5 stars.",

I had no problem with condition or damage w/packaging as others had noted. Price maybe a little high, but you do get 3 pcs.",

You can see it about six pretty obvious areas where they cut the plastic from the extrusion machine. On the plus side, they are very lightweight and with the addition of pillows they could be used for outdoor Ottomans. I think these pieces are good as transitional if you\u2019re not ready to invest a lot of money in outdoor Furniture",
