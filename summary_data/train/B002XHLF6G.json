She is 22 months and both my husband and I are avid skiers - so we wanted to get her comfortable on skis ASAP so we can get her on the real mountains when she is ready. These are great for little ones to get a feel for having 2 sticks strapped to their feet. We just went to our local park and pulled her along the pathway and she seemed to pick it up pretty quickly. These will be great for the next year of learning before hitting the real slopes.",
