It sits, uncovered, in our backyard. It is also very comfortable. We have two porch swings, padded lawn chairs, and zero gravity chairs yet we always seem to find ourselves choosing to sit on this bench to relax. We looked at a lot of benches in the stores, and I'm so glad we went with this one!",

It supports two average adults without any problem. It wasn't as wide as I thought it would be, but there is still plenty of room for us both to sit side by side.",

It gets dragged around and no problems, so am upgrading it to 5 stars.",

In Louisiana the humidity, rain and sultry summers take a toll on outdoor furniture. We have similar dining tables and chairs which have been sitting outside for 5 years and still look like new. This is a great price for this bench too. UPDATE: May 2013, still loving this bench, but I need another one and its no longer available. Please bring this item back!",

      "text": "We were looking for something to place near lake front that was comfortable to sit on, sturdy for several years use, easy to move, could take outdoor elements and not be extremely expensive. After one season of use, it's meeting our requirements. We purchased 2 and are quite pleased. The assembly was quite easy.",

    "description": "Catch a summer breeze or watch the birds from your lovely Maldives Outdoor Bench from BEST. Built to last with cast aluminum construction and a weather-resistant finish, this sturdy bench will give you years of enjoyment. The comfortable seating is perfect for reading a book or listening to the sounds of nature.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nBEST COZUMEL CAST ALUMINUM BENCH, ANTIQUE COPPER FINISH\nPERFECT BENCH FOR ONE OR TWO PEOPLE\nThis copper finished aluminum bench is as pretty as a picture. You can imagine a snapshot of it being the focal point of a postcard set in a lush garden with shade trees, blooming flowers in all the colors of a rainbow and a wooden foot bridge in the background. It makes a very romantic statement with plenty of sitting room for two. The cast aluminum construction is quite sturdy and is rust proof which helps if you plan to leave it outdoors. It would look perfectly at home in the backyard with several stone rabbits or other furry creatures scattered in front of it. It weighs only 37 pounds which makes it stable but still light enough to move from the yard to the patio and even to the screened porch. It would make an excellent seating area for guests who come for a cookout or just to sit a visit in the cool fall air. Since it is so versatile and easy to move, during the \"off season\" you can place it by your front door and decorate it with pumpkins and fall foliage for Halloween and Thanksgiving. Santa would find this a perfect place to sit throughout the Christmas holidays. \n\n * 22.8 inches in Length, 40.2 inches in Width and 32.7 inches High\n * Cast Aluminum Construction\n * Antique Copper Finish\n * Simple elegant Design\n * Perfect for Garden, Patio, and Balcony",
