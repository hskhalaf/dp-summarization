      "verdict": "New Balance kept the MC 1006 sleek and clean, which got the interest of players searching for supportive and stable court shoes. Its innovative midsole minimizes impact, making it one of the most comfortable New Balance tennis trainers in the market.Aside from being light on the pocket, this all-court footgear doesn\u2019t weigh the foot down with its durable composition. And while it allows the users to spring from one point to another with confidence, this doesn\u2019t keep the foot toasty even during long matches.",
      "pros": [
        "A good chunk of New Balance 1006 reviewers state that this shoe needs no break-in period",

        "Lots of users agree that this footgear is very comfortable",
        "Many reviews indicate that this is one of the most lightweight shoes by New Balance",
        "It provides ample traction according to plenty of consumers who appreciate its outsole composition",

        "A few wearers find it less bulky than the Adidas Barricades"

      "text": "Shoe soles are quite inflexible. There is no interior cushioning either. All this makes for extremely uncomfortable tennis. My size is 9.5 2A (narrow) WC1006WS, and have been wearing the WC1005 model (which I assumed the 1006 was a replacement for) for over a decade. I play 3 times per week. New Balance has changed the design, unfortunately. Even after inserting a cushioning insole, the cement court surface felt uncomfortably hard and I could not flex my feet when running, causing my feet and leg muscles to hurt. I hope New Balance brings back the old design. These shoes also run smaller than the WC1005. I returned them for a refund.",
