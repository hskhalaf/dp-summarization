I will NOT consider using ANY OTHER product other than GODDARD's. My horns look as good as the day I got them.",

While the product did make the tray more shiny it did not remove all the tarnish as much as I would have liked. I used about half the bottle on the tra and really had to use some muscle to get out what I did. I have used other products in the past that were much more effective. I wasn't overly disappointed by it because like I said it did remove most of the tarnish but I was not wowed by this product by any means, it was just ok.",
