The headphones are comfortable and have a folding design to take up less room when packing. The headphones have the ability to hook another pair of headphones to these headphones (via a separate audio cable) so I was able to watch Blippi with my kid...Overall I would recommend these headphones.",

I love that there are two AUX jacks- one on each side of the ear phones for sharing 2+ kids to one tablet or iPod! Great idea! Love that there is a lot of cushion around the top so they can be worn for at least 30+ min without getting uncomfortable.",

It's hard to know online which cords will fit with what headsets. Within days Snug sent me two sets of new headphones to my home. The customer service is outstanding, and I'm really glad I chose them over other competitors. Now, I have headphones that work making travel easier with toddlers in tow.

I was a little skeptical with these at first because of the reviews about the product snapping where it adjust. But haven't had any issues so far with that problem. My daughter takes pretty good care of her things, so unless she rough handles or throws around her headphones i dont see why they should break easily. I would definitely purchase these again or reccomend",

We have a special case for them that they are stored in and still, the same issue of wiring has made this pair not work.
