I haven't took the time to fix them yet to see if they survive again but the kids loved them. They had so much fun! I would still buy them again. Definitely recommend blowing them up the day before use. The plastic has to stretch and acclimate then freshen them up before use. Make sure not to over fill them, the seams could bust! They don't need to be completely filled, just need to stand up on their own. Hope this helps!",

The pins are nearly impossible to knock over, and the ball hardly travels four feet from you, so you need to stand within kicking distance of the pins to even hit them, only fo them to just wobble and stand back up.
