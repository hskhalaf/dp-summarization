      "text": "I used this to help cool my skin after using the Via Cosmedics Exfoliating and Clarifying Ultra Mud mask. It has aloe, chamomile, etc and really did a good job to ease redness and burning after using a harsh treatment on the face. The product dries after a few minutes so you can leave it on for as long as you want. I leave it overnight after using the mask and just use a mild cleanser in the morning before I do my makeup routine. My skin generally gets really oily in the summer months so I don't use a facial moisturizer as much. This gel makes up for the moisture lost. Highly recommended!!",

I was surprised by how quickly it dried and how comfortable it was. When I woke up the next morning, my skin was softer than it ever has been. The consistency is a little strange at first, but it smells great and is easy to put on. You can feel the difference instantly. Will definitely buy again.",

It is very sticky so I don't think I could comfortably leave it on overnight for a \"more intense treatment\" but I found that leaving it on for 20 minutes worked great. As I mentioned, it is sticky but it feels so soothing once it's on. A great product at a great price!",
