The scope tube fits in the bag just right and the carrying straps are a little off center so that it balances out the heavier part of the tube that houses the primary mirror. The bag only fits the scope tube...not the dobsonian mounting base, which is carried separately. I highly recommend this padded case if you plan on transporting your telescope with any frequency.",
