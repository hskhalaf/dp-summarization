I'll be using another brand in the future. UPDATE: Well, it took over a month to get a reply, but I got an e-mail from Ernie Ball yesterday saying they were sending a new set of strings. They're not timely but at least they responded appropriately, so my one-star review has been updated.",

I wanted something meant for rock music and the only size available (during the time of my purchase) were medium-light I believe. I strung em up, and they look great and sound great. They play amazing, very durable and can get some great bends out of them. $5 for ErnieBall quality, what\u2019s not to love.",

Probably pretty good for folky players who use a lot of Cowboy chords. No sweat, though, it was an experiment. At 5 bucks or so a pop for strings on Amazon, I'll be trying plenty more.",

Compared to D'Addario Extra Lights I normally use, they are heavier gauge, the sound is bright and quite metallic, maybe a bit more body to the sound than the D'Addario's, and not bad in my opinion. But they are coming straight back off. Can't afford to risk a string going at the next gig. Back to the D'Addario strings for me.",

Unfortunately, as heavy gauge strings they require a lot of tension to tune up. I am used to light and extra light strings, so I have tuned these 2 half notes low, (i.e. E string tuned to D, etc.) to reduce tension, but they are still hard on the fingers to play. I will look for a lighter version of the Earthwood strings, to try to get the same full yet mellow sound without the high string tension.",
