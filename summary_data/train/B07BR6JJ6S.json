I was hesitant to purchase a Dell in the first place and I'm regretting my decision daily. The repair company has replaced the operating system and is on day 9 of waiting on a new memory board and a new system board. I was told Dell is very slow in sending replacement parts. Incredibly disappointed with this whole process. Lessons learned: 1) Never buy a Dell and; 2) Never buy a computer on Amazon. I will update this review once we receive the system back.",

And only THEN after I made those threats publicly on twitter. Great machine. But if you want good service, it's possible some other company may be easier for you to deal with - in my experience, Dell were not at all helpful.",
