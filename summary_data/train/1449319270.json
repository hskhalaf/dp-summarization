The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that many of the details a person needs to design a web page are buried in the flowing narrative. The author states that reading the book is like sitting in her class, and I have no doubt that she puts on a great class. However, when class is over and you're sitting at home looking for those three or four key tags you need, a chapter glossary or searchable list would be nice. This is especially true in the CSS section. Again, it is a very good and readable book for learning the basics.",

There is still lots of information packed in this book that I need to review. I have not yet read any other books on web design, but I can say I was very happy with this one. I wouldn't recommend it so much for learning JavaScript, as it seems the author of this section just gives a brief and somewhat confusing overview, at least for me.

      "text": "Best book to learn basic HTML. I had bought the \"A Smarter Way to Learn\" series prior to purchasing this, but after completing that book, I found that there were a lot of missing topics etc. This book is definitely more extensive and intensive, it not only teaches the methods of HTML and CSS but the best ways to organize your code. In all, this book is twice as good as the other HTML CSS books available (with the same ratings), and if you were like me, deciding between the several top-rated web design books on amazon, this is, in my opinion, the best one available.",
