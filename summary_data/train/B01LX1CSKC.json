      "text": "Quite impressed with this efficient, well-designed card holder/wallet. The purple color is exactly as shown on the website and the leather is very nice. It appears to be sturdily put together. the credit card pockets are exactly the right size, so there's no slipping or tight, unmanageable fit. The zipper is quality and doesn't appear to be susceptible to sudden failure - something that is important to me. The size is right for all my purses. I'm looking forward to using this for a long time.",
