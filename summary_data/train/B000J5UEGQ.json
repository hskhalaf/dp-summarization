I can start a Pandora station on my FireTV and ask Alexa what the weather is tomorrow and get to hear how it's going to be 12 degrees (8 with the windchill) while the music continues on uninterrupted.",

I've always been able to eliminate hum before but this one has me stymied. UPDATE: reluctantly invested another $11 for awhich much to my surprise actually solved the problem! Quite surprising for a passive component. (It's a 1:1 transformer effectively, rather than an opto-isolator)",

And of course electronics with unstable power connections are prone to shorts and malfunctions, so we will see. If I start using this thing in my live rig, I will definitely duct tape the power supply into the unit. It's really baffling that anyone would think this is a good design for power supply...",

After getting this mixer, I paid close attention to choosing its successor, and every other mixer I looked at had a typical barrel connector. This is my first mixer, so I won't comment on its sound or build quality. Sent it back, simply because it kept turning off because the plug barely engaged with the mixer body.

When I found myself needing a new, highly portable, mixer for just a few channels I looked at ordering this unit. I'm very glad I did! It works flawlessy, with no noisy signals. It's so simple that my 11 year old was able to pick up the controls quickly, too. While this doesn't have a TON of channels, it does the job it was purchased for and does it quite well! Update: After several gigs with this I can say that it's durable and reliable. My ONE complaint is the non-standard power plug (hope I never lose it).",

Some reviews talk about it \"clicking\" into place to stay. Nope, mine doesn't, it's pretty loose at all times, and falls out with minor movements of the unit. I have it in a very stable location, so it's not too concerning for me. But someday I can see myself ripping the unit open, hardwiring the power cable, and throwing away these utterly horrible power cord connectors.",

My kicks sound incredible after getting them dialed in and the lil extra on the snare added is just enough without being overbearing. So to all the drummers out there this is a killer little mixer.

This is actually not that big of a problem seeing that most electret condenser microphones can operate as low as 9V just fine even if their spec sheet has 48V slapped on it. 48V is an industry hold over from earlier designs of the 20th century. However, this is till a major oversight that needs to be corrected.",

This will work for the most part, however if you use Discord, it will route all audio with the microphone audio. I would suggest using the 802 version, as this has the aux/fx out. The aux/fx out will allow you to isolate the mic audio from the rest of the mix.",

This was a cheap yet great way to plug everything in and record it. The end result is amazing! This won't work for a ton of instruments, but this is a great place to start.",

No input noise, (through a shure57) 2. Great functionality, all jacks work perfectly",
