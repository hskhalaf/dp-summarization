Some reviews say it's easy to push back in resulting falling back, it really depends where you place your feet. If you want to sit up, have your legs flat in front where your body is shaped as an L. If you want to lay back, have your legs criss cross apple sauce or in the shape of a upside down \"V\". I fully enjoy this seat as it's very comfortable or easy support. If you would like better seating as in sitting up straight, just place a bedroom pillow behind your back. Love it!",

They work for us because we have a lot of space where they are mainly used, but may not be the best choice for people who have smaller spaces and storage is limited, if they aren't to be left out at all times.",

I only sent them about a month ago, so I can't speak to their durability with children. But they're perfect for them to watch TV on. They each have their own special seat and can rock to sooth themselves. (Since they live in FL, they have tile floors which are hard and cold, so these are a comfy way to sit on the floor.)",

It's too rounded at the lower back, so you'd need a pillow. Return shipping wouldn't be worth the refund so this was a wasted $22. But if you don't have back issues, it's probably a great chair. My five year old loves it.",

My boys aren't particularly destructive, but they're still boys and manage to wreck stuff, so I didn't want to spend a lot of money. These chairs seemed to fit the bill given their price and fair rating. As I think others noted, they aren't well padded, but they get the job done and my boys love them. We've had them for three months now, the boys use them everyday, and they're still intact. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.",
