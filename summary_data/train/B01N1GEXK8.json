      "text": "This is a Fujifilm Neo 90, from a feature-set/capability aspect. That being said, it looks SO much nicer than that camera. And it's a \"Leica\". I say it like that because, it's the most affordable Leica you can buy... it doesn't have Leica optics, or anything that makes a classic (or modern) Leica a LEICA. Regardless, if you're a fan of aesthetics, and instax exposures, this might work out for you. But it is really, seriously, internally identical to the Fujifilm Neo 90. Works with mini instax film, Fuji or Leica made.",

My only gripes are the quirky ergonomics of the shutter release and the unintuitive vertical orientation of the shutter release (backwards) but one adjusts quickly to that. The optics, battery life and results are fun...and the design of the camera is exactly what you'd expect from Leica.",
