I will still use the 16 inch for smaller windows since it is still in fantastic shape. These Ettore brass squeegees are the best in the world, and I highly recommend them for anyone that wants picture perfect windows with no streaks or after marks like most of their competitors! Amazon sells the replacement rubber packets for $2.98 and I have found, depending on use, they last several years!",
