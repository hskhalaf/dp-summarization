Years ago, I did have a sling that had a row of thicker padding that went across the lower back / upper pelvis area for hanging upside down. This sling isn't quite as comfortable for that particular purpose, but the body does adjust over time. Sometimes I just fold a towel and put it across the back of my upper pelvis if I feel I need a little more padding... thanks, YogaBody.",

We are still \" playing\" with the trapeze and haven't realized its full potential. But it is strong ( I weight 220) and surprisingly comfortable to hang in. The handles are well placed and the actual band is wide. You feel very secure when using the trapeze. Fits all sizes a gains am 220 lbs, my wife is 120, we both are using it. Install was easy, I had an over head rack in place. So it is exactly as advertised. No surprises, you will get exactly what you ordered.",
