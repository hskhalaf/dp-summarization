It came out of the box with display fault and when I researched the dark section's on screen is the most common fault of this display panel. But this is not what is the main pain point. The main part is once you start interacting with either samsung or amazon to replace it. I never got it replaced and had to live with using a faulty product. So choose wisely. There are better products out there with quality standards.",

The morons who rate it low because of shipping problems should be banned from reviewing the tv, they should be reviewing the shipper not the actual tv. The tv automatically connected to my galaxy phone and my galaxy tablets, they all work seamlessly together. I definitely recommend these tv's.",

Have to say the pix clarity is stunning, but I have some concerns. The color adjustment is difficult to use, when you go to settings the picture disappears so you can't immediately see what the change does. MY computer monitor has a much better picture then this TV, doesn't seem right to me. Have to say I'm disappointed.",
