Alone the fact that gives you individuality to make your coffee is worth it. Only for geeks of course ;) If you simply want a decent quick coffee then a Mr. Coffee might do the trick for you already. In the end it's the beans and the roast that are most important. The rest boils down to (ha) intuition and believing in the process.",

(And yes, I've got it on correctly.) I've had the larger Chemex for years, and its collar fits perfectly, so maybe this was a one-off problem?",

There's something Zen about folding the filter, boiling the water and pouring it over the coffee. It's definitely more work than popping in a kcup into a machine. But it feels worth it. Only thing I'm unhappy about is the wooden handle and leather tie. It's too fussy to untie every time you wash it. I see they sell one with a glass handle. I may get that one next. I add extra coffee because it seems weaker when made this way. Overall I'm very happy with it.",

I definitely recommend the Chemex for brewing your best coffees.",
