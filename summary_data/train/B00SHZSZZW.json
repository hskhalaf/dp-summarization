      "text": "The most FPS you're going to get with this is 60 frames. I play SC II in full 4k, get very light screen tearing during the cinematics when using a GTX 1060. It's not barely noticeable and I've never had a problem during game play. When I first used it the screen tear was really bad, but I turned off antialiasing and everything has been great since then. I rather have gotten a monitor that was higher than 60 hz, but they didn't exists for under $500 when I bought this. Overall I'm happy but waiting to upgrade in two or three years.",

The larger the monitor the smaller the lettering and while the monitor lettering is adjustable, some programs are not. The colors are bright and seem perfect. I edit art and photography. I would highly suggest this monitor.",

Inexplicably, the 3.5mm audio jack is an output, not an input. I get that most people are using HDMI or the displayport itself for audio, and that's all fine and good. But on a hackintosh you're probably not because OSX support for hdmi audio is sketchy at best, it's preferable to use analog output. So 4 stars for not having an analog audio input, a minor inconvenience. Otherwise a great monitor for a great price.",

I ran a Spyder calibration and the factory calibration was very good, and hence this is great for Photoshop. The from-the-bottom adjustment buttons, in keeping with the slick, clean fascia of the monitor, was a little tricky to adjust. Overall I am very satisfied with the screen.",
