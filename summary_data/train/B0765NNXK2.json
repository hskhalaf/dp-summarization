The more aggravating factor is that the outer cover is washable but the actual blanket is not, which is a problem when you have a toddler using it and he accidentally wets the bed when he is sleeping, thereby wetting the blanket cover through to the actual blanket. I wish I had known that the actual blanket was not washable and that the cover was not waterproof before I bought the blanket. An expensive lesson.",

We\u2019ve had this blanket for almost two weeks and it has been amazing. She has been falling asleep pretty quickly and also has not been having nightmares.

First, the ties in the other brand are made of a material that stays tied. This blanket's ties are made of a silky material and do not stay tied therefore the weighted blanket does not lay well inside the minky cover. Second, the weighted beads in this blanket do not lay evenly. The weight always falls to one side rather than being distributed evenly. The other brand I bought is quilted with the beads evenly dispersed with in quilt so the weight stays distributed evenly throughout the banket.",

There are sewn in loops for the duvet cover and it doesn't slip at all. The duvet is soft but not hot and I love that is was included, all with prime shipping. It is filled with glass sand rather than poly pellets so it is not bulky or loud. I would definitely recommend this blanket.",
