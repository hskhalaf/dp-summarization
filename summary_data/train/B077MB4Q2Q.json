It makes it so easy to clean her braces, it came with 4 different heads an 1 head has a point an she can get under the wires even around the little brackets an in between them. I'm going get one of these for me too. If you have a child struggling to clean thier teeth correctly then this brush is what you need.",

This Fairywill has a bit fatter handle than the very thin Dazzle, but is thinner than a Sonic-care. Sonic-care rattled my brain, and was too rough on my gums, and too fat in the grip. This Fairywill is just right. In between the Sonic and the Dazzle in power and handle thickness. This Fairywill has a small head which fits in my mouth better than a round head oral-B. Perfect so far. As long as it keeps working this way, I am very satisfied with it.",

No large expensive apparatus and parts that are cumbersome to handle effectively with each patient. Feeling the same way about this battery-charged, USB connecting, wonderful sonic brush: I love it!! :-)",

      "text": "I have been using this as my daily tooth brush for a couple of weeks now, it works as expected and has some interesting brush heads included. It's small size and good hand feel make it my choice for travel. Its vibrations are not as strong as a SonicCare so I have not decided if it is good enough to be my daily driver. Pro: Small size and rechargable through USB makes it great for traveling. Good hand feel, elegant design, quality look and feel. Con: not as strong vibrations as SonicCare and non-standard USB cable",

Yes, it's a product, but things like the brush stem is too thick. It feels like it wasn't designed. The product is in my hand, because of $$$ Will the toothbrush last? I dunno? Will I use it? It's my main toothbrush. Nothing wrong with it, i dunno...i feel dirty for using it ;)",

I used a regular toothbrush for awhile then decided to try this again. Still really dont like it. The brush head is too small and the vibrations make my mouth tickle.

The battery lasts a very long time between charging. More importantly, this cleans so much better than the name brand ones we were previously buying and spending $100+ on. Our teeth feel like we just came from a dental cleaning afterwards. The lady who cleans my teeth at the dentist's office has told me the last 2x that they're so clean I haven't left her any work. I brush on the sensitive mode, which is perfect.",

It has another brush aside it is like to pass it through more places deep works very well. I do not know if it is better to brush or vibrate when it comes to washing teeth!",
