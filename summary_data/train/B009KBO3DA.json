My skin is smoother, healthier, more hydrated and brighter. Recently, I used the oil on an very bad scrape on my arm and was surprised to see how quickly it healed my damaged skin. I am now using it on my arms each day and expect to have the same results I had with my face...smoother, more supple, healthier skin. A little goes a long way, just one pump is enough for my face and neck.",

I have acne-prone skin and suffer from severe cystic acne developing around my chins, but ever since I used this oil (it's been about 2 weeks), I no longer have major pimples on my face. It keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day too. I've used it for scalps and it's great at preventing hair loss too. Moringa must surely be a gift from God!",

      "text": "The actual oil is very good for dry skin/acne/ etc. I was very disappointed though when I got my package to find that a good amount of oil spilled out of the container (in the box). When I picked up the container I had to wipe off all the excess oil surrounding it and then I realized the oil was leaking from the top (the dispenser). Right now I am still keeping it in a zip lock baggie because the container is still oily. Overall good product but I had a bad experience with the packaging.",
