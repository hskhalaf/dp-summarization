Yes, it is just a cap, but I want to take the bottle/spray with me in my bag, so having the cap is necessary. I wanted to use it right away, but cannot in case if I decided to return/exchange. In addition to that I will need to unnecessary time to spend for return/exchange.... very disappointed.",

I spray it on about 5 or 6 times a day. I wish I had found this stuff in my 20's. We went on vacation a couple weeks ago, so I had to slum it and use my moisturizer and I hated it. It left my skin greasy and gross. The bottle lasts for a long time too- about 3 months. Well worth the price.",

It seems like the spray/water within the canister allows for the water to remain cool when sprayed out. This product is quite expensive regardless of where is you get it from is my only complaint. This product does more than just spray water but it provides refreshing and rejuvenated skin. Overall, I would give this a solid 4 stars.",
