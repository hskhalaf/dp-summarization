I made 22 pizzelle and 18 cannoli shells in ~ 1/2 hour -- one note.... the amount of batter you should put on the plate is about the size of a walnut. I started too large and had to trim a few.",

I'm so glad that I did. This press is a perfect size, I like the size pizzelle it makes along with the compact design. The press works quickly (around 22 seconds I found) per two pizzelles and they're super easy to slide off with a spatula. I look forward to using this more!!",

After finding one of these on Warehouse Deals for $26 on Prime Day, it seemed like a cheaper alternative in the long run. In 5 batches, this pizzelle maker will pay for itself, and I get the great fun of using it! The batter is really easy to whip up, and the machine is a breeze to use once you figure out the consistency you like. The thickness of the cookies is perfect for cone, bowl and cannoli shapes, and the non-stick surface works like a charm.",

I let it cool, cleaned it, seasoned it and started over. It immediately stuck again. Tried it again the next day and the pizzelles immediately stuck on the top lid. What a waste. I threw it out!

I hope to use this one for as long as I had the other Pizzelle make (12 years). I would recommend this Pizzelle maker to anyone, the price is right and so easy to use.",

They take 20 to 25 seconds to cook (two at a time) and the recipe I use makes 3 dozen. It's faster than baking a cookie in the oven and almost as fast as no-bakes. So fun!!",
