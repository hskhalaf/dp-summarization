Thsnk goodness for the bright color - it slipped away as soon as i went to snorkel in a rough area and the color made it easy to spot and grab before it went to the ocean floor. The transfer process is easy using the app downloaded to your phone.",

Picture quality was good and at that depth light was bright so not surprising. This is not a high end underwater camera and should not be expected to perform like one. At the price point this is without doubt a excellant buy.",

I've used the camera for a couple months now and work in dark areas at time so needed a good flash. This ain't it. My old XP-45 had a much better flash. I often need to take several shots to find a usable one because the flash does not light up a space well. Appears to be weak and to have short range. Very disappointing. Photos in good light are fine and very usable.",

    "description": "A sleek yet rugged point-and-shoot, the Fujifilm FinePix XP120 is a capable, compact camera offering versatile imaging capabilities, wireless sharing, and a robust water, shock, freeze, and dustproof construction. Utilizing a 16.4MP CMOS sensor, this camera can record high-resolution stills at up to 10 fps and Full HD 1080p video, and the sensor's back-illuminated design maintains smooth, low noise image quality when working in difficult lighting conditions. Complementing the imaging assets is a Fujinon 5x optical zoom lens that covers a 28-140mm equivalent focal length range for working in a variety of scenarios, and optical image stabilization minimizes the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting.In addition to straight photos and movies, the XP120 also enables creating Cinemagraphs, where a still photo contains select moving elements for a unique multimedia image. Time-Lapse Movies can also be produced in-camera, as well as wide-format panoramas and other creative effects. The sleek form factor incorporates a 3.0\" 920k-dot LCD for image review and composition, and built-in Wi-Fi is also featured for wirelessly sharing your work to a smartphone or tablet, or for remotely controlling the camera from your device.",
