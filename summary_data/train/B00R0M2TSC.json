It's hard to wash because the coating on the wire mesh is rough and sponges get snagged in the rough parts. I used the rack today and it works well cooling baked goods seem to get stuck to the wire mesh.",

I was very happy to find this one that can do both! Even better, it was suggested by a youtuber that focuses on Sous Vide (Sous Vide Everything). He uses it with clips to hold vacuum sealed bags with food in place within the water bath. Meaning, this has held up well for baking, cooling and being used under water. For the price, you can't beat this rack! And just a tip, when you bake something on it, spray some cooking spray on it and it cleans up pretty easy.",

      "text": "I'm very happy with this wire rack. I used it to make beef jerky in the oven. I sprayed a light coat of canola oil on it prior to placing the beef on it. Clean up was very easy, mostly came clean with dish soap and dish rag, which by the way did not snag on any sharp wire edges as has been the case with other racks I've used. I used a toothbrush for debris on a few of the wire joints but even that took very little brushing. I really like the grid size, the rack definitely feels like it could handle a good sized roast. I am seriously considering buying another one.",

It is also good for baking and browning chicken wings, breasts, etc. Of course it is also great for cooling baked goods. I'm sure there are many more uses that other customers can think of. As you can see, I'm very pleased with this rack and happy I chose it from all the others.",

It was great that it could be used in the oven also and that it could hold a substantial amount of weight as a Trivet. The rack that I had previously been using did not have the grid pattern and warm cookies would slide through and break. I am impressed with the quality of my new baking rack. Thank you! And that you for the cook book, I was elated.",
