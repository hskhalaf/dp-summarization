I sent one to my sister and she loves it too. It works like it says and I have never had a problem with parts melting. Most sauces are not cooked on high heat therefore I have not used it with any boiling sauce or water. I love the fact that I can make bernaise sauce or other sauces and not have to stand there and constantly stir it.",

      "text": "I have used this product for year and bought 3 from ebay when it was discontinued. Use it primarily for Grits, Polenta and Steel cut Oat Meal. I assume the melting problem was using it with hot oil which obviously can get well over 300 degrees so with water based dishes it never gets over 212 degrees. I don't recommend useing the arms if it requires full extension as this puts the springs at full tension and may pop off the pot edge and fall into the pot. Just had a great dish of Grits and Grillades with the Stir Chef stirring the simmering grits for up to an hour.",

I agree with the other users about the potential arm stretching safety issues but if you follow the directions and use the product carefully, it works very well. I find that the intermittant setting is perfect for the tomatoes over low heat. Yes, it takes a long time, but I don't have to watch it much so that doesn't matter to me.",
