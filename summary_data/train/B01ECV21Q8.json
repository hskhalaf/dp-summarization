It arrived on time and no faults and set up using Xperia Companion and Google was quite painless. The Camera is excellent but will not be using the earphones that came with as my Sony clip ones I bought with the first one are superior [they stay on my ears and don't fall out.] Overall great phone for the price.",

When setting up be aware the phone is set up in Spanish so had to translate to set up in English and you will have to change the keyboard, time settings etc which was a bit of a faff. It\u2019s not a bad phone but there\u2019s better for the same price. Wouldn\u2019t recommend.",

      "text": "This was a present for my dad for christmas that I bought on behalf of my mum. Dad is so pleased with this phone. As you can expect with Sony the quality of this phone is amazing. It has a really premium build quality and the screen looks amazing too. It comes with Android 6.0 which whilst not the lastest version it's recent enough to not really be any issue at all. Dad reports that the battery life on this is much better than other smartphones he's had in the past so that's a plus for this handset too.",

Doesn't have the front end muting options and the looks are a bit odd - like it's bent in the middle. Too much duplicate software from Sony again clogging up memory. Nice colour mind",

Now, 3 months later the screen goes mad, doing things on its own and no responding to any command. I thought it was a kind of malware but doing some online research looks like it is a Sony's software malfunction quite common in their Xperia range. It is funny that after such a short period of time I cannot return nor exchange my item with the seller. So, guys, here is my advise: DO NOT BUY any Sony device and mostly do not buy with this seller because if something happens you will loose your money. Pathetic.",

I don't know it's a charging or battery problem but I am not really satisfy with this Model and thinking it to replace with some other brand. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.",

      "text": "Worst phone I have bought in a while. I regret buying this due to the dreadful battery life. I wake up with 100% having charged this all night. Use the bluetooth for the commute, look at it a couple of times and it's 50% by lunchtime. The Sony Z3 Compact I owned before this was far far better....but I decided to replace with this as I dropped the old phone too many times.",

Battery is absolutely terrible (barely lasting a few hours even when not used), the storage is SHOCKING and the phone screen damages without even dropping the phone (while in a case). Don't waste your money on this phone! Brought this phone in August and by Christmas I needed a new one. Had my last iPhone for over 3 years.",
