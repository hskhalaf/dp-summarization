The only way to turn-off the fan is by disconnecting the power cord from the hub, which is what I do. Otherwise, it would be 5-stars.

The two power ports on the front are very convenient and there are two more USB ports that I use for my small wireless dongles. The only thing I don't like about it is the power supply has a very large footprint and runs the same way as the powerstrip taking up two additional plug spaces. Come on man!",

The power cord is surprisingly long, adding a great deal of flexibility, although if you're going to fully utilize it you might need to get a USB Cord longer than the one provided.

However the actual power delivered to USB devices on the regular ports (not the charging ports) is low. We have smaller hubs with much less powerful supply which support more power to connected USB peripherals. For example connecting a USB HD drive to more than two of the ports on this simply does..not.. work. On a little Amazon Basics USB 3.0 hub - works just fine.",

After plugging in a printer, external hard drive, and Fitbit dongle I found myself having to hot-swap the remaining 3.0 port way too often. Enter this Sabrent 7-port hub. I love all the flexibility offered by that many high speed ports, plus the added benefit of 2 charging ports. Setup was a breeze, and everything I've connected so far was immediately recognized. My wife charged her Fitbit Charge from dead to full in about 20 minutes. That made her happy, which I'm told also made me happy.",

      "text": "Love this little usb hub! its great and works well, but the title is a little misleading. The description is 9 usb 3 ports + (and) 2 charging ports. What it should say is 7 usb 3 ports +2 charging ports. The 2 red charging ports are power out only, they do not connect to the computer as a part of the hub. the other 7 ports work as described, with the correct speeds for 3.0 and 2.0 and I say it was a great purchase.",

      "text": "I had recently reconfigured my desk and the location of my PC was inconvenient for easily connecting USB devices. The Sabrent 9 port USB 3.0 hub provides an easy solution of quickly connecting those devices that need additional power for charging (my phone and tablet) as well as quickly connecting a USB thumb drive without having to crawl under my desk. The device looks good on the desk top and the versatility of using it either vertically or horizontally (with the slide in stand) allowed me to place it were I can most easily reach it. A great device that I recommend to anyone who needs to relocate powered USB ports to their desktop.",

This has only happened twice since I've bought it though, so not too much of a nuisance.",
