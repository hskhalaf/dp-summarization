So I did a little research on how to DIY...and here you go! Buy or make your own cold brew, put it in this handy, dandy dispenser, and BOOM! you have fabulous Nitro Cold Brew! Winner! It arrived quickly, is sturdy, works well, and saves me money. And it's fun, to be honest. That \"spshhhhh\" is quite satisfying!",

Each time we used it, it was harder to get together and harder to get apart. Finally, it became stuck and we were unable to unscrew them. Probably should have returned it, just threw it away. UPDATE: The seller contacted me to offer a refund even through I had thrown away the item. This is incredibly good customer service. I feel as though you can confidently try buying this item as the seller will take good care of you if yours is defective like mine.",

Also taking it apart I tried to take off the cap while it was still pressurized but it was extremely difficult. I thought by removing the gas cartridge it would depressurize but such was not the case. Had I been able to remove the cap while it was still pressurized it would have been very dangerous. Fortunately I discovered it was still pressurized and then I depressurized it.",

Most other ones that's of the same price or even higher have plastic parts. This one is all metal. You also get extra nozzles and a cleaning brush, so that's even better. The threaded part that the charger goes on can come loose with frequent use, but you can tighten it again with a wrench, so it's not a problem. The dispenser uses a large lever for better control compared to other ones that only uses a button. Parts can be easily disassembled for cleaning and repair.",

      "text": "Love my AmazeChef Cream Whipper! The design is great and very easy to use. The quality of the whipper is excellent! I love that it has stainless steel tips. Many of the other brands have plastic tips. This one also comes with a handy cleaning tool to keep the whipper in perfect condition. The whipper makes my desserts and coffee drinks look professional. It also saves you $ and is much healthier than store-bought canister whipped cream. A must-have item for all at-home chefs that want to add that professional touch to their creations!",
