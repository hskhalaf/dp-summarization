I bought my 2nd bottle and after a couple days of getting diarrhea, looked at the label and saw they added oxide to the formula. It's very upsetting. I am not supposed to take oxide due to GI problems. ZHOU, PLEASE CHANGE BACK TO 100% GLYCINATE!!",

They have quietly switched out their formula to a proprietary blend (meaning they refuse to disclose the ratio of individual ingredients) containing the incredibly cheap laxative magnesium oxide. Magnesium oxide is not known to have many of the benefits magnesium glycinate confers as it passes right through you, hence the laxative effect. This supplement is no longer worth the label it's wrapped in and is potentially dangerous to unsuspecting consumers who believe they are reaping the benefits of bioavailable magnesium.

It causes diarrhea and is poorly absorbed as would be expected with magnesium oxide. They do not indicate the percentage of mag glycinate/oxide on the bottle. However the diarrhea make me feel that there is a substantial percentage of magnesium oxide. Way overpriced for this product. I can take magnesium glycinate without issue. I am a physician and despite reading ad on Amazon and reviews this mix was well hidden with marketing gimmicks. I will be reporting this product to Amazon.",

However, the main concern is that they company switched the ingredients and added magnesium oxide. Magnesium oxide is a cheap form of magnesium, very common in all brands and for me not well tolerated. What upsets me is the covert way the switch was accomplished. I usually order two bottles and when it was time to open the 2nd bottle I was shocked to see it in tablet form. I read the ingredients and discovered the switch. If I could I would give the product zero stars.",
