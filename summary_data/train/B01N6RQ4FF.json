I just received them and followed the instructions to unroll them and let them sit for 24 hours. They were soft and had no noticeable smell so it seemed like they were perfect... until I noticed a few spots on them and thought maybe it was lint or a little dirt. Wrong... they were little worm like bugs on both pillows... some still alive and moving around! I understand this is probably just a rare occurrence but it is unacceptable. I have attached pictures of the pillows where you can see the bugs",

The pillows have retained their original shape and feel. I was worried that they would give off heat since they are memory foam, but there is no extra heat, etc. This second purchase is for the guest room so my guests feel extra comfort while visiting.

I was used to sleeping on thinner pillows because generally thicker pillows were uncomfortable. I was having trouble sleeping and would always wake up with a kink in my neck, so I decided to look for a new pillow to see if that would help my sleepless nights. This pillow is literally a game changer, and so glad about how affordable it is as well! It took about a week for me to get used to it, but now I cant imagine sleeping with any other pillow.

My last one was most of the way there, but they didn't make a king sized version. I was initially hesitant upon opening this pillow, because it's a lot lighter than my current queen sized cooling foam pillow. Well, my concerns were unfounded. It supports very well, stays cool all night long, and the lightness makes it easier to flip over in the middle of the night half asleep. Very, very happy with this purchase.",

      "text": "This pillow comes as shown. There is no inner fabric covering on the foam pillow itself, making the supplied pillow cover next to impossible to get back on the pillow after removing it for washing. For this reason I have given it the lowest possible rating. If you never plan to wash the cover, this pillow is very nice and reasonably priced. The smell is not the worst of the many foam pillows I have tried over the years, but the lack of an open weave inner covering is inexcusable!!!",

It seems a few got pillows that were improperly stored or packaged. That was not the case for me as mine came in pristine condition. There a mild smell that I would pick up sometimes at night when it was new, but that has now faded away. It still keeps its form and supports my head in just the perfect way.",

There is the perfect amount of give when you lay on it whether you are laying on your side, back or stomach. The high quality casing around the pillow is soft to the touch and there is little to no smell when first opening it! This is an excellent pillow if you are currently experiencing neck and shoulder pain and need a little extra support.",

Great for all positions but probably best for side sleepers due to the wider loft. Very soft and very light, don't feel like bricks like some memory foam pillows. My expensive ones are now in the closet. One small issue is the pillows are somewhat sticky likely due to the infused gel so once you take it out of the cover to wash you'll have a job putting it back in without damaging it since they are quite fragile.",
