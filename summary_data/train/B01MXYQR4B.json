      "verdict": "The Puma Suede Classic gets its terry cloth treatment in this collectible sneaker. The Puma Suede Classic Terry comes in supple all-suede upper, a Formstrip in terry fabric, and a durable rubber sole and cushioning that has made this classic kick an enduring icon. While some think that there\u2019s hardly any innovation introduced in this sneaker compared to the original, they believe that the new style treatment and value for money factor makes it a coveted casual sneaker.",

        "Aside from the Terry fabric in there\u2019s hardly any innovation to this Puma Suede Classic iteration some buyers observed",
        "The shoe runs large as some wearers commented that buying a size lower will get them a better fit",
