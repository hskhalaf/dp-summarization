      "text": "After minimum use, unexpectedly one of the front legs snapped. I contacted the supplier (with photos) expecting a resolution, as these chairs are not cheap. The supplier said they could not help as the product was beyond a 60 day warranty. I was expecting them to be surprised by the outcome and offer to exchange/replace the product. Maybe this condition is not so unusually. I had the chair less than a year. Sat in it 'maybe' 10 times. If you are expecting this to be outside and last several years, you might want to think twice. In my opinion it is not durable.",

It\u2019s too bad the quality control of the welding department is pretty much non-existent. We returned one of the originals when we first bought it because one of the legs was as welded at an angle. There\u2019s no bead on the weld - it\u2019s basically like a tack weld to position the legs and they stopped there. Very disappointed - will need to repair these myself now with some make-shift screws and metal parts from Home Depot!",

Second chair assembly was just a disaster. I think this one was sent back, repackaged and resold. Some of the screw holes were stripped so I could not get the screws in. Same problem with one of the arm assembly and also the chair backing. Save your time and frustration and just buy a different chair.",

Amazon should remove the product from the market. All 4 chairs have various degrees of rust after only 8 months. The rust deterioration on two chairs resulted in the tubular supports in the arm rest and leg cracking. It was made of lowest possible grade of steel with the rapid deterioration. I suspect the product wasn't new as claimed and it was exposed to salt water environment (ocean shipping from China or improper storage). Amazon should request a refund from the manufacturer for extremely poor quality & misleading advertisement.",

Now I have to keep the cushions inside till I need them. If you live in an area that rains a lot these are not for you but if you want them for a sun room or dry area they are perfect.",

      "text": "I have ordered 4 of these chairs and I am trying to return them. I am now being told I will have to pay for the return. The chairs were nice but basically and inch from the ground. I may as well sit on the ground. Also, I was never told I could not return for free. Nowhere in the description does it say that or I would have never ordered something I cannot return. I have amazon prime and have never had this problem before. please make this right and send me 4 return labels so I can return them to you. Thank you",
