Now rotate the filter 90 degrees so that the labeled side is facing either to the right or left when you put it in. If you try to install with the labeled side facing you, the filter will go in but will be too long front to back. Rotate it 90 degrees and re-insert. It should go all the way in.",

After watching a couple of YouTube vids on how to replace an air filter for a 2018 Civic Si sedan, I saved myself about $53 and it only took about two mins to DIY. Easy install and literally no tools needed except for a stepping stool cause sitting on the passenger seat would make you a bit high.",
