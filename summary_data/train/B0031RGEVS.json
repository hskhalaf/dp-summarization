The battery is a bit small if you take many flash pictures. Be sure and carry a spare.....and be sure the spare is charged. This camera is so much lighter and easier to handle than my old ones and much of that is due to the new high-tech battery.",

Another great SLR, but heavy and intrusive. I decided to begin taking pictures again and have loved this little Olympus. It is a higher end point and shoot, I can manipulate it a bit, but do not have as much freedom as I had with the completely manual cameras. The camera comes with a good amount of storage. I've bought an SD card and my next accessory will be an extra battery. This camera has made the world of digital photography quite seductive!",

Its cheaper compared to other super zoom cameras because they took off a lot of extras which I rarely or don't use such as: -view finder -horse shoe -manual (you can download this) -software (you can download this as needed) -video quality is minimal(this is not designed for this, get a video camera if you love taking videos.

It was several years old and would have been prohibitively expensive to repair. We are so pleased with this Olympus SP-800UZ camera. We are in a business that requires very detailed close-ups of antique coins, stamps, political buttons etc. and the 30x zoom is just the ticket! Also, I've used many different photographic software programs over the years and the Olympus Master software is the most intuitive and user-friendly I've ever found.",

Its just not a good enough camera for the 350.00 price ive seen elsewhere.It is a nice small body camera with a large lens and it was not to hard to use. Its good for general photography but dont expect to do any bigtime photography with it. If your looking for a point and shoot camera with a large zoom lens, that does the things a DSLR will do but with a fixed lens, go with panasonic lumix or a Canon.

Seems to be built pretty rugged though and feels like a quality camera. Part of the problem is that I know I'm a novice and lack in photography knowledge!",

Maybe Olympus with figure this out for the next version as the camera is close to useless as it is unless you go to the trouble of setting up and using a tripod. The major benefit of the extreme zoom is therefor negated.",

    "description": "OLYMPUS 227665 14.0 Megapixel SP-800UZ Digital Camera\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Inside its slim, elegant body, the SP-800UZ hides something amazing: a 30x wide-angle optical zoom. Bringing you all the power of a 30x zoom in a camera that\u2019s small enough to go wherever your travels take you. And with advanced features like Creative Art Filters, you can truly express yourself. \n\n30x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom (F2.8-F5.6, 28-840mm Equivalent) The longest, most powerful zoom in the world is also incredibly compact and portable. It zooms in 30x for extreme close-ups, then all the way back out for wide-angle panoramas. \nHD Movie 720p A simple, one-touch button allows you to record movies with amazing clarity in high-definition, right from your camera. \nDual Image Stabilization The 2-in-1 anti-blur solution. Sensor-Shift Image Stabilization, which keeps your shot steady by compensating for camera shake, combines with Digital Image Stabilization to capture crisp, clear images in any situation. \nAF Tracking Automatically tracks unpredictable, fast-moving subjects like kids and pets. Continuously adjusts the focus and brightness so you can easily capture a great shot of your subject in motion. \nCreative Art Filters Give your photos a distinct look and artistic feel by applying one of four different Magic Filter effects, including Pop Art, Pinhole, Fisheye and Drawing. \n\nOlympus SP-800UZ Features \n\n14 Megapixel\nAn amazing 14 million pixels in the high-resolution CCD create superior image quality. Create poster-sized prints without losing a single detail. \n\n30x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom\nAll the capabilities you need in one compact lens. The 30x optical zoom gets you amazingly close to the action while the 28mm wide-angle lens lets you capture breathtaking panoramas. \n\n3-inch LCD\nThe huge 3-inch LCD features an extra-wide viewing angle and anti-glare technology for easier composing and shooting even in direct, bright sunlight. \n\nHD Movie 720p\nA simple, one-touch button allows you to record movies with amazing clarity in high-definition, right from your camera. \n\nDual Image Stabilization\nDual Image Stabilization combines Sensor-Shift Image Stabilization with high ISO sensitivity and fast shutter speeds to capture crisp, clear images in any situation. \n\n2 GB Internal Memory\nStore more photos and videos than ever before, right in your camera with 2GB of internal memory (usable memory is 1.83GB). \n\nAF Tracking\nAF Tracking automatically tracks unpredictable, fast-moving subjects such as kids and pets, and continuously adjusts the focus and brightness so you can capture these photogenic whirlwinds with ease. \n\nCreative Art Filters\nUsing Creative Art Filters you can give your photos a distinct look and artistic feel by applying one of four different in-camera effects, including Pop Art, Pinhole, Fisheye and Drawing. \n\nIntelligent Auto\nThe Intelligent Auto setting identifies the scene you're shooting -- portrait, landscape, night portrait, macro, or sport -- and adjusts the settings to optimize results. \n\nAdvanced Face Detection\nFace Detection automatically focuses on your subjects' faces and optimizes exposure for sharp, brilliant portrait pictures. \n\nIn-Camera Panorama\nCaptures three images and stitches them together to create one amazing panoramic picture by simply pressing the shutter button and slowly panning across a panoramic scene. \n\nShadow Adjustment\nShadow Adjustment Technology helps you capture scenes exactly as you see them, even in difficult lighting situations--perfect for outside shots in bright sun when dark shadows are prevalent or shooting in backlit situations. \n\nBeauty Mode\nBeauty Mode lets you smooth a person\u2019s skin, removing unwanted wrinkles or blemishes. Additionally, make subtle edits, such as slightly emphasizing and brightening the eyes, with a new post-capture feature: Beauty Fix. \n\nPerfect Shot Preview\nUsing a live, multi-frame window on the LCD, Perfect Shot Preview lets you view the effects of various settings and then select and capture the perfect shot.",
