Second, as other reviewers have said, it leaves a layer of an oily feeling on my skin. The oily build up was even evident on my exfoliating gloves... so gross! The product before would exfoliate without a residue feeling left behind. Very disappointed, unfortunately, I will not be purchasing anymore.",
