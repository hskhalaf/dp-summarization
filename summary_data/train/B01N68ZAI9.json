The one and only thing that kinda sucks is the pockets for cards are deep and you have to double up on the number of cards per pocket because theres not enough of them. I used my direct tv remote to help people size the wallet",

It's a struggle to get my ID out every single time I need it. (A tip: I put the cards I use often - my ID and debits - in the large money slot.

Pretty design. The Bad: Since it does have such a large capacity a well as thick padding, it is a fairly large and thick wallet which is great to use as a clutch but difficult to fit in smaller purses. Overall: I love this wallet! Excellent for anyone who still carries cash and coins. If you carry no cash and many cards, you may want to look for a different design. Makes a stylish, useful clutch and can even fit your phone!",

It holds all my cards my credit cards my store shopping discount cards my insurance cards and I still have room for more if I need. The snap enclosure holds my iPhone 6 Plus perfectly and I have another pocket for my bills in addition to the zippered enclosure which will hold my coin just fine. I am very happy with my purchase!",
