It\u2019s a no fuss shoe with an easy-to-wear makeup and easy-to-clean upper.Those with broad feet might need to size up \u00a0as this go-to casual sneaker comes naturally narrow.

Really comfortable, great for driving and just general chilling out. If you're walking miles, I'd suggest either thicker socks or a different trainer, as the soles are quite thin, so can be a little uncomfortable after a while. Low tread and a thin sole, so I'd avoid puddles... Bit on the narrow side, but I do have wide feet.",
