      "text": "Ok... I know it says \"Heeled Sandal\" in the product title, but I didn't know what that meant. So, I admit this was my fault. I really liked the look of the shoe, so I bought a pair. When pulling one out the box, it was sooooooo light. Too light. Then, I looked and saw the shoe doesn't have rubber tread on the bottom, just foam all the way... like a pair of flip-flops. So, I guess that's why it's a \"Sandal\". I was definitely looking for a pair of shoes; these are not shoes... so I'm returning them. With that being said... these fit well and are comfortable. But, they are over-priced for what they are.",
