They did not sound as good as the Klipsch set I had for around 8 years but they were close enough and less expensive. Barely 3 months later the left earbud starts cutting off intermittently. I had to constantly play with the cable to get it to come on. I initially thought it was the headphone jack in my ipod but the problem was there on my other devices as well. If they work they are 4 star headphones. Edit: Contacted Westone support and they replaced the headset with the Alpha's. So far no complaints since they are essentially the same headphones as far as sound goes.",

After another 10 days or so of use, thought, the sound in both sides has diminished and not returned. These aren't the most expensive, but they're not cheap drugstore buds either. I've requested a return from the Amazon Seller. Failing that, I'll request an exchange or return via Westone Audio.",

Great build quality and accesories' inclusion. The \"beta\" iteration has less bass (yet still a lot), that sounds somewhat muddier/woolier than the alpha. Still a great headphone, however, if you like your bass. The fit on both the alpha and the beta is great; comfortable and feels non-existent, especially with the correctly ear-matched tips. Bass feels slightly more controlled while listening using the true-fit foam tips. Recommended for bassheads who want high-quality bassy sound. Not recommended for activities due to price; best to use something cheaper and easily replaceable.",

The midrange is so hollowed out as to appear to be 20 feet behind the drumkit. They are the opposite of the Shure \"house sound\" (which have sublime midrange) They are very well made earbuds.

      "text": "I've owned a set of custom molded Westone ES2 in-ear monitors for about 13 years, so I am familiar with the Westone sound and quality. I have recently started to travel quite a bit, and was in the market for a quality set of monitors in the $100 - $150 range. These sound almost as good as the $700 ES2! I am not happy with the cloth coated cable. The ES2 has a braided metal exterior, which is non absorbent, and much more flexible. Where I would never use these on-stage, they are a nice upgrade for those who demand more from a set of personal monitors, without getting into the custom fit models.",

      "text": "Well I purchased these head phones with high hopes. Unfortunately the first time I used them on my apple computer, the phones for some odd reason kept shocking my ear canals. Im not sure why this is happening. Getting shocked in the ear canal is not pleasant. For the money I spent I'm very dissapointed..",
