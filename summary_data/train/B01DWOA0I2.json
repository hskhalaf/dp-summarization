I don't know why the sizing of BareTraps changed but they did. I have a former pair in a 6 1/2 which they were the perfect fit. The next year I ordered a brown and black in that 6 1/2 way to small , gave them to my daughter in law which she wears a 5 and they fit her perfect. So you really need to go at least a 1/2 size larger to be happy with the fit.",

I was also pretty surprised the foot bed was pretty hard given the brand. The material was oddly shiny as well. The style is nice but I'm not keeping them due to the material.",

They are a bit shiny, but that doesn\u2019t bother me. I have somewhat skinny calves, and they fit my legs really well and are not too gappy at the top, which is nice because typically I have trouble finding boots that are not too gappy at the top. So glad I bought these!",

I am normally a size 8 or 8.5 but the 8.5 in these boots was too small in the toe area and the size 9 fit great! They are not uncomfortable though I wonder how they will feel after I've worn them for several hours. Also I really like how they fit around my calves/legs. I hate how most boot I see are wide width or wide calf. I do not have wide calves. So if you are like me then these are not skin tight but fit pretty good with skinny jeans on.",
