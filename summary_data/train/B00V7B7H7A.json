Whether it be wine glasses, beer glasses, or just water, this is a great final touch to any party. I recommend waiting a few minutes before picking up the glass where you wrote on it just to let it dry, but overall, the writing came off the in the dishwasher which was an added bonus. I read a few reviews that said you'd have to take it off manually, but the dishwasher did just fine!",

If you wait hours or until the next day, you may have to give it a gentle rub for it to come off. Definitely no scrubbing needed though. Highly recommend these markers.",

I write with them on mirrors and put names on wine glasses at parties. Everyone loves them. The only thing that you have to watch for is that some colors work better on some things than others (i.e. Gold won't show up if you write on a jar full of white rice or a glass of white wine, it it's great on a jar of black beans or red wine).",
