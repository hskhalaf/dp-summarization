Then desolder/cut off the speaker component - see before and after pictures below. Do at your own risk, voids warranty, no guarantees etc. etc., but an easy procedure if you want to try it.",

So, it will work for a few years and then one day it won't and I'll have to hunt down the weird little battery for it on Amazon. Guaranteed, the day the battery craps out will be the day I need the fan or fan light to work. Not worth uninstalling and sending back, I'll just deal with it.",

This also could be because this fan wasn\u2019t manufactured to have it, so why make the space right?

One nice thing is that if you flip the wall switch on an off the light goes on even if it was switched off at the remote. Nice for going into a dark room and the remote is not by the door. Kind of a reset/over ride. It is especially useful when you only have a single remote.",

Although that worked, the fan motor housing doesn't align with all screw holes, but we got it to hold with the ones we could align. The product works perfectly and is convenient if you only have a single switch plate. My suggestion would be to try to manufacture with a smaller housing if possible.",
