The countersink collar itself has two set screws which are easily tightened and loosened for adjustment. I haven't had them too long so I cannot comment on the long term durability, but DeWalt makes solid products, so I'm not too worried. The Bad: I have run into a few instances where one of the set screws was a little difficult to screw back in and went in on a weird angle. This was probably my fault, but you do have to be careful when using an Allen wrench to adjust the tiny set screws.",

The countersink is easily moved on the bit using hex set screws and can be removed if you don't need it.
