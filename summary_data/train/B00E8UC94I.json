You can test the alkalinity level and notice it will perfectly match the indicated pH level. Functionality is as easy as pressing a button and start letting run water through it. The only tiny inconvenient I see is that it seems active carbon filter life span seems to be decreasing a bit fast, so you may need to change it every 6 to 9 months depending on the use and the quality of water at your locality.",

You have to understand this is not a 3-4 Thousand Water Machine and have to take precautions like cleaning often and I advise if your filling jugs to give it about a 10 minute break in between. Otherwise than that, I love the thing. Even has a meter that works correctly as I have all the instruments to check what the machine puts out.",

I have only had this unit for 4 days so I can't honestly grade the Iontech Alkaline water machine just yet but i will say the unit seems to perform as intended and looks nice in my kitchen. Installation was easy as 123 and the water tastes great. I will update this review in a few weeks after we take the ionizer through its paces.",
