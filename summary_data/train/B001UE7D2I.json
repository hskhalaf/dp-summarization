Sometimes it cuts off after a minute or two, and at first I thought it was overheating, but once it turns back on (usually after a minute or so) it stays on for a good 10 minutes so that can't be it. Seems like there's a short circuit somewhere that keeps getting triggered. I'll hear a clicking noise and then it's completely fine. Just FYI - if you want to deal with that, then it's fine. Otherwise, look elsewhere.",

The older model was manufactured with better materials. I would not purchase this particular hair dryer ever again.",

Excellent hair dryer at first; something I would've recommended to all my friends with thick hair, since I have thick hair, but it broke so quickly.",

My daughter would fry her hair if she used my dryer, plus it is way to heavy and requires the skill of holding while brushing! This is a great product for teenagers!! Mom approved!!!",
