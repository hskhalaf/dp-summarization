      "text": "My only complaint with this camera is the extremely fleeting battery life. Even with two spare batteries the camera would be dead before the end of the day. To be fair, I was shooting primarily video in 1280P. Stabilization in standard zoom is excellent, highly recommend getting a tripod for static video. Touch screen display is super responsive, and the 90 degree tilt is great for panning and filming while walking - does not allow for selfie-shooting. More features than I used but great to have.",

Quality is good fine-Like my canon g-10 power shot, I keep it in program mode with -1/3 exposure compensation and mostly it works fine. Connection to cell phone/tablet easy enough. Touch screen focus is handy combine with touch screen shutter release is much better than ring on front release... Using touch shutter release, touch the screen where you want it to focus it seems to adjust focus to the shutter touch point. I really wanted it because I think it looks good...I own better cameras,",

But no on can seem to get that function to work, and it was a prime selling point of the camera so will probably be returning. b) Listing should also include \"What's in the box\"!!! Nothing in the listing or on the Canon site mentioned a neck strap, so we shelled out an additional $15 for a neck strap, only to find that one came with the camera. c) Camera comes with a blue bottom shell (presumably to protect the SD card & battery doors), but shell does not fit properly when neck strap is attached. Not a very good design.",

So many of these small cameras move at the effort of presing the picture button. With this camera you are able to hold it solid while you trip the shutter. Canon has done another good job. I have not used the wireless feature yet but look forward to learning it as my PC and printer are wireless.",

It doesn't float and it isn't waterproof (I knew this...) and it went straight to the bottom of the Caribbean sea. I bought a Powershot 270 SX270 instead.",

Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of Canon's advanced image and scene analysis technology to apply a range of artistic presets based on the individual scene, subject, and exposure. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five unique variations of the composition by cropping it, rotating it, or adjusting its color, tone, and more. The result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.\n\nEXERCISE COMPLETE CONTROL WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES\nNEWLY DESIGNED 2.8-INCH CAPACITIVE, TILT, TOUCH PANEL LCD; LENS SHUTTER; AND ZOOM RING OFFER USERS A UNIQUE AND CREATIVE WAY TO CAPTURE PHOTOS\nLeverage the flexibility and creativity of the PowerShot N using a set of new innovative controls. The newly designed 2.8-inch capacitive LCD monitor is more than just a means of reviewing your photos. 90-degrees of tilt open up new perspectives when framing shots \u2013 shoot diagonally, horizontally, from low angles or high for the perfect emphasized shot. The top-mounted hinge keeps the PowerShot N compact, even when folded out, for easy, one-handed operation. Adjust settings and modes using the intuitive touch-screen menu\u2014use gestures to zoom, rotate, and select images. Dual rings provide effortless control over the lens and shutter. The outer ring controls the shutter, which can be released from any point on the ring. Whichever angle or position you choose to hold the PowerShot N, the shutter release is always under your finger for quick and discreet release. The inner ring controls the zoom of the 28mm Wide-Angle 8x Optical Zoom lens with Optical Image Stabilizer, ensuring your images are sharp and clear. Responsive and silent zoom action provides a welcome feel of tactile control that makes operating the PowerShot N an incredible experience.\n\nA POWERFUL AND COMPACT NEW LENS\n8X OPTICAL ZOOM WITH 28MM WIDE-ANGLE LENS\nThe PowerShot N houses a Genuine Canon 8x Optical Zoom Lens in the center of its square-shaped body, allowing you to capture powerful shots with outstanding optical performance and versatility. The zoom starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 224mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), covering a wide and highly useful range. The telephoto reach gives you the freedom to capture subjects from afar, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings.\n\nOPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical in more shooting situations, providing excellent image quality in many difficult situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\nBEAUTIFUL IMAGES AND FAST PERFORMANCE START HERE\n12.1 MEGAPIXEL HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nThe PowerShot N employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.\n\nCANON DIGIC 5 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the PowerShot N's image sensor to bring phenomenal increases in processing speed and power, delivering incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. The faster processing speed results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the PowerShot N can achieve higher ISO sensitivity and even perform advanced functions like lens correction, special scene modes and much more.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM FOR EXCEPTIONAL LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE UP TO ISO 6400\nThe PowerShot N gives you the power to create images with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. The 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works in concert with Canon's latest-generation DIGIC 5 Image Processor to create the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you'll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality even at high ISO speeds all the way up to ISO 6400; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur in a variety of situations for incredible photos and even when shooting video.\n\nGET THE COMPLETE HD EXPERIENCE\nCAPTURE STUNNING 1080P FULL HD VIDEO WITH A DEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON, PLUS ZOOM WHILE SHOOTING\nSimply touch the dedicated movie button on the PowerShot N to start recording video in 1080p Full HD that is breathtakingly vivid and realistic. You're free to use the full range of the zoom in movie mode to get the video you want. You can also view and share your video on an HDTV to enjoy.\n\nOPTIMAL IMAGE STABILIZATION IN ANY SITUATION\nINTELLIGENT IS AUTOMATICALLY CHOOSES FROM SIX DIFFERENT MODES TO OPTIMIZE IMAGE STABILIZATION FOR THE SHOOTING CONDITION\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot N, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. ADDITIONAL FEATURES\nECO MODE\nThe PowerShot N takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed or with a touch of the LCD screen. With ECO Mode activated to conserve power, you can even stay connected for longer with the built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae feature on the PowerShot N. With ECO Mode, you can be sure that your camera will keep up when fun with family and friends runs late into the night!\n\nSHOOTING MODES\nPowerShot cameras offer shooting modes that make it easy to take perfect photos in a wide range of shooting situations by providing intelligent presets with optimized settings.\n\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Hybrid Auto Automatically selects shooting settings for optimal quality and records a video clip before capturing a still image. One day's worth of clips are then combined into a video. Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions. Creative Shot Analyzes the scene and applies a number of creative filters to automatically create five variations in addition to the original image. Fisheye Effect Now you can get the fisheye effect \u2013 a classic photographic distortion \u2013 without a fisheye lens. Miniature Effect Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image. Toy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with \"toy\" or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect. Soft Focus Creates a hazy ambiance that's perfect for portraits and wedding photos. Monochrome Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue. Movie Record video; unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode. Super Slow Motion Movie Record your clips in high speed (approx. 240 fps), and then watch your videos in slow motion. Actual results may vary from examples shown above.\nFinal image may vary depending on picture composition.\n\nEASILY CHARGE BY USB\nIn addition to standard outlet charging, the PowerShot N can be easily charged using a USB cable anytime. It is possible to charge the camera by connecting it to devices with USB ports such as a notebook PC, for convenient charging when you are out or traveling, or even when saving photos to your computer.",
