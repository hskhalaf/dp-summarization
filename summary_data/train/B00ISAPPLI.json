      "text": "Honestly the first time I tried this I stopped after a few days because it is a commitment. You have to have bathroom access. With the lockdown I was able to commit and would take around 8 am and between 2-4 pm I needed to be home. Do not take and think you won't urgently need the restroom because theres no avoiding it. It helped my heartburn, and after the stomach pain subsides you do feel more energetic. I have done the cleanse several times and am happy with the results. If you take at night you could wake up and need the restroom or it could be around noon. Drink water, lots of it. It helps.",
