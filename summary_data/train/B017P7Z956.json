      "text": "I purchased a pair of Hunter Women's boots in a size 6 in January from Zappos. To my dismay the right boot has already cracked in a few places (pls see picture attached) although I just started wearing them a few weeks ago. This is surprising since I normally think as Hunter as a quality brand and have purchased similar rain boots in the past which lasted for years. Unfortunately Amazon will not replace the boots since it's past Amazon's 30 day return policy. Sadly Zappos stands behind Amazon's return policy and won't replace them either. They offered me a 25% refund but would have much rather have gotten a new pair...",

For the money, I'd rather not have that big, red label. Not attractive in my opinion!",
