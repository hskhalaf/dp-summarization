The pucks glide very easily on this surface, so if you release too hard, it's easy to hit the gutter. Otherwise, I love this product because it small which makes it very portable. The design and craftwork and paint and so on is really good quality.",

It is solid, seems well built, the surface seems to be in good condition and the bearings glide across as they should. Its a great tabletop game for the family, even the young ones love to push the pieces down the board.",

I contacted Carrom and asked if these items were necessary. They said no: \"We would not recommend you use anything on the surface other than a duster and if absolutely necessary a barely damp soft cloth.\"",

They do not roll true and wiggle across the board. You will roll it straight and can watch the puck drastically change direction. Now, this has made for some interesting games where it looked like the puck juked around another one, of course it was planned then. :) I'm planning on seeing if the company will replace the pucks or I might just buy replacements, but we are just using the 30 year old pucks from the original game for now.",

I know how to play shuffleboard already, and was pretty sure I didn't know how to play after reading the rules, I though a page must be missing or something.

The pucks glide fine, and the board is nicely made. A good value. We had, and continue to have a lot of fun with this. My only suggestion is that they figure out some kind of puck storage mechanism, even a felt bag stapled to the bottom; I keep the pucks in a zip-lock bag while this stands up in the corner when not in use.",

My 6 & 8 year old kids picked it up very quickly and routinely beat me. The pucks slide well and the board is very sturdy. Our dining room table is slightly wider than most and the table sits perfectly going width-wise...and it's small enough to move about the house if we need to eat at the table. A great family add.",
