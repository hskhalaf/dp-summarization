We don't use the robber at all- it caused too much contention. 3, in order to make the games shorter (2 hours per game \ud83d\ude31), we only build roads leading to ports where we can trade. We kept all other rules. It's addicting: Age of Empires, almost, except without the computer or the ability to attack your enemies towns & tear them down!",

They're printed on light, flimsy, card stock that I was almost afraid to touch. They feel like something that would come in a happy-meal freebie. Compared to the rest of the game they stuck out like a sore thumb. In fact, I grabbed the resource cards from the Caanan game and subbed them out before we even started playing.

Can be mixed with other games (take Diplomacy theme and apply it to resourcing...likely why there is a GOT, Roman, Barbarian, Viking, etc. versions).

I do wish it could be effectively payed by only two, but that's not an inherent drawback to the game. I've played Monopoly all my life, and always will, but this game is actually more interesting with many more possible outcomes. Like the old Alka-Seltzer ads use to say: \"Try it, you'll like it!\"",

The final confirmation came when my bf got me the expansion (from Catan Studios) which had the beautiful colors and flawless houses... And I noticed that the manufacturers were different.

The cards come in two packs that should presumably be different, but we received two identical decks that only contained resource cards. Also, all of the game board sections quickly started to warp (see photos). So, even if we had all the cards, it would be difficult to place settlements. The game is great, I've played \"Settlers of Catan\" before and I was hoping to play with my family, but the game that we received was incomplete and very poor quality.",

I think the quality of the box is good, it seems like it would hold up for 1000 years on a shelf, however the cardboard pieces inside seem to be of average quality.

Playing with 4 players is much more challenging and makes you think a lot more about your placement of your settlements and roads. It's so much fun and we really love playing it as much as we can!

Our old game (and old design) was loved so well that the cards and board pieces got worn down (not because of a manufacturing or quality problem) so we recently had to get a new one. The newer updated version looks nice and clean. This one is more animated than realistic like the old one. Other than your preference on the old or new design, there is nothing not to like about this game. It will be well loved just like our previous one.",

I personally like the 4th edition a bit better, how the pieces fit together and how they look, but probably just because that's the version I've always had. This is a great game and once you get the rules and strategy down, you can get through a four-person game in 30 to 45 minutes. It definitely makes you think about strategy a lot and is always interesting because the game board is always a little different so you have to change your strategy based on the resources available to you. Great game, I highly recommend it!",
