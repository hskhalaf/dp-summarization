Yesterday I found him chirping at it and enjoying it but when he held the bell part his foot got stuck. Some part of the bell or the plastic that fastens it is catching his foot over and over again. Scary. I think I am going to cut the bell part off. Love the disco ball. The bell has got to go.",

It is for sure his favorite, when he is resting he sits by it, and you can always tell when he is happy cause he'll give it a tap. Sometimes he plays rough with it too. Sometimes he will bend down and touch the bell. A great toy for your bird!",

And it's very easy to clean I just wipe it down with water and leave the water droplets on there which is even more fun for Pecker. The disco ball is about the same size as the little bird but it's his favorite toy so he doesn't care.",
