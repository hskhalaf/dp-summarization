When my hubby first originally assembled it in Dec 2018, all he had to do is put a bit of pressure and the steering wheel stayed put. For fun that lasted only for 4 months, this product was disappointing and pretty expensive. I wish I could return it for a refund.",

Unfortunately, the car we got was defective - the wheels ground against the plastic and the 20-30 pound toddler couldn't get it to move.

The kids under 4 I've seen have a hard time with the coordination it takes to operate the \"swivel\" motion, but it's a short learning curve. Older kids will get it right away, the motion is pretty intuitive. Regardless, this is a fun little buggy to include in your arsenal of outdoor toys and I highly recommend it.",

It might have helped if the road out front of his house were a bit smoother. It seems that the bumpier the surface, the more difficult the maneuvering to get it to move faster than a slow walk.

We keep these cars indoors because we do not want to get gravel & dirt on the wheels and then bring them in again to be ridden on the wood floors because they may scratch. No worries of scratching the wood if the wheels are clean though.",

The smooth concrete floor allows more speed and they zoom around for hours. All of the other ride ons we purchased spent most of their time parked. They give the kids a little engineering lesson. All you have to do is wiggle the handle bars and they way the wheels are placed in the front allow for the inertia to create movement.",

Temptation got a hold of dad, who is 6'-2\" 180lbs, as he boogied around the kitchen too. Quite funny. Well made, easy to put together. This is a toy that kids can grow into for several more years. Well worth buck$. Get one, you'll be very happy you did.",

Luckily it is the smaller front wheels which barely ever hit the ground. Other than that they do love riding on them, even though they use their feet to propel them, they don't work well on our paved driveway just using the handlebar thing. So all our shoes are developing holes where they scrape across the ground. The kids all love them though. It is the first fought over riding toy in the daycare..",

The plasma car is easy to put together (65 year old Nana had no problem!), and is a favorite outdoor toy for the kids. It does pick up some speed, and one would think there are safety issues in that, but the grandkids (ages, 3,6,6,8) intuitively know when to put down their feet to slow the vehicle. The quality of the toy is great and we have no worries about it breaking and causing injury while they are riding it.",

We need to take it some place with a bigger surface than our driveway, to see what it can really do. Four stars because tipping has been a big problem so far.",

I can't recommend this enough - a great car for the little ones and like nothing else I've ever seen.

    "description": "Color:RedThe sleek, innovative design of The Original PlasmaCar features a patented safety seat, polypropylene wheels, and is kid powered; kid approved! Sit with both feet on the footrests, turn the steering wheel and away you go. Turn and navigate in small spaces indoors, and ride outdoors on sidewalks, pathways, and any other safe, smooth, flat surface. The award-winning PlasmaCar is easy to operate, and helps your child develop coordination, balance, and motor skills while harnessing the natural forces of inertia, centrifugal force, gravity, and friction. PlasmaCar is adult-friendly too: it doesn\u2019t require an expensive power source that needs constant replacement, it provides kids with plenty of exercise, and it is quiet, the only sound you\u2019ll hear is the sound of the wheels. Adult assembly required; instructions included. Please review all warning labels and read instruction manual before using this toy. Fully assembled: 31\u201d x 14\u201d x 16\u201d. Model No. PC020\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nIt's like magic, but you don't need to be a magician to get it to work. The PlasmaCar is a mechanical marvel that makes use of that most inexhaustible of energy sources, kid-power, by harnessing the natural forces of inertia, centrifugal force, gravity, and friction. It's so easy to operate; all it needs is a driver and a smooth, flat surface. The PlasmaCar is adult-friendly, too. For starters, it doesn't require an expensive power source that needs constant replacement. No batteries, no power-cells, no liquid fuel-just the occasional cookie or two. It's quiet too-the only sound you'll hear is the sound of its wheels. It provides kids with plenty of exercise, more so than most toys. And the PlasmaCar is engineered to be absolutely safe when used appropriately. It's been extensively tested, and meets or exceeds all significant international safety standards.
