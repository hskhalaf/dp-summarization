However, after using this the second time, the stiffening rods came completely out. Poor product design. *** 2nd UPDATE The company sent me a second hammock to replace the faulty one. I went camping this past weekend and was very thankful that I had brought another hammock for backup. See the pictures to see how this \u201cnew replacement \u201c hammock came out of the box. Don\u2019t buy from this company!!!",

Thanks changing my review to 5 stars! ORIGINAL REVIEW: While I love the idea of this hammock, it arrived with one of the 'hoops' broken. Even though technically it would still keep mosquitoes out, it would eventually poke through the netting where it is broken. Sadly we had to return it...and as it was a lightening deal I was not offered an exchange, just a refund. Next time it goes on sale I will try it again and then update my review.",

      "text": "Good hammock, cheaper than others like it with the same quality. The mosquito net is a nice touch and is way better for camping. My favorite feature is that the net doesn't need to be secured to stand up like most, could even really use it as a makeshift tent probably if you get a rainfly. The mosquito net is dark green and hammock part is whatever you chose. Definitely room for a couple smaller sized people or really comfortable for just 1. Haven't actually went camping with it to see if the mosquito net works yet, will update but overall I would say it's a good buy.",

The rope that came with the unit is very nice quality material and the same rope is used on the hammock. Putting it back in the pouch was very easy also. It was nice taking a nap inside the mesh, the net is closed off with a zipper slider which zipped very smoothly.",

Some of the poor reviews cited the tendency of the mosquito net thread to break. My advice is to lay in the hammock like you are supposed to and it won't break. The net threading isn't meant to support weight. Great product! I am happy I bought it.",

Update from 2 stars - after posting my review, I received a message from the seller asking if they could send me a replacement. I received the new one today and look forward to using it.
