The best combination we've found for allergies as been the combination of a nasal spray like patanase and/or nasonex for nasal symptoms plus naphcon A for eye symptoms. Pretty much anything with Naphazoline and Pheniramine will be effective, but I trust Alcon to get the solution perfect every single time. This is not an eye moisturizer, and it's not for eye infections like pinkeye. It stops itchy, teary eyes from allergies in its tracks.",
