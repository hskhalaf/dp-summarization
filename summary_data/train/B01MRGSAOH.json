If I had any tweaks, I'd make the cup holder slightly deeper and I'd love if it could go around the seat instead of her (for easier removal mid- trip) but the aren't complaints.

The extra compartment in the bottom is great for storage, and straps make the whole thing easy for the little ones to carry their own stuff. These are lightweight, well-made, and clean up easily.

It made the drive go by so much faster bc they were entertained coloring, doing homework, playing with Poke\u0301mon cards and eating snacks on the tray. It kept everything contained and organized! It is so easy to clean and a really good quality product.",
