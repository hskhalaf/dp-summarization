I even tried re-installing then uninstalling the offending program, but to no avail -- apparently it exists only in McAfee's imagination. I returned the software and just switched to AVG. Such a waste of time. Boo, McAfee.",

      "text": "I have used McAffee for a couple of years, but this one is real junk. Since the last update, the console that allows me to stop a scan no longer appears. It scans whenever it feels like it. The infected files list in the log has a length of about 10 characters ( nothing like you have an infection in C:/Program_f. ) It gives false positives. So, why am I sitting at my computer. Well McAffee decided to scan even though it was scheduled to run at 7am. I can't stop it, and it will not let windows shut down. So, I suppose I do what I now have to do to shut down my computer - pull the plug.",

Realizing that, McAfee has loaded this with extra features. My guess is most people will only use a small number of features beyond those that run automatically, but if you have use for the parental controls, data backup, shredder, or other extras, it might be worth getting this all in one package rather than installing several apps from different companies. All in all it's good software, even if the price seems a bit high.",
