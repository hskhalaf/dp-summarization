I keep running it into walls (By mistake of course) and it takes the hits like a champ!",

There is one glitch in the instruction booklet however, it states that the on/off switch is on top of the helicopter. I scoured the top unable to find the switch. The switch is on the right side of the helicopter opposite the charging input. The S107H is very easy to fly, it hovers in one position when not touching the controls. It flies great indoors, but outdoors, it is pretty iffy. The slightest wind can carry it away if you are not careful. With a little practice, you can land it on a book.",

Perfect indoor flier, took it outside a few times and it is just to light to withstand any type of breeze. I have used small helicopters before and some were expensive (brookstone), but this the best by far. Thinking of getting two more for the kids and I to race. Battery life is short compared to charge time. 5 mins/1 hour. Otherwise, I love it!",

The old one would fall out of the sky when letting off of the altitude control. The battery runtime is very good! Hubby and I traded off a couple of times, pretty sure we were well past 5 minutes. Our rule: when you crash, you let the other pilot take over. \ud83d\ude04 Again, great little helicopter to fly indoors, to entertain cats and dogs, and put a smile on human faces, too!",

It's pretty smooth flying this around the house but it's recommended to do this in outdoors especially if you are new to this. The blades can be a bit sharp so it's best to avoid contact with it. It's a bit noisy when flying/hovering but great fun overall which lasts about 5-6 minutes before needed a charge (about an hour).",

      "text": "We ordered this little helicopter for a birthday party for our preteen niece and did not expect much based on the price. We were pleasantly surprised when this toy captured the attention of both children and adults at our gathering. Everyone wanted a turn and was able to easily operate it. The unit is light, highly maneuverable and has very realistic flight pattern! We and our guests enjoyed it and recommend it to others looking for a realistic helicopter done.",

It has an auto-return button, it hovers easily, turns goes backward, dives,...we had great fun for almost 30 minutes I think. This is THEEEE helicopter to have immediate fun with!!",

It has automatic take off but be careful because the throttle is at half way all the time so it picks up and goes immediately. I do wish there was a manual takeoff option. It charges quick and lasts quite a while on one charge. All in all good for a beginner!",
