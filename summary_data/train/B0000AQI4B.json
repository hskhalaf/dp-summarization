She is using them with the Louisville Slugger Series 5 Intermediate Catcher's Gear that we also bought on amazon and they work great. She is able to have more support behind her knees when she is squatting. I was worried about the wear and tear on her knees playing catcher, I feel these help a lot. She is able to pop up quicker and she plays a lot more innings as catcher without feeling fatigued I would recommend these knee savers and would certainly buy them again.",

It's tricky to get the straps from the shin guards through the knee savers' loops but I suppose this is a good thing so when the shin guards are removed from the catcher's legs, the pads don't fall out easily. The pads themselves seem sturdy and I hope it lasts until my daughter outgrows it. Bought her the small size and she is 9. The other catchers on her team use this and they all think it's more comfortable.",
