This is not an IPS screen, though it never claims to be one. - Short battery life of ~3 hours when just web surfing - Huge track pad causes bad wrist angles for typing - Did not come with a nvme ssd Tip: Use Windows 10's Fresh Start feature to reinstall Windows without the bloatware.",

I haven\u2019t purchased a laptop in years so I took a lot of time to research on a brand and msi was it. This computer in my opinion has everything. Especially the cd drive since those are being phased out. All my games work perfect if not better than before! Love the RGB keyboard and the light up logo in the back. 1 thing though, this laptop is a smudge magnet. That is the only negative thing I can say. Best warranty",

      "text": "Had the laptop for little over a year and an extremely common error occurs with a lot of their products. The c,r,8,9,0 and backspace keys stop working unless you put pressure on a spot right to the right of the mouse pad. Didn't drop or spill anything on the laptop just a faulty product. Support ignores the multitude of complaints on forums listing this exact problem. Called customer service and they told me I need to get a replacement keyboard for $300-$400 despite that it is a manufacturing issue. The laptop is extremely prone to this issue more likely than not it will happen down the line. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Can't stress that enough!",
