You can hold it in your hand, pass it back and forth, leave it in your pocket and it warms you up in a flash. I bought several as gifts as well and they're a BIG HIT. Turns out my girlfriend has Renaud's Syndrome (extremely poor circulation) and she put the one I gave her inside one mitten on the drive to work. She sent me pix afterwards and the contrast between the two hands was scary! So she bought another one, but noted that it's difficult to drive to work with both! AHAHA! Don't do it, but buy this Hand Warmer!",

I charge it up and it will hold a charge for a long time. It fits well into a pocket, it has a nice smooth finish that feels good to hold, and it can also be used as a power bank to charge other things (like my phone, which doesn't hold a charge nearly as long). I love that this provides quick, consistent heat. I'm planning to buy more of these for gifts!",
