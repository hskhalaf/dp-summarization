It doesn\u2019t suction the iPhone like other cases does so that\u2019s a big plus! It has a small bump on the front so if it falls it has some protection, but I would still put a screen protector on because mine has fallen and I\u2019ve still broke the screen protector. Looks great and would buy again! Recommend.",

The corners seem like they will definitely protect it from a fall, but are unobtrusive enough that they don't get in the way.",

Simple durable design, no issues with the button mechanisms. My last clear case turned yellow and that was about forty dollars, this shoes bo sign of color change yet and had it for months.

I bought the clear case because I wanted to see a sticker I put on the phone itself. It's easy for me to press the right side button to turn the screen on and off but sometimes I feel like I have to press a little harder for the volume buttons. It's a good case considering I almost dropped 30 dollars for one at the mall.",
