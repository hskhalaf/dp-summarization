It's a good light, but it's awkward to use.",

The numerals on the clock are too bright even on the dimmest setting (there is no way to turn them off), and any time it gets accidentally unplugged or there is a power failure, you need to reset the entire thing. There is no battery option. I wish I had returned it. Complete waste of money.",

Honestly, when she doesn't have to work early and I wake up to just my regular alarm, I find it to be a much more jarring experience. I guess we're both reaping the benefits! The alarm sounds are all bird chirps and nature sounds, and they gradually increase in volume, easing you into wakefulness. It's pretty rad!",

Now, my body gradually wakes up with the simulated sunrise and I'm ready to get out of bed when the birds start chirping (the alarm sound that also gradually gets louder). If you're already getting 8 hours of sleep but still have trouble waking up without sunlight, I highly recommend this alarm clock. It's helped me tremendously. There are a few drawbacks in design, but none of those interfere with the function for me.",
