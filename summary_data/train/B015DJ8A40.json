Decided to try this lug wrench because there's not much room on a tight flatbed trailer I use for work so this looked like it would tuck into the tube steel frame until I need it and it fits perfectly. First impression is this thing is super solid. It's heavy for its size. Opens up and snaps together in 5 seconds. No prob with heavy torque. It's not going to bend. Per tight spaces, there's nothing on the market like this. Probably going to pick up a few for Christmas gifts.",

      "text": "Solid construction, but the \"ball bearings\" used to \"secure\" the two pieces together are very weak. Normally, you'd think of the push in style bearing, that provides more security so the two pieces won't slip. This just uses two very small ball bearings to hold one piece to the other. Playing with it with little pressure and you can easily slip past one bearing, and completely dismantle it. Imagine this happening when changing a tire? Presents a potential safety hazard. Beyond that issue, as said, very solid construction. Very compact. Cool concept, just wish it was more secure when creating the \"+\" or the \"L\" with a more robust bearing system.",

I'd like to counter one piece of feedback another reviewer made about the leverage you can attain with this device as the product picture is deceiving (in this case in your favor). You can configure the pieces to form an \"L\" which achieves maximum leverage. The photos show the product in the \"+\" configuration, which understandably gives you much less leverage. Although I hope that I never have to use this product while traveling, I have not doubt that it will provide great utility in actual practice.",

The carry bag is tough, well made material as well, with enough extra space for the lug nut key. I have already recommended it to friends and family. I will certainly be purchasing another!",

Not LugStrong it comes in a small pouch so it will fit in your manufacturers tool kit hole. When assembled it is a balanced ( X shape ). You can push and pull at the same time giving your self more torque to remove those stubborn lug nuts. Check it out, you won't be sorry!",
