      "title": "Great card!",
      "text": "This card is perfect for someone who doesnt want to spend 300$ to play their games on max settings. I've been able to play everything maxed out so far. Titanfall, Warcraft, Diablo 3, so far everything runs great. Went from a nvidia 9600 to this and it is a major upgrade. Like the 9600 i expect this card to last many years and it definitly plays the current gen of games on max settings assuming your cpu isn't limiting you. Easy install, is a little thicker than the 9600 card i had but installed no problem. I didnt use the drivers and overclock utility i just got the nvidia driver from www.nvidia.com instead.",

The two other monitors connected to the DVI ports down have the same issues. using another mini HDMI cable doesnt work. That being said.... performance is pretty good. I would do a GTX 750 before any other low end GPU from any other manufacturer. Runs super cool and the fan is pretty silent. If you are considering the Asus Strix 750ti, spend a little more for a GTX950 strix for a truly silent GPU option. If you haave the PSU connectors of course",
