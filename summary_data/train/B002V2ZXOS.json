      "text": "I bought this 72\" bar to upgrade from a 54\" short bar, mainly because I could not fit more weights on that bar (but also because I couldn't properly position my hands on squats and bench press). Well, it's a very solid bar, but unfortunately the length of outside the collars is exactly the same as my short bar - about 11.25\" on each side. I had assumed that some of the 18\" difference would be outside the collars. So I guess I should have gotten the 7' bar, but this would be cumbersome in my workout space. So instead I need to upgrade from the bulky vinyl plates to thin iron plates.",

Deducting the small collars, it is about 48 and 1/8\" between the collars. It fits my Progear1600 (rebranded Fitness Reality 810XLT) rack with inches to spare. Sleeves are 11.5\". Non-gnurled middle section is around 14.6\" It's what I would expect for a basic standard solid bar. Some bars in this price range are multi-piece and have a much lower maximum weight than the 250lbs this will hold. Needed it to do presses in a basement where a full size olympic bar had clearance issues.",
