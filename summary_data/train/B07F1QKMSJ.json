I didn\u2019t worry about it and tried not to move them. A little over a month has passed and the power cord fell out again. I go to connect it and it absolutely will not go in the jack. Now I have only 3 instead of four intercoms. Like I mentioned, another one is also loose. So will that break shortly too? I can\u2019t return them because the window of time is up. These were expensive to have broken so quickly. Bummed.",

The build is what you'd expect in today's world of plastic and not less or more than expected for the price. The sound quality was excellent considering we're not listening to music here. The installation consists of plugging the units into the wall sockets so a child of 3 could probably do it. I bought 2 units and I'm thinking about buying another one to put in a different room. Since I only use channel 1 right now, I'm not sure how using multiple channels will work out but I have no reason to think it won't work as advertised.",
