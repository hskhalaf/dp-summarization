We had to immediately stop using the product to avoid harming our baby. Buyer beware of this possible reaction when using this product on your baby. So disappointed to have to return this.",

The only thing that need to be adjusted is the rates for what is normal. An oxygen level in the 80's is not normal and 60 is super low for a child's heart rate. I wish I was able to adjust it myself. Hopefully in the future it will be adjusted to the correct normal limits.",

He wasn't but two feet away from me while I was working on a diaper cake for my sister-in-law's baby shower. He was so peaceful. The only reason it was not SIDS, is because he didn't die, the owlet monitor alarmed me immediately, giving me enough time to take action to save him. It landed us a hospital stay. I beg, beg, beg mothers to buy this. $300 is nothing compared to their priceless life.",

My phone was on vibrate one time so the alert only shows up on the phone without making a noise.",
