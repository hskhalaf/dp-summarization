      "text": "An outstanding tool. I'd recently had the opportunity to use an impact driver rather than a drill to install screws after drilling countersunk pilot holes. The quick connect 'drill and drive' type tool was ideally suited to use in an impact driver. The DCF887 is one sweet tool. The three speeds are wonderful for a wide spectrum of installations. I typically leave the setting at 1 and the torque is low enough that it's unlikely that I'll break another screw. The lower speed is ideal for starting screws. Absolutely NO regrets about this purchase.",

I am by no means an expert, but I used a less powerful masterforce impact that didn't over torque and drove the 4\" all the way in with a counter sink. It was slower, but got the job done. I would use this for heavier projects like driving lag bolts would be its ideal scenario. Good took, well built, just to much torque for smaller projects.",
