Avalon organics lavender is so potent and has that real lavender smell. This body wash is practically half essential oils, it cleans my skin but never leaves it feeling stripped. I've tried other body washes, like kiss my face, while smelling good it dried my skin out and left a residue feeling on my skin. Not with this stuff. It smells amazing and it's all natural essential oils not synthetic fragrance or anything. It's an aromatherapy experience every time you use it and it will leave your skin feeling super soft.",

Another thing I'd like to point out is this is a shower gel instead of a wash so a lot does come out and is needed in order to make it start to foam up but I still have plenty after a few months so it lasts quite a while. It does a pretty good job at moisturizing my body compared to some other products as well as neutralizing odors for a few hours after use.",

The body gel is so watery and wouldn't foam well like I'd like it to be. I wouldn't buy again because of the packaging issue. and low-quality product.",
