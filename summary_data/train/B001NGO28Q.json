The conical burr produces less coffee dust and a very consistent grind. The really fine powder was always an issue on the standard burr grinder. Hopper pours better into the coffee maker due to the shape of the hopper. This results in less spillage when dumping into the machine. Still really easy to use with the grinding timer that grind the proper amount of coffee for the number of cups you want to brew.",

All the ground coffee freely slides wherever you like. You don't have to do it very often to make the plastic \"slightly\" conductive, and you don't have to create aa special solution. They're already on the sheets. Try it. Yes, I'd recommend this to anyone.",

      "text": "Bought this after trying to use grocery store grinder for a french press. This is much better -- more consistent grind & way less fine powder. Personally, I think it's plenty coarse for french press (I use one of the less coarse settings for French press because the coarser seemed not to extract enough & seemed weak). The auto setting for a cup seems to be set at about half of what most directions suggest -- about 1 tbsp or 5 grams for one cup, so I set it for double what I'm making & is ok (maybe still a little light). Used it for pour over & it worked well. Haven't made espresso, so don't know about that.",

I purchased my first Cuisinart programmable grinder in late 2013, it stopped working early in 2016. I initially was disappointed, but liked the results of the grind, so went ahead and purchased a replacement of the exact same grinder. Yesterday (January 2017) unit failed to work and I placed it in the garbage. Very disappointed. Again, great grinder while it lasts...but just not durable...keeping in mind that I only grind beans two times per day. I'll be looking for a better and more reliable replacement this time around.",

Uniform grind with little dust. Uniformity allows a finer grind for better extraction with same flavor - use less coffee. It makes the expected small deposit of grinds outside the ground coffee receiver.",

It is a bit loud but the results are an impressive cup of coffee. The grinder's features make it a good value.",
