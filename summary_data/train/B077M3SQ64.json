      "text": "Consulted the sizing chart and measured my hand. Bought size adult XS based on this info. The gloves were ginormous and baggy... not suitable for riding a motorcycle. Fortunately, I contacted the company and was able to exchange them without penalty. When I explained the situation to them, they suggested the child size large. I remeasured my hand because the youth sizing uses different measurements. I decided to order the youth medium, which fits like a glove (should). So again, the sizing charge is way off. The only problem now is that the gloves are getting covered in nubs, presumably from the velcro used to tighten the wrist.",

You will need to get another pair of gloves to use in temperatures less than 65 degrees (give or take). Good product and price.",

The small is still too large and with the slightest bit of sweat my hands slip around inside the glove. they don't seem to absorb the sweat at all. However, my biggest issue is that the primary material (the red cloth in the fingers and back of the glove) sticks to Velcro. Plenty of my other gear has Velcro (safety pads, shorts, etc.), so these gloves are sticking to my other gear and after just two rides are frayed and fuzzy from me pulling them off Velcro patches.",

They work great, have great ventilation and great protection for this class of glove (ie stadium, adventure, enduro). I would put this between stadium and adventure. If you fall on hardpack or rocks, they wont provide the protection an enduro glove will. Driving and falling on soft intermediate terrain they should work well enough, and they work great if you drive through brush etc.",

If you have any velcro on your bike and touch the hook portion with these gloves, the material sticks and \u201cfrazzles\u201d. The look nice, are comfortable (pay attention to their sizing charts) and are true to their size. All in all, I\u2019d purchase these again over the name brand gloves.

      "text": "(I received no incentive for this review) I purchased these a month ago, and really wanted to get to use them for a while before giving the world an honest opinion. The gloves are still in great shape, and the grip is extra sticky, making riding a lot safer and saving your hands from callouses at the same time. My only complaint is that they do fray pretty easily, but that's not getting in the way of functionality one bit. The gloves work great with the touchscreen on my Galaxy Note 9 - the velcro on these gloves fasten in the back, making them easy to adjust while stopped -- great purchase!

The worst part is the seams in the thumb BUSTED in the first 30 days. On both pairs! I wasn't doing anything weird. Just riding my mountain bike. And these are described as mountain bike gloves. but they could not take the simple stress of commute riding. Didn't even wear them on the trail yet. I can't stress this enough, I wasn't doing anything out of the usual with these gloves. They were strictly for commute riding. Sad, they looked cool.",

Also, the \"touchscreen\" ability is fine with the index finger, but you can't \"pinch zoom\" or otherwise manipulate with the other fingers.",
