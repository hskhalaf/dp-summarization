After struggling with the product I was able to findout the firmware update from the D-link blog, but it can be solved. But there are some main disadvantage is iI am not able to pair the Amazon fire stick and google chrome cast devices. But the cisco router can do that. I am not able to significantly fidout the HD stream engine feature of the product. Might be demonstrated well can be improved.",

Also it's design is pleasantly flat and simple, not towering with a mess of antennas sticking out. The extra features are good too, with usb, priority media streaming, and a nifty log in option.",

Connect Printers, NAS servers--even security cameras--SharePort Plus USB 2.0 lets you stream from any USB device. There's even a SharePort App for Android and iPhone OS for online gaming support like Onlive. We've included an SD card slot for uploading HD media files like video and photo and with DLNA standard, the HD Media Router can connect to any device, automatically. \n\nADVANCED HOME NETWORKING. SIMPLE SETUP\nHigh-performance entertainment devices. Wireless signals anywhere in your home. Multiple laptops. Network storage systems. iPads, iPhones-- It used to be that designing a home network capable of handling so many devices required some serious hardware and some seriously messy installation. Not with Amplifi - the HD Media Router 1000 has not only been engineered with the power to handle all of your digital demands, but with the smarts to put it at the tip of your fingers. \n\nHD Media Routers offer Wireless G backwards compatibility and Wi-PnP technology for simple wireless connections through a USB drive. IPv6 allows for intelligent self-detect and router setup and with DLNA, the HD Media Router 1000 not only connects to any Ethernet-equipped device, but virtually any device, automatically. With push-button connectivity and 128-bit security encryption standard, a secure home network is as simple as plug and play. \n\n\n\n128-BIT SECURITY ENCRYPTION\nThe HD Media Router 1000 protects your network with 128-bit AES data security encryption--the same technology used in E-commerce or online banking. Create your own network name and password or put it at the tip of your fingers with Push Button Security standard on every Amplifi device. With hassle-free plug and play installation, and advanced Wi-Fi protected setup, the HD Media Router 1000 is not only one of the fastest routers available, it's also one of the safest.\n\n\n\nGET READY FOR THE FUTURE: IPV6 EQUIPPED\nWith the growing number of Internet-enabled applications requiring IP addresses, the supply of IP addresses under the current Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) system has already been exhausted. The IPv6 protocol solves this network addressing exhaustion by creating more IP addresses, but migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is not necessarily automatic. No worries--this D-Link product is IPv6 Certified and ready for the future.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nHD Media Router 1000 (DIR-657); Ethernet cable; CD-ROM; power adapter; quick install guide\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nSee more",
