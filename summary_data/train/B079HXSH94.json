    "description": "Allergies in full bloom? Redness, itching, burning, stinging, and irritation are common symptoms of allergy eyes. We all want our eyes to feel better during allergy season, but many allergy sufferers are concerned about the chemicals found in allergy eye drops. Traditional over-the-counter allergy drops use chemicals such as antihistamines or vasoconstrictors to mask symptoms. Vasoconstrictors may actually worsen redness symptoms if used more than directed (usually 4 times a day maximum). Similasan of Switzerland works differently, by using natural botanical extracts to stimulate the body's natural defenses and target the root cause of allergy eye symptoms. Similasan products are made without harsh chemicals, so you can use them as often as needed. Can be used with contact lenses. Drops will not damage lenses but performance might be better when applied without lenses. If you have redness, itchiness or irritation, it is best to avoid lenses for a while. Trusted by pharmacists and families in Switzerland for 40 years, Similasan is a leading Swiss brand of remedies that use natural active ingredients instead of harsh chemicals to keep families healthy. Our state of the art facility located near the Swiss Alps makes over 190 popular remedies for children and adults. Claims based on traditional homeopathic practice, not accepted medical evidence. Not FDA evaluated.",
