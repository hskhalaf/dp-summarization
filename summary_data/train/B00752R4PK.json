I tested it on some of my older DVDs and they had the same problem. I unplugged the unit and replugged it in (rebooted it), and it then played my older DVD fine. But 1 hour later and it wouldn't play it again. So the reader mechanism isn't reliable. I checked for the latest firmware update and I have the latest. I don't like giving bad reviews, but this one deserved it. If it was just me, I'd say it's a one off. But I saw someone else had the same problem.",

Amazon will not give me a refund as over a month had passed, the seller is telling me to contact Amazon, and Panasonic doesn't care. Maybe it is a lemon, maybe Panasonic is junk.

PROS This player seems to have a clearer streaming picture than a PS3. Has more streaming apps than a PS3. Moving from app to app is much easier than a PS3 Player is very slim. CONS This player's navigation response time is staggeringly slow. The player will reboot out of the blue for no apparent reason. Must use the player's remote to control the player and the remote will only control certain Panasonic TVs. I will keep the player, but I wouldn't buy it again.",

Nonetheless, that's what we ended up doing. This required shelling out another $60 for a powerline adapter, to run our internet through the house wiring. That solved the problem.",

Easy set up, initiated the firmware updates immediately upon internet connection, and both have performed well. Some of the menu functions are odd (for lack of a better description), stellar video quality on every disc tried to date. Only issue is it's extreme light weight; easily slides back when operating buttons to load/eject, but solved that with some stick on silicone feet over the original pads.",

It has a small footprint, very thin, which I like. Set-up was a breeze. The network features are flawless. Connected easily. Streams movies beautifully. Loading time to play a BR disc is fast. The remote is not too cluttered with buttons. Does everything you need and is easy to use. Picture quality is perfect. Couldn't be happier. Highly recommend!!",

My wife and I tried to watch a blu-ray the other day and found that we had to update it before it would work. Once we did, though, it performed superbly.

Regular Blu-ray discs produce excellent video presentation and sound. I have connected it with an ethernet cable to a router and used it to update the firmware but little else yet.
