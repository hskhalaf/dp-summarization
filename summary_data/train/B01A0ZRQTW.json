If I were to buy another 4k monitor I would look for something that had a refresh rate of at least 75hz or more. I'd probably go more just to be safe.",

We waited till his birthday to open the boxes and by the time we did VS's 7 day return window had passed. HP tried to repair the PC but could not as VS is not compatible. Amazon won't take it back because more than 30 days have passed after repair attempts, so we are stuck with it.",

So ViewSonic has the product calibrated but doesn't notice dead pixels? I think they are hoping that the customer won't notice. Either way, this is my first and last ViewSonic purchase in over 15 years. Their quality control is atrocious. I will stick with Dell as I've never had a problem with their monitors.",

The cons are definitely overwhelming, bad and aged menu that for some is impossible to navigate, the white isn't pure on this monitor and has a noticeable portion of yellow with it, the display is dim and is a struggle to look like an ACTUAL LED screen, the text is noticeably blurry and even with sharpness at 100%, it's still blurry. I think I honestly may just return this and find a better 4k monitor. Too many problems with this one regarding color and light balance.",

      "text": "So far I love it. The colors are vibrant, and the display can get very bright - much brighter than my old Dell 24-inch it replaced. Driving it with a R9 380, I was getting 40+ fps in WoW on ultra settings (no AA needed at 4k resolution), spiking up much higher in some areas. Minimum fps in cities hovered around 40. Freesync works great if you can keep games above 40 fps. Freesync range for this monitor is 40-60 fps. I wish the lower bound for freesync was lower, so I wouldn't notice tearing below 40, but I am not sure if that is the monitor's fault or AMD's. All the more reason to upgrade my graphics card!",
