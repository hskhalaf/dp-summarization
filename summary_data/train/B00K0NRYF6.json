Out of the box a 74mb update took only less than 5 min to download and install. The one I bought came with 4gb memory,so a MicroSD is a must in case you take a lot of pix(cheap 16GB for $10 will do it) The camera too nice pix outside ,but I didn't test the can indoor (no flash built-in,I read many coplaints about the bad pix quality in doors or nights). .. I will update my review later after coming back from mediterranean trip.",

I couldn't get it to work, images would appear sent, but recipient would never receive photo/video sent in this manner. I downloaded alternate sms apps, still didn't work, finally increased the picture limit to 300ish and it sends photo/video....for now.",

This phone will not be used for games or watching videos so the slightly smaller (than my MotoX) display doesn't present any issues. I don't anticipate I will need a rear-facing camera as I have other devices for video calls. The back cover is a little flimsy, but a standard case protects and holds it in place. I like the Motorola and Google-provided apps (Motorola Assist and Google Now) for searching, scheduling, driving, sleeping. Frankly, I didn't envision that I could get a new unlocked GSM smartphone with all this functionality at this price point so I'm quite pleased.",
