      "text": "One thing I\u2019ve learned from ordering items online is to test them right after they are received. This pressure cooker leaked around the point where the handle attaches to the lid. Water dribbled out onto the stovetop as pressure built. Once I saw where the water and steam were coming from I released the steam and took the lid off. There are two phillips screws that secure the handle to the lid. I tightened both screws and retested. This time the cooker held pressure without leaking. I really didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of returning the cooker. Will provide additional feedback going forward.",

It engages the screw that secures the handle to the cover. I will be returning the product. I'm not sure where this is made and it could be that I got the one bad part. Quality control is mandatory and this delineates a lack of quality.",
