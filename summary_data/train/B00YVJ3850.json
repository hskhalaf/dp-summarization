Poor adhesives, insufficient support of the top when it is rolled up, poor seal at the tailgate, and the manufacturer DOES NOT respond to attempts to contact them. I would caution anyone to think carefully before buying one of the Bak products. They tout a long warranty but it is useless if they do not respond to customers.",

Does not feel as secure as the MX4 and lets more water in near the tailgate than the MX4. Overall I\u2019m disappointed with this cover but it does work with my Thule Tracrac SR ladder rack so I\u2019ll continue to use it.",

It went through 2 summers in N Texas and then the adhesive that holds the felt panels on the underside and the front weatherstrip let loose. The weatherstrip has curled up in the front and both panels have fallen off. I would not recommend any BAK products unless they have changed the grade of adhesive they use that will stand up to hot weather. I would imagine that any of these models that are being used anywhere in the Southern or Southwestern U.S have experience the same issue.",

I do enjoy the roll-up of the cover, the cloth on the inside is nice as the metal gets very hot. Does it get the job done? Yes...Is it worth 1,000 dollars?
