The riser (the vertical part that goes up and down) is very hard to adjust, does not at all slide smoothly. The bottom cross-bar does not stay firmly attached to the poles. One of the pair arrived with a crack in it, though it doesn't affect its functionality, just demonstrates how cheaply made these are.",
