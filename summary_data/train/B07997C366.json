Having the auto document feeder and the ability to print duplex are convenience items that were well worth spending a few extra bucks over some of the more basic models. Setup was very simple.

If you do more graphic, photo printing you may want to purchase the higher HP series 7000-9000 Office jet series which will give you a better resolution and print quality including more features. But expect to spend at least double the price for such print quality, but it would be worth it to you for better graphic and photo quality for the money.",
