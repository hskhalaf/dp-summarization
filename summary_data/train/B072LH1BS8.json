Applied two coats, (except yellow required 3 coats), and then topped with non-wipe clear gel top coat. Solid two weeks of no chipping or lifting. If it wasn't for nail growth, I would have kept them on longer. Colors are vibrant and beautiful. I also applied them on to 3 of my friends' nails, with the same result. Would definitely buy again. I attached 2 pictures of the polish. One is with stamping over it, and the other is the use of the yellow polish with nail art on it.",
