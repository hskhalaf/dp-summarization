      "text": "Picked this up about 3 months ago for a 4.5GHz overclocked Intel i5-2500K processor. I frequently have all 4 cores maxed out when gaming, temps are always kept below 50C. One note, the stock fans are effective however quite loud at maximum speed, I ended up swapping them out for a set of PWM magnetic levitation bearing fans,now I have the same cooling performance in a much quieter package. RGB function is a great novelty, I also have an EVGA graphics card, and the software syncs the LEDs together which is a great added touch. I'll certainly be using this for my i7-8700K build in the future.",

When in pull, the fans \"fight\" for air causing them to fall off balance and make a grinding noise. I believe this is a flaw from the design of the fan shroud/case. It has curved dips along each 4 edges which causes air to be pulled to both fans. A normal \"box\" would eliminate this issue. 4790k @4.6ghz 1.25v does not go past (peaks) at 64C and usually idles at 55C with pump set to 100% and fans set to 40%.",

      "text": "I got this to use as an exhaust fan paired with the nzxt kraken g12 to cool my gpu. It does fit, but as other reviews have stated you just have to loosen the 4 screws before twisting it into the bracket and then you can tighten the screws again. My gpu runs about ~20c cooler now. Make sure the tubes are facing the right way before twisting it in! I do wish that it had nicer sleeving for the tubes similar to the corsair h100i braided tubes. This one is just rubbery material.",
