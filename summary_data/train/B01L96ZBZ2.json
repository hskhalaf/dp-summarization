Battery life isn't great, you can actually see the percentage points dropping down, but not too worried as my car charges it when Android Auto is on so it's always fully charged when I get to work/home. Latest software, easy to use, some bloat but apps easily disabled. Sony support in my experience has been top notch for warranty repairs.",

(Fantastic feature) Great device, hope it will serve her long and well.",
