The size in the description is correct (and I love it!).This planner helps me stay focused and motivated. I love how it's undated so I can make the most out of it since I may not need all the months of the year. I love the set up and the end of month, week, and day review. It helps me to be mindful of daily activities and how invest my time. Overall I think this planner is a great investment if you want to get your life in tract. :)",

I love that the planner allows me to plan my month, my week and every single day. Focusing on what I'm grateful for and taking a few moments at the end of the day to evaluate my day are bonuses. Since using it I'm much more organized, productive and have an overall greater sense of accomplishment. Introducing it to our eldest college aged daughter and to my hubby. Grateful for a tool that helps me stay on track personally and professionally.",

I love that there is a space of affirmations, goals, a focus, everything! How did I live without it. Maybe, just maybe, this will be the year I get it together.",

My ONLY complaint is the paper is thin and thus I get some bleed through and feathering. Especially when using fountain pens (which I use almost exclusively). I understand heavier paper would make it overall weigh more (and it's a hefty thing) but the paper quality is close to being a make it or break it quality for me.",

My only real complaint is that there are 12 monthly pages, 26 weeks and roughly 1/2 a year for daily...either make the entire planner 1 year or 6 months, not some weird spawn of both. To me, for a planner to be disjointed is kind of a negative. However, I do like the Panda Planner...I just wish they would figure that out.",

Otherwise I love the heavy pages and the look and feel of the physical book as well as how the planner is set up.",
