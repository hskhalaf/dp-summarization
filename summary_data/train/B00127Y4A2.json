      "text": "I got this in 2009 for just over $100 and it's been a bumpy ride. I was initially delighted with the versatile settings, the zoom and the quality of the pictures. Then the camera decided to go nuts - wouldn't turn on, wouldn't turn off - it became unusable. I put it aside for a year. On a whim, I tried it again, and it behaved itself - same memory, same battery, same charger. It still works, but now the flash bulb has stuck in the \"down\" position, and I can't get it to pop up. In short, when it works, this camera is fine. It's just rather inconsistent. It's still better than my phone. (I have a rubbish phone!)",

At longer zooms, there is a lot of chromatic aberration - objects have a purple fringe and the overall shade of whites tends to purple too at those zooms. Also, while the camera will accept normal AA cells, unless you use Lithium or better Lithium Ion rechargeable cells, you will be very unhappy with battery life.",
