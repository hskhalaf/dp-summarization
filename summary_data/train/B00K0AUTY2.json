It sat in the pouring rain for an hour and a half at Disneyland last week and all of our stuff, including our kids, stayed dry. It has also walked across the Golden Gate Bridge with wind and rain successfully. This rain cover also fits our jogging stroller extremely well (it's a mountain buggy double jogger). It won't fit every stroller, obviously, but if you have a b agile double, it's definitely great to have!",

I am not a fan of the all plastic rain covers that Zoe sells because they are difficult to fold up once wet; this cover was easy to fold up and kept my kids dry! Their feet did dangle out, but we had them tuck their feet in (or took their shoes off because it was 100 degrees and the rain felt nice).",

While it still doesn't cover the area where their feet would be exposed, my little ones will be a lot more covered than they were with Jeep rain cover I purchased from here last year. As other reviewers noted, the cover sent is not the same as the one pictured, but a gray material with a transparent window for the kids to see out of with ventilation holes on the sides. There is also velcro located on either side so that you may have easy access to your children.",

We took it to disney a month ago and it was easy to take on and off the bus and my 7 and 1/2 year old even say in it when he got tired. Great buy!",

Plus I feel it wasn't breathable and my kids got hot and stuffy inside, even with air holes. I feel this one will breath much better and keep my kids comfortable. Bonus is that this folds very easily without fighting with all the plastic. I'll update as soon as I'm able to test it out in the rain.",
