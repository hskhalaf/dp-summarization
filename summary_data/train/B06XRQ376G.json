This carafe makes it so easy to make cold brew, the directions are very clear and so simple to clean after each use. The overall product is very well made, the glass is strong and the handle is very useful. The filter is beautifully made and definitely high quality. I really like how I can actually remove the filter and continue using the lid all by itself, just need to transfer the silicone ring to the lid so it fits properly into the carafe opening. Five stars for its functionality, design, quality and price!!",

Even if you have the seal on it like other reviews says it does not stay airtight. Overall, disappointed in this purchase",
