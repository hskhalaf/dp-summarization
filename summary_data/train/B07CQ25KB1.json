We researched all of the different ones and picked this one because of the reviews. The mattress arrived in two days and was shockingly thin (we did know it had to expand). Within 4 hours, it was full size but we waiting the recommended 24 before putting it on the bed. It is so comfortable and we sleep so much better. We just purchased an RV and will be buying a queen size since I never want to sleep on anything else.",

Do not worry the odor. There is no wild odor with the new mattress. I really enjoyed my night. It is just the perfect medium soft and hard feeling!I had my old mattress costing $1000 at a famous brand mattress store. This new one is even better with less than half cost!I love the memory form topping!The hybrid is really nice choice. I had nice sleeping with my little son. Never expect a online shopping for mattress could be that valuable!Totally worth to buy!",

The mattress is medium hard and forms to my body nicely when lying down, it gives me just the right amount of support. I\u2019ve been using this mattress for about two weeks now and I\u2019ve noticed that my back pain has already gone away for the most part. Many mattresses I\u2019ve purchased have had an odd smell upon opening that lingers but I didn\u2019t have such an issue with this mattress. This was simply a great purchase.",

No sturdy foam around the edges to keep the sides from easily collapsing when you sit on the edge of the bed. This will cause an issue in the future when the mattress gets older and more worn in and the sides start to bulge out or become weak. But for the price I am very happy with the comfort level it provides!",
