The base is so thin that nothing can be kept on it except maybe some bar towels. We had the entire assembly buckle under moving it across a dining room. The front two wheels caught in a concrete seam in the room and it buckled under legs and all. However the bin stayed intact and did not even damage the interior lining.",
