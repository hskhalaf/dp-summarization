Wyze does not do well on glass in darkness and our area is pitch black because neighborhood association does not allow street lights or all-night lights. All the lighting is our home comes from Phillips Hue, which we love and trust so I thought I would buy an extra bulb and put it on porch. No, it is not an outside bulb but we have a well covered porch and an enclosed porch light. I figured the motion detector would trigger the light and then the Wyze. Works perfectly. Now, when a bear comes around we know it!",

Only gripe, wish I could trigger other non Hue devices to receive an audiable tone on phone or in home when motion is detected. May order a second unit for perimeter of house.",

I like the ability to configure the behavior separately for day/night times, how long it stays on after motion is detected, sensitivity, etc... and have it trigger a configurable group of lights. Only complaint would be the price/value, seems steep for a motion sensor. Also the app allows you to configure day/night times manually and the sensor also senses daylight so its not immediately clear why you need to set both, should be one or the other.",
