They clearly love all the different food types (except the wheat grains, which they ignore), and the hard pellets are great for them to gnaw on to keep their teeth worn down (very important for rodents). And their fur started to grow back! This is clearly good food for rats (and probably other small rodents) and I highly recommend it.",
