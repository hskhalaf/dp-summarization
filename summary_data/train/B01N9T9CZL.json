Considering the amount of chinese manufacturers trying to turn a quick buck by cutting corners in every other product category, I was wary of getting some glorified sunglasses by accident. It's one thing to buy some shoddy pajama pants for $5, but quite another to get shoddy eye protection. If you decide on these glasses, make sure that the seller is GSM Sales; if they start selling too well, chances are good some bad knock-offs will start popping up and undercutting the legit version.

I'm super irritated because now it's too late to order replacements through Amazon, everywhere locally is sold out, and I'm past the refund window for these. Should've inspected them more closely when they arrived, shame on me I guess. Totally sucks that our eclipse experience is likely ruined!!!!!!!",
