Others of similar design get so hot they will burn the ground or right through a plastic table.

Most of the popular windscreens are not tall enough, so look for a 9 inch+ model. I went withwhich comes with a nice carrying case.",

This stove allows you to use wood or solid alcohol fuel. It has two burning phases. First, it burns the fuel you add (wood or alcohol), then there is secondary burn that burns the smoke because of the air holes on the top inside of the stove. My only complaint is you have to remove your pot to add more fuel. I have not had a chance to try it with the solid alcohol fuel.",

      "text": "Perfect backpacking and camping stove! It is very light weight and as long as you have plenty of fuel near by it can get the job done. Boils water quickly and cooks food with vigor. It is very compact and packs well with my other gear. My only concern is due to the light weight the material can give a little or dent if it becomes lose in the pack or accidentally knocked over. Overall great product and highly recommend it for backpacking or survival kit.",

I had plenty of deal to work with so fuel was no problem. It fired up easily and easily headed up my 2-cup pot of water. The wood will burn down quickly so you do need to tend to it but that isn't an issue for me. Others complain that there isn't a big slot for putting more sticks in; I didn't have any issue just lifting my pot off for a few seconds to refuel. Overall I'm happy with the performance for the price.",

A small wind screen might be helpful getting it going but it makes a hot smoke free fire when it's going. Comes in a nice mesh pouch. Seems like it should last.

      "text": "Got this after watching Joe Robinet's videos on youtube. He boils water in one similar to this (though his is about nine times as expensive) and thought I needed to get one. Packaging is great, the instructions are super easy to follow, and it comes with a slightly padded mesh carrying case that makes it all pack together nicely. I love this stove and can't wait to cook on it.",

Little heavy for backpacking, more for car camping but the versatility for fuels you can use is a plus. I deducted stars because I don't like being mislead in a description of the product.",

It is important to use enough tinder and/or long stem matches or lighter to light your \"nest\" of twigs as it can otherwise be a little tricky to start. It is fairly easy to feed the fire without removing a pot, though that may be more difficult if cooking in a pot or pan much wider than the top of the stove. After a few uses I may give up on cannister stoves altogether and just carry some fuel tablets as a backup for very rainy conditions or trips above the tree line.",

Obviously you can't simmer over it like an isobutane stove but that's not it's intended use.",
