Love the fact it can run forever on a single battery, too. Easy to use, from 'turn on and go' to using the discrimination and notching, it also has the pinpoint feature. Very lightweight, can use it all day and not get tired. Best detector I've ever had!",

Its easy to tell if you want to dig with the pin point function. I'm super happy with this. I've owned the BH discovery before and figured that this would be a good upgrade. It super sensitive and the pinpoint function is priceless. Locate, pinpoint, dig, and hand pin point. its that easy.

Fast recovery rate, out performing my Fisher F2 and much faster than the Ace 250. Pinpointing is right on, and with the 10\" elliptical coil it's a great deal. I bought the Land Ranger Pro as well, for it's many abilities plus ground balance. The new Pros are very light to swing, but still sturdy. I can just switch out rods with coils between the two now. First Texas did a great job on providing excellent bang for the buck with this line.",

It works great we found some old coins and we are letting them soak to see what they may be. I think one may be silver. In any event we are liking this metal detector. Recommend this one but it is pricy.",
