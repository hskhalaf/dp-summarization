They cost a bit more than some ,less than others and the quality is always there. I also like to use Penn rods matched with the size reel I have . Matched they are an unbeatable combo. The Newer Reels for the super line are a nice touch. Peen just keeps getting better, Right-On PEEN. Take care of them and they will last a life time. Thanks, Tom",

I fish hard and often and fresh water rinse after each use then I spray silicone or reel magic to remove water then wipe clean. if you buy nice stuff take care of it. my buddy has penns 30 years old still work perfect! hope this helps.",
