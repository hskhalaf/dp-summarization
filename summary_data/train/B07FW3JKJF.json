I purchased this in hopes that it will deter them from ruining any more of my furniture! My cats avoided it at first but once I sprayed some catnip on it, they went crazy. Now they only scratch this mat and they leave my other surfaces alone! SO happy to see that I have relatively undamaged furniture now.",

It is different from other cat scratchers and can cover the side of my sofa very well. After a few days of purchase, none of my three cats started scratching the couch, preferring the new scratchpad. And its quality is very good. I am satisfied with it.",
