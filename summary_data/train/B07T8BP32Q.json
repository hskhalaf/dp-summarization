Ordered this one because it's rechargeable, and with the pandemic going on, batteries could become scarce--and an electric swizzle stick is something I'm not sure I'm prepared to face the apocalypse without! But this one should come with a warning--it came at least partially charged, so I tried it out mixing an EMERGEN-C (tangerine + Orange juice) drink. My fault for using a small glass because the horsepower on this thing is unreal! Juice and powder were nearly ATOMIZED and dispersed in a large swath about the kitchen. Be warned...this thing has some kick to it and WILL send liquid ballistic! I dig it.",

As of 11/30, it is completely dead. In the short month that we owned it, we have had to replace the batteries 3 times!!! That's using it MAYBE one to two times a day!!! I also was not able to get extremely frothy milk, like the other users did. I'm assuming we must have gotten a dud for it to eat name brand batteries that fast and then to just die.

The other issue: it creates big bubbles and very dense foams that is hard to pour. I find I can have better more useable result from my French Press. Another design problem: the tiny power switch is place in a odd place and hard to operation. Still debating whether I should keep it. So far, not meeting expectations.",

More amazing is the fact that when I rated this one and said I hoped it lasts longer than my battery powered one I bought last year, they offered to REPLACE it. For FREE. You cannot beat customer service like this. HIGHLY recommend this seller.",
