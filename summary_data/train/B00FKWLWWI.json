We had a party last weekend and made 20 pizzas in no time. It took longer for people to figure out what kind of pizza they wanted then to cook them. I would say 5 to 7 min each. Best pizza no doubt. We are having another one this weekend but only 7 or 8 pizzas. If you're going to have a party make dough balls ahead and keep them in refrigerator. Have all the toppings ready. Roll out the dough and go for it.",

I think the key is that this unit gets much hotter that our stove or our outdoor bbq. Only downside with the unit that we have seen is that the crumbs fall through onto our deck (lots of crumbs due to using corn meal to make pizza slide easily). I fear that I will be seeing a lot of pizza for the next couple of months as my wife tries to master different types of pizza - oh well.",

If your home oven has a proof option for dough, I highly recommend using it, it has taken the dough to a new level. We don\u2019t make our pizza dough, we buy it at Whole Foods and bring it home and proof it before cooking. I also suggest having at least 2-4 pizza peels so you can keep the pizzas coming without too much time in between. Fresh mozzarella, although delicious, can make a watery pizza, better to use a drier mozzarella. The oven is really great and in 5-6 minutes your pizza is ready.",

Could have been very seriously burned! My husband who does not cook ended up making a pizza while I iced my face. It turned out great.",
