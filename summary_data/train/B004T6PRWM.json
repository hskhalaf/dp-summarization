Just get some Bar Keeper's Friend or some other such stainless cleaner, learn the cooking techniques, and you are set for a lifetime of cooking pleasure.

This pan is everything that America's Test Kitchen has reported for All-Clad tri-ply. It distributes the heat evenly up the side instead of just on the bottom, and although it isn't non-stick, clean up is easy. I just heat some water in it for a couple of minutes, and most residue slides right out of the pan.",

If you do serious browning in them, you might need a little soak and scrubbing, but they clean up nicely.",
