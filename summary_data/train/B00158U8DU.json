I put my nut milk bag through the wash (don't do this) and ruined it. Recently I wanted to try making oat milk because it seemed a lot easier. However, many people will tell you not to use a nut milk bag because it won't strain the milk well enough. Well, again...wanting to keep everything easy I decided to use one anyhow. Bought this and so far, so good! I don't know what those people we talking about because I don't have chunks of anything in my oat milk and I'm completely happy with the results.",

I love it and am able to have my milk any time with just 15 min prep time. Will only use this bag, it's the best out there.

      "text": "I've recently adopted a clean diet which includes making shakes from almond nut milk. For the first month I used a cheese cloth to strain the nuts from the liquid. I was about to give up as it was time consuming and messy for me. This Nut Milk Bag has made the process so easy, clean and efficient. Not only did it keep the nuts separated very well, I ended up with more milk than I had with the cheese cloth method. I had no idea the cheese cloth I was using absorbed the liquid as much as it did. I LOVE this product!",
