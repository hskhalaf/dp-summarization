I do not like it near as much. It is hard like all typical gluten free breads. The original was so much better. Now I have to find a new bread which is going to be difficult. I hope they go back to the original.",

Then after returning home I found it at Amazon & ordered it. Unfortunately almost every slice of the 5 loaves I ordered was broken into pieces from the shipping & handling. I love it so much I will eat it anyway, but it will be awkward to make a sandwich with it. I will make gluten free croutons with it and I can use it as a filler when making gluten free meatloaf. If it hadn\u2019t fallen apart from shipping I would have given it 5 stars.",

This is a different story. I've had at least one sandwich a day since I discovered it. The taste and texture are both excellent. No grit, no sponginess, no sliminess. Just bread. This product has made lunch a pleasure again!",

I've yet to toast it as its yummy as it is. Even my gluten loving and eating hubby will happily eat this bread which tells me its good bread, not just good for being gluten free.",
