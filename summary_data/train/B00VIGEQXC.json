It adjusts from 55 to 154lbs, which is great. However, as you increase the tension the handles actually get further and further apart. For an individual with larger hands, this won't be an issue, but it causes problems for me. Even though I can comfortably close the handles at higher settings, I can't get a full grip on the handle and have to re-adjust mid close. It's not a deal breaker, but it's definitely worth mentioning.",

Also, the competing unit has a distinct click when one has reached the limit of compression. Overall, for those, already with really good grip strength is is not a bad product but way overpriced.",

Does this mean that the actual strength is 11 lbs over the indicated markings? Still, it's a good product, just choose a level that will allow you to get a good work out.",

The back side of the grip is curved away from your palm which makes for a very uncomfortable grip when doing higher weight. I end up getting very sore (not in a working out my muscles sort of way) and end up only using it for shorter workouts. It would be better if the grip was straight, or even better if it curved back toward the palm to match the natural curve of a hand.",

You can really set it to be the perfect difficulty for whatever rep range you are training. Personally I think the surface of the handles is a little too slick, and I prefer the aggressive texture on the CoC grippers. Plus, there is a bit of flex in the handles (just a little) at heavier settings. Honestly for what I was looking for, it would be 5 stars if it were more aggressively stippled on both the backstrap as well as in the finger grooves.",

I own ones that stretch the spring and I always had a fear in my mind that the spring would snap and possibly hurt me. I didn't rate it 5 starts because it gets slippery when you sweat and it begins to slip. In the next development, I would like to see a grip worked into the plastic handles.

    "description": "ONE GRIP STRENGTHENER TO RULE THEM ALL\n\nIntroducing the most versatile, durable and effective grip and hand strengthener ever created.\n\nSILENT - Our solid steel compression spring is designed to be completely silent when compressed. You'll never have to worry about the squeaky sound that plagues other grippers. You could train with your Death Grip next to a sleeping baby, and they would never even know you were there.\n\nVERSATILE - With a resistance range of 55-154 lbs (25-70 kg), the Death Grip gripper can offer a level of resistance that can challenge both beginners and veterans alike. Regardless of your current grip strength, you will find levels of resistance that will allow you to see dramatic improvement while challenging you every step of the way.\n\nQUALITY - Crafted 100% from Thermoplastic Nylon and Steel, you can feel the quality the instant you pick up the Death Grip grip strengthener. There is no squeaky spring, no side to side wobble and the resistance only adjusts when you want it to. If you're looking for a gripper that you can use and then hand down to the next generation, this is it.\n\nSAFE - By using a compression spring design, we've eliminated the danger posed by adjustable grippers that create resistance by stretching a metal spring. Stretching a spring places a tremendous amount of tension on the spring and the anchors holding it in place. When that much force & potential energy is placed on weak metal & plastic components, they will eventually fail, sending dangerous debris flying through the air.\n\n100% Money Back Guarantee - We are confident that you will LOVE your MummyFit Death Grip gripper. However, if you buy our grip strengthener & don't like it for any reason, we'll refund 100% of your money. It's that simple.\n\nBe sure you get the very best and click the add to cart button right now!",

      "SILENT! The ultimate workout machine for men and women on the go. Do your exercises anytime and anywhere because the Death Grip's completely silent operation allows you to strengthen your hand grip and exercise your forearms and wrist without detection. Since your Death Grip gripper is light enough to bring anywhere and doesn't make annoying squeaking noises that most grippers make, you can use your exerciser at work, on a plane or even in a library without bothering those around you.",
      "INDESTRUCTIBLE! Crafted entirely from thermoplastic nylon and steel, this grip strengthener is built like a tank. Even the adjustment wheel is solid steel. You can strengthen your hands every day for years to come and still be able to pass your Death Grip down to the next generation. You simply won't find a higher quality adjustable gripper anywhere. We're so confident in the quality of our equipment that we offer a LIFETIME WARRANTY that covers any problems resulting from normal, proper use.",
      "ADJUSTABLE! When you lift weights, do you use the same amount of weight every day, or do you adjust the weight up or down based on your workout needs? Why should using a grip strengthener be any different? With the Death Grip adjustable gripper, you can start at the level of resistance that's right for you and increase the resistance as your grip strength improves. Don't limit your progress by using the same level of resistance day in and day out. Welcome to the future of grippers.",
      "SAFE! Focus on strengthening your grips without worrying about accidents. The resistance of the Death Grip is generated by COMPRESSING a solid steel spring. Other adjustable grippers create resistance by STRETCHING the spring, which can be dangerous. Stretching a spring places extreme tension on the components holding the spring in place. These components often fail, resulting in dangerous flying debris and metal shrapnel. By compressing the spring, we've eliminated this risk altogether.",
      "BIG SAVINGS! In order to match the 55-154 lbs range of resistance offered by the Death Grip, you would need to purchase SIX of the leading metal coil grippers. Why buy SIX expensive grippers when you can have the same levels of resistance all in ONE grip strengthener? Better yet, you'll save 75% and end up with a higher-quality tool that is more convenient and more comfortable to use. This is one of those rare moments when you can spend WAY less and get SO much more in return."
