It also has a poorly designed lens sleeve in that even after tightening the sleeve onto the lens it comes loose constantly and became useless. Sad too since I was attempting shooting a heavy waterfall at Yosemite National Park.",

I typically pair my Nikon Z6 with FTZ mount and 200-500 mm telephoto lens and this rain cover handles both easily and comfortably. It is especially useful when on a small boat in the ocean, where ocean spray can occur and would normally be damaging to the camera and optics. The transparent back makes it easy to use the viewfinder or rear display while keeping the camera dry.the two side openings are easy to put your hands inside and you can set up a camera strap to run through these openings. A great way to keep your camera dry on rainy or drizzly days.",

Thankfully I have the controls memorized so this is not huge, but till it would be much better if you could see better from it.

      "text": "Anti-slip lens grip and Velcro tightening mechanism make attaching to and keeping the cover in place a snap. Easy access side sleeves make camera operation easy and convenient. Large viewing window allows for making camera adjustments quickly and easily. Slight trade-off for full cover protection - no cutout for view finder. This makes for superior protection from the elements - but can make viewing and focusing on your subject a bit of a challenge. Heavy weight nylon also provides excellent protection - but is bulkier and requires more space than lighter weight and more compact covers. Overall, a solid cover for the travel and outdoor photographer for whom space is not the primary consideration.",

The see through plastic is of poor quality and has degenerated to opaque and cracked and separated along the stitch lines. It was cleaned after use every time I used it. The sealing system around the lens hood is problematical, I never could get a good seal with a zoom lens. For the price it is almost a one off use system, almost a disposable item. The concept is good but the execution of the design has major flaws in material (the clear plastic) and the lens sealing system (I did look at all the YouTube videos for suggestions)",

This one came and they seemed to have made some improvements which is great. The first one I had worked good, this one works great. The bit that adjusts around the lens cover works much better on this version.",

It's cool but it could be slightly bigger for me to reach in to focus my lens. A cool add on would be a small plastic piece that could attach by velcro somehow over the top part of the lens. Other than that I have not field tested yet in bad weather but as soon as I do I'll add to this post. So far I can comment on how it doesn't seem like a piece of cheap plastic. It seems well made and I can't wait to test it out.",

The clear portion is not large enough to see the dials on top of the camera without moving the camera around inside the bag. I did have better luck when I used a longer lens, with the bag fitting better, but still had problem with the view of the top of the camera. I'll keep it just in case I see a storm coming and can't get to my backpak.",

I used this rain cover in a steady down pour at a high school football game and my camera stayed dry. I recommend it if you don't mind removing the battery pack from your camera.

A lens hood would help protect the camera lens from wind driven rains. For long exposure to rain, may want to apply Scotch Guard to the exterior of the black vinyl area.",
