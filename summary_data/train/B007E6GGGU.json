Good, sturdy wheels also that have survived multiple international trips so far. The only downside: the top front compartment (designed for an mp3 player, etc) is less usefull with the zipper openning downwards than if the compartment was upside-down. It makes it difficult to store other items (like change, keys, etc) as they can easily drop off if you're not careful. But otherwise a great buy well worth it's price and an item I use now constantly when I travel.",

My complaint would be that the largest zipped area could unzip farther down the sides to be able to access that largest pocket better.",

I actually was impressed with the overall design of the bag. It goes from a \"backpack\" to a small piece of luggage with wheels & tow handle. A zipper stores & conceals the arm straps & exposes a kick pad. So your able to tow it through airports.
