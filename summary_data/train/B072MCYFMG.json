Still easy to remove if you've been sweating, but adheres through the activity, at least for tennis and pickleball. Best we've found recently. Needed something for taping a foot for plantar fasciitis issue, and for a sore wrist. Costs more, $3.33 per 10 ft. roll, but it works. Other tapes came loose with sweat. Update. Just received our third order of this tape, after trying yet another brand. This is still the best.",

It might work for taping ankles or for hands in combat sports but the adhesive was not sweat resistant enough to stay on for long climbing sessions. After an hour or so, I could pull the entire wrap off my fingers. Contrast this to Metolius tape that was so stuck on that after climbing for 4 hour sessions I dreaded having to peel it off my fingers. It was half the cost but it really does not suit that purpose.",

I didn\u2019t know how large the roll was until I actually bought it but this tape tears perfect, it stays on for my gym session and jiujitsu session and it\u2019s really easy to take off. I paid 11$ for 3 rolls and it\u2019s definitely worth it. I\u2019m gonna stick with this brand. Thanks!!",

Up from elbow to shoulder & elbow to wrist. Terribly painful. I iced & then wrapped (Ace bandage) it, but the wrap I had didn\u2019t stick well & it was not tight enough to support. Instead of going to the drug store, I decided to wrap this tape over top of the wrap & voila ! Much better support & it stuck ! I love how flexible it is & strong. It\u2019s also very versatile. I\u2019ll be buying more of this stuff ... great value for the price.",

      "text": "I use athletic tape to support my finger tendons while rock climbing. I usually buy tape from the gym, but they're all closed. I thought athletic tape was simple, but my tape slipped right off my fingers during a climb. Tape also smells like cheap arts and crafts glue, which I never noticed in my other athletic tape. Good deal overall though, ten bucks for three rolls. Maybe the tape holds up in colder weather, I'll find out as i'd imagine ill have these rolls of tape for the next year at least. But i wont be buying more of this brand in the future",
