A bit of the paint on one of them got scratched, but besides that they are good quality.",

I was concerned that the paint would end up in his mouth or that he would get splinters (he's pretty tough on toys) so I looked for a child-friendly solution at a reasonable price. These adorable little penguins were just the thing: he loves the big eyes, and there are enough of them to keep him busy trying to put the individual birds together and then nest them. I don't expect them to last forever, but for now they are perfectly sturdy and enjoyable for his fat little hands and offer plenty of opportunity to build manual dexerity and fine motor skills.",

My mom has a set of nesting eggs that my grandson likes, so I thought the nesting penguins would be worth a try. My grandson loved them and played with them A LOT! I also bought a nuts and bolts play set, and they were hardly touched. The smallest nesting penguin could be a choking hazard. The package clearly states it is for ages 3+. So we just took the smallest penguin out. The penguins are easy for small hands to take apart and put back together. I highly recommend!",

They are easier to pull apart than some of the wooden ones that can swell and get stuck together (and become difficult for a child to open). The child I bought them for loves them. When she plays with these, she is clearly thinking about and learning how to fit smaller sizes into larger sizes. It is simple but seems quite educational for her. The smallest penguin would probably be a choking hazard for a toddler, so I would recommend removing that one before giving it to a very young kid.",

Her little hands were flying, taking them all apart then trying to piece them back together again - it reminded me of the kids who have those Speed Stacks competitions.
