It's a bit bulky for someone hiking and sticking this in your pack though. But luckily I have a 70 liter pack that it fits in a little snug. Would of loved to of gotten it into the sleeping bag compartment, but that just wasn't going to happen. I know a lot of people would pass this up for something lighter and smaller, but to me this is my luxury item that I must have.",

The other zipper goes from about 1.5 feet from the bottom where the other zipper ends, and then extends to the top. Why this bag has this is beyond me. You can not open the bag up like a blanket. I guess some people like this zipper configuration? I would love this bag if it had 1 normal zipper....",
