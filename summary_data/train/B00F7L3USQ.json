      "text": "I really like this Farmhouse Fresh scrub. I like to exfoliate in the shower. Duh! But the oil based scrubs leave a oil slick that could be hazardous to your health. Sugar and salt dissolve when water inadvertently gets into the jar. This does neither. It has a gel like texture making it easy to spread, isn't bothered by a little water in the jar and has a heavenly smell. It's a little pricey but the proceeds help to rescue abused and neglected animals, like Otis the goat and Salt and Pepper and Arlo the donkeys and many others.",

      "text": "I typically love FarmHouse Fresh products. They have such yummy scents! But this I don't care much for. It definitely smells like coffee and caramel but don't confuse this scent with say a Starbuck's Caramel Frappuccino. It's not. I think of this more as a strong cup of Chevron gas station coffee that's been heating on the burner for hours with too many pumps of caramel creamer. Now the exfoliant, I love-which is probably the main factor in choosing this scrub. It doesn't dissolve in the shower like sea salt or sugar scrubs. But you do need to rinse well. I will purchase more FarmHouse Fresh scrubs in the future but probably stick to the Sweet Tea or Pineapple/Coconut scents.",

It also does a very nice job of exfoliating and hydrating at the same time. It's a bit creamery than other Farm Fresh polishes I've tried, but my favorite overall.",
