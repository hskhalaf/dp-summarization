      "text": "Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Canine Satiety Support Small Dog Dry Dog Food has been wonderful for our miniature poodle. Flash is very allergic to so many foods and has a lot of gastrointestinal issues, it has really helped in that aspect. Royal Canin has also helped us with Flashs weight issue, as he was about 3 lbs overweight, because it satisfies his hunger and yet doesn't cause him to gain weight. He also seems to have more energy, I don't know if it's because of the food or the loss of weight but either way it's because of the Royal Canin so we are very happy with it.",

My Yorkie has bad knee joints so getting her weight under control was so important.",
