It\u2019s the outer belt which puts this brace above any similar device I\u2019ve seen. The instructions explain things perfectly. Somebody got clever here and I\u2019m benefiting.

The Stays in the Wal-Mart belt are to thin and allow the belt to roll up. This belt from Amazon was a 100 times better and didn't roll up. Also the belt fits better. I ordered the same size from both retailers. If you sit for long times this is a good back support belt. Stopped the back pain in a little while.",
