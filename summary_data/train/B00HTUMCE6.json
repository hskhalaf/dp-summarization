It was super easy to assemble, it is a lovely size, maybe just slightly low, but it does not look odd. The finishes are really high-end looking and the glass trays are really heavy and sturdy looking. I originally wanted a gold cart, but found this one in my price range. Very pleased with this purchase!",

They had this thing in a box inside of a bigger box with all types of packing materials. Once it arrived, I simply followed the instructions and had it together in about 15 minutes. It actually holds more than I thought it would. What really sets it off is the chrome with the black finish on the glass. It makes your glass bottles and wine glasses pop. It is movable but I'm not sure how much you'd want to use that feature.",

It seems fine if the cart if lifted, and one spins the wheel, however when the cart is pushed, the wheel sometimes seems to stick and does not work in union with the other wheels. The braking mechanism is not on, so I am not sure what the problem is. Probably it was a defect in that one wheel.",
