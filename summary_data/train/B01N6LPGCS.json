I am a senior woman of medium strength and build and had to put a little effort into the project and stretch out over several days but it was so well worth it. Edging came out beautifully and I am getting lots of positive comments about it! Item is fairly easy to use and sturdy. The reason I say it cost me a lot of work is because I keep finding new places to use it. Great product and well worth the money.",
