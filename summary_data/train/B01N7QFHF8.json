It\u2019s closest competitor is the much cheaper black magic cinema pocket camera, also a fantastic bit of kit, but this feels so rugged and stable in your hand. The build quality is amazing, but the end result is even better I\u2019ve used the predecessor GH4 for national news reports. This is a welcome step up",

I am trained on all kinds of professional cameras, so can't speak for myself, but I have given instructional workshops for the gh5 and find that peole catch on quite quickly. It's easy and intuitive to handle and takes beautiful pictures and footage but does have a very specific look which won't work for all styles/genres and needs to be learned how to use. Never let's me down though.",

After a year of commercial use, Very satisfied",
