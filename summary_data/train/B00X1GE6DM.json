These are perfect supplement for when you're on the road with your cat (yes, I have adventure cats who travel by car, plane, bicycle or motorcycle) so I need something to tide them over during our day-trips in between their fresh raw meals which are extremely challenging to transport. I always look for 100% raw treats for my cats so that I have a variety for them to consume and Sojos is one of the few my cats really enjoy; this coming from super fussy eaters!",

He is on a whole prey diet so it's very hard to find great treats with quality ingredients, with actually, 100% meat. Another thing to know is they are not all the same sizes. This doesn't bother me at all still in smaller pieces no larger than ~ 1 inch. Love!!",
