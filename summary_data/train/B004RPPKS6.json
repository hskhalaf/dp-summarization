      "text": "Overall this is an OK mouse. However for frantic clicking (such as that used in gaming) or extended click and drag operations using the left button, there is a problem. With the wrong direction of pressure on the left mouse button the right mouse button will engage. Once again, this is usually only during games like Diablo 3, but I have had it happen when doing click and drag operations in applications such as Microsoft Word.",

It is light with a great fit and feel. This is another mouse that Microsoft got right. The left and right clicks are very comfortable and have a nice soft sound to them. Highly recommend for a general office use mouse, works well and feels good in the hand.",

To my surprise, as soon as I plugged it in I got a prompt to download the drivers. A quick configure and the scroll wheel is not a \"double click\" button. I like that.",

      "text": "Buttons not very defined - easy to click both at once due (poor cover design). Slippery material - can't grip very well. Oversized as well - the sides are too wide/rounded. For a 'comfort' mouse, it isn't very comfortable. The biggest complaint I have is that the mouse wheel is garbage. It isn't very responsive, and on upward wheel movement, it misses or actually registers as downward movement. After 2 years of regular (non-gaming) use, it still works - but the mouse wheel issues prompted me to buy another brand. This mouse is twice the price of ones that actually work much better.",

The blue-trac laser almost seems too sensitive; little hairs on my mouse pad throw it off and the mouse cursor twitches accordingly. This may be because it is almost too light. Good for surfing the web, lightweight and comfortable. But not for much else requiring higher precision.",
