He tore one nipple up pretty good the first day before a nurse helped me get him latched correctly, and this cream definitely kept me feeding while it healed. The one downside is that I was originally using this without breast pads. I didn't realize it until later, but all of the shirts I wore during that time now have huge oily stains over the nipple areas. I haven't had time to try and save the shirts yet. Hopefully I can, otherwise this cream ruined a ton of my clothes.",

I haven't had a problem with dry, cracked nipples, but this worked great for super raw nipples. Highly recommend!",

Also: big tip is to apply a warm, soft washcloth to your breasts before feeding/pumping and then after as well, concluding the whole process with nipple cream at the end.",
