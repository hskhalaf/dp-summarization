It came with 2 bright hotwheel cars to race with. It only includes 2 short pieces of orange track, they are just long enough to launch the cars off for a race. This does shoot them off quick! It's easy for a 3 year old to operate and kept him busy for quite some time. I am pleased because I can add onto this for many years and he and his Daddy were both having a great time. ;)",
