The material is easy to clean but I don't recommend the \"white\" unless it is a must for your color scheme. Also understand the material is not a cloth material it is a nylon material which does provide easy clean up but a little disappointing in regards to comfort and style. I would probably buy this again, in a darker color (sand).",
