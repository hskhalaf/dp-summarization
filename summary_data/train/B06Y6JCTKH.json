I had to go out and buy a new android based device. The web page could be more welcoming and entertaining. It's good, mind you, but it would be nice if you log in and save information and projects and remember where you left off in the instructions. I also don't like that the speaker sounds do not come from the robot/cat. They come from the tablet. It sure doesn't look that way in the advertising promo and takes some of the fun out of playing with the finished product.",
