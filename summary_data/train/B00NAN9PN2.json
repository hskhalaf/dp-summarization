But you would expect a toddler biting it, especially with the 360 design, right? It's a very nice product if it doesn't break down!",

Since babies are still learning, most of the time they are just chewing on whatever objects they are holding. We gave this to our twins and they were able to hold it and chew on the end as intended. The all around bristles meant that their teeth were getting cleaned no matter which way the toothbrush was held. After they are done chewing on it, we take the same brush and help them brush some more so they could get used to feeling the toothbrush in their mouths. This toothbrush made the transition to a regular one easier later.",

From the first time we used this brush my son loved it. The bristles are very soft and the portion that goes into his mouth is much smaller than the finger tooth brushes. The all around bristles allow me to brush his top and bottom teeth at the same time. Very happy with this purchase.",

    "description": "Color:Green| Size:3 CountTurn brushing teeth with your child into a positive experience after every meal and at bedtime with Baby Buddy's Brilliant Baby Toothbrush of the Brilliant Oral Care System. The program guides you with innovative oral care products that grow with your child from birth. Starting from the Foundations and through Teething & Budding, the products are designed to take care of budding baby teeth with state of the art, safe and soft products that children love to chew on. During Teeth Eruption & Development, the program progresses to distinctive toothbrushes for ages 4 months to 5 years that easily clean those hard-to-reach places where food and plaque can build up and cause cavities and other oral problems. The Brilliant Toothbrush revolutionizes the industry with its innovative design featuring bristles 360\u02da around the toothbrush head that are devised specifically for your child's tender teeth and gums. Over 10,000 short but highly elastic bristles gently massage gums and effectively clean the cheek and gums. And because of its unique design, brushing is always at a 45 degree angle, allowing parents and caretakers to brush teeth, tongue, and gums without needing to twist their wrist. This unique patented design can be used with water only to clean teeth to help remove harmful bacteria and sugar buildup that typically causes tooth decay. Developed in partnership with the Osaka University Infant Dental Clinic, the Brilliant Toothbrush effectively removes almost twice as much plaque as conventional, one-sided toothbrushes, when brushing for 2 minutes. The Brilliant Baby Toothbrush has been sized with a 4-24 month old in mind. Give your child the gift of a lifetime of good oral care habits with the innovative Brilliant Toothbrush. Check out our other Baby Buddy products because Every Baby Needs a Buddy.",
