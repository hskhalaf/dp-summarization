It is an elastic fitted sheet rather than the envelope style that comes with the Halo, and it does not fit the unique curve of the Halo mattress. The elastic also makes the mattress bow. The sheets are otherwise soft and come at a good price for the pack, so probably a better deal for another bassinet mattress.",

Love that the sheets have a waterproof underside (haven't seen other products like this) but like other reviewers have pointed out, the only downside is that it will take a while to dry when laundered (manufacturer tag indicates it needs to be hung dry). So having the 2nd sheet is a plus while the first one is drying out. \ud83d\ude03 Hope they come out with more designs for this type of sheet.",
