I bought this nai\u0308vely thinking the manufacturer surely would have corrected this design flaw as soon as they knew it was a problem. Instead, you have to ask them for a replacement part and fix it yourself. The concept for this product is great. I love the ceramic bowl. I hate the cheap plastic lever.",

I also see many having issues with the plastic lever wearing out/breaking. I'm guessing these are related. Nowhere does it say this product is dishwasher safe. I simply rinse it out in hot water and let it drain between uses. Don't put it in your dishwasher.",

But since then I've had two more units, and the levers broke on these as well. Bonavita would have a terrific product here if they could address the durability of the lever. But once it breaks, this dripper is no different from any other dripper out there. And again, let me stress that sooner or later, that lever will break.",

It also comes with a lid which keeps it hot during that process. My only complaint (not even really a complaint) is that the bottom exposes all of the inner workings of the device. So water definitely gets inside (and possibly trapped) so it takes a bit to air dry. They should find a way to cover all the screws and nooks and crannies. Other that that, it\u2019s awesome!",

Also as the rate of flow decreases, it stops dripping on center and runs somewhere along the inner rim.

More than 4 minutes to finish dripping and you'll have a mediocre and bitter cup of coffee.

I heat the water prior with an electric kettle so the entire process takes under 7 minutes. Makes a WAY better cup than any machine and provides the benefits of a filter that a coffee press doesn't.

Valve holds well, does not drip in closed position. Deducted 1 star as I am seeing minor surface cracks in the glazing after a few months of twice-daily use, but these cracks appear to be superficial and do not affect the integrity of the porcelain. Never had in dishwasher, only hand clean.",

I have recommended this to friends and they became fans too.I like that my gold No 4 filter works just fine. Downside: I have to hold the cone (it is heavy when filled) when filling some travel mugs because it does not sit on top by itself very well.",
