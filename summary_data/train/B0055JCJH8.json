Was trying to decide between this and the Kyocera Rise, and this finally won - although I like the keyboard much better on the Rise, this one is far, far superior in terms of call quality & camera. Very pleased - got a brand new, NOT refurbed phone, and the price at Amazon was less than half of what the Ting Store wanted, or the Glyde website where it was more money for a used or a refurbed one. Great little phone!",
