I work in the field and I bought this case after my third cracked screen after dropping and suffering a corner strike. With this case, it has been dropped on the corners several times without any damage to the screen. The feature I find unique and very useful is the tiny standoffs on the back side, preventing the phone from getting wet if it is placed on the table on a spill! Well Done Spigen!",

The edges on the bottom of the power hole are rather sharp as well, so if you hold it from the bottom it can get uncomfortable at times, but nothing too awful.

When I drop it, nothing breaks or shatters. When I hold the phone, the case feels slim and streamlined. Not much bulk is added. It feels sleek. The buttons to increase/decrease volume and power on/off are well outlined and satisfying to push. I can charge my phone and use the headphones while this case is on. I\u2019ve recommended this case to many friends and do the same here.",

      "text": "The only case I have used in the past few years for my I phones. I have accidentally dropped my phone many times with this case on, and the phone is still in perfect condition. The buttons work seamlessly with the phone, and the case does not stick in your pocket when you try to pull it out like other cases. Also, the headphone jack is wide enough to accept any inputs, when sometimes I have had to pull other cases off to listen to music in the car. Also, the lip on the front screen is amazing because it protects your glass if you lay the phone down on its face! Get this case, it rocks!",

      "text": "This is my 1st Spigen case. In the past, I used Otterbox. This one seems as sturdy, cheaper and MUCH LESS BULKY. the only thing that kept it from getting 5 stars was my concern over the durability of the metal back. Its not laying completely flush on the top right corner (non-camera corner). It appears to be slightly warped and my concern is that it will get worse with time as it catches on pockets etc. Overall it seems to be a solid, slim, strong case",

It doesn't get much better then this. I would strongly reccoment buying one of these cases. I have dropped my phone on the screen multiple times but the phone is left without a scratch. Although it completely protects my phone, I would reccoment getting a screen protector to go along with it to better protect the phone. Overall, a great product. Thanks Spigen!",

I had the same model for my 5s and it seems they were able to make this one much slimmer. I was worried about how this would effect the durability. Low and behold, I dropped my phone from about waist high smack down on the outside concrete. I was terrified to turn it over as it had landed on the edge (usually a deal breaker). My case a little scuff on the side, but my phone was perfectly in tact. A+",

I recently switched from Galaxy S6 back to iPhone and had this case for both. It has enough grip on the sides to keep me from dropping it, but also slides in/out of my jeans pockets with ease. And I have dropped it a couple of times from table height on very hard surface. Phone has survived each and every time!",
