There were no missing or ill-fitting parts or hardware; took about 20 minutes to assemble. I'm biased towards the 5-star rating because it matched the espresso cabinetry already in the guest bathroom. Works perfect installed over the commode. The panels are actual glass too, not plastic (well, oughtta be for the cost). All the lines are straight; pretty solid piece when assembled correctly. Doors move and latch just fine. Glad we found it - I was afraid i was gonna have to pay more for an already-made cabinet that would have needed painting to match it with the rest.",
