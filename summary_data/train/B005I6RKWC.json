I am at the emd of my second pair with all kinds of backpacking, daily use, and hard construction work miles on both pairs. I have had laces break, but never any part of the boot itself.

It is here, in the Northern Rocky Mountains, from the Wind River and Teton Ranges to the Bridgers and Spanish Peaks, with incredibly varied geologic features, and abundant wildlife such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, that Oboz is found. They've adopted the phrase \"True to the Trail\" as their guiding principle. As a new company, they're faced with direction-changing decisions every day.
