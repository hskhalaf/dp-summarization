Those who would choose to invest in this product are also likely to brag about its glove-like fit, incredible surface traction, and flexible midsole. It is a sandal for virtually everyone, although access to its many qualities is locked behind a rather lengthy softening stage. Nevertheless, the Z/Canyon 2 from Chaco revels in its remarkable traits.",

      "text": "Loved the weight(much lighter) compared to my old chacos. However, the heel strap is the main point of concern and low rating. It has padding on the inside, which as first was nice but then i developed pressure point blisters on the sides of both feet. Never happened in my old Z/2's. Also, the side piece of the heel strap that goes down to the heel, seems like it'll break much sooner. the glue has already come undone a little from the top of the sole. And i've only worn them for 2 whole day!!! Giving it two stars because they're light and as always, love to cloud footbed/sole",

The rigid ankle portion on the Canyon is what really makes them start to be uncomfortable though. That and the straps have significantly less play to be adjusted for comfort. I didn't get to try these on so that was my mistake. I thought the Z Cloud was going to let me know what these were like but the differences are more pronounced than I expected. Try before you buy.",
