The markers take a bit to prep but once primed they work great! The colors spread a bit more then my perfectionist 4 year old would like but that isn't a big deal. This toy is great and will get a ton of use in our household!",

He likes to spend time playing with it, and then it can be stored away with no problem. I like that it comes in a reusable plastic bag, and not a cardboard box. The pad for the stamps seems kind of cheap, and we had to give our child a sponge to wet the stamps, because the felt pad wouldn't stay in place.",
