My skin is oily in the Tzone, usually from being so dry and the Deep Cream makes it much oilier. It also does not absorb as well under my eyes and on my forehead and kind of just sits like a film. It looks very greasy all day long unless I use under a BB cream. Smells pretty neutral and the packaging is beautiful as always. I will probably go back to the regular Collagen Cream.",

It looks a little greasy right when you put it on (but I usually use it right before I go to bed) but by morning my face is moisturized. Because the cream is so thick, the bottle lasts a long time. I probably still have a fifth of the bottle left after using it for around 4 months. If you have dry skin, this is a great cream! If you have regular or oily skin, you probably don't need something this moisturizing.",

It\u2019s gel like which I thought wouldn\u2019t work for my dry skin but it does the job nicely! I wish it came in a pump but handle it with care to keep it clean.",

      "text": "I have pretty dry and chapped skin in the winter, and it usually just sucks products up but this cream kind of sits on my face. It's a little greasy feeling and takes seemingly forever to absorb completely. Having said that, it's not giving me any adverse reactions and it feels kind of nice when it does dry all the way. I don't think I'd buy this one again unless my skin gets unbelievably dry, but it's definitely not the worst night cream I've ever used.",

It\u2019s been less than a day and my face is smooth. It absorbs slowly, but I like that and it isn\u2019t noticeable. Never using another moisturizer after trying this. Highly recommend for dry skin!",

It also comes with a little scoop that you use to take the product out of the container, which is much more hygienic than dipping your fingers in. This would work best for those with dry skin. It would be too heavy for someone with normal to oily skin and might be a bit much in warm, humid weather. But I absolutely love it and have found my new HG face cream!! Note that there is a light scent, which I find pleasant, but others might not. There is also no SPF.",

The new has a very strong floral scent whereas the old is very light and fresh. Also, the NEW one doesn\u2019t retain as much moisture as the old. Will not buy the new, hopping the old version is not discontinued.",

It feel so smooth, and my skin simply loves it. I've had no breakout or yucky issues. The scent on the other version is better, but this can't be beat moisture-wise. Great for oily skin (like mine) when it feels dry- Use sparingly",
