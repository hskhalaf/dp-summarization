Amazon should remove it's \"Amazon's Choice\" label from this piece of crap before someone gets hurt. I wish I had read more of the negative reviews - I would return this if I could.",

I can move it the arm as needed without having to move the entire lamp which is a HUGE plus. AND DID I MENTION HOW BRIGHT THIS THING GETS!? In all honesty, I wasn't expecting much, but oh goodness.

For my study at night something much less bright is sufficient. Another improvement would be to be able to switch hue to a more yellow color It is a bright white light, which is great for many things but not as relaxing as a more yellow hue. Allof that said, it's a great little lamp.",

The added USB outlet is a nice touch for recharging my iPad or iPhone. It is not quite as sexy looking as the one at Costco that is 3 times the price but it's good looking and does the job. Touch one on, a second time brighter a 3rd time brightest a 4th time off.",

Even has a USB port on the side to charge the phone while I\"m working! Get this light! You won't regret it.",
