First of all, I perceived zero benefits derived from this product. It seemed like a pointless addition to my routine. Additionally, as usual with dimethicone-laden products, I broke out. This product caused unusual (for me) painful \"blind\" pimples on my chin and some very red little bumps on the sides of my nose that looked like bug bites against my olive-golden brown skin. I removed this product from my routine, et voila! A few days later my skin was much better. I just don't see the point of this *shrugs*.",

Face at night feels sticky and in the morning feels tacky. Face slightly sticks to pillow but does not stain it. Really enjoyed this once I started an acne treatment that was drying my face. It gave my skin the extra moisture I needed. I find this works best as a treatment product for me. It is not quite enough to act as a moisturizer by itself, but does a nice job of boosting my existing moisturizer. I like it but don't love it.",

By the time she wakes up in the morning, the stickiness is gone, but it is unclear whether it is because the mask was absorbed into her skin or into the pillowcase (though she did not see any stain or grease spots). She thinks her skin looked the same as it did before application. The directions say to apply moisturizer first, then the mask, which does not make much sense to her. She tried both ways, but she did not see any difference.",

In the morning there is no trace of the mask so a simple rinse of my face with warm water is all that is necessary. It leaves my sensitive, rosacea prone skin feeling plump and pampered. I recommend this mask and will repurchase.",

I have sensitive acne prone skin and the ingredients agree with me, it has not broken me out or done anything other than soften and moisturize. it has a good clean smell as well.",
