I warned them of the coming review(s) and they were very nice but didn't care. No more Suunto for me. They even asked me to take a survey - first question was would I recommend Suunto - 0 was no way - told me that was invalid and they ended the call.",

If you intend to use this in pitch dark I don't think it'll glow like a tritium (mildly radioactive substance that glows due to the substance decaying) watch dial. For those of you counting ounces, it weighs in at 1.04 ozs on the home postage scale. I like the magnifier in the center.

The cover hinge isn\u2019t a hinge at all, it\u2019s just a thinning in the plastic. I\u2019m sure it will wear out and snap off. The compass itself is simply snapped into he housing. The protective film on the mirror is difficult to remove. The whistle is nice and solid. The clip mechanism which holds whistle on to the compass seems a bit flimsy. Again I think it will wear out quickly. Overall not a great buy.",

Also, know the magnetic declination for your area of travel as this compass will point to magnetic North. Made navigating in an new city very comforting.

      "text": "After owning and researching watch and compass combinations, I settled on this clip-on compass for my L. L. Bean field watch. Every combo has either a great watch with a so-so compass or vice versa. This exceptional clip-on compass fits my slim NATO style watch band perfectly. It is small enough to be unobtrusive but big enough to be worthwhile. Now I have the right combination for less money than I would pay for something that looks impressive but doesn't perform both roles well.",
