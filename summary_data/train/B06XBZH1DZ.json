      "text": "I bought this for my 10-year-old granddaughter for Christmas. I had looked at several different keyboards. What I like about this is that it has the mic, stool, pedal, headphones. There is also an App that it recommends to learn the keyboard and you can place your Smart Phone or tablet right on the stand and it knows which keys you're playing. If you put the headphones in, you can play or practice and no one around you can hear anything and the volume in the headphones is a very comfortable level. Considering everything I looked at I found this to be a great bargain considering everything that comes with it.",

It's easier and ultimately returns more value for the money if you also buy the extras, like a stand and bench. I was happy to find such an affordable kit, and surprised that it works so well. 6+ months later, all the pieces are still sturdy and functioning as intended. I'd buy it again and would recommend it. However, the cord for the AC adapter isn't very long. A power strip can help (and is probably a good idea anyway).",

We have an 8yo who wanted to learn how to play, but good keyboards are expensive. This is perfect for her to learn on and we can get a better one when she outgrows it. Overall it's a good value if you're wanting to learn, but it just doesn't cut it for intermediate or advanced players.",

Had to package the WHOLE THING (break down the seat, the stand - everything) back up and send it back for a replacement. When the replacement arrived we set it up - multiple keys wouldn\u2019t even work when pressed. Now having to package up and send back once again! This time not even bothering with a replacement, two defective products and hauling a 30 lb item to the UPS store twice in three days is definitely not worth the savings on this item.",

If I could send it back, I would but I recycled the box the same week I got it so I could store it. I didn't find out the stand wasn't usable until I went to set it up.",
