      "text": "My daughter loved the look and color (navy) of this helmet. She was replacing an IRH helmet that went missing at the stables. The problem with this helmet is the strap. There is velcro on one side of the head that the strap with Velcro to adjust can't possibly reach. So you've got Velcro on the strap under your chin. It's scratchy, stiff and uncomfortable. Nothing like the helmet we were replacing. Very disappointing. Waiting for UPS to pick it up now for return.",

I bought the velvety looking version with a shiny vent and am very happy with it. After a friend saw mine, she bought the matte version with a matte vent, and she loves hers too.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve been on he lookout for a new helmet for schooling and love the IRH helmets, but they\u2019re usually more expensive than I\u2019d like for a schooling helmet. Saw this go on sale for my size and so I ordered it. I\u2019m SO glad I did. The interchangeable and washable liners are an amazing feature and this helmet is definitely nice enough to show in as well (hunter/jumper and dressage in my case). Would absolutely buy again even at regular price.",

I\u2019ve gotten compliments on it at the barn. It comes with two different padding inserts - one is thicker and one is thinner so you can further customize the fit.",
