I informed them that 2 bulbs were blown, and they sent 5 replacement bulbs within a week. I'm very happy with my lights, and very satisfied with the customer services of the vendor.",

Boring and a hassle I know but soooo much better than having one end release from the extension cord before it's securely tied/attached and crash onto the cement patio below.",

      "text": "The product was exactly what we wanted. After checking the light and all were working we CAREFULLY hung the lights in a straight line around our Gazebo. Within three days over half of the bulbs stopped working. We had to replace all the bulbs since we were unable to match the existing ones to lights we bought at Home Depot. They work fine now and seem durable. We purchased four sets and by the time we replaced all the bulbs it ended up costing us over $50. We were in a pinch since we had a party the weekend after they arrived so no time to go through the return process and customer service never responded to us.",

They can support their own weight, and have a perfect lighting that both makes outdoors more visible at night, but isn't so bright that it messes with the ambiance. I went through a few different versions of this before finding this brand, so if you're shopping around, give these a try. A few bulbs have gone out (in places safe from the weather), so it seems the bulbs are not as high quality as the actual wiring/insulation. I might look into getting lower-light LED bulbs or something for this in the future that won't go out for no reason.",

The box comes with an extra. I screwed in the extra only to find out 2 other bulbs were not lighting. Over the course of a few days, 5 other bulbs stopped lighting. I tried unscrewing and screwing back in with no luck. Amazon sent me a replacement, but the replacement has 2 bulbs that don\u2019t work. getting tired of setting up and taking these down and returning to UPS only for them not to work again. I can only imagine what these will be like after a month of usage.",

They give you one extra bulb per strand so I would recommend ordering extra bulbs with your order.",

These were a cheaper option than most and for only 6.5 months of use, i can now see why.
