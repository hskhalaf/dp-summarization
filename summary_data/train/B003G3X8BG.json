The detailed description doesnt let you know;I contacted Dish Network for more info and I strongly advised anyone who purchases this product do the same, but its definitely worth the purchase price. It has perfect graphics,no lacking, and the sling works great.Also,the DVR receiver has the ability to work on multiple tvs at once. Thanks, Micheal Carson",

The new VIP922 will not read any of the files off of any of my external drives even though they were recorded from the old VIP 922. My understanding is that this technology is what the Hopper is based on, so buyer beware if you like to use an external drive to archive your shows you probably don't want to be in the same situation I am in. I have about 13 2 TB drives full of shows that are now useless. By the way, Tech support spent hours trying to help, they were not able to help me with this problem. Ralph J. Fitcher",

Finaly, I was advised to wait for few weeks to see if the manufacturer may address the problems. Five months later I am still waiting",
