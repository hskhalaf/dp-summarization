      "text": "I brought this nailer with 1\" recommended roofing nails. Project, secure cement board to OSB wall. Nailer never misfired but about every fourth nail would go on a diagonal an not secure to OSB wall. Not happy with that, I tried nailer and nails on a small composition roofing project. Once again a nail would come out on a diagonal about third to fifth nail. I believe the wire holding the nails in a band is to strong for the shorter nails. The nails have to far to travel before exiting the nailer allowing them to twist in the barrel. Longer nails should work better! I hope!",

Plan to finish the half done roof and have no reason to think it won't. The only misfires were when the coil was short, down to a few nails you might have a two shot. My wife even used it since she can climb around on the roof like a big monkey. She said, 'This doesn't work right!' when multiple nails fired--because she kept squeezing the trigger. Lay off, muscles! It's not a machine gun.",
