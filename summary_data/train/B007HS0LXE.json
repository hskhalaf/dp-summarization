This product isn't bad, but the real deal is smoother and more moisturizing. Perhaps the product is expired, and that's why they sell it cheaper - or it's a knock off. I will not purchase this or any other beauty products on Amazon as this is not the first suspect product I've received. The other was Juice Beauty Hydrating Mist - definitely a knock off.",

This seems counter intuitive to the conventional wisdom that night creams should be more heavy and \"sink in\" all night. But I actually like the fresh and light feeling of the Caudalie sorbet at night, like my skin can breathe after being covered with heavier cream and makeup during the day. I can't get enough of this moisturizer!!!",
