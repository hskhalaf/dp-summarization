It is that sturdy.Yesterday I was doing step-ups with a 135 pound barbell across my shoulders (I weigh 175) at the 16\" setting. The Stamina X didn't groan, moan, sway, shake or otherwise compilation. This is one serious piece of gym equipment.",

I'm pretty sure it could take the weight of a car. It's so heavy that it's a bit cumbersome to adjust the height, and it's heavy to move. But it's a sturdy platform as a result. The rubber surface on the top is thick and appears durable. Cons: I agree with another reviewer that the bar used as a locking mechanism is extremely flimsy, and likely to bend or break if you're not careful. This seems like a major oversight when the rest of the unit is so heavy-duty.",

The ONLY criticism I have is the height sticker falls off fairly easily. If the steel it was on was stamped in so that they sticker was recessed it would be an improvement. Its so nice I use as a seat, a stool, a step-ladder, a TV tray. It is steel and although the paint is nice, it will wear on the slot/ridge. So keep in a dry area or I would inspect/clean/lightly oil occasionally. Overall awesome!",

It doesn't take up a lot of space but you can use it at 4 different heights- I couldn't imagine trying to fit 4 different wooden plyo boxes in my garage!
