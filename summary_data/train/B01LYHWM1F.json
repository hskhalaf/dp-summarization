I went on a 10Km walk and experienced zero hotspots and zero moisture, thus no chance of any blistering. The support the sneakers give under the ball of the foot is a new experience for me and only added to the overall comfort. This is my first purchase of Skechers and I have no problems in recommending them. Excellent choice.",

I love the memory cushion inner sole which make them feel like slippers.",
