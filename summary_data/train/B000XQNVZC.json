When it arrived I actually laughed out loud because it was so comically large. In an office setting I may be a little embarrassed to use this around other people (due to it's size) but I work from home and it's a great calculator. It's about 8.25\" x 6\"",

It does a great job and has several options others don't like Cut, 5/4 rounding, Floating point, and a decimal point switch with several options. I deducted one star because its size is not stated in the description and because some functions do not work as expected. For those reasons, be sure to keep the instructions. An example shows what I mean: If you want to add 5% of 100 to 100, you CANNOT key in 100 + 5 % because it gives 105.263. You have to key in 100 x. 5 % + which gives the correct answer of 105 calculated as 100 + .05*100",
