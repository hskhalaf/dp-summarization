I like to make a muscle rub oil for when I\u2019m feeling achey and stiff and this is what I use with arnica oil and essential oils. I can put the muscle rub oil on and after a few minutes it\u2019s nice and absorbed and I don\u2019t feel super greasy. I also like the price point on the NOW brand, although I\u2019m sure an argument could be made for the higher priced carrier oils, this one works just fine for me.",

For some reason, with this combination, my hands are sticky when I finish. This however, does not affect the results on my hair. I have high porosity hair so I have to moisturize every night (ugh).",

This worked well for me and I soon discovered that it doesn't take much either. I also used this in my bath water along with my bubbles and just a teaspoon in the water. Worked like a dream. I used this in combination with my lotion and again, it left my skin smooth and soft. I highly recommend to anyone for their hair or body as this oil is 100 percent natural, unlike some other oils I have tried.",

All the other products I've tried did a better job at straightening, but the smell was so bad I had to discontinue use. This has a slight smell for about half an hour, but then it goes away. I apply this to my mustache right below my nose, and the smell isn't overpowering at any point.",
