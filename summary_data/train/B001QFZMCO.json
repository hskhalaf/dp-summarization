Can't see it on the back screen but will notice it on your computer when it is too late to take another photo. Really like the lumix line but have run into this one issue.",

You have to move your entire hand, not just your finger to reach zoom controls from the button that takes the picture. I couldn't hold the camera comfortably and press the button. 3) No viewfinder means you're taking pictures blindly if there is any sun, but they still come out great usually. 4) Battery lasts about a day so don't forget to charge it.",

Definitely an upgrade. Shutter speed and reset before you can take the next picture is a little slow unless you have it on burst mode, but then the pictures are not 10 megapixle. I would still recommend this camera though. I really like how it takes black and white pics and a couple of button clicks and you are in the next color option.

Unfortunately, I hadn't had much chance to use the camera until two months after receiving it, since I bought it in advance of my internship, so that I could record meetings. I bought a new battery ($45). That didn't work. Then I bought two different cables to connect the camera AC power ($55), but, all for naught; it still won't turn on. Actually that's an exaggeration. It does turn on maybe one out of every five times I try to use it. It's incredibly aggravating, especially considering how much money I've put into trying to fix it now.",

Other reviews have hit on the strengths and a few shortcomings in great detail, so I will keep my review short and sweet and just say that it fully met my needs and expectations, and for a great price.",

The DMC-ZS3 had the same 12x optical zoom that the DMC-FZ20 had, and the great Leica lens. I love the ZS3 and am very impressed with the Lumix cameras overall. Although the ZS3 is not the most compact camera you can find, it is the most compact with a 12x optical zoom. I take it everywhere on my motorcycle, I slide it in my briefcase, even in my coat pocket. Great photos, easy to use, amazing zoom, awesome camera.",

Although this camera packs many features, I am disappointed at the fact that I cannot remove red-eye conditions through the unit itself without having to rely on software removal after the fact. Unfortunately, the red-eye control option does not always prevent the red-eye effect, and it would be nice to correct this problem with the click of a button.",

It took great close-up pictures of flowers, plants etc. The \"iA mode\" is smart and correctly detects the mode to be used (although at a few times we used some manual setting like turning off flash etc).

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3 inch LCD (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackThe new Lumix ZS3 features 10.1-megapixels, a 25mm ultra-wide-angle lens and 12x optical zoom, meaning it has added 2x optical zoom to the award-winning TZ-series camera, yet reduced its size. The ZS3 also features a Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens and High Definition (HD) video recording ability, known as AVCHD Lite.The ZS3 is the world\u2019s first digital camera to feature HD video recording in AVCHD Lite. Compared with the conventional Motion JPEG format, AVCHD Lite allows longer recordings with breathtaking HD visual and audio quality. This combined with a well-considered control interface, which includes a dedicated movie recording button on the camera\u2019s back panel, makes the ZS3 a hybrid model that performs admirably for both still and motion image capture.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe new Lumix ZS3 features 10.1-megapixels, a 25mm ultra-wide-angle lens and 12x optical zoom, meaning it has added 2x optical zoom to the award-winning TZ-series camera, yet reduced its size. The ZS3 also features a Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens and High Definition (HD) video recording ability, known as AVCHD Lite. \n\nThe ZS3 is the world\u2019s first digital camera to feature HD video recording in \"AVCHD Lite.\" Compared with the conventional Motion JPEG format, AVCHD Lite allows longer recordings with breathtaking HD visual and audio quality. This combined with a well-considered control interface, which includes a dedicated movie recording button on the camera\u2019s back panel, makes the ZS3 a hybrid model that performs admirably for both still and motion image capture. \n\nThe ZS3 also expands Panasonic\u2019s popular Intelligent Auto (iA) mode with the addition of Face Recognition--a feature that \"remembers\" faces from previous shots. When a registered face appears in the frame, the camera will prioritize focus and exposure to capture it beautifully. With Face Recognition, when a familiar face is recorded several times, the camera will prompt the users to register the face. Once registered, if the face appears into the frame again, the camera will display the name specified for that person and prioritize focus and exposure so that the registered face is bright and sharply focused. \n\nNew this year to the ZS-Series, iA mode is also available in Movie Mode. It automatically selects the most suitable Scene mode and helps to correct handshake, focus and brightness problems - making iA mode your one-stop solution to capture beautiful still and motion images. In Movie Mode, the ZS3, Optical Image Stabilization (O.I.S.) helps prevent handshake when using the high-powered zoom. Face Detection automatically detects a face in the frame and adjusts focus, exposure, contrast, and skin complexion so it turns out perfectly. Intelligent Exposure continually checks the ambient light level and adjusts the exposure setting as conditions change to prevent blown highlights and blocked shadows. And Intelligent Scene Selector automatically switches between Normal, Portrait, Macro, Scenery, and Low Light modes according to the situation to optimize visual quality. \n\nThe imaging power of Lumix has further evolved with the Venus Engine HD, which boasts two CPUs to provide approx. 2.4x processing capability and support for AVCHD Lite and HDMI output. It integrates all the advanced functions and camera operations with high performance and low-power consumption. In image processing, luminance noise and chromatic noise are reduced separately before and after signal processing. This is further refined by separating noise two-dimensionally into high-frequency and low-frequency noise. The circuits then effectively reduce only the low-frequency noise to minimize the unwanted noise and help produce beautiful, sharp still and motion images. \n\nPlayback with the ZS-series is also easy. Simply insert the camera\u2019s SD memory card into the VIERA HDTV\u2019s Image Viewer SD Card slot for a photo slideshow. Alternatively, connect the camera via an optional HDMI mini cable, the DMW-HDC2, to a VIERA Link-equipped Panasonic VIERA HDTV and use the television\u2019s remote control to run mixed slideshows of photos and videos. The ZS3 features a 3-inch, high resolution 460,000-dot Intelligent LCD with a wide viewing angle, improving visibility during recording and playback. \n\nOther features of the Lumix ZS3 include: \n\n * Increased Scene modes for both still and motion image shooting--optimized for a variety of situations. There are 26 scene modes for still image and 17 for motion image (Portrait, Soft Skin, Transform, Self portrait, Scenery, Low light, Food, Party, Candle light, Sunset, High sensitivity, Beach, Snow, Aerial, Pin hole, Film grain and Underwater) \n * Two new My Scene settings let users assign their two most frequently used Scene modes to the setting, and with a simple switch, allow access to either scene instantly. \n * New Panorama Assist scene mode allows users to shoot a number of consistent photos, either vertically or horizontally, by aligning them according to a guide that overlaps the screen. Then using those photos and the bundled PanoramaMaker software, users can create dramatic panoramic images. \n * High-Speed Burst (Speed Priority) that fires off approx. 10 shots per second. \n * Menus are clearer and easier to navigate with the Display Size option. \n * Macro Zoom function lets users pull subjects even closer to capture dramatic close-up shots by using the 3x digital zoom in the wide-angle. \n * Bundled Software: The latest version of PHOTOfunSTUDIO 3.0 HD Edition allows users to view, edit and archive captured content with greater ease and fun. Still and motion images can be transferred to the computer via a USB cable for viewing and archiving. Using PHOTOfunSTUDIO 3.0 HD Edition, users can edit and remove unwanted portions of video clips recorded in AVCHD Lite. Contents recorded in AVCHD Lite can be burned directly onto a DVD disc or the software can convert contents to MPEG2 format. The software also incorporates the Face Recognition function, which recognizes registered faces in photos stored on the computer, making organizing and archiving photos with a specific person much easier. Additionally, motion pictures can be uploaded directly to YouTube.",
