Well, the zipper just broke on them down by the ankle, and I have no way of repairing them. These boots are expensive, so they should have lasted longer than a few monhs. The leather is high-quality and the fit was great. Too bad about the zipper though. :(",

I have tried so many knee boots searching for a particular tailored look and I found it in this pair. The heel is chunky and gives a nice boost in height, too. And, the zipper mechanism moves smoothly and easily. Looks good from every angle. I can wear between a size 8.5 and 9: went with the 8.5 and it's perfect even with socks.",

Here is a tip that I read written by a professional football player: The best way to break in a new pair of shoes (i.e. boots) is by taking a pair of relatively thick athletic socks, getting them slightly damp and then rub a bar of soap all over them. Walk around with the soapy socks in the shoes (i.e. boots) all day. They will soften to fit your foot perfectly and you will have no blisters! Wow. Using that technique really works!
