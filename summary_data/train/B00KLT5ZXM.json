It is designed to hold a significant amount of debris without spilling it back into the water when you are moving it through the pool. The lip is angled perfectly to allow for collection of the smallest pieces on the bottom. It seems very durable considering I have used it several times a week for more than a year and it is showing no signs of wear. The price of this rake makes it a bargain when I think about how many cheap skimmers I have been through over the years.",

      "text": "This pool leaf rake is better than the ones you buy at the box pool stores but it does have a major flaw. The lip of the rake should be more hydro active (make a turbulence via the lip) so that the debris in front of the rake is gently disturbed so that the rake can capture the debris more easily. A larger more water dynamic lip would solve this problem. With that said I would buy it again as the large bag is perfect for raking a lot if leaves off the bottom.",
