We just didn't have any appropriate surfaces.",

Suctions to the glass wall of the shower, plenty loud for the shower--volume determined by the phone--but can be controlled with the speaker buttons, easy to recharge using standard USB outlet. Best of all, it's portable, unlike a ceiling speaker, so I can travel with the speaker or use it outdoors to boost my phone's speaker. Don't expect to use it for dance music, but great when a phone speaker isn't enough.",

This one, I charged, used once, and the next time I wanted to use it again, it was dead. I'm too practical a guy to just throw something away, but when it was dead so soon after a charge, I was able to overcome my cheapness and finally, joyfully, trashed this pile of crap.",

Not even worth playing music while it's doing a low battery tone, because the music is constantly interrupted. It would have been nice if they used a light color change for low battery warning, or made the tone not as frequent.",

However, thanks to additional instructions from Margo, and a little fiddling around in the Alexa app on my phone, we got it working. I'm very happy with the speaker.

Very easy to use all features. Simply charge out of the box and you'll be good for weeks. Cons: it comes with a charging cable but does not come with the piece that you actually plug into the wall.

      "text": "I bought this because my portable speaker and phone don't transmit sound well enough while I'm in the shower. The sound quality is great, given that it's a small shower speaker. Battery life is great; I've charged it once since I started using it a month ago (my showers are only 10-15 minutes long, for perspective). No issues with connectivity thus far. It definitely has enough volume... I have to turn it down because it is too loud sometimes! I can also talk on the phone if I get a call, although the sound of the water makes it hard for people to hear me. It sticks well to my shower door and has not fallen.",

You can adjust the volume from the shower directly on the speaker.

However the sound quality is not that good in my opinion. It sounds like the mid-range and treble are turned up so high that it is screechy and hurts my ears. Bass is virtually non-existent and to me that would have gone a long way to improve the sound quality. I can say I only recommend this if sound quality is not a priority for you and are just looking for something cheap. Otherwise I\u2019d avoid this if sound quality is important to you.",
