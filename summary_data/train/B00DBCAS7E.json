Back in original game you could continue to build and tend your zoo indefinitely, however, these zoos are \u201cfull\u201d and then you can no longer add animals or other buildings without deleting other ones from the same park. Meaning you complete a zoo within 30 mins and it\u2019s just over. Horrible purchase. Would not recommend",

      "text": "I bought this a few years ago and played it when I first got my Xbox one. I was really excited for it. The game was fun for a while and kept me pretty entertained, but it did start to get a bit repetitive. The biggest disappointment was when I was about 2-3 hrs into the game and it told me I'd reached zoo capacity. When looking over the total possible space to build on, I'd probably used only about 10% of the available space. But it didn't have the ability to build more, which was a buzzkill since I couldn't continue. It was fun while it lasted, but it didn't last very long.",

But I did like having the challenges added in Challenges mode like taking pictures of something. It\u2019s lots of fun to interact with the animals. It would always be nice to have more animals.

She likes the fact she can create her own little or big zoo and feed all the animals and care for them. The graphics are great and I love the fact there is no violence or cursing going on in this game like so many other xbox games out there have now. She has several of the tycoon games now and none have disappointed. This is a great game at a great price. All ages that like animals and building and designing would enjoy the game.",

I do wish they had made expansions like on the original to do dinosaurs or sea animals. Not a whole lot of animal variety, but enough to entertain.
