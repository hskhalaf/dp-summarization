It's been tough to find a good gluten free pasta that acts and tastes like regular pasta. This is one of the better gluten free pastas we've tried.",

I have used another brand that is far better than this that holds up, even if you have to reheat some of what might be left over. I thought I would try the Barilla because I have used their regular pasta before I changed to gluten free. I would have continued purchasing my favorite brand, but the price on Amazon was outlandish. Thus, I am seeking another source for it. Many gluten free products are overpriced and not good enough to warrant their high prices. Obviously, I shall not purchase this again.",
