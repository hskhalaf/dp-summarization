However, after 2 days of use, my poor dogs armpits look like they were attacked by a cheese grater. I wondered why he didn't have any pep in his step when fetching his ball today until I saw his bloodied, raw armpits. A few more inches of padding or fleece could have completely prevented this issue. Due to my dog being injured by this harness, I cannot recommend it. The picture only shows an edge of the injured area. He was understandably sore and wouldn't allow for much positioning.",

I was looking for a harness that had a front clip and something that would be comfortable on her. This harness fits the bill. We just came back from our first walk and the harness worked great! No pulling at all from beginning to end. Although she looks sad in the photo, I assure you she is quite thrilled. Sizing was accurate according to the chart. Would recommend this product.",

The new one is every bit as well made as the original. Given the beating the first one has taken and survived during the past three years, I wouldn't think of trying another brand. At any price, the quality is excellent--and there are dog harnesses that are way more expensive.",

      "text": "Just purchased this harness for my dog.. he walks great most of the time, but anytime we are getting closer to home or the car he pulls like crazy, so I was hoping this would help.. It didn't.. he still pulled just the same, but since I had the leash hooked to the front, it really just pulled the front chest portion over which restricted his front leg movement, but still didnt stop him. I was honestly afraid he would slip his leg out that way, so I switched it to the back clasp. Not sure if i'm going to keep or try something else. Overall it seems like a nice harness though, looks more comfortable than what we had..",

At first I thought it was too big but you can change the straps to make it smaller or bigger which is great if she grows. I bought this because she pulls on the leash a lot even with a normal harness, but with the front range leash thingy you gain so much more control, yes she still pulls but it's a weak pull. The difference is night and day hopefully, this will make training a bit easier. The harness its self is great quality easy to put on, and well built. Highly recommended!",

I had read front clips are best for lose leash training a puppy and once they learn the back clip is ideal. Our dog loves this. The quality is great and the reflectors are a good add on. We have also found that the handle on the back has been very helpful with out energetic puppy... he is also automatically better behaved once we put it on. I have already purchased the next size up for him and bought one for my parents dog!",

      "text": "I've used this harness for almost a year now with our 70lb golden retriever. I've used it on walks, hikes, and runs and overall the quality of the material appears to be high. It has stood up well to the elements and his pulling. The top handle strap is very convenient for restraining him when he gets overly excited around other dogs and people. However, after using the harness for several 2-3 mile runs/hikes, I've discovered large 2-3\" abrasions in both armpits that were scabbed over. Seems like anything more than walking causes this. Well-made harness but the injuries are forcing me to look elsewhere now.",

      "text": "This is the best/nicest harness I've purchased and will be the last! The photo doesn't do it justice. Really quality constructed. Quality materials etc. If I ever need to purchase another harness I will definitely repurchase this one! Adjusts nicely! No areas of chafing, etc. on my dog. Seems to ride very comfortably against their body. Really well constructed chest plate and nicely padded and seems comfortable against their chest/skin. (I ordered two for my two Shelties). I not only use them for walking, I use them to harness them in the backseat of my Outback. Can't say enough about these harnesses... Thank you!!!",
