The descriptor of heat resistant is accurate, though they are not thick enough to provide any protection to the surface below if a hot dish is placed on top. The weave allows for gaps, but it still cleans up easily. Again, however, it will not protect the surface below from spills. The heat and spill protection factors are why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars. All in all it is a good product and serves my need.",

I have two little kids who both spill frequently and these mats do a good job. I've noticed some staining (mainly from pizza sauce) which is too bad but I still love these mats.",

They are smaller than the placemats we had previously but these look nicer. I cannot attest to how well they clean and if liquid sleeps through yet. They arrived flat in the packaging.",
