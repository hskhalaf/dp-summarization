      "text": "Seriously surprised! I am a seasoned airbrusher and I collect many more expensive brand airbrushes, Japanese , German and American made. Right out of the box , complete with all that you will need to get to painting. One thing missing was lube. The parts are machined well and tight, had to spritz a lil' lube onto the MAC air control screw and BAM!, ready to rock! Trigger response is tight and control valve works as it should. Good looking hand-piece, this one is a keeper. Comes with spare tips and needle in different sizes, moisture trap, adapters, hose and quick disconnect. Price is right!",

      "text": "Received this product yesterday and i was impressed with the packaging and all accessories it came with. But that's until i tried the airbrush. The button action is a bit too rough and will someone's be stuck! I tried lubricating it but still getting stuck! Took it apart to see what is catching. Looks like the gasket for the plug is a bit too tight! It sprays nicely but your finger will tire out and it's hard to regulate the spray. I was really rooting for this to work good because it's a good looking airbrush. Hopefully it loosens it as i try to use it more.",

      "text": "It's really stiff the button for air and paint is hard to push your finger and hand gets really tired quick maybe it will free up over time it does not spray well as you pull back for paint dead spots where it will stop paint flow and then blast a load of paint the .5 needle does not do that but it's a bit big for the way I paint I polished the needles to see if that would help it did not will keep playing with it maybe I can make it work as of now I'm real disappointed but it is cheap cheap doesn't matter if it doesn't work",
