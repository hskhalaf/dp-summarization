The smooth single ball is a good alternative to the knobby ball for those who might be too sensitive for the pointed knobs but I like the knobs, they are a little rough but satisfying. My dog seems to love these balls. When he sees me take my balls out, he wants to chew on them so the included ball sack is great. I just hang the ball sack up out of his reach. So if you have a dog that loves balls you'll definitely want to keep your balls tucked away in the sack.",

Because it on traditional slick matting - like most gyms use - it just slides around under you if you try to roll over it. It's possible that on yoga style rubber matting it would work just fine. But I wouldn't be thrilled with the cleaning the felting either.",
