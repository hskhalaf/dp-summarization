Bought size 2.0 reeds to use with this. The fit is tight. Definitely needed a lot of cork grease but nothing that my kid can't handle. The customer service is very responsive. I emailed with questions and they answered very promptly. If you're concerned on quality for your student player, just get this! You won't regret it.",

Between his music teacher and the two specialists it was determined that nothing was damaged on the clarinet, it was just a faulty instrument. This made the clarinet unfixable, unplayable, and unfortunately a big waste of money. I ended up having to rent a clarinet to make it through the rest of the school year.",

This fit my needs perfectly, and I would recommend it to any beginner or intermediate musician. The only problem I've had is that the cork in between is a little flat. But otherwise it is excellent for its price.",
