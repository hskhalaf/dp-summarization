Unfortunately, most of the materials that I looked at were geared towards rote repetition. The Singapore Math books, by contrast, are excellent. They focus on creative problem solving and force children to really think through the materials. If you are wondering why Singapore's students are doing fabulously on the PISA tests that test student achievement across nations, here is the answer. Strongly recommended.",
