      "text": "It has been widely reported that the camera on the 2020 MacBook Air is low quality, but mine was definitely in the non-acceptable range. Picture was very grainy, unfocused, and low light level. I strongly suspect the glass in front of the video chip was damaged, perhaps for a contamination during assembly, but have now way of checking directly. Cleaning the outside had no effect. With heavy heart, I decided to return the unit, and buy an equivalent from the big-box store, where quality can (and will) be checked before purchasing. Update: refund for the item still pending, 14 working days after the returned item was delivered to Amazon. Worse than expected and worse than advertised (14 calendar days)",

What year is it. I dont think I've had any camera in 720p in over 6 years. The retina display is nice as always but it IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!

The \"quad core i5\" in mine might as well be an i3; it music cuts out when I'm listening to podcasts and challenging the device by surfing the web. It's underpowered for multitasking. I wanted to believe that by upgrading to the higher echelon model I'd be ditching a lot of the complaints I read about, but I've immediately found that's not the case. No getting around the 2GHz MBP 13\" in my world - hoping at least that can handle two things at once with a decent camera.",

Very lightweight. Product came in GREAT condition. Only problem I have is when I put my phone by the screen, the screen glitches. Idk if thats just me or if that happens to everyone. The laptop barely overheats. Actually, the laptop never really gets hot. I love this laptop. Keyboard is great! Easy to type and use. I use this laptop for regular use (nothing fancy) and it works like a charm for me.",

I wish I got the i5 version for $100 more instead so I can easily use full features with apps like Zoom but no regrets, handles most of my usage with ease. Heats up a bit because of its thinness but doesn\u2019t impact performance drastically. Great screen! Super lightweight! Amazon delivered 14 days before Best Buy told me they would have more in stock. Definitely go with Amazon on this one!",

Overall I would recommend this product especially for the price. We went with the 256 as the 500gb was $200 more (a 1TB SSD is &$100) you don\u2019t have to be an expert to put a hard drive in - just a clean place and good set of eyes Battery life camera quality fingerprint reader - two of these are not reasons to purchase a laptop.",

I was skeptical at first buying a new Mac laptop on amazon and also seeing the cheaper pricing, but after some research I decided to take a chance. The laptop came in full packaging like it came from apple. I've been using laptop for less than a week but it seems to hold battery pretty good. The camera was not the best but I knew that in buying the new 2020 MacBook Air. Next time I will probably get more Ram because I like to play sims 4 and it makes the laptop heat up a lot. Other than that it is a good buy.",
