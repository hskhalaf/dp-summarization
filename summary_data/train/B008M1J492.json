I would buy it, even again at this price because it looks really good and gives the player some extra confidence. Just would expect the straps to hold. But honestly in 2019 I'm surprised someone hasn't developed an easier, more efficient strapping system. Still old school hook style. IDK, I really like it but there are some sweet looking sets that cost a little less.",

I think it\u2019s the best gear for her, very protective. Helmet is very heavy though. She isn\u2019t a picture taker but here\u2019s one from the back.

This is marked for youth age 9-12, but it runs really big. Shin guard is 14.5' while other youth brands are in the range of 12' - 13'. Chest protector is 14', again most are in the 13'. The helmet looks nice, but my daughter complained of narrow field of view compare to Eastons helmet. Overall, I would not pick this product if your child is 9-10.",

He played a full tournament this weekend and is in love with his new gear. According to him the helmet is more comfortable and easy to put on. Chest protector has great padding. The leg guards have more of the protective fabric \"wings\" on the sides than other brands. Definitely gets two thumbs up from him...and me!",

It is a little higher priced than other sets I found but safety and quality take precedent. This set fits all 4 boys (9-10 yr olds) that switch off catching perfectly. The shin guards offer more protection than cheaper sets and they are very easy to put on and take off. The facemask and helmet offer a little more protection in the chin/neck area which is comforting. The boys have taken many balls to the chestguand and shinguards and have felt no discomfort.",
