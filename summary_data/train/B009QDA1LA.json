The grub screw for holding the 2 horizontal members is a hole drilled in the metal with a nut tack welded on to it in two places and then the screw/bolt goes into that nut and pushes the two bars together. Not an elegant solution as the tack weld will snap clean off if you apply the slightest hint of too much pressure when tightening the bolt. Other than that once you have it secured to the frame and weight on top of it it will hold up pretty well",
