At first glance, I thought the fabric (\u201cmesh\u201d) might be too fine for that purpose, but it drained really well. Once it was drained, the smoothness of the fabric enabled the thick yogurt to be dumped out of the bag easily and cleanly. So much easier than trying to drain it through cheese cloth layers \u2013 and it\u2019s reusable. The size of this bag is a perfect fit to hang inside my 1/2 gallon juice pitcher while the yogurt is draining (with a few clothes pins to hold it up). It cleans easily and dries quickly too.",

However, it was my first time and I wasn't quite sure that I knew what I was doing:-) I've since made several batches of Almond Milk but used a commercial stainless steel strainer basket. Much quicker results and NO residue from the pulverized almonds.",

Which is also the best way to clean it.",

I don\u2019t like to keep for too many uses as I\u2019m concerned about the food trapped in the seams. It may just be color from the veggies, but I can\u2019t tell.

With this nut bag, it actually filtered all the beans and allows me to have a good smooth soymilk texture. Overall, this is a must buy if you want smooth and healthy nut drinks. Pro: filters all the beans to leave a clean drink Con: may get hot when you pour hot liquids in the bag, but that's expected.",

      "text": "Awesome product overall. I love that it's a 2-pack, so I've always kept one back strictly for coconut and the other for almonds, cashews etc. I've really come to love making my own nut milk at home! This was my second order, so you know I liked them! Would have given 5 stars with exception of one tiny thing. I know I squeeze hard to get as much liquid as possible out. I would recommend just reinforcing the seams a little bit more. Small portion of one of the bags started to come apart. I still use it, but am very careful how I apply pressure to the bag when squeezing.",
