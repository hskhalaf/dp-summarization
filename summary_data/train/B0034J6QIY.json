I finally purchased it for our office (about 8 people), and after almost a month of use, I can safely say that this is a GREAT machine at an incredible price. It starts at 8:30 AM and runs non-stop until 5 to 5:30 pm every day! It does the job with no issues or difficulties. It easily outperforms the Keurig one I have at home. I am VERY happy with it and highly recommend this item.",

I have to return it. So frustrated. Amazon makes getting it replaced so easy that I will keep going until I get a good one. It is way better than the Keurig.",

It's too late to return to seller so I will explore options with the manufacturer. This is my last K-cup brewer. Love the convenience but tired of spending so much money on something that doesn't last. It's back to \"old fashioned\" brewing for me.",

Got burned twice with the same machine.",

I deducted 1 star because I have had a few cups of coffee with a lot of grounds at the bottom, which never happened with my older Keurig machines. It does take up quite a bit of counter space compared to other single serve Brewers, so probably not ideal for smaller kitchens. Still really like this Cuisinart very much though.",
