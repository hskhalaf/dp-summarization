As soon as I started them on this cat food, they immediately stopped vomiting and the only vomited once in a while which is much better. I was using hills science diet, prescription, for sensitive stomach/skin which one cat has a sensitive stomach and the other has sensitive skin, and yet the vomiting still continued. Both have been helped by this cat food and their stool is much better as well. Highly recommend and is cheaper by half.",
