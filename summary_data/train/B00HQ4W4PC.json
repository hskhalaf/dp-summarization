I have learnt just to ignore the error message. My only real complaint is that it does not have the right focal length for great macros.",

Between this lens and my Tokina Ultra Wide, I think I got some really great shots. Seller was accurate in his description and quick on delivery. The lens was packaged REALLY well.

With another lens, any of these issues could be a real problem, or sink it. With this little Nikon though, they're really just not a problem. The only \"problem\" you'll have, is carrying around a more expensive, bulkier lens that doesn't get any better an image that this one provides. The Nikon AF-S dx 18-55mm f3.5-5.6G VR II lens is a good buy, is very hardy, and produces very good quality images. It earns the right to belong in everyones camera bag.",

I thought this would make a good compact travel lens based on very positive image quality reviews on photo sites, but the image quality is in no way acceptable by today's standards on a 24 megapixel camera. I was so disappointed I returned the lens and decided not to try another copy. I would recommend the Nikon 18-140 or a used Nikon 18-105 instead.",

Maybe a perfect zoom range for a walking-around lens, and gives you much more flexibility over just using the (really excellent) 35mm prime G lens. Focuses quickly. I like the lock for transport, but it will keep you from using any type of rubber band or other grip on the focus ring, if you like to focus manually, like I do. Overall, quite a bargain lens.",

      "text": "Light and compact. The focal range is appropriate to the Nikon 1 series 1\" sensor. Auto focus is really fast to the extent you hardly notice it. It's hard to say much about the image quality as the V1 I own is the limiting factor. It will be interesting to see DxOMark results when this is lens is paired up with the V3.",

I had to give it only 4 stars because for the price you would think your getting a NEW lens, but in fact it is actually refurbished. Very miss leading by Cameta Camera. The price of this product seems to change every few days. I've seen it go from $98 to $247... for somewhere in the middle you can buy a brand new lens from a Nikon dealer and enjoy the full 5 year warranty instead of a 90 day limited warranty.",

The AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II is the most compact, advanced version of the 18-55mm lens yet. A new retractable barrel design inspired by the Nikon 1 system makes it approx. 25% smaller and lighter than its predecessors, and the latest Vibration Reduction technology provides 4.0* stops of blur-free handheld shooting.

This value is achieved when DX-format compatible lenses are attached to a DX-format digital SLR camera and zoom lenses are set at the maximum telephoto position.\n\n\n\nSUPPLIED ACCESSORIES\n * LC-52 Snap-on Front Lens Cap 52mm\n * LF-4 Rear Lens Cap",
