She is so much more comfortable now. She does scratch a little every now and then, but I suspect that has to do with her sneaking the cats' food when she can get away with it.

I added a little bit of this to his homemade food and by the third day he was so violently sick he couldn't walk, could barely breathe and wouldn't eat or drink anything (which is incredibly rare for him). This wasn't like a little stomach upset - I thought I was going to have to put him down. Maybe this is a match for others but this food is clearly not as natural as they claim it is - DO NOT BUY if your dog isn't used to eating chemicals and crap.",
