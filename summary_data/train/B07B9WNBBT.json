You also have to purchase their monthly cloud service otherwise you cannot access and download any of the recorded footage. Thus, the cameras are useless without a monthly subscription. As much as I am opposed to nickel-and-dime business models, I was fine with the aforementioned until I realized that the camera was not recording consistently. On any given day, it would be offline for like 20 hours. I spent weeks troubleshooting this issue with Netvue customer support reps and then...voila! It stopped working. In short words: Really horrible camera, really horrible customer service.",

The motion detection (which I believe is the most important aspect of a security camera) is atrocious. I have the sensitivity set as low as possible, yet I get at least 20 to 30 false notifications a day.

The night vision is not as clear as it was the first day it was installed. You can barely see anything unless a car with headlights passes through. 2. The camera turns on and off randomly and thus, does not allow me to view the footage remotely. Other than this, the product is pretty great for the money. Thank you, Rehnuma",

Completely unacceptable for my application. Thing is, it's got to be a very simple software fix to disable the IR lights whenever \"Always Day\" is selected. Why the manufacturer still has not made this change defies reasonable explanation. The other cameras I use (such as Wyse), support disabling the IR lights at night. I will be returning the camera.",

It\u2019s just clear that whoever designed this never tried to mount it in a real environment.",

However motion sensitivity continues to be a constant challenge as well as an app update that took my unit down for over a week on my Android phone.. The customer service has been ok. Just to much work in having to adjust motion sensitivity constantly.. The good news is I purchased as a test unit and now will probably try a different manufacturer as I increase my number of cameras. Another note. Received an app update yesterday. Had to reboot the camera (again). Also, I do like the 128Gb memory card capability. Motion detection control is the big issue.",

Also, night vision is sub-par for moving objects. When motion detection captures people walking along our front path they are blurred. During the day it is much better.",
