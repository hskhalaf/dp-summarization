Same tab is cast too short and won\"t stay seated. Too much trouble to wait for another replacement. Back to Walmart for another onion chopper. Tossed this one.",

      "text": "This is great for cubing tofu for frying - 1/2 inch size is just right for adding to recipes. Not great with sweet potato as it takes too much effort to push through even when sliced down to a manageable size. Good with garlic and onions but clean up is not as easy due to sticking in the blades and in the base - soaking helps. Generally, if I only need a few garlic cloves rough copped it's quicker by hand. I tend to use this when there's lots to chop so makes clean-up time worth it. Overall, I'm glad to have this when I need uniform dice or a lot of little stuff needs processing.",
