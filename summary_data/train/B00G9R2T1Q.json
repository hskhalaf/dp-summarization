My main issue with the two I have owned is Callaway's solution to typical velcro does not have the durability of velcro. Over a few rounds (in the heat of summer I alternate gloves each hole so I am using the latching more often than some) the top flap becomes \"frayed\" and no longer latches properly so now when I hit the ball there is a 50/50 the glove comes unlatched. I think this is a problem with all Callaway gloves of this generation.",

Not only are these made from the same cabretta leather as the Sta-Softs, they are cheaper and fit better than Weather-Soft as well! Also, the durability of the glove is top notch. I bought 4 gloves and have been using a rotation of 3 for the last 2 months. Even when they are old and beat up, they remain soft, they fit well, and they have grip. I will continue to use this product until further notice.",

I've made direct comparisons to cheaper and more expensive gloves and none outlasts the Dawn Patrol. I play in North Texas and May-Oct it's HOT. Even on the hottest day, DP stays usable, even when soaked with sweat. Most other gloves will stay usable for four or five holes in that weather and then they get wet and slippery, but I get away with using two gloves per round with the Dawn Patrol. It's just another thing I don't have to worry about during my round. Highly recommend these golf gloves.",
