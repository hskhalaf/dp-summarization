      "text": "I'v had this wallet for almost 8 months now and it still looks new. The material is waterproof and sturdy so it is holding up reaelly well with no signs of wear. The best part of this wallet is that it holds all of my cards, I can see them, and get easy access to them. The zippered compartments are large enough to hold receipts, biz cards, and bills if they are folded. The only negative is that I wish that there was a change compartment on the back so I could keep coins separate from everything else. Overall worth the price, would buy others in different colors.",

      "text": "I had high expectations for this travel wallet, as I travel frequently. Here are the two biggest problems I encountered over the past two weeks with this product. 1. It opens completely; there is no way to open just one side. When it is open, it exposes every card in the inserts. There is no privacy from prying eyes. 2.It is 13.5\" long when open, and the slots are vertical, not horizontal, so the entire wallet must be opened every time. It takes up a lot of counter space. I am going to have to return it because I require more privacy than this wallet affords. P.S. The snaps and zippers worked fine.",

This is a very slim solution that holds unfolded paper cash in one zipper compartment and coins in the other. Inside, I use one side of card holders for ID & rewards cards and the other for credit cards. It\u2019s a very handy & secure solution that is very portable if needed. It\u2019s also very well-made (my year-old wallet was chipping at the corners & was beginning to look bad). Highly recommend this one!",

The material is more plastic-y than synthetic leather, the zippers aren't the highest quality, and you need to measure the purse you intend to carry it in, as it is quite long. But it's a great solution at a really reasonable price (I got it for $11.19 on a Lightning Deal), and I highly recommend it.",

      "text": "I love this wallet. It fits all my credit cards and has room for my rewards cards too. The side pockets are big enough where you can fit cash on either side without having to fold it. Bonus win for me! This wallet is light weight and slim, taking up the least amount of space in my purse. I think I need a new sunglass case now since that's the largest thing in my purse after my new wallet was added. Very convenient plus the snap closure on both sides is very secure. Comes in variety of colors, I choose black and love it. Doesn't bleed and doesn't feel cheap at all. Highly recommend.",
