      "text": "Bought this desk pad to cover a big scratch on my IKEA desk and I love it. I got the 35.4\" x 17\" size which I recommend if you have a larger size desk. It's a very comfortable and non-slip surface on the top. The pink one is not a bright pink, it's a deeper blush pink. It does move around on the desk a little bit, so what I did is put some tape under it so it wouldn't slide around. All in all, I love this desk pad for both appearance and functionality.",

Also has a strap to hold the mat together rolled up to use if you want to travel with the mat. Have no negatives. My photos don't pick up the color well but it is just as pictured.

It has a very subtle texture that does not prevent writing notes/checks/etc directly on the pad. I've placed a few vinyl stickers on the mat using a vinyl cutter to add some personal flavor, and there is no issues with them adhering. My only recommendation would be that if you are used to a slightly softer mouse pad, look into a wrist wrest or similar. After 1 week, I can definitely tell a difference from the harder desk mat from the softer mouse pad.",

There are 2 sides to it, with one side being darker and the other this very shiny penny look. The mat comes curled up so it takes a few days for it to flatten out, there was not much smell either to air out. Cannot complain, and I bought 2 more for my inlaws as a gift so that they could cover another surface. Questions sent to seller were answered quite promptly. So far so good!",

It's super easy to clean, and is very useful since I tend to get a little wild with my mouse and a normal mousepad is wayyy too small. Only regret is that I got both in pink. One pad sits on a normal plastic desk and is fine, however the other sits on a wood desk and it does slide a little - might put a couple wash cloths underneath to hold it in place. I would buy again as a gift.",

The only complaint I have is the strap put around the rolled up pad is too small. I found it impossible to roll it up tight enough to attach the strap, and it makes sense why it was loose in the box and not already on. This is a very small complaint, as I will likely never need to move the pad from my desk and will likely lose the strap anyways. Thank you, and have a wonderful day!",

The first one I ordered was a mint green color and then I decided when they came out with a lavender keyboard that I was going to get the lavender one and it\u2019s perfect color is more on the mall side than lavender though but it\u2019s purple so I\u2019m good. You may have to flatten it out a little bit before you use it but it works very well",

They are fairly thin but that is what i was looking for. Soft to the touch and didnt have an odor like some similar products i have had.",

Other than that, it's a nice wide size, it's a slightly metallic silver on the bottom, and it wipes clean easily.
