I was honestly concerned.. but took a chance.. the other one kinda comparable...\"banana\" I think.. had hard shiny plastic tires and tire reviews were terrible... slick on grass and gravel.. and the handle bars seemed oddly angled.. These tires on the strider bike are fine! And the handle bars look great .. And it was perfect height for our 18 month old who is not on the tall end of the spectrum, lol. We dig this bike! Glad we bought it!! Vroom vroom :)",

One day one of her friends dads stopped by and dropped off their strider. In 2 days our daughter switched to her 2 wheeler and was riding great! That same strider bike got passed around to about a dozen of their friends and taught them all to ride in a couple days to 2 weeks. They are pretty expensive for something you don\u2019t really need very long so get together with a group and get one to pass around. Once they can ride there is no reason to keep them on it.",

It\u2019s amazing how quick he can get going and I can see his confidence growing each time he rides it. I feel like it gives him the necessary skills to be able to ride a bike with pedals (like balance and steering) so he can concentrate on pedaling when that time comes, as opposed to worrying about if someone is holding on to the bike, pedaling, learning to balance and steer all in one go. I\u2019m a huge fan!!",

Any kids that visit our house are always intrigued by the strider bike. I would recommend for any child boy or girl from walking through preschool.",

    "title": "Strider - 12 Classic Balance Bike, Ages 18 Months to 3 Years",
    "description": "While the industry typically uses \"entry-level\" as shorthand for a non-race bike, we can assert with comfort and confidence that the custom grips, saddles, and other features that set Strider's lighter, more expensive models apart from the \"entry-level\" 12 Classic Balance Bike probably won't be missed. The 12 Classic is designed for aspiring cyclists from 18 months to 3 years of age, providing a platform to transition from striding to coasting in order to learn the balance and handling skills necessary for eventually piloting a proper bicycle. The balance bike's sturdy frame is rounded off with flat-free tires, an adjustable seatpost, footrests for gliding, and brake mounts so that -- as the young rider's coasting skills increase -- a rear brake can be added to keep things in check.",
