I packed four days worth of clothes, a toiletry bag and a small purse without overstuffing it. The one drawback I will mention is that, though it fits in the allotted space under the seat, it juts out lengthwise far enough to significantly reduce leg/foot room. It was worth it for me because I\u2019m short and was able to rest my feet on top of the bag. Somebody taller might find it uncomfortable.",

American Tourister should be ashamed of themselves for selling such a poor quality product. At one time, this company was well-known and trusted for its good quality merchandise, so I feel deeply disappointed and, frankly, cheated. My last suitcase easily weathered ten years of international flights, and still looks and performs great. This one couldn\u2019t make it once to Texas and back to Seattle!",

It is too big for Alaska Airlines' size limits for use as a carry on. At 23\" X 14.25 X 11, the actual dimensions exceed those allowed (22\" X 14\" X 9\"). So according to Alaska's Customer Care department, it would be allowed only as checked luggage at their usual fee. It makes me wonder if American Tourister has mis-stated the dimensions for all of their alleged \"carry-on\" bags. Very disappointing.",

The advantage of this over some soft bag is that this was designed just to meet the two carriers limits and in theory, you can pack the maximum amount as any other bag will be a little shorter or not as wide as the absolute maximum allowed (so one extra pair of socks?!!).",

I have seen people with carry-ons that were bigger on American, and I was always resentful that I paid to check my bag while the attendants were just taking theirs for free to check. So, I don't anticipate any problems. I occasionally fly Allegiant, and that is a bit of a concern with the size though.",

I just had to wash my clothes twice for an 8 day trip. Not bad. I didn't have to worry about my luggage arriving to the destination on time and it ultimately saved me money on the airfare. I'm SUPER HAPPY with it.",
