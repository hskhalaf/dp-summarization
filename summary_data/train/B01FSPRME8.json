I use a lot of cast iron myself, and these are just as good as the rest of them. Would be awesome set for camping. They come preoiled, but know better to remove and season. I helped him learn how to do that, plus how to clean (No soap) them. Save your kitchen rags for cleaning, and get some Silicone handles.This set should last a lifetime if taken cared of.",

This set comes with three different sizes, the smallest of which would be perfect for baking a large chocolate chip skillet cookie, or for single servings of fried eggs. The downside is that these pre-seasoned skillets are rough, and need re-seasoning. Once you go through that process, they are worth the price. So put a little elbow grease into it, and you won't be disappointed. Do not trust the factory seasoning to be non-stick!",

This set meets those qualities, and isn\u2019t intimidating or difficult to get started with as a beginner. The size variety is great so you can use it with different ingredients/recipes.
