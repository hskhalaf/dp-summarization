If you need one for a few days the rental cost will probably be more than purchasing this. Buy it! Also, digging holes in South Carolina clay is no fun.

In the past, I had used an iron rod and manually would break the concrete around these old posts. My back would hurt for days afterwards. This jack hammer made the job extremely easy and simple. I would definitely recommend it. However, beware that it is a bit on the heavy side (about 35 - 40 pounds). Also, the key is to simply let the weight of the device do the work (i.e. do not try to press downward on it when it is running). I was able to break each block in about 15 seconds.",

June 2017 The company paid for me to send it back to them and very quickly sent me a new one at their expense.

Used it for about two months with absolutely no issues. Comes with the hard case, gloves, 15ft cord, two bits, bit oil and spare brushes. Addition bits and accessories are available. This was the best investment I've made on any DIY project! BTW - neighbors are glad the project is complete - it does make some noise and hearing protection is recommended.",

      "text": "Wow, this thing was terrible. The jackhammer part didn't jack, or hammer. It just vibrated. I bought this to dig holes for planting in AZ, very hard ground. It doesn't work. When I read the trouble shooting guide it states (not exact words) \"if you are hammering in soil it will only vibrate, this is normal ops\"...what???? I bought a jack hammer for the purpose of a jack hammer, if I wanted a vibrator I'd go elsewhere. Used it for 10 minutes, kept on trying, it would hammer for a second or 2 then vibrate. I will say that when the hammer did actually engage, it worked fantastic. So very disappointed in this. Will shop for another.",
