Such as a shame as I had heard good things about these headphones. I called amazon and they were good enough to provide a refund over the phone. I will not buy these headphones again as if they demonstrated the clear weakness in the cable after just minutes of use, it would indicate a deficiency that would likely occur at some point in the future with a new set.",

I used my studio headphones and monitors to mix my own music and use these primarily to reference the mix and its always pretty much spot on. Take it from someone who makes music... these are good and inexpensive.",

      "text": "The earphones failed after seven months of one hour daily use. I do not listen to music but only podcasts so these $30 earphones were just fine. The company sent a new one under their three year warranty -- and didn't want the other one back -- in a few days. So, yes it probably failed too soon. But for the cost and their great service, I'm not unhappy.",

I usually spent lot money on headphones but I keep losing them in the subway =p After some research I found those RHA MA390 U. At this price I didn't expected anything amazing but the reviews are good so I gave a shop and I have no regrets. This sound is clear and they're offering good bass. So far I found those earbuds very comfortable.",
