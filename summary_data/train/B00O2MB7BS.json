We had an appliance repairman try to fix it and the damage is beyond repair. This was a huge waste of our money.

The Danby has a lot of usable interior space, with tempered glass/clear plastic shelves. It easily fits a week's worth of my cooked lunches and dinners, with room to spare. The temperature is somewhat adjustable. The one drawback-- though not enough to warrant any form of rating demerit-- is the door column for chilling cans. I do not purchase many cans, and the inability to reconfigure that space means it will not be substantially used.",
