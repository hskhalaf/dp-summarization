I have tried with potatoes, butternut squash, cucumbers. The cubing option is very poor. especially since the part left over in the slicer is too big and it only cubes about half of what needs to be cubed. The rest, must be cubed the traditional way with a knife. I wish I had tried it right after I had bought it. It does not seem to give me the option to sent it back. DO NOT BUY IT!",

The vertical blades are too dull to cut tomatoes and even the main horizontal blade is not very sharp. My 24 year old, beat up Borner mandolin cutter is sharper than my brand new PL8. One major design flaw is the vertical blades are too steep of an angle to cut - they should have a more gradual incline. Another problem is that you need to lift up the veggie over the vertical blade on the return, otherwise it mangles the food. Overall I'm quite disappointed.",

You can't use this slicer with your bare hand, and if something is gamed in the knives - be very careful removing. So this devices is completely not fit to cut any vegetables as it's designed.",
