I expreienced no substancial connection drops. CONS: I experienced audio synchronization issues with my phone even after troubleshooting. The biggest issue for me is the company decided to change the \"earstrap sizes.\" Zolo Liberty had the right lengths to stay fastened to my ear during any activity. Zolo Liberty + doesn't. The decreased earstrap sizes I feel are a problem that can't really be fixed because any 3rd party \"straps\" will most likely effect how the earphone charges (the charging area is a tight space).",

My main issue with the headphones is that the battery kept steadily declining to the point that they are unusable. The battery nowadays lasts around 20 minutes. Not enough time for a full workout. At an original price tag of $150 I expected the headphones to at least be usable for 2 years. I'm very disappointed by these headphones.",
