Some found the shoe comfortable and supportive for a variety of training activities, while others disfavored it for being too stiff and rigid. The size and fit were right for some wearers, yet it ran too small and narrow for the majority. Many reviewers also took a dim view of the burrito tongue construction. Overall, the trainer wasn\u2019t able to meet the needs of most training enthusiasts, but it still worked well for some of the buyers.",

I think I have wide feet and I did not have any trouble getting my foot into the shoe. Based on the reviews I almost didn't order these! Under armour support recommended them to me based on what I needed out of my shoe! I have tried on 5 other UA training shoes and these were my favorite! I won't run or lift in these shoes so I can't say if they will be great for that. In my opinion they ran true to size.",
