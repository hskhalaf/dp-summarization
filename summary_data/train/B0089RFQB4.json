They didn't even double stitch the visible stitch in the bags. After playing with them for 5 minutes one seam split completely open. We were camping and thankfully I had a sewing kit with me and was able to sew them back together. See picture, I added the black stitches because the original orange stitching came out about 2 inches and would have continued to split open if it had not been mended. My set was made in Thailand. For the price these should be much better constructed!",

Another great thing is that the filling will not break down like corn does with excessive use.

      "text": "The bags are constructed of high quality material and play very good after a few rounds of play to break in the canvas. More than the high quality of the bags is the even higher quality customer service. The set of grey bags I got were a little on the light side and when I informed SC Cornhole they immediately sent out a new set that were better in color. They are very responsive, understanding, and willing to work with their customers to ensure customer satisfaction. Highly recommend this company and I will always purchase my corn bags from them!",

      "text": "The bags are durable and look good but they have a very thick and heavy stitch on the end that was closed. If a bag is thrown and it lands or slides onto the hole it it will often sit right over the hole. Even hitting the original bag with additional throws isn't always enough to knock the bags in. They work but I probably wouldn't buy these again.",

At this point, its not worth going through the trouble to send them back. Overall seems to be good bags but haven't actually played with them yet.",

    "description": "The Weather Resistant Cornhole Bags by SC Cornhole Games was developed over 10 years ago after some players were asking for an alternative to the traditional corn hole bags filled with feed corn. Players complained of mice getting into their cornhole bags, mold developing if they happened to get wet, and the corn breaking down over time to the point where the corn hole bags were a fraction of the original weight. To address the problem, we came up with a blend of recycled plastic to mimic the feel of a traditional cornhole bean bag while addressing all the shortcomings! The bags are 6x6\u201d, made with a durable 12 ounce duck canvas, and filled with 14-16 ounces of plastic filling. The result? A bag that plays like a \u201cregulation\u201d bag, but lasts MUCH longer! From the moment this product was introduced to the market, it became our most popular seller! Be careful though, there are many imitations of our product but none of them have the official SC Cornhole Games marking, durability, and 1-year guaranty! Those things are only available when you purchase directly through SC Cornhole Games.",
