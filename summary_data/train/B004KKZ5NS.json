My second pair feels much more comfortable, I do notice the snug fit around both my ankles but they\u2019re not cutting into me like the first pair. They\u2019re warm and water resistant, which in the Midwest is a must. Wearing warm socks with these shoes will definitely keep you toasty.

I mean at a shoe store I would have given the 10 back and gotten the 9.5 and headed home. Well anyhow they did feel warm and the sole has material to keep that area from getting cold.

They were the right length, but the width was too broad in the back. Almost felt like they should have been labeled Wide. This is more of a personal fit issue than a recrimination of the shoe's design or build quality, which seemed to be pretty solid. I was not able to find these shoes in a local shop due to limited inventory (online too), which led to 2 returned pair online, unfortunately.",

The only issue I have is that I am a auto mechanic. I work on the floor under cars on a creeper and on my side a lot. With my foot on its side it tends to drag and unfortunately tears the stitching which of course sucks. They do last me about a year. I wish I could get them double stitched so hopefully this will not happen. I just ordered another pair. I may try to find a place that can double the stitching.",

And they aren't nearly as warm as my old North Face shoes. Sadly they don't make the same ones anymore, so I opted for the Keen version hoping the reviews would help sway me. All in all, WAYY too over-priced for shoes that don't fit well, and don't keep your feet warm in colder weather (as described). I would search elsewhere.",

Of course, in deep enough snow I have to switch over to boots. My only request is that they add a little \"grabber\" on the heal to put them on easier. I like them fairly snug so I don't get snow down in them.",

At least the shoes were very comfortable and over all quality was decent for the price, this pair not so, its almost like a cheap pair of payless shoes, they suck.....",
