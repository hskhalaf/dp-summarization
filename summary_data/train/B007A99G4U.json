Also a shoulder strap which comes very handy! If this review was helpful please let me know by clicking the \u201cHelpful\u201d button below the review.",

Then for the fourth game it wouldn't work at all, and still it does not work at all. Highly disappointed.",

I like how you can either sling the megaphone and use the handheld mic, or latch the mic bullhorn and use the trigger like a regular bullhorn. Between events I moved the selector switch to 'OFF' because when it's set to 'TALK' there's some noise while not in use. Noticed the rubber guard around the edge of the cone was slightly torn at the bottom. Not sure if that was there out of the box or after the event. Has no impact on operation.",

Quality is not fantastic.....I was trying to open the battery door to add the initial set of batteries, and a small black plastic retainer clip broke off. This is within 5 minutes of me unboxing the unit. However the battery door retention clip seems to stay closed ok, even without this little plastic clip. Time will tell if it actually holds up. But so far, so good! I cannot comment on battery life yet, but may add an update after having gone through a few sets.",

It comes with the ability to speak into the microphone while it's attached or like a police officer into their radio. The aux cord is useful and universal. These do take C batteries some of the other versions by Pyle take D batteries.",
