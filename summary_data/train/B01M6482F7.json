The headset works very well and I love that my husband who is wheelchair bound is not tied to his computer if he wants to take a break. Thank you so much for helping me to give my husband a little more freedom. It's really a big deal to us! Also I was especially blessed that the owner took personal time for a phone call to check and make sure the headset was a good fit and met our expectations. Personal good customer service is so rare these days ! Thanks again---- Julie N.",

A couple things keep me from giving it 5 stars: The Mute button should be easier to differentiate from the volume controls. And the mic boom should offer some flex, rather than rotation only. These are relatively minor things which can be improved in future versions. You should get the Handset Lifter, you'll be glad you did. Customer service is excellent and the reps are very knowledgeable and helpful. Give Headsets.com a call and get your questions answered. Then buy this headset.",

They sent a prepaid label to send the defective one back and are sending out a replacement right away. I would definitely buy more of these as our old Jabra units start to fail and as our company grows.",

They also work fantastic on our computers through the USB connection...which is awesome for the number of Zoom meetings we're having these days. The sound quality is exceptional on both ends. I never feel like I'm yelling, and I'm never struggling to hear anyone. The sound cancellation between speaking and listening is completely unnoticeable. The range is also incredible. I've been 100' away from the base, with walls in between, and never lost a signal.",

This was a Godsend since my rep (Raghu) was delightful and got me set up right away without having to read instructions and do it myself. Beautiful process, especially for someone a bit technologically challenged. If only all companies offered this type of service.",

However what really got me was the customer support (card inside the box tells you to call for any reason). While easy to set up, I just wanted to know everything sounded good and they helped me every step. After a short time, I decided I liked this headset so much I would exchange for the next model up, so I could use with my Bluetooth phone in addition to my computer and desktop phone. I couldn't be more happy.... Both are great !",

You can adjust it in and out and can bend it to fit your head better. You can also bend the microphone arm to move it closer to or further away from your mouth. A very solid and sturdy product and much less expensive than other brands.",
