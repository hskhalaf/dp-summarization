Seriously, it was easily cutting through a log when it just stopped mid-cut and no joy from that point on. I purchased it through Amazon and no option to return it is available. I bought it in September, used it for a grand total of about 20 hours and now it's useless. It was working perfectly before this happened.",

      "text": "This chainsaw is awesome. I needed to purchase a saw to clear some fallen eucalyptus trees on the MIL\u2019s property. I was researching gas saws when I came across the Greenworks saw. Based on the large amount of positive reviews, I bought the saw and a second battery (Shentec 5ah). I absolutely love this thing. It cuts as well as any gas saw I\u2019ve used in the past...just keep the chain sharp (duh) and it will be a delightful saw to use. Like others have said, it does leak oil. That is a downfall, but bar oil is cheap and I keep it in the shed, so who cares about a little spilled oil?",

      "text": "I was skeptical...especially when the saw blade bounced lightly on top of the first log I cut...then with a little pressure it really went to work. It is light and requires you to push but it cuts great for the type of jobs I need it for. The log in the pics took 1.5 batteries. You want another battery...I went with the cheapest one I could find on Amazon. This thing is so much easier than my gasoline chainsaw. I\u2019m very happy with this chainsaw!",

I know it could do even thicker. Have not changed or sharpened the chain yet. Chain has not come off while cutting. Easy to tighten when it does come loose. So much quieter than a gas powered chain saw. No issues with oil leaking. I will never go back to gas. So much easier to use and maintain. Battery will easily last at least an hour. Very happy with the power. Totally recommend this product for any home owner.",

I still have two bars of battery left, and I cut that branch into a dozen pieces, plus trimmed it. Quiet, surprisingly long battery life and impressive power. Hmm, I see they have numerous other gizmos that work ont he same battery pack too.",

It also had fallen into two other smaller trees and had bent them over into the road. I used my Greenworks pole saw to clear the smaller trees up high and my Greenworks chain saw to cut up the big tree so I could move it. The best part was the saws started right up. I HATE pulling on a two stroke engine that won't start. The batteries last a long time and are easy to charge. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.",

I used this on pine and maple thus far - so it works alright on soft and hard woods.",
