Or your foot goes into the front tire. Turned a 4 star product to a 2 or less because what am I supposed to do now? Stop buying stuff I haven't seen in person I guess. There used to be a review that said this also but it was removed, so when I shopped again I didn't remember it was for this item. Sketchy",

      "text": "I love this bike I use it everyday it is great because it won't slip on anything! Easiest bike I have owned to ride on a beach. The bike is not a speedster but speed is not what it is designed for. The wide tires create more rolling resistance than a narrow tire bike and it weighs about 40 pounds. However, it is very durable and was easy to assemble out of the box. I did change the seat to a more comfortable one. Overall, a great bike and fun to ride.",

They told me these are junk. I paid them to try and get the brakes not to grind. They told me the discs are warped on the brand new bike but they did the best they could. Also the gears didn't change smoothly, so I added a different gear switcher and it's better. Even though the bike shop worked on it, occasionally the gears still grind when I'm pedaling and I can see that the part is bent.",

Also you really can't beat the reasonable pricing of this bike. Most others sell for close to $700. It only cost me $40 at my local bike shop for them to install the rapid fire gear shifter.",

I found this one at a bit of a sale price, but was impressed that it included the features of the 7-speed derailleur and front and rear disk brakes. It came partially assembled and final assembly was very straight-forward. I gave the Comfort rating 4 stars because the bike is set up for more of a performance bike, like mountain biking. Not as comfortable for my wife as a cruiser. So I have invested in a different seat and handle bars. Now the bike is exactly what she wanted. Just got back from the beach, she rode it quite a bit and is very happy!",

Most people have much bigger bottoms than what this bikes seat accommodates. Fairly easy to assemble once you figure out the disk brakes. Still having to adjust those from time to time. If you think the thin tire bikes kick up water just wait for the soaking you get from these bad boys! All in All a very good purchase.",

You can go over curbs with the wide tires, through mud, etc. I live in Vegas and you can ride right across the open desert, over 2' high bushes, rocks, though water and even snow. The only con is that the bike is heavy (about 60 lbs) so you are pushing around that extra weight but my calves sure look more muscular than before! It does attract a lot of attention from people so I have a heavy duty chain lock and a strong U-lock to keep it safe-",
