      "text": "I am not a gamer, so no comment on that. Mainly this is a monitor stripped off the extra features to save the cost. Things were taken away: 1. Speakers 2. Type-C connection 3. USB hub If you do not need the above, go for it. Another minor thing, the windows 10 driver shows it is a generic monitor, not true monitor name / model. Compared to the 34\" ViewSonic XG, the weak-up time is much faster, the control system is better. I use this one to pair with the Dell U3011, like it.",

I picked this one over the dells' just because the spec says it is 75 Hertz. Also, the user CD comes with the product has virus which infected my PC. Buyer should be aware of that!",

This one has a little higher pixel count, and it shows. It's a gorgeous crisp screen, and I love it! The colors pop, and despite staring at the screen 8 plus hours a day, no eye strain due to the detailed picture it produces.",

Great work (instead of a dual-screen setup) and work well for casual gaming, definitely an upgrade from my Dell Ultrasharp 27\". My only gripe is that the Dell monitor seems to have a better anti-glare film (more smooth with less freckly effect) but on the LG it's a bit noticeable at a close viewing distance.",

The size is just right to see most of it without turning the head too much and sharpness is excellent, big difference comparing to the other 4k screen that I use next to it.",

Yes 60 to 75 is not the end of the world, but its more about the concept behind the misleading info for such an expensive item. Frustrating!",
