The book does a great job of giving the reader a broad overview of computing concepts ranging from time complexity to databases to memory management. It\u2019s a great reference for anyone who wants to expand his/her/their horizons beyond their immediate field of expertise. I found the book easy and fun to read. Also I discovered some concepts that I\u2019d like to explore further. I\u2019d recommend this book to anyone who has gotten into programming from a non-sc background.",

The databases chapter was more advanced than the rest of the book, so I skimmed it, but I\u2019ll come back to it later after some more learning.
