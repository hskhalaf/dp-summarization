I love how there are many sizes which allows for a more custom fit. Trying on standard helmets, my very tall 7 yo was too big for youth size, yet the adult was way too loose. I got the small which is perfect for her with a some room to grow and little wobble. Her teammates are jealous of her purple helmet with pink face mask!",
