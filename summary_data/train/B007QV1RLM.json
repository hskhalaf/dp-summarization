The hose lock while spooling out or in is very hit or miss and just today I noticed that there's an air leak inside the reel somewhere. I only bought this in February and it's only seen very limited use in a woodworking shop that's generally kept clean and organized. I'll have to keep it disconnected when not actually in use going forward and try to locate the leak and repair. Disappointing, but it is what it is.

There is a wipe-on lubrication provided with the hose that helps the problem, but requires a consistent application (every month or so) to keep it working well.

      "text": "Works quite well. The hose really is light and flexible. It does get dirty easily, being neon and made with that matte material. And as other users have posted, the spring mechanism isn't the most durable. It recoils most of the time without issue, but sometimes, you have to really extend it again and return guiding it to have the whole hose make it back into the reel. Seems to work ok so far but will report back if it shows any real wear or completely dies. Not bad given the price.",
