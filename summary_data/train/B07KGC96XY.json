Now this roller will not contour your face into looking like Christy Turlington or anything, but it certainly does work and you definitely notice a difference in your face when doing a side by side differ of Rolling it on one side of the face. And it feels good on the skin and doesn\u2019t crack and squeak like so many other ones I have read that do.",
