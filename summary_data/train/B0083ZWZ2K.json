I used a wooden dowel from Michaels to replace it just to see if the pen was still good. After I assembled it was so weak. If anything more than 15 lbs ran at it the structure would be unstable. I don't trust this pen to hold my dog while I'm not at home. I'm going to try the square pen they have and see if it's anymore stable. I chose this brand after a lot of research so I'm really hoping their other product is higher in stability.",

I love the color, and the fact that it can't rust, but the poles that hold it together come apart very easily and the top caps that keep the metal covered come off frequently.

But, that annoyance was a onetime thing, and now I have the perfect playpen for my puppy. He\u2019s a Maltipoo and will stay small. Another customer complained about the caps on the connecting rods coming off, or being chewed off. Mine are firmly attached, so unless you\u2019ve got a serious chewer, or a larger dog that\u2019s bored, the caps aren\u2019t a problem in my opinion.",

A medium-sized dog could push it around and a large dog could topple it if they tried. Amazon ships this in it's original box.

She now has space for her bed, food, and puppy pads to be comfy during the day. Set up was easy but would be best done with two people. It is a little flimsy so I would not advise for a big or rambunctious dog. It is very well suited for small-medium low energy dogs. So far my dog loves it!",

I like how easy it is to break apart and assemble (literally took 5 minutes). We keep a 2 panel section out now to block off our stairs and our guy hasn't had any issue with it. For the price point, this beats any of the previous metal x-pen styles we've tried!",

It kind of slides around which I didn\u2019t mind because it still kept her from getting into stuff she isn\u2019t supposed to. We\u2019re at about 3 months with it now, my puppy is massive and just figured out how to escape",

      "text": "I ordered this pen for my 1 year old Golden Retriever. It's exactly what I was hoping for - the panels are very tall (he can't even stick his head over the top) so I know he will stay put/not be able to jump/climb out. The door is a little small/too weird for him, so I just don't use that panel. The panels are surprisingly lightweight, which makes for easy assembly. Overall, this was just what I was expecting so I am happy with it! The only downside is that I ordered it with Amazon Prime and it came a day late AND the box was open (luckily nothing was missing)",

For out side sod steaks or snip wire hangers to 4 in piece then bend in a u shape pound in grass a few will do it!",
