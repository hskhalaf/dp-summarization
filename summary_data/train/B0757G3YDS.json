It has been 100% waterproof. It's good quality. I bought this one after the AUDEW turned out to not be waterproof at all.",

It is sent to you vacuumed packed but once expanded you will struggle without success to store it back in the bag.

This was the worse designed piece of crap and I can\u2019t believe I wasted time with this. Do not try and save money and get a quality car cover that will save your car paint from scratches!! I have a brand new Subaru and if I can\u2019t buff out the scratches the manufacturer will be hearing from me soon!!",
