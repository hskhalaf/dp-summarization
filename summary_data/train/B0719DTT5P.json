They appreciated its lightweight design, its appealing looks, and its apparently capable components.

Literally unusable if you want to go for a jog wearing them. It's really weird because I have no problems with the left foot, but there is a slightly harder bump in the fabric(probably glue) right above my toenail which makes it really uncomfortable to run with those sneakers.",

They have too much room around the foot, also with these you feel the impact on the floor, such doesn't happen with the other Asics models I've had. Its like it doesn't even have gel. I bought these because it was on sale, now I wish I'd paid more for a proper pair of shoes.",
