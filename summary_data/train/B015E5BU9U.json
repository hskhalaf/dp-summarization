Only major fault is that it does not seem able to play avi files from usb stick without converting everything first. An irritating fault which Epson could easily sort, but for whatever reason have decided not to. I'm going to buy another projector for the living room, but due to this fault it will NOT be an Epson though. Shame really as otherwise its great.",

It's not too great with the curtains open on a sunny day though. The quick corner keystone setting makes it relatively easy to set up, even when I have it in the corner of the room and directed at the screen at an angle. Only 4 stars though because it doesn't have an audio out and the inbuilt speaker is a bit poor. In order to get better sound quality I either use a fire tv stick or pc to link to a bluetooth soundbar.",

The sharpness and brightness are excellent and the picture is large and impressive. Maybe four stars is a bit mean, - it is only because for me the picture let's it down when viewing video. Compared to a DLP projector at a similar price point the tonal representation in films falls short and the picture can lack depth, most noticeably in dark scenes. This is a well-documented feature of LCDs. On the other hand the lack of rainbow effect is a real plus and it looks great. At this price you can't expect everything.",

So far, we've tried it in twilight and the dark, in the summer house, behind the summer house, on the living room wall and the dining room ceiling.
