Disclaimer-I don't really care how accurate the calorie count is, that is not a feature I use. I also don't use the online tools that much.",

It's easy to catch the edge of the clasp on clothing and have it come undone. The Garmin Connect website where you sync your data a very unreliable, it's unresponsive many times during the day. On Nov. 2 it even lost 1.5 hrs of activity data. Have a look at the Garmin Connect website Facebook Page  to see posts about the problems people are having. The heart rate monitor works well.",

    "description": "FITNESS BAND THAT MOVES AT THE PACE OF YOUR LIFE\n * Learns your activity level and assigns a personalized daily goal\n * Displays steps, calories, distance; monitors sleep\n * Pairs with heart rate monitor\u00b9 for fitness activities\n * 1+ year battery life; water-resistant\u00b2\n * Save, plan and share progress at Garmin Connect\u2122\n\nYou already know the active steps you take now can improve your overall wellness today, tomorrow and well into your future. And while it seems simple to get out of that chair more often and move, making it stick is another matter. That\u2019s where v\u00edvofit can turn good intentions into lifelong habits. It\u2019s the only fitness band that greets you with a personalized daily goal, tracks your progress and reminds you when it\u2019s time to move.\n\nPERSONALIZED DAILY GOALS\nv\u00edvofit learns your current activity level, then assigns an attainable daily goal. As you meet your milestones, v\u00edvofit will adjust your goal for the next day, gradually nudging you toward a healthier lifestyle. At Garmin Connect\u2122, our free online fitness community, you can earn virtual badges and view your progress.\n\nTELLS TIME AND \"TIME TO MOVE\"\nResearch shows prolonged periods of inactivity such as sitting at a desk decreases your body\u2019s production of fat-burning enzymes. You can reverse that effect by taking frequent, short walk breaks throughout your day. And while you might lose track of time and forget to move, v\u00edvofit knows. A red move bar appears on the display after 1 hour of inactivity and builds when you\u2019ve been sitting too long. Just walk for a couple of minutes to reset the move bar.\n\nKEEP MOVING\nWhen you\u2019re ready to take the next steps toward better health, v\u00edvofit has additional features to keep you motivated. Use a heart rate monitor\u00b9 with v\u00edvofit to record your heart rate and zone data and get more accurate calorie burn information for any fitness activity, such as a run or a cardio class at the gym. At Garmin Connect, you can join online challenges with other v\u00edvofit users or start your own competition with friends to compete for virtual badges and bragging rights.\n\nALWAYS ON\nv\u00edvofit follows your progress 24/7, and it can stay on for more than a year without a battery change. Set the sleep mode when you go to bed and v\u00edvofit will monitor your rest. At Garmin Connect, you can see your total sleep hours as well as periods of movement and restful sleep. The v\u00edvofit band is water-resistant\u00b2, so you can shower or get caught in the rain, worry-free.\n\nGET CONNECTED\nWith the touch of one button, you can wirelessly sync v\u00edvofit with Garmin Connect to see a complete picture of your progress, join online challenges and earn virtual badges for extra motivation. You can access our free online community from your computer or on your compatible mobile device\u00b3 with the Garmin Connect\u2122 Mobile app.\n\nIN THE BOX\n\n * v\u00edvofit with large and small band\n * Heart rate monitor\n * USB ANT Stick\n * Quick Start Manual\n\n\u00b9Included with some models, sold separately on others.\n\n\u00b2Water-resistant (50 meters).\n\n\u00b3Includes Bluetooth\u00ae Smart Ready phones; contact your provider to verify if your phone is compatible.
