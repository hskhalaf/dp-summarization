Because of all the claims of (no alcohol, no chemicals, no this, no that), I thought I might be buying water in a spray bottle?!?! Nope ...whatever is in this stuff works! Give Calyptus a try. They already guarantee your satisfaction anyways!",

      "text": "Bought it because 1) I needed a screen cleaner that could clean both my computer monitor and my TV; 2) is eco-friendly (no harsh chemicals); and 3) was affordable. Received it today, and cleaned my monitor. It got all the dust (more than I thought, tho admittedly it's been a while since the last time I cleaned it), but there are 3 or 4 really small specs that the cleaner simply will not clean off the screen, even after a 2nd cleaning. No streaks, though ) Overall, I have mixed feelings about this stuff.",

If you need an electronics cleaner you need this! I really love that it came with two bottles and two microfiber cloths. The only small thing is the bottle is little hard to push sometimes. But no biggy!",
