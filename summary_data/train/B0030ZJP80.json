Foot ring is also much higher than normal drafting chairs.

Leather version didn't allow enough 'airflow' (obviously) and while the seat cushion hasn't worn out, it could use some more padding (none of the screws come through the seat though).

Although this is true, they are totally useless as arm rests for a person my height or anyone taller and I'm 5'8\". Your elbows just aren't down as low as the loop arm rests unless you are several inches shorter in the torso. Like 3+\" shorter. (Senior female review)",

Chalk that up to a combination of the plastic base, a not too caster friendly carpet, and my bulk. Still using the stool while I wait for a replacement. Just have to be careful not to lean back. ;) Only other issue I've encountered is a tendency for the cylinder release to slip and let the seat lower. The cylinder itself still works fine. Also worth noting, this product is rated at 275lbs. During the time I've used it, I've averaged closer to 300lbs. So it's met and exceeded expectations in that regard.",

My only question here is, I bought this chair here on amazon for the unbelievable low price of 87 dollars ...

From there, you need a screw driver to get in the back, and once you screw in the arms, you're all done. The chair is comfortable, it's versatile when it comes to adjustments, and it looks great.

      "text": "I bought this chair a few months ago and was so excited about it. I got it put it together before the end of the first day the circular piece fell off. I am not even sure how it was attached in the first place because it was so flimsy. I decided to try gluing it back together instead of dealing with the hassle of mailing it back. This worked fine. Today not even 6 months later, the arm on the chair just broke completely off. This purchase was very disappointing\u200b.",

I've purchased other Boss furniture for my customer lounges and have had good success with the quality so I am going back to the brand again. I purchased 3 of these to replace some Drafting stools for my employees that the armrests and seat covers came apart on in less than 2 years. Assembly was a little trickier than expected, but not difficult, and each chair took about 30 minutes to assemble. Will update review after using for a few months.",
