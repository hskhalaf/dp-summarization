      "text": "The most important thing--these are extra large. I always order extra large gloves for myself and these were...extra large for me! They are substantially thicker than kitchen gloves, but are not suitable for solvents since they are latex. They do resist both acids and alkalis and are thick enough to avoid quick leaks although they are still only rubber, not something tougher. They are large enough to shake off, which is handy for grabbing things out of chemical baths, as you don't want to ever touch the working surfaces with your bare fingers unless the acids/alkalis are first neutralized. I do not recommend them for tasks where you need fine finger coordination as the thickness may interfere with your dexterity.",

The last 3 pair were so large that it was impossible to work with any dexterity. Pretty bad when they produce pinholes after a couple hours in dishwater, that is a fact I am very disappointed, my father is a lineman and I have seen refurbished gloves and we gotta dead ringer.",

Saying that my boyfriend doesn't have huge hands but they're fairly manly and these literally were falling off his hands. So I doubt that washing or holding any items that are fragile or breakable, with these will require him to have mad \" rugby like \" skills. So these reviews may be relative to the person and purpose intended!! As for me \" oh no !!",
