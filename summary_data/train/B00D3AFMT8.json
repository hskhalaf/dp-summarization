The bubbles are thicker and offer more protection, equals less wrapping needed. Objects wrapped in the spell grab slide easily into bubble mailers too. I was surprised to see my 150 foot roll is actually larger than the 175 foot roll of the offbrand because the bubbles on the offbrand are so thin. This truly is the best bubble wrap on the market.",

Every bubble in this wrap seem to have full inflated qualities which makes it harder to not just start popping. Just wanted to have a little fun with this review. It is bubble wrap, with full bubbles and it works. I would recommend this product.",

The wrap I received is light weight and the perforations are a little difficult to see. When located, the perforations do work for tearing into smaller sheets. This product is not quite the quality I was expecting. I am using it to pick for a move and will double up as needed for fragile items.",

When wrapping or picking up an item post wrap, the bubbles pop negating the wrapping. I don't know if this is how all bubble wrap is now, but the last time I moved this wasn't a problem. Unfortunately, I can't remember the brand of that wrap. I suppose this bubble wrap is good for popping but not for protecting.",

This is very easy to see where to tear at 12\". No fighting the perforated lines either. It tears smoothly and easily. I have always used the larger bubbles, but these smaller bubbles are much better for packing glassware, dishes and other very fragile things because you can easily fold the wrap tightly and securely around the item. Moving and packing is stressful enough. Anything that makes it easier is well worth the extra few cents, like this wrap.",
