I had purchased an identical Zagg keyboard case before and assumed that perhaps I had at fault when the first Zagg keyboard case did the same thing. With this 2nd keyboard case I was more careful (not that I was not careful the 1st time round) Despite my care the Cover/Tablet holder snapped off again.",

My only negative with this version is that it's held together (when closed) by an almost non-existent magnet. My prior version had a very heavy latch holding the two sides together (it did not come open unless you put a little effort into it). With this one, I really don't care as I leave it open in my kitchen most of the time (very seldom closed).",

The keys are backlit, and the letters can never rub off like they do in cheaper brands. The cover protects the screen, which we found out was important when we shattered it last year and had to replace it. The back stand is sturdy, unlike the cheaper brand where the back stand broke off after a couple of months, and we had to put a lego block in the back to support it. I personally like the way the keys are better spaced out for my fingers.",

This definitely isn't the case for your needs if you're looking for heavy duty protection for your device, or if you regularly use the portrait rather than landscape position (I pretty much never do with the iPads). Otherwise, it's great.",

I bought the Belkin QODE, but the stability of working on my lap was not great and wasn't crazy the aluminum side of the case. The feel of the keyboard was hard to get used. After a week I decided to order th PROfolio+ and compared. LOVE IT. The keyboard works well and is easier to type on, for me. The stability is great on my lap or anywhere else. The outer covering is nice and is easy to carry without slipping, like the aluminum. My co-worker is using the QODE and loves it, so it is probably a matter of personal preference.",

It is rather irritatingly hard to discern the correct orientation to open the keyboard (I guess that's a user problem). Additionally, I wish that the keyboard would fold backwards, facilitating using the unit when using in tablet oriientation.",

It's so nice to be able to type on my iPad too. I have another brand for my newer iPad now, and it is a pain. You have to pull the top out and get it situated. With this one, you just open it up and get it propped up in its spot and it's ready to go!! Eventually I will get another one for my new iPad because this one is just superior to the one I'm currently using",

The old one had a snap latch that both held the cover shut and served as a \"thumb-hold\" to open the case with one hand. This new one lacks any way to hold it closed. Probably should steer clear. Although the old one lasted several years, it did so with a piece of each of the iPad retention ridges broken (cheap). I've returned mine",

The lighted keyboard is the only way to go, since I can use it in a dark room with the keyboard as the only light. The reason I rated it so low is because of the 3 tries and the cover is leather which is nice when you first get it, but it scratches so easily, which I have learned to live with, because I really like the keyboard case itself. I think a faux leather would almost be a better material to go with.",

The connection setup is incredibly simple, and just opening the case turns the iPad on, ready to go.

Also, the case itself already had a few small scuffs and a crease, telling me someone had already used this item. Additionally, this item is plastic..NOT brown leather. The keyboard seems very nice, but the outer case is a very flimsy plastic and will offer little protection of your iPad in my opinion. I'll look elsewhere for a more protective and functional case.",
