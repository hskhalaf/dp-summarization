      "text": "It arrived as advertised, no surprises. Worked well out of the packaging. Should be functional for keeping uninvited hands off the contents. Good size for portability, yet large enough to handle what I intend it for. Wire seems adequate to secure unless someone is equipped with decent wire cutters. For the price seems to be a good value. My suggestions for improvement are twofold: 1) provide at least one flat key that can be easily stored in a wallet; 2) upgrade the foam a bit. Those two changes would have earned it a five star rating in my book. I would purchase again and recommend it to someone looking for a portable secure box of its size.",

Instead of storing the gun in the glovebox, I will cable the box under the car seat. The box is heavy and well constructed. Worth every penny.

I would get something more durable like a Pelican case. The NV200 holds a Colt Commander and two 7 round Kimber mags fairly well. Only complaint I have are the mags slide around with or without the pistol in the box. Not good when those items are rubbing against one another during travels and possibly having loose ammunition in the case. Great for the home, transporting in the car, and safe keeping in a small space. Good solid case too. Stepped on it and nothing wrong with it so far.",

      "text": "I bought this for a G30S and thought it would be fine since it fits a 1911. My mistake. A 1911 is thinner than a double stack 45 so my Glock barely fits in this case. I will buy the next size up and use this one for my wife's G42. Very solid lockbox. The cable is pretty thin and looks like it can be cut through with wire cutters. I plan to upgrade this to a larger cable used for laptops. The cable size took this down a start, otherwise excellent product.",

In hindsight I would have purchased the NV300 NanoVault or MV500 due to them not requiring a key, instead a combination or keypress combo. The reason for this is I store my duty weapon in here daily and the key and times can be difficult to get fully turned when the safe is full.",

The cable loop is difficult to fit securely in the case with a firearm in the case. I would have given this item 5 stars if the cable loop system was designed better.

I was really excited about GunVault after having read others' reviews and watching a YouTube video highlighting the GunVault, but after TWO go-rounds of no keys, I've ordered from SnapSafe instead--perhaps they will include keys and I will enjoy the added bonus of having saved $7.00 with this alternative SnapSafe purchase.",

The hinge design has been improved and is no longer easy to push out. Its not the strongest box or cable out there but is certainly strong enough for my purposes. The metal is 18 gauge and is a strong design. The others out there in this category are much more expensive, heavier, and bulkier. A well made purpose-built design. Kudos. The Wiz",
