      "text": "I have owned the Rebel DSLR in the past and think that, while large and heavy compared to a bridge camera, produces superb images. I love the relatively high ISO with a minimum of noise. Battery life is great, just about everything about it is excellent. I personally like to use it with a telephoto lens, at least to 130mm or even 200mm. But for everyday photography, the kit lens is fine. And, of course, I love the great range of settings which gives you the most flexibility.",

It's okay to get you to learn how to use a DSLR but a decent mordern mid-range Phone camera can give it a run for it's money. If you don't believe be, watch YouTube videos of the product before you buy it. For the price though, it's alright but you will need to replace he kit lense asap cause like I said, a mordern mid-range phone camera will produce similar or better results.",

I hate to say this but the way the package was set up with everything included within the case this scenario is highly unlikely. The camera works fine which is good, the shutter release button however feels a tad loose. This would not bother me if the 18-55mm lens worked correctly, the autofocus on the lens does not engage. I tested this with another of the same lens that I have and that one worked fine so apparently this company does not test any of their products before shipping them.",

Size is comfortable for a woman with small hands. Easy to hold. Easier to pack than the prosumer (D-series). Exception would be with the heavier zooms - with the 70-200 f/4, the lens completely overwhelms the lighter weight of the camera. I use that one on a tripod (with a ring!). I added a Black Rapid strap which makes this camera even more fabulously portable and easy to use more readily. Get it. You won't be sorry. I considered the 50D but this one was the winner.",

It's held up to the test, and rarely fails to deliver. It's well worth the price point - and stands above most models in its class. As for what's lacking - I'm getting a 70D to achieve even better low light performance and more precise autofocus. I recommend picking up a few Sigma lenses to go with it - they are generally cheaper while still maintaining very high build quality.",

Very nice, although I don't use many features, mainly Manual and Aperture Priority at ISO 100-200. While noise is better controlled than on my XT, it is not as good as on the T1i, which I regret not buying for the cheaper price. Negative: The stupid SD card, whereas my XT used a CF card--which I like much better. Also, the menu is much deeper, with features that I don't need so it takes longer to find what I need. All in all, tho, a nice camera that should last for years.",

Since this is DSLR, it is quite heavy. It's not very fun to carry it around for the whole day without a proper camera bag. Also, the stock lens cap is very bad. It comes off very easily.

I recommended this to 3 of my pals, who bought them and also are still happy with their choice. One thing to take into consideration is that the focus in video mode does not change, so you have to keep the camera at the same distance all the time. This is very inconvenient, so for video it would be better to purchase a video camera.",

Cons: Compared to my moms XSI, the materials of the t2i feel so cheep, and the video af ruins any audio that was recorded because it is so loud. Otherwise it's a great camera-BUY IT!!!!",

My only con is with the shipping. I had a HORRIBLE experience with UPS and the box itself was quite beat up. Fortunately both 17th Street and Canon over-spec'ed the padding and bubble wrap and the camera & lens came through unscathed.",

    "title": "Canon EOS Rebel T2i DSLR Camera (Body Only) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Style:Body Only| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe D90 delivers the control passionate photographers demand, utilizing comprehensive exposure functions and the intelligence of 3D Color Matrix Metering II. Stunning results come to life on a 3-inch 920,000-dot color LCD monitor, providing accurate image review, Live View composition and brilliant playback of the D90's cinematic-quality 24-fps HD D-Movie mode.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe new flagship of the EOS Rebel line, Canon EOS Rebel T2i brings professional EOS features into an easy to use, lightweight digital SLR that's a joy to use. Featuring a class-leading 18.0-megapixel CMOS image sensor and increased light sensitivity for low light photography, the EOS Rebel T2i also has an advanced HD Movie mode for gorgeous Full HD movies. Able to capture up to 3.7 frames per second, it's ready to go the minute it's picked up. Advanced Live View, a new wide-area screen, plus features like Canon's brilliant Auto Lighting Optimizer and Highlight Tone features ensure brilliant photos and movies, easily. With some of the most advanced features of any digital SLR, it's simply the best Rebel Canon has ever created. \n\n\n\n\n\nEOS Rebel T2i Highlights \n\n18.0-megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor\nThe EOS Rebel T2i has an 18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor that captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range and offers more than enough resolution for big enlargements or crops. This first-class sensor features many of the same new technologies as used by professional Canon cameras to maximize each pixel's light-gathering efficiency. Its APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format). \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\nThe Canon DIGIC 4 Image Processor dramatically speeds up the entire EOS Rebel T2i's camera operations for intuitive operation and offers improvements in both fine detail and natural color reproduction. It works in concert with the EOS Rebel T2i's CMOS Image Sensor to achieve phenomenal levels of performance in nearly any situation. \n\nCapture stunning shots in low light. ISO 100-6400 (expandable to 12800) for shooting from bright to dim light\nThe EOS Rebel T2i features an expanded ISO range that makes shooting possible in situations previously unthinkable without flash. With an ISO rating up to 6400 (expandable to ISO 12800), along with the DIGIC 4 Image Processor's improved noise-reduction technology, creative possibilities abound. Combine the EOS Rebel T2i with one of Canon's EF or EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer and the shooting possibilities for both movies and stills expand even further. \n\nImproved EOS Movie mode with manual exposure control\nDesigned for the evolving, tech-savvy user, the EOS Rebel T2i features HD Video capture technologies--manual exposure control for more creative control, for example--borrowed directly from professional Canon SLRs to capture stellar video with all the benefits of shooting with an SLR. By shooting video with the EOS Rebel T2i, photographers as well as filmmakers can take advantage of the creative features native to SLR cameras. Along with its manual controls, the EOS Rebel T2i allows for full use of Canon EF and EF-S lenses, including Macro and Fisheye, providing a plethora of shooting options once reserved only for still photography. The resulting HD video is a standout in its beautiful depth-of-field characteristics and remarkable capture capability under poor lighting conditions. In a first for EOS cameras, a Movie Crop function is included: An SD-quality movie (640 x 480) can be cropped to the equivalent of about 7x magnification of regular shooting. \n\nVideo can be captured at a number of resolutions and frame rates for numerous applications. It can capture 1920 x 1080 Full HD video at frame rates of 24 (23.976), 25 or 30 (29.97) frames per second, for up to 4GB per clip. Movies are saved as MOV files and can be viewed in Full HD through the EOS Rebel T2i's HDMI output. Other recording sizes include HD at 1280 x 720 (50/60 (59.94) fps) or SD/VGA at 640 x 480 (50/60 (59.94) fps). The EOS Rebel T2i has a built-in microphone for simple mono recording and stereo sound can be recorded through a self-powered external microphone. \n\nEnhanced 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system, and 9-point AF system\nThe EOS Rebel T2i features Canon's newest Dual-layer sensor, with 63-zones. By measuring not only the amount of light, but also taking into account color and luminosity, this new system delivers a very high level of accuracy for better results every time. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized; the EOS Rebel T2i gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as sports on a cloudy day, or indoor holiday scenes. \n\nAdditionally, the EOS Rebel T2i has a high-precision, 9-point AF system utilizing a high-precision, f/2.8 cross-type center point. The 9-point AF system uses both normal and high-precision focus depending on the aperture and available light. The 9 focus points can be chosen automatically or manually selected. \n\nWide 3.0-inch (3:2 aspect ratio) Clear View LCD monitor\nThe EOS Rebel T2i has a high-resolution 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor that features 1.04 million dots/VGA for spectacular detail. It also has the same aspect ratio (3:2) as the camera's sensor, making for clear and easy Live View composition. An anti-reflective and water-repellant coating provides a clearer and more smudge-resistant surface and screen brightness can be adjusted in 7 steps in accordance with ambient light. \n\n\nNew Quick Control Screen button\nThe EOS Rebel T2i's refined button layout includes a dedicated button that directs the camera immediately to the Quick Control screen, where it's simple to navigate among any number of settings, including ISO, Exposure and Flash Exposure compensation, drive mode, white balance, image quality and much, much more. \n\nImproved layout with dedicated Live View/Movie shooting button\nWithout the need to navigate through a bunch of menus, the EOS Rebel T2i transitions effortlessly between still and movie mode. By pressing the Live View/Movie button, a situation that had required menu access with other cameras, still images can change to a movie shoot and vice versa. It's literally as simple as the press of a button. \n\n3.7fps continuous shooting up to approximately 34 JPEGs or approximately 6 RAW\nThe EOS Rebel T2i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second (fps) for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34 full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS Rebel T2i can capture even rapidly-unfolding scenes with ease. \n\nNew compatibility with SDXC memory cards\nThe EOS Rebel T2i is compatible with both SDXC memory cards for greater storage capacity and with Eye-Fi SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and internal antenna for wireless, high speed transfer of images.
