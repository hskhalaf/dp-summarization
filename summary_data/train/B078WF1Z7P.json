(cutting crape myrtles) Only con I found was with the operator running out of steam!!",

IT'S TOO DAMM HEAVY ON THE BUSINESS/CUTTING END OF THE SHAFT, because of the weight of the motor on the cutting head end. The motor needs to be at the bottom of the shaft, where it would configured with a flex or solid drive shaft \"only\" up through the extension tube. In my opinion (only) looks good, but functionally when fully extended, only a behemoth of an operator, could possibly wrangle/control this poorly configured over weighted at the functional cutting end. The MOTOR IS TOO HEAVY... TOO PLACED AT THE TOP END OF THE SHAFT!!!",

Update: had to order tension knob to replace the original one, chainsaw is heavy when the pole is attached and a bit difficult to handle.

Love the modular disconnect of the saw and power unit, very easy to switch as compared to other model.
