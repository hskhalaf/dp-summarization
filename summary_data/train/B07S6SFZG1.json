The OLED strip makes it easy to switch between the multiple open windows, and makes formatting fonts easily during word processing (eg highlighting and changing font colour). Sound is also great!",

Called Apple Support - they could not fix it and suggested I return to Amazon for a replacement. Apple had no interest in sorting out my problem themselves. But Amazon have no more stock and can only offer a refund - refund takes two weeks, so now I have no computer and no money for 14 days either. When I am spending this much, I would expect a replacement to be sent to me...be warned.",

The screen quality is crisp. One thing to note, the battery claim is 10 hours, but it is normally around 5-5.5 hours The delivery was super fast. Although heard of problematic deliveries from Amazon, so was a bit skeptical before opening the box and hence made a video while opening but God forbid, everything was good :) All in all I\u2019m happy with my Mac and the delivery",
