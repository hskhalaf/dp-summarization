I researched online, and found out you have to pop it open and reseat the keyboard plug on the motherboard on a regular basis. This is a common problem. Then the pin broke off in the power port. It was such a tiny pin. I re-soldered a new pin, and it worked again for a little while. Eventually the machine just stopped working altogether. Meanwhile my daughter and I have Toshiba laptops we were using long before this thing, and they still work great long after with no problems.",

Incredibly thin, light, great screen, great keyboard. The only negatives are that the memory is not upgradeable, and we did have an issue with the keyboard not working briefly which turned out to be a common issue with the keyboard cable getting disconnected. That was an easy fix with a piece of tape (but I did have to buy a special screwdriver to open it up).",

All the shortcomings were solved and nice enhancements added, compared to the previous version. There was a slight touchpad a and typing problem when I got it but a quick driver update from ASUS's website solved both. I can't say anything that would be a minus. Its fast, reliable, the display is not glaring, sharp and perfect, light and battery life is great. I wouldn't change anything on it, except maybe a better upgradeability but I guess that would be hard to do with such a slim design. All my friends are amazed when they see it :)",

Excellent for software development anywhere you go - battery lasts nearly forever. My only issue, which could have been solved with a little more research on my part, is the inability to upgrade the RAM. I purchased the 4GB model planning to upgrade as necessary, however, memory modules are soldered directly to the motherboard. Still works great, but don't plan to run Eclipse or a similar IDE with a whole pile of tabs in your browser and the Android emulator at the same time. ;)",

It's the ONLY place I was able to find a replacement keyboard. Oh and the SSD, hope you never want to upgrade it, it's also rare and of a proprietary interface. At least you can find a replacement SSD for a MacBook Air and they invented proprietary!",

This computer responds extremely well and is extremely portable. Battery life and screen quality also both exceeded expectations. I give this laptop my highest recommendation.",

On top of that the fact that it's truly a bargain to get a screen with this resolution, computing power and a weight of under 3 lbs. I'd recommend this to somebody looking for a powerful ultrabook.

      "text": "This $1,400 Ultrabook looks great on paper, but quality control apparently isn't implemented at the ASUS factory. The Notebook arrived with a non-functioning camera (searching on the Internet, I see others have had the same issue). After two hours on the phone with ASUS technical support, including a demand that I wipe the machine and reinstall Windows (which I did), they advised me to send the unit in for its first repair--two days after receiving it new! Shipping a device with defective components and apparently not testing before shipment is not a great way to start a long-term customer relationship, so I'm returning it to Amazon and starting the search all over again. VERY disappointed.",

Customer service was so-so, little help and I had to fight to get a return authorization. They wanted me to back up my data on the computer, yet I could not turn it back on, and could not seem to grasp the idea I could not access the data. And since the box was opened, I can not get my money back and am stuck with a non functioning computer. Would not get this brand again.",

Besides the USB ports and Fn keys I overall really liked this laptop.",

Why is it that no PC manufacturer can get this right. My fix is to use a usb wireless mouse. The Zenbook is pretty much great in all other aspects.",

The only downside was that 8 months in the power button stopped working. It was still under the 1-year warranty, but I had to shipping it to the manufacturer and wait close to 2 weeks before I received it back. No other problems since then.",

Except for the critical fact that after 2 weeks, some of the keyboard keys are intermittently failing to register: the C, the K, the Q, and the space bar. I emailed Asus support about 12 hours ago so hopefully I'll hear back from them soon. Why ruin a lovely computer with such a basic failing?!?! I want to keep this computer, but cannot if this continues. (Yes, for some reason the keys are working now as I type this, but they often weren't working for the previous 2 days.)",
