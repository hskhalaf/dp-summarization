And 2 of the 10 packs were damaged not vacum sealed.",

However, they taste nothing like they smell. The taste reminds me of a dry sugar cookie, just not that sweet. We could definitely eat these as survival food if needed. I only gave four stars because of the smell. Other than that, they're good. We'll be buying another case as soon as we can.",

I ordered Jan 2018 and the bars that arrived were manufactured 4/2016, so almost 2 of the 5 year shelf life were already burned through which defeats the point of emergency bars. Also, one of the bars came with its vacuum seal failed so I assume that one wasn't even safe to eat. Just sent it back. Otherwise the product itself is great - just inventory management seems poor.",

A few of mine weren't even labeled with a lot number or expiration date. Seems like this happens a bit. Buy from someone else if you are looking for 25 year shelf life because these don't make it here sealed. Hate to rely on these in an emergency.",

The box it came in could have been taped up better but everything inside seems to have survived shipping well and shipping was timely. They are made new like the individual one I bought. Mine were made in October 2015 and are good untill October 2020. It is a case of 10 as described. 1 pouch is a 3 day ration and there is 10 pouches in a 30 day supply. A case of 10 isnt very big which makes them easy to store in a closet or something and a box weighs about 10 lbs.",

It provided me plenty of energy and was easy to digest; however, I was getting a bit sick after a steady diet of this stuff.

Tastes like a very slight lemon sugar cookie overall. Very happy!",

I'd say a month easy, they are that tasty compared to the other survival bricks. I even use these in a pinch now when I don't want to deal with cooking, don't have time, on the go etc...so I highly recommend them as a great utility food.",
