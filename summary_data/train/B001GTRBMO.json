      "text": "I'm a repeat user and know that Work and Forget works well to clean algae and mildew on our siding and other outdoor home items. This version requires a sprayer (but is less expensive than the pre-mix). It's not fast and you first see the algae begins to die, but after a few days you stop watching to see if it's working. Then a few weeks later and a few rains, I noticed my home is clean! I have neighbors that have professionals clean their siding at a high price and a few than have siding that looks terrible. I like the Wet and Forget choice.",

I put the water and product onto the sidewalk overnight and woke up the next morning to a perfectly normal and clean sidewalk. WOW! I recommend this.",

Today there is a little improvement but I imagine this application will take longer due to the mold stains being imbedded in carpet fibers and not thin canvas. The directions do say it can take 6 to 12 months before all stains are gone. It also says it can be applied every 4 weeks as needed.",
