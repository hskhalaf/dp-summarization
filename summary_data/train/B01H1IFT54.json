      "text": "I had my old iron for over 40 years. Decided I needed a new replacement to keep from damaging the repair or project when the heating element fell out of the handle. I am very pleased with the newer technology for attaching the tips. This iron heats quickly and has worked well so far. The kit has the basics for a beginner and intermediate user. Do not expect to do volume work where a professional grade soldering station is appropriate. I don't expect to need another in my life time and this is a good one for both light duty electrical and electronic use. I recommend it for all levels of expertise.",

And, the temperature dial is loose and right by your hand so it turns while in use making the heat change constantly.

I don't use the iron very often but the two times I've tried it's been completely useless. Definately worth spending an extra couple of bucks and getting a higher quality iron and control. I will say the tip and accessory selection is very nice.",

It works well so far although I've only used it a few times so far. The only thing I did notice is that its easy to accidentally turn the temperature up or down on it without even noticing. That's the only gripe I have about it. Also, the tweezers are REALLY nice. I used them to pull some small metal pieces out of my hands (unrelated to my soldering work).",

I had it turned all the way up to tine 16ga, 14 ga, and 12 ga wires. The tips range from very small to small with one medium wedge tip. The iron stand is very cheaply made and will not last long if you fold it for storage. I would not buy this again!",

The iron itself worked well for my first project, so this was a worthwhile buy. The folding metal stand for the iron is a bit iffy. It could easily slide off a table if pulled by the iron's power cord or it could tip over while the iron is resting on it. Be careful with it and consider getting a better stand.",

I would spend more next time IF I had a need to use it more often. It worked for my needs, so I guess it is kinda like that Freight store that sells the one time use tools, you get what you pay for and if it gets the job done, it gets the job done.",

Invest in a digital instead. The case is nice and the extra tips are nice, but im going to replace the temperature dial with a better one.",
