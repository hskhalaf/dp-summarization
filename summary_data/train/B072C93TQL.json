When I emailed the company notifying them that I did peel off the backing, they offered to send a new one. The customer service was great and very quick; however, I will not get a replacement as I don't think I can trust what is actually in this mouse pad.",

In the trash it goes. It tracks a little slowly for gaming, but it's smooth enough and seems to be well made. The design is pretty close to the natural way my wrist works. It misses the fifth star because the gel for the wrist-rest is very firm and not as comfortable as some others.",

      "text": "I am definitely not a gamer! But I bought this because my wrist hurt from the wrong angle. This is not only great gel-filled, but the photo in the ad is not even fair to the actual product. It looks like shiny red constellations, and in person it is even slicker! Rounded pad on the user's end means no sharp corners on your wrist. GREAT Idea, perfectly executed and FUN to use, instead of dreary ordinary mousepads.",

Overall, the construction of the Curtis pad seemed more durable and substantial, but this pad is very good and has an equally good wrist support. The non-slip grip on the bottom of this pad is second to none.",

Even so, I'm buying another one of these to replace it. It's that comfortable.",

This wrist rest mouse pad helps reduce wrist pain and release working pressure. It is a waist saver for office workers, especially those who do editing work.\n\nConfortable and Healthy\nThe GEL pad is encased under the Lycra so it isn't sticky like some mouse pads. The bottom is rubbery so it doesn't skid on the desk. And the material is ROSH approved, it is environmental, non-toxic and safe to use.\n\nPerfect Overall Shape\nWhen using a mouse you move the mouse in an arc pattern. Then you will understand how smart this design is. This mouse pad is much better than square or rectangular ones. You would move off the pad with square mouse pads. And the rectangular one would add some unusable space.\n\nMatches Any Decor\nThe plain classic look of this mouse pad matches any d\u00e9cor. Unlike some mouse pads with a huge ad or picture in the middle of the pad, our simple black pad matches any d\u00e9cor.\n\nSpecifications:\nWrist Filling Material: Gel\nType: Mouse Pad with Wrist Support/ Wrist Rest\nDimensions: 9.84\u201dx 8.86\u201dx 0.79\u201din (L*W*H)\n\nPackage Included:\nMouse Pad with Wrist Rest x 1",
