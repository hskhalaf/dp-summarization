      "text": "I have been using the Printer Dock 6000 for several years now. I love it so much I ordered this one as a back up. It was used, however, functions perfectly. My Kodak camera went bust a while ago, buy I continue to use this as a printer for 4X6\" prints. I am a photographer for a U-19 girls soccer team and make 4X6\" team photos for each girl at the end of the season. I wanted prints that would last a life time and the ones made with this printer fit that need. A little pricey per print, however, you get what you pay for.",

However, each 4x6 print costs, according to my calculations, just over 62 cents--and that's just for consumables (paper and cartridges) and does not factor in the price of the unit itself. Think about that before you buy it. My wife can't live without this thing because of how nice it is to have great looking photos printed on demand. I'm not so sure the convenience justifies the price.",

Just like the convenient EasyShare camera dock, the Printer Dock 6000 transfers pictures to your PC in just one touch and charges your Kodak camera's battery. \n\n The Printer Dock 6000 is compatible with Windows PCs and Macs, but a computer is not required. It's compact enough to take anywhere, so you don\u2019t have to wait until you\u2019re back home to start printing. \n\n The Printer Dock 6000 uses Kodak color cartridges and photo paper (with Kodak XtraLife laminate coating) to produce prints that are highly durable, waterproof, and tear resistant to last a lifetime. The quantity of paper exactly matches the quantity of archival dye with the EasyShare color cartridge and photo paper kit. It all works together so you'll always know how many more pictures you can print. And because the printer dock is based on Kodak's continuous tone thermal dye transfer process, you can count on getting stunning photos with vivid color.\n\n This package contains the Printer Dock 6000, 10-piece sample photo paper kit, Kodak color cartridge, NiMH rechargeable battery pack for Kodak 6000 series digital cameras, AC adapter, Kodak printer driver software, and cleaning tool.",
