The tablet itself is interesting and it is fun to have a full version of windows that you can carry around whenever, but from such a known company the quality of the build is terrible along with the screen. Windows lags a lot on this device and battery life is not the best. On the positive side it is a small cheap solution to have in your pocket, but with all the choices out there today I would try another first.",

I bought it when it was on sale for $299.99, and a few weeks later I was also able to purchase the Bluetooth physical keyboard that goes with it for $25.00. Together, they totally meet my needs for a Windows-based tablet that comes with Office installed. For me, the screen resolution is just fine--I have a Kindle HD if I want to watch movies. I mainly use it for word-processing, checking e-mail and Facebook, and it meets my needs just fine, at a price that I found extremely reasonable.",

I have had many other tablets, low end and higher end, including the Lenovo thinkpad tablet 2, and the acer screen is a little funny. seems a tad glossy in a weird way, I think its just a cheaper screen than my Lenovo?? so be weary, some cant stand it, others don't notice. other than that, good product so far. had to get the keyboard for upper level college!!!!!",

Could the screen be better? Sure but it's not really that bad - more than adequate in normal room light - just don't try it in bright sunlight but that's also the case for even the iPad. It's fast and versatile. I was able to load an old version of PhotoShop 7.01 and the software for my old Sony LocationFree box so I can stream my cable box to the W3 anywhere in the world with a Wi-Fi connection.",

The product information should be updated to say that this tablet does not have any productivity software which is not included with Windows 8. I gave 2 stars (instead of 1) because after paying for MS Office separately, the hardware does a good job of running it. It works especially nice with the bluetooth keyboard (ordered separately).",
