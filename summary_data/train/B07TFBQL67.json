I bought this specifically for savory cones. I make the waffle cone out of cornbread and fill it with potatoes and meat and it is delicious. I highly recommend this product! Definitely a great value for the price!!",

Also the instructions are very limited, the recipe it gives is very good, but it doesn\u2019t say how much of the batter you should put in, so I went through 2 batches trying to figure out exactly how much was needed for a cone. The central ring would nearly burn and the outer edge was not done. I am only using for family treats so it is adequate my second attempt was a little more consistent.

Several \"trials\" over the summer proved to SLOWLY close the lid until locks otherwise batter \"spreads\" too fast and leaves holes.... Comes with cone roller, good luck with that! Takes practice to get them on the cone maker, but it can be done with patience, an extra set of hands and burned fingers....the challenge is closing the hole at the bottom of the cone.... I have found that waffle \"bowls\" are way better AND easier. :) would definitely buy again",
