      "text": "The compact is a little bigger than others. It\u2019s cute, comes with the limo, a microphone, cupcakes, chair, camera/filming tripod, guitar and 2 dolls. My daughter enjoys playing with it, but gets frustrated because it\u2019s so top heavy it keeps falling over. This is the main reason for the 3 stars. She can\u2019t spend 5 mins playing without it toppling over because it\u2019s so top heavy. Another bad thing about this playset is that the limo doesn\u2019t fit inside to store it. The last complaint I have is the guitar. The photo shows the red headed doll \u201cplaying\u201d the guitar. You can\u2019t seem to get the guitar over the dolls head, much less around the arm.",

The Polly stick concept is fun, although it isn't too much better than the original snap in Polly feet in the vintage sets. Polly can only stick where there is a sticker, and you can't place stickers \"anywhere\", only on smooth surfaces. So it isn't a huge improvement over the vintage sets. But the play value is still great.",
