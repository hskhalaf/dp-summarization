It looks like the Impex brand that is on the picture however the difference is that the locking collars are not spring type they are plastic, seems like it will hold up well since I will use it indoors and dont have to worry about it going bad from sun damage. Still recommend it.",

My olympic weights arejust slightly loose on the bar but not enough to warrant a complaint. As far aswhat I received, it is a great value for the money and I couldn't be happier.",
