Is ok...as you can see at the picture, just that little detail around the hip (too tite) It comes with the adjustment cordes at the hip level (mine is at maximum). Also it has velcro around the wrist.",

Fleece Lining is very soft but on the thinner side. I wear a size 6 typically and a small fits perfectly. Sleeve length is also great for my arms. I\u2019m 5\u201910 and it hits mid hip. Red color was more subdued then in the pictures as well, but it is a true red. The jacket I received differs slightly from shown pictures. The zippered hand pockets have a black quarter inch outline surrounding the zipper, but it\u2019s not a deal breaker for me. Interior has two open top pockets in the lining as well.",

The collar is really nice on, it isn't too lose or too tight when fully zipped. Overall it is a really good jacket.",

Fit is true to size and flattering. The MSRP on the tag is $199. The only downside that I can see is that it is NOT lightweight...I probably won't use it much when I travel by plane because it would take up too much space and weigh too much in a suitcase. However, it will be great to use at home and on car trips.",
