The other was to run by CPAP while camping. It performed well. For several months, I didn't have use for it. It was always on the charger, per the instructions. Now it's dead. I called about warranty service, but that required ME to pay to ship the (very heavy) item back. I'm not spending upwards of $50 more to ship the item when it's likely to die again.",

Last week the I went to start the truck and the battery was dead. I clipped the jumper cables on, turned the switch and it started the truck the 1st time! Really impressed me, so now I don't worry as much when my daughter takes off with her horse, they have lots of external power and an air compressor if needed.",

The problem is the unit weights around 25 pounds and I am suppose to pay for the shipping to Texas. What a deal, that's about 1/3 of what I paid for the unit. So in 8 months I'm suppose to pay another 1/3 of the cost of the unit that was never used.",

We considered a gas generator but trusting the name Schumacher from past use we bought one. Every one who sees this goes crazy. My advice buy at least two, one for the house and one for the car. At these prices and this level of quality buy it before they wake up and charge more.",

I liked that this could be used to charge my phone during power outages. When the power went out it took a couple tries to get it to actually charge and then failed altogether a month later so this didn't pan out as well as I had hoped. Good concept, questionable quality.",
