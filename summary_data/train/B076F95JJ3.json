Ours are straight legs on all four corners so didn't quite fit, plus our legs were 4X4 metal so the straps weren't big/long enough to go around them (this is a Sam Club outdoor table and set). What we ended up doing was putting the straps under the footpegs on the legs which held the sides down then just ran a few bungie cords from the middle of the sides under the table which pulled sides tight and under the table and held in it place real well.",

      "text": "When I bought this a few short months ago I was impressed with the heft and apparent quality. It seemed like a great bond of canvas on the outside and vinyl on the inside. Very heavy and oozing \"quality.\" But this week when I was putting the cover back on the firepit table and chairs I noticed this large rip. Crap. I've seen this before. One rip will lead to many. As you can see from the photo this cover is loose fitting -- I'm not pulling it tight over the corner of the chairs and table. Guess I need to check out the warranty.",
