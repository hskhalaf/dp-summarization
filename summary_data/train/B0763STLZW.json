So to advertise this as expandable storage is false in my opinion. Called the company to see if they could help, no help and rude.",

But the camera sucks, if you wanna record video with your tablet try one that is 280p and darkens ur face when ur in a sunny area, but for a first tablet I like it! I'm on my phone slots on YouTube and social media apps on a lgg5 so a large screen is much better!",

I purchased this to replace my iPad air, (I'm not a great fan of apple products). When comparing this tablet with the iPad, there is no comparison. This ASUS table is slow processing most everything. My Galaxy S5 does a much better job of processing data and surfing this internet. Processing video clips from the news networks is painful waiting for the file too open. The only reason I gave it two stars is the price. This is diffidently fulfills the old adage, \"you get what you pay for.\"",
