These have a sharp, almost astringent smell. If that is \"bayberry\" to all these happy reviewers, it will make finding what I want difficult! I put them in the kitty-box area as air freshener. Still searching for candles close to the aroma I love and miss.",

Unfortunately these candles became harder to find in stores, especially the ones made from bees wax. Then look what I find this year! These candles were exactly what we had as a kid and I made sure to buy a pair for myself and for my daughter. They burned perfectly and smelled heavenly. Price is good and the transaction went smoothly. Candles were delivered as promised and we had them for New Years Eve. Definitely ordering more to have on hand for next year.",

The bayberry tradition has always been an important part of new year's, ever since I was a kid. When I got these, I had to do a test burn. It was perfect. (See photos.) They burned evenly with no dripping, burned all the way to the bottom, and smelled great. As soon as I finish writing this review, I'm going to order more.",

You'll also find Root still working with the original values of honesty, integrity and hard work. All Root candles are made in the USA with rich, lasting fragrances infused with essential oils for exceptional fragrance delivery. Root manufactures their own custom wicks with natural cotton (both lead and zinc free) that self-extinguish. Free of paraffin or any petroleum based waxes, Root candles burn cleaner and third longer. All products have solid color throughout the entire candle and full fragrance during the entire use of the candle. Root's QC Burn Lab test burns 1, 000 candles per day for fragrance throw, emissions, soot, flame strength, stability, end of useful life, welling, dripping and burn time. All Root products meet all ASTM quality and safety standards. When you burn a Root candle, you understand why they are often called the Best Candles in America.",
