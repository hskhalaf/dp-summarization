      "text": "The first thing to say is that I have received two pairs of these headphones and both have broken within a few months of arrival. The reason I have given them 3 stars, is that everything other than their build quality is very impressive. The sound is good and the comfort levels are very good. If you live a very stationary and delicate existence they represent an extremely attractive option at their price point. Unfortunately for the user on the go, or even the user on the stroll, they are not built well enough to last. A great shame as I don't think I will be able to find something similar in the same price bracket.",

Additionally I find them very stylish and comfortable. However, there are some major problems here: these headphones don't travel well as they do not fit into many cases and griffin doesn't offer one of their own, and the headphones themselves do not fold down for storage, but that isn't the real issue here. Simply put, these are very cheaply made. I have purchased two pairs (one as a gift) and both pairs experienced a headphone snapping off from the headband over the course of mere weeks, simply due to everyday usage.",
