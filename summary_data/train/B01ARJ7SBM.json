I then used it under one leg, placing it under my calf muscle and immediately it went flat like an old bicycle tire. My wife who weighs 43kg, she used it between her thighs and it deflated like a party balloon. In my final analysis, this product is not fit for the recommended use.",

Now from the person who cleans this thing..it has a cover over the foam but it fits really snug..it needs a bit bigger case to put on it so it's easier to take on and off for washing the case..even with issue I will be a repeat customer because it just works so well!!!",

      "text": "This is the best thing EVER! I'm a side sleeper and have always had terrible back pain. I used to sleep with a standard pillow between my legs at night, but it was always taking up space in our queen bed and I would lose it through the night, not to mention still waking with awful back pain. I decided to try this pillow based on reviews and I'm so glad I did! It was a life saver when I was pregnant, and still is. It's amazing how much this pillow alone has reduced my back pain! Its comfortable to use, and it somehow stays with me through the night. I highly recommend giving this pillow a try!",

After using it for a month I feel improvement in my low back, thigh and hip pain. I move around a lot while sleeping and it is very easy to switch the pillow from side to side. It doesn't swish down like cheap memory foam either, it keeps a good shape not too hard and not too too soft but very comfortable. Highly recommend this one.",
