In tight spots, I can just pick up the whole unit to turn it around rather than the three point turn I used to do with my very heavy reel mower. It's easy to hose down the mower dock after use.

My old trimmer was heavy and I could only trim half the yard at a time because it wore me out. It is under one acre with lots of trees and flower boxes to trim around. This one is a breeze. I'm not sure where they will look for the tool but I've had 2 neighbors stop and ask me what it was, sounded like a trimmer but looks like a small lighweight mower. It is the best.",

Another plus .is it has a self feeding line ,no bumping .....It actually feels like a toy ,and really doesn't look to me that it will last long because everything is light weight plastic.

For the price, and for small yards it\u2019s great though! I recommend buying an extra charger and keeping 2-3 batteries fully charged though.",

Works best when used regularly to mow when grass isn\u2019t too long, can chew through battery life if taller grass. For routine/weekly quick maintenance the mower portion works pretty well, the lightweight feel is nice, and you can zip through a small area pretty well. Heavy duty it isn\u2019t, but it IS a pretty neat idea, good battery life, and a fairly versatile tool.",
