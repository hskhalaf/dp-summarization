I loved that the picture of this set because it had a locomotive and 3 wagons (which was confirmed by the product description). VERY disappointed to find that the box actually contains 3 wheels TOTAL...only enough to build a locomotive and 2 wagons. As my previous LEGO purchases have included all the pieces to build the item(s) featured on the front of the box, I thought this picture was misleading at best, and I advise the manufacturer to change it.",
