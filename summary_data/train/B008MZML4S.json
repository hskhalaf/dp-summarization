Which is drastically smaller. I looked through the reviews and saw that multiple people have been given this second cage, when thinking they are ordering the first. It seems no one notices the difference, but I do because I already own the giant rabbit cage. It\u2019s very upsetting. I hope this is fixed, but I highly doubt it since for the last few years; the second cage has been the one shipped out.",

It is a great cage with the wheels and easy access for cleaning. The water bottle did not come with anything to attach to the cage so I used my old one. Also the bowl it came with for pellets is way too tall for guinea pigs. My guinea pigs do not go on the top level but they do like being under it. This cage is too small.",

I ended up just taking them out and my piggies use other accessories instead.",

The huge issue is it was HORRIBLE to set up. The pieces didn't fit together at all. It was a very big struggle. The top is pretty flimsy too. The cage is also a pain to clean so I recommend fleece bedding. (which ironically I don't have any yet) I have ordered a nice fleece to use instead of bedding because the cage gets really hard to clean. Altogether this cage is very large my guinea pigs really like it!",

I knew the floor of this cage came in 2 pieces but didn't realize that when assembled, there is a half inch raised divider where the 2 pieces meet. This kind of defeats the large size of this cage because my rabbit cannot lay over the divider. So, while the floor dimensions are 48\"x24\", in reality there are 2 floor areas of 24\"x24\" because of the divider in the floor. I also found that the plastic floor is kind of flimsy and flexes easily, Same with the side shelves.",
