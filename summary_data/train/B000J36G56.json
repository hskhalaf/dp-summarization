One (messy) weld arrived completely detached, with the rod next to it not even being the same length. The base rods are not straight or symmetrical, they do not line up with each other. They also arrived poorly packaged. This was in the retail box, not the Amazon box, so it's not an amazon package issue. The cups weren't guarded against the metal, so there are many black marks on them. The box was also pretty smashed up. I'd skip these and buy a different set, even if it's a bit more expensive.",

Overall, good for what they are considering the price, but this first world problem of mine with these cups is actually pretty annoying.",

The cappuccino cups will hold a Luongo brew from my nespresso machine (original line) which is somewhere just shy of 4 oz. That leaves a tiny bit of room for some frothed milk if you so desire. I prefer my cappuccinos in my 6 oz cups. (withmore milk).",
