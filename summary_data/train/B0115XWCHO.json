It leaked all over my wood floors! At first it was just a little bit of water, but now we have to keep a tray under it because the amount of water that comes out of it soaks an entire towel! I\u2019m so disappointed because when we bought it we paid $500! We should have just used that money towards a central air unit! What a waste! And we cleaned it and stored it in our spare bedroom every winter!",

    "description": "LG's 115V Portable Air Conditioner with LCD remote control is the ideal climate-control solution for when you\u2019re on the go - room to room, house to house or home to work, the installation is quick and easy. The innovative dehumidification function mixes cool dry air with the warm air to keep you comfortable and prevent over-cooling. The oscillating air vent technology circulates the dispersed air more efficiently, so no hot spot will be left untouched. Plus, with the programmable 24-hour on/off timer, you can control the temperature even when you're not there! In October 2017, the Department of Energy implemented a new test procedure to determine the BTU rating of portable air conditioners. The procedural change has adjusted the amount of BTUs allowed to be claimed downward by as much as 50%. There have been no internal changes to these units, and the functionality remains the same.Dry Air Flow (CFM) - 255cooling power:12000",
