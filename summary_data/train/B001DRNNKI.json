I personally found that very helpful becasue it made it easier to replce the filter. The filter in my Audi sits under the glove box and you are almost making a hand stand to open the little compartment. Anyhting boxier would have made the change more difficult.",

      "text": "This is OEM quality and has active carbon to absorb more fumes than regular filters. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't come sealed in a plastic bag, so it will start absorbing smells as soon as you open the box or have it stored as I do until I need to replace my filter. Other filters usually are sealed in plastic to extend their life and keep them from absorbing odors in shipment or in storage.",

Installation requires you to be as bendable as a Chinese acrobat and if you wear glasses that are variable lens, good luck. The product is great it's just the placement of the filter that makes it tough. Check out YouTube if you have questions on the install. Cheers",
