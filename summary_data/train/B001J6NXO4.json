I had these delivered to me overseas, so I am out the money that I paid for them, (Plus the shipping, which was equal to the price of the shoes)---I will never order Tom's outside of Tom's website again!

My feet have been feeling, um bigger lately, so I opted for a 1/2 up, but I think a 9 would have fit perfectly. They do give a bit. I'm hoping once they need to be washed that they may shrink a bit. Considering buying another pair in a different color since I love them so much! Well, then of course there is the wonderful feeling of helping a child get a pair of shoes! Can't beat that.",

The shoe is well made but there is absolutely no support and I can't wear them for long before my knees are aching. I support the brand and their message but at this point I cannot justify spending the money on a shoe that isn't good for all day wear.",

I selected this particular shoe because it is navy and I was looking for something that wasn't just plain, if I could. The espadrille design was also an added treat. The shoes fit great, are comfortable, and look good on my feet. I highly recommend them.",

I believe doing this only works with the canvas toms. This pair I bought as a replacement because some how I lost my previous pair of red ones. I did not rest until I got another pair. The only critique I have is that now my right tom is making a bit of a clicking or squeeking sound :(.",
