The printer is a little larger than our other black and white laser printers but not as big as other colors lasers we've had in the past. So far it has worked like a dream.",

With the price of the drums it was cheaper to buy the whole printer again. This one lasted almost a year. One of the drums failed, and now it just refuses to see the network at all.
