I put in different poles and they hold. I called for replacement poles and they were out of stock, which tells me this is an ongoing problem. It's an over priced piece of junk.",

I can't seem to find a good economical choice that keeps the rain off well enough. We even covered most of the tent with a large tarp, but the stakes didn't hold in the ground good against a storm and came out - which is when I assume the tent pole shattered and everything got wet. Maybe others have better luck with the tent, but it didn't do what I wanted.",

Small holes about the size of a dime, easy fix. The poles are not labeled well and it makes setting it up difficult. It has 3 rooms and one large walk in. Each room can fit one queen size mattress perfectly; no more space for anything else. It's very heavy but that was expected. So far I really like the tent",
