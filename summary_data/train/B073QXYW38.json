Easy to light, generated heat, doesn\u2019t smell or get smokey, and extinguishing is easy. I think after the flame has gone out it\u2019s best to remove the lid so that the wax can cool quickly so you can move/store it. Takes about 30-40 min for wax to re-harden. When you extinguish you don\u2019t have to fully replace the lid, just cover to snuff out flame.",
