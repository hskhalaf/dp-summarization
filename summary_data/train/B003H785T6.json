Great packaging so everything arrived in perfect condition, very fast shipping, quick response to my inquiries. Product works well, with simple assembly - you will need to purchase a wax ring, toilet seat, toilet bolts and I added a new flexible stainless supply line - as these do not come with the toilet. I'd also suggest some toilet shims just in case you need them. I would recommend both the product - there are not a ton of 10\" rough toilets - as well as \"Need Plumbing Supplies\" as a seller.",
