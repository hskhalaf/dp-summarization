One of the reviews said it was good at whisking up mashed potatoes and that made me take the plunge. It's one thing to mix batter, cake mix etc., but potatoes are a stronger test and this mixer passes that test with flying colors. I love it. Does a great job and is very pretty to look at. The red color is fabulous and I love that it has added attachments with the dough hooks and balloon whisk. Very content with this purchase and well worth the price.",

Please advise if we can receive a replacement set. Also, my wife said the mixer motor is very power and the wire beaters just are not up for that power. Please advise what we can expect.

Not so much tarnished as the coating was gone in many spots and all I could see was black. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried to wash it off but no, I was correct the coating was gone in several places. I am so disappointed. I would not recommend you buy this product. I should have listened to other reviewers. I will be returning it as quickly as I can!",

      "text": "When I received this item and took it out of the shipping box, the box the mixer was in was open. When I pulled the hand motor out I was shocked to see food splattered on it and the cord. So obviously this was used(who knows how many times) and returned. I do love how light weight it is. And I would have given 5 stars had I received a new, unused mixer.",
