Our gerbils ate the ladder and a good bit of the loft- maybe ours are more nibbly than others, but having lots of chewable edges is not a good thing. And the water bottle started rapidly leaking so we couldn't keep water in the cage for our gerbils. We ended up using a bowl for a few days until our new, obnoxiously colored cage showed up. I wouldn't recommend it.",

I keep all the hamsters toys under the bed as there is so much room there. I didn't even have to get my hamster to move to the upstairs bed... He did it himself! Overall, this is a great cage with everything you need; plus you can add-on through either of the 2 tube connectors.",

      "text": "This was easy to assemble and very nice looking. It is quite small, which was fine since we had a dwarf hamster, but I think it would be too small for a regular sized hamster. It was very light, which would not be good if you have small children or animals who can knock it over ( my small cat was able to knock this off of my dresser). After a couple weeks the wheel started getting extremely loud, so we bought a different one and replaced it. It is nice that the sides are plastic, therefor eliminating the problem of the hamster kicking out the bedding, however the shallow bottom can make cleaning it out a bit messy.",

The ladder that comes with didn\u2019t attach well, I gave up on it and it\u2019s been out of the cage ever since. The hatch that opens the cage loosens easily (having to catch my hamster after she escapes and doing a duct-tape job on the doors). The design is simple and nice, but cheaply executed I guess.",
