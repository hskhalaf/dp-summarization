      "text": "This just arrived, yesterday. I was a little worried that it might have gotten damaged in shipment, because the box was partially open when I received it, but everything inside the box was in good shape. Assembly was only moderately challenging. The directions consist of a series of diagrams with numbers and letters assigned to each part. It took me about 45 minutes total to put it together, by myself. You only need the hex wrench and the allen wrench that come with the bed - no additional tools. When it was done, I was very pleased. It is exactly as pictured, plus it is very sturdy. I think it will last for years. I would definitely recommend this item.",

For one person this frame should be fine. But dont get this if you have a partner and do NOT have sex on this. Its wobbly and helps it brake. Not a frame i would buy again.",

      "text": "I had a metal frame futon when I was a teen/young adult. I was expecting aluminum brazing in structural locations like my futon. However this product turned out to be great. The middle legs are connected to the long bars by big bolts, the brazing only holds the decorations on and if they were to fail shouldn't compromise the structure. I like how the cross bars are just fitted in place with rubber grommets. The instructions are very easy and the bed only took me about 45 minutes to assemble. Another bonus is during installation the 2 long bars and their connectors (4 parts in reality) were the only parts where orientation mattered.",

I went to wake my daughter up after the first night she slept in it and she had slid a 1/4 of the way off the bed frame on the mattress. The cross bars are metal and finished in a high gloss so it makes the mattress slide very easily. They could have easily added something to the bed frame to prevent this at little cost. Be prepared to put something underneath the mattress to keep it from sliding!",

Because they don't touch the floor normally when you sit on the bed they make a noise, and any activity on the bed is noisy and uncomfortable. Apart from that it seems strong and doesn't rock or move except when you lie on it. I think it would have been a great bed if the support legs were the same length as the regular legs.",
