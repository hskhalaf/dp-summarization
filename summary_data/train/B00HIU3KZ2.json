      "text": "The air balloon machine was fabulous. The shipping and arrival was very quick, machine work flawlessly for an extended period of time. I had 6 college students working on it full time for about 15 minutes and was able to inflate hundreds and hundreds of air balloons for Valentines dance. We had hundreds of blooms all over the dance floor and they help to create a great atmosphere and end ambience of excitement and entertainment all during the dance. This was a great investment, a great tool to help us with a very successful Valentines dance.",
