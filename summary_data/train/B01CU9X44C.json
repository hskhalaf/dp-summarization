The only thing that bothered me on the Salvage Mech are the arms. There are black sloped pieces on the armpit area of the arm that, as built, prevent the arms from going down all the way and restrict the movement. I turned them around so they sloped toward the armpit and was much happier with the look and function of it. The skeletons are kind of pointless in my opinion.",

The joints are the best I've seen out of any figures - you want them to move, but then stick in position. This it does perfectly. I was into Legos as a kid in the 80s, and I built lots of ships, robots, and transformers. These pieces they make now are so fantastic - ideally suited to the job with a great deal of style and potential. The Lego company has have never let me down, and all these years later are better than ever.",
