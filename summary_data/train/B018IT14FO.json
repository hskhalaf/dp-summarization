      "text": "I prefer metal because it\u2019s simple to clean. It lays flat and even on cleaning surfaces. My ONLY gripe with this product was the sticker that was attached upon arrival. I\u2019ve come to learn that heat is the most effective to get sticky stickers off with the least amount of mess. I ran hot water on the side that the sticker was not on to heat up the sticker side without getting it wet, and the sticker peeled right off without leaving any residue. Aside from that, this product serves its purpose exactly the way I needed it to.",
