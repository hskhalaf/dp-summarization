I didn\u2019t expect wonders from this thing- we have wood floors and stone throughout the entire house so I bought this SOLELY for the purpose of cleaning the 1 area rug, and the three small rugs in our kitchen and bath. Plus vacuuming the corners of the couch. The handheld vacuum may work, but WOW I have never met a more incompetent vacuum in my entire life. When the flat head is on, to vacuum my rugs, it literally has no suction. I suck better on the regular. Beyond annoyed.",

The only thing it picks up easily is hair and dust bunnies off the hardwood floors. It works ok as a \"dustbuster\", but I still have to add the crevice tool for it to have any kind of suction (I use this combination around my fireplace).",

Forget carpet...this is not meant for carpet and I'm always surprised by people who provide negative comments on a stick vac like this for carpets...it's meant for floors...and it does a very good job at that.

But I was completely wrong! This vacuum is absolutely amazing! I use it to clean my couch, my area rug, my baby\u2019s play area and on my hard wood floors. Basically everywhere. I use it almost 3 times a week and it does wonders. It picks up everything, dust, hair and even big particles. Its so easy to clean, its small and I love how everything comes apart, literally 3 in 1. This vacuum is perfect!",

It works great on my carpeting and, as for my floors, I've moved my broom and dustpan to the back of the closet! This makes my broom seem outdated. It does the job faster and better than my broom, isn't heavier or clumsier to use than the broom,, and is flexible enough to go under my kitchen table to pick up debris quite easily.",

The suction works well, I have 2 dogs and it picks up the hair without problem. It was super easy to put together and easy to use. The chamber for debris is small so you have to empty frequently if using for more than small cleans which is fine by me. I returned the bissel crosswave $300 bc it kept spitting out dog hair and leaving behind dirt. I bought this based on the reviews not expecting much and it exceeded my expectations.

Capacity to hold dirt is very little and the cord really needs to be about 5' longer to reach from outlet to outlet. It does a pretty remarkable job in sucking up dirt and hair. Overall I'm happy with this purchase. If you have $20.00 to burn and don't want to sweep or lug around a heavy and loud vacuum, you might consider this little vacuum on a stick.",
