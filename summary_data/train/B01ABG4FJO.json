I used the blender. I didn't want to throw away the shakes so I decided to make frozen pops. I will continue searching for a shake that my kids like. =-/ Wish I could be refunded. I should probably try a Vitamin store next time so I can be guaranteed if they will give me $ back if the product doesn't work out.",
