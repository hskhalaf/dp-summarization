Purchased this heater and could not be happier. Ended up having to go down to shorts because of how comfortable the temperature was in the room. I have not had problems with the remote like others have in the reviews. Put in the batteries (Triple A not included) and it worked right away, after I found the switch at the back haha. Hope everyone enjoys it like I have!",

It's got a decently long cable to make positioning it easy, and the remote control is just wonderful. There's no need for an intense training session...just plug it in and turn it on, although it does have more capabilities, such as a timer. This is a great product!",
