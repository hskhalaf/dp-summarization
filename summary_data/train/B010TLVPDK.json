My main purpose was to get a phone so that I could use it with an international SIM for emergency/low usage purposes while traveling outside the States. This phone did its job! My low star rating is because I could not use Tethering... and I did not get that it had all the AT&T junk installed. I am assuming that AT&T junk prevents the Tethering/Hot spot functionality. Anyhow, I am probably going to install LineageOS to see if I can get rid of the bloat.",

But basic functionality of smartphone, use of maps, directions, voice search, etc is great. Many of the integrated cloud features of current gen phones you'll be frustrated with(I replaced with Galaxy A3).
