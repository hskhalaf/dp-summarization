What I enjoy most is that they are slim yet provide ample protection for your phone. The case has a very nice tactile kind of feel and provides just the right amount of grip to prevent an accidental drop. It is also easy to remove if needed. My only problem is that I had a difficult decision in choosing which one of all of the Caseology cases that I liked the best for my new GS8. Guess I am going to have to buy several more and change them up occasionally!",

Most of the one star reviews have to do with getting the wrong case. Be careful when ordering that you are not buying the S8+ case. I made that mistake as well and admit it was my fault for not looking closer before checking out.",
