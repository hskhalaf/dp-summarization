My old vanilla had a 53cc scoop while the new package has a 80cc scoop and the chocolate flavor is a 60cc scoop. This is an expensive product and I don't want to use more than I need. There is no change is serving size or weight or number of servings in the package or the package overall weight so I don't understand the scoop that's 50% bigger. Other than that, I like this protein powder overall. It's a bit too stevia sweet for my taste, but I haven't been able to find an alternative that's as high quality.",

The consistency is what really put me off though. It doesn't blend. I usually make a recipe with the beef protein powder I usually use. When I used this protein powder instead, it totally ruined my recipe and I had to throw it away. I had purchased this protein powder in the past and didn't have the issue with the off-putting smell and taste. I think they changed their formula or something.

As a result, I had to find a different container to put the product in, and of course it didn't want to poor easily, so I lost some in the transition to the new container. That also meant that I had the product in a different container with no labelling information (which I really need, since I have several powders in my cabinet).

Threw in some greens, fruit, a few almonds and I had a very tasty shake. I'd recommend this protein to anyone who wants to include protein shakes in their diet.",
