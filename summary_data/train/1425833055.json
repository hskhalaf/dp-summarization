They are simple straight to the point quick topics or long depending on how you do your stuff. The only downfall we found is that sometimes the answer key expects answers that are not necessarily covered in the reading. However this is not totally a bad thing if you are encouraging kiddos to think for themselves.",

I usually supplement each week with some sort of relevant YT video, and our kiddo has really enjoyed it. Great product!",
