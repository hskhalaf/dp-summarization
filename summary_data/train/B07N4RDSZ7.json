Ordered this pair (JJ III), and it was very disappointing the new design kept me from even getting the shoes on my feet. I wear a size 10 shoe and could not fit into the 10, 10.5 nor the 11s. The tongue of the shoes is built into the shoe and it is harder than a deep dive wet-suit to put on ! Also note, these shoes are either made in Vietnam or China... Sham on you JJ !",

Came in beautifully and nice quality but downfall is it's too small. He can't even put them on. Putting them on made him sweat! LOL! But seriously, my husband even have narrow feet. So he exchanged it for a size 12! 1inch bigger than his size.. and guess what?! Still doesn't fit!!! Also the design is poorly thought. You can not open the mouth or the lip of these shoes. One reason why!! But even though he already have put them on he still wasn't comfortable inside. So needed to return!!! Too bad!!",

These shoes will not fit people with wide feet. Even after I was able to put them on, they seem pretty tight in the middle of the feet. Maybe in time they will break in but this is initial reaction. 3 star for now only because they feel light on my feet but we will see as time goes.",

Love the gum bottom and the shoe is a tank. Very stable and solid - what would be perfect for a training/gym shoe. The reviews are absolutely true - due to the unadjustable lacing, makes it hard to squeeze into. Order a 1/2 size larger at least. I\u2019m returning, not exchanging, mainly because the shoe is built narrow and a 1/2 size bigger (longer) won\u2019t really remedy my issue.
