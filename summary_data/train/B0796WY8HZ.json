It has great settings for wakeup time, turning the alarm buzzer on/off, a nap timer, adjusting the brightness of the light, adjusting how long the green light stays on. The button on the puppy's foot is fun for my 2 year old to press himself to turn off the green light after he gets up.",

All the functions are easy to set and I love it can be battery or wall plug. Will be great to take when we go out of town. Buy it-you\u2019ll be glad you did.",

I also appreciate that unlike some similar products, this lets you adjust the length of time that the ball glows green; we set it for fully 2 hours since sometimes my daughter's sleep can be erratic and unpredictable and I don't want her waking up confused, trying to derive meaning from a ball that isn't glowing at all.

It works so well my 3 year old has gotten smart enough to pull the cord out of the wall because he doesn't like it \ud83d\ude02 It really helped us establish him understanding when he needs to be in bed and when he can get out of bed. At night before I tuck him in I set it and it turns red and in the morning it turns green and he turns the paw off and can leave his room. What disappointed me the most is that you have to reset it every night. It won't automatically turn red. Overall really happy though!",

      "text": "We bought this for our oldest daughter since she kept getting up earlier than us on the weekends and now with this virus keeping us inside. It was frustrating telling her to stay in bed. This has been a saving grace. It is so easy to use our daughter can set it herself before bed. Worth the money. And it is a cute dog. Can\u2019t go wrong with that.",
