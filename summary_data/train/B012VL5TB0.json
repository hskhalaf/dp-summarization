The trimmer attachment works great however, which sadly fooled me into keeping it outside of the return window. When I needed to actually shave and use the razor head, it was completely worthless, far inferior in shaving ability to a $5 bic. I spent a solid 10 minutes shaving and missed so many hairs, it won't even get any of the hairs on my neck or under my jaw. Do not purchase.",

Couldn't get it to cut any of my neck whiskers that with ONE swipe my less expensive Norelco could. What a deep disappointment and frivolous cost to have to discover on my own. I never actually could get a complete shave with this being it was torturous and an easy completion with the older and cheaper design. NOT recommended.",

The improvement is far more than I expected when upgrading from the last one I purchased nearly eight years ago (and it was still running strong, BTW). And the cleaning system works great too! No more worries of neglecting to clean my shaver. Just turn the cleaning system on and leave it alone. This shaver was well worth the investment!

I have never imagined that electric shaver can shave the face better than any other razors. NOTE: in the instruction it's written we need 21 days trial and conversion in order to adjust our skin to a new shaver and feel the closeness of Philips Norelco, but... I felt it today - in one day it did its work perfectly in case, when I have very thick face hairs. In a word - this is the BEST SHAVER - I recommend this to everyone!",
