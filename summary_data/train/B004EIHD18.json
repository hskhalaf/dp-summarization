On the gizeh from Amazon the t-strap wouldn\u2019t lay flat. I have two other pairs of Gizehs and this isn\u2019t a problem with them. It also isn\u2019t an issue with the pair I purchased at Dillard\u2019s. In the photos, the Dillard\u2019s pair is on the left. The two footbeds are also different. The straps, however, are made of identical faux leather. The strap on the amazon pair just appears to be longer. Anyway, I\u2019m sending them back.",

I have a low (not flat) arch and after 20 years of professional dance my knees had begun to ache. The arch support in these literally got rid knee pain. After about one week of wearing them, the soles also became a bit more flexible. There isn't any way to adjust the top strap. So when you purchase, make sure that they are good and snug..because they will relax a bit. I generally wear a size 6 but went down because they were a bit long. Now if only I could wear these in the Minnesota winters....",

It has been so hard to find these in narrow until I found them here. We say its somewhat large, we recommend ordering these in a half size down from the normal shoe size. She wears an 8 and I ordered the 38 N. Perfect Fit! Doesn't have the bulky appearance as the regular Birkenstock's do.",
