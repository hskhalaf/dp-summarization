It\u2019s a divisive neutral running shoe for the road, but it\u2019s mostly welcomed by its purchasers.",

      "text": "I have owned four pairs of 890v4's and several v'3s. I run approximately thirty miles per week. I have loved the previous versions like no other and especially for its lightweight. This newer version has a heavier feel to it. Also the tongue is made of thinner material and not as padded as the other versions and I find myself having to keep loosening and retighten the lases because they hurt the top of my foot because of the thinner tounge. Not a bad sneaker but not the feel of the previous version. It was disappointing since I have been faithful and loved this version for the past ten years.",

I wore this pair of shoes for the first time this past Sunday. They were not comfortable after about 2 hours and I was not on my feet very long. I bought and insole and wore them all day yesterday. My feet were sore last night. This is not what I normal for New Balance Shoes. I would not recommend THIS STYLE. No issue with New Balance....but these are not up to their standard. If I had saved the box I would have returned them.....do not recommend.",

Neutral: the toe-tip of the shoe has this weird running slant that allows you to step into strides better(?)..not sure if its a great feature or not,but its a different running-shoe-feel. Cons: Breaking them in was hard to do--the higher-neck of the heal gave me bad blisters on both feet. Probably the neck of the heal goes up too high. never tried running in them...Im afraid it'll just leave more blisters if I would try to run, but will break-in and cause less blisters overtime. Not sure if id run in these, but I will wear them at work.",

I used for 2 months, ran a 13.1 in 2.11, but didn't really feel very comfortable and stability, comfort and support was not up to my liking. I switched to Asics Gel Kayano 24 and very next week ran a 13.1 in 1.59. I am going to stick to Asics for my runs and use this casually for walks and theme park visits.",

They have great support and feel really light , additionally the upper mesh allows for breathability. I feel like I\u2019m running on marshmallows .
