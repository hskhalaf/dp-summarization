      "text": "This backpack is very large, spacious and durable. It's nice, but it's certainly not worth the $40 I paid for it. It has an attractive blue tie dye print (minus the big Jansport label I'd rather do without) and multiple compartments to store plenty of books, clothes, tablet, laptop, pens and many other things. The padded shoulder straps are really thick and curved for maximum comfort and support. I'm a little surprised by the inner white material; it's a bit thinner and cheaper than I expected. But overall this is a good quality backpack. I got it to bring extra shoes and clothes to T.V. shoots in the city, and it's definitely up to the job!",

Other reviews (and I agree) state that the zipper does get stuck on the backpack itself... which is difficult to fix but is fixable. no other backpack for the price holds up to my teens high school honors books and binders which can be quick heavy. Also not that the shoulder straps are more padded, durable than the superbreak jansport. Both do there job. The photo isn't as pretty as in person.... Daughter was very pleased.",

The straps are very padded but a little still when you first purchase but they bend into shape after a few uses so it's no big deal. Perfect for hiking, travel, school, whatever you want!",

It was worth the price I paid here, which was not too expensive compared to the original price.

Stitching is standard, no reinforcement. I just wish the bag bottoms were reinforced. These bags last about a year, but they all start getting holes. Second purchase after about a year and a half: The bag bottom is ok. The zipper gave out. Still, my rating stands.",

I've always loved my JanSport when I was going to school and it was well made and lasted my entire high school years. I'm hoping this will last just as long for him.",

She is very petite but the backpack when filled is still comfortable with nice big wide straps. The only drawback is there is no hook for a lunch bag but that was an easy fix. Great quality. The last backpack was from LLbean and lasted 3 years. I will update this post.",

My husband still has the purple one he got in highschool, still in quite useable condition, too. It's worth paying just a little extra.",

I actually now use it for a 72 hour kit, and it's holding everything nicely that goes in an emergency kit.",
