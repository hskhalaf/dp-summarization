A few days later a package arrived, containing a pretty box with TWO necklace length chains with extenders! The chains themselves are bright, delicate (but not flimsy), and really pretty. I would absolutely buy from this seller again!",

We live in Guam and have a pool at the house as well, so chlorine and ocean would've caused constant tarnishing. I went with this for that reason and also for the added strength of steel. It looks just as pretty as a silver or white gold piece. We'll see how it holds up after its been on her ankle, but so far, I would highly recommend...especially for the price.",
