I give it two stars because it did a great job cooking, but due to the hinge won't be able to use it to transport food safely.

If you detach the arm that holds the lid in order to clean it, the bracket inside that holds it is not attached to anything else and will fall inside the basin. The unit cannot be disassembled, and the manufacturer will not help you. Other: When you lift the lid all the way up, condensation on the lid pours down onto whatever surface the cooker is on. This can be either a pro or con, depending on whether you want the water to go back into the pot or spill water and food residue all over your counter.",

Well built and great to carry it for parties with the handles on the side. But be careful as all the surface of the slow cooker gets hot. I would not recommend if you have small children at home.
