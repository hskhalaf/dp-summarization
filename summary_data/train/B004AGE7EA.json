Pros: very quiet, smooth, zero brake dust, zero vibration. Even under heavy braking, they continue to have great performance. Can\u2019t beat the price too. Con: The OEM metallic pads have more initial grip. They have more bite, just in the beginning. I would be willing to bet these add a few feet to the 60-0 braking distance vs OEM Lexus Pads. The conclusion is clear. I would buy this combo over and over again. Highly recommend.",

I installed these pretty quick with some new pads from ACDelco and I am extremely happy with these. Normally I would buy EBC brake parts but those were just too much money today. These rotors are great. They will make some noise for the first 10-20 miles because the coating needs to be removed from the rotors with the brake pads pressing against the rotors. Will update if any issues arise in the future. Worth the money. 5 stars!!",

One was made in Italy and the other in the Czech Republic. I had no choice but to put them on and they seem to function the same. Just very disappointed and the main reason I go to the auto-parts store and look at everything they put on the counter to confirm the correct form/fit/function.",

They installed without incident and, coupled with Bosch brake pads, are providing pulseless straight-ahead braking. I dropped a star because they lack the two small threaded holes in the center \"Cap\" that allow them to be removed if they become difficult to remove at the end of their life. The originals have those holes, and I had to use them to remove the driver's side original. So put a slight film of anti-seize on these where they will contact the axle. A few years from now, you will be happy you did so.",
