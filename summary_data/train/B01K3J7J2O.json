      "title": "Great combination--Bose and Dot!",
      "text": "Having been frustrated with the terrible sound and size of the Echo, ordered the Soundlink II packaged with a Echo Dot. Problem solved! For a tiny package, the sound is fantastic, bell clear, and the bass is incredible for such a small enclosure. I couldn't be happier. The two sit unobtrusively, speaker under my display and Dot to the side, low profile and inconspicuous. Although not marketed as such, I think the Dot's sound is as good as the Echo. BTW, no conflicts, just a satisfied consumer. Now all I have to do is figure out what to do with a surplus Echo. Paperweight, perhaps.",

You struggle for it to connect to the pins correctly. Second is a lack of a lit function button so you can't see it when a call comes in the dark to answer it. I would have expected Bose to make a better leap from the original, especially the unreliable base, to this version.",
