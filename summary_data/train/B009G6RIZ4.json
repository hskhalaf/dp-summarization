      "text": "I wrote an earlier review, but have since changed my mind! I regret ever having purchased this sorry product. It slides to one side of the bed EVERY night!! Plus, on one side it heats only to about half as warm as the other side on full high. We needed to replace our previous Sunbeam electric blanket that was given to us 31 years ago as a wedding gift -- blanket just started having problems a few months ago. So, the obvious choice seemed to be Sunbeam -- didn't read the frustrating review. A total waste of money, in my opinion. AVOID unless you like to chase a faulty product around the sheets every night.",

It creeps from one side to the other, interrupting our sleep 2-3 times each night as we wake up shivering.

Moreover, why can't the design a control pad that doesn't fall off the bedside stand with every tug on the cord?",
