I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the quality of the speaker is below par and the resolution of the camera and the video is not HD quality. The phone generally sells at a price point of, $55.00 but it perfoms as if it were a much more expensive unit. As an everyday phone that does what it is suppossed to do, I highly recommend it but If you are looking for a top flight, high tech George Jetson trylark descrappler you might want to look elsewhere.",

I can honestly say that my phone is often much faster than my Frontier DSL home network. The only con I would have to say is the same as with the Realm is that call volume is not great if there is outside noise but its my only complaint and by far the best Android phone i've had thus far (this is phone #5 in 6 years).",

If you use your phone as a do-everything-go-everywhere PC, then look elsewhere..... it simply isn't built for that. It handles video calls, TooYube, & surfing just fine. Spreadsheets are fine..... but games are hit or miss b/c the RAM is limited. Excellent choice if you need a phone that is modern, will run what you need it to run & occasionally can be pushed to its limits, but don't get upset if it lags when you do so. Again, great for light-to-medium everyday users. I'd recommend this to anyone who falls into this category.",

The only issue that I found, is that the volume is not very loud when on calls, I have to use the headset/headphones to hear the person through the phone.",

      "text": "Perfect phone for the basics of Android. Buy an SD card, and install before loading with applications to keep more storage open. Bluetooth is solid, as is WiFi. Not too big to use with a single hand for calling or txt-ing. Battery life is good. If you talk a lot carry the charge cable with you. Other bonus uses USB micro for charging so affordable if you need extras or need to replace. Camera is good too. Clean clear pictures every time.",
