    "title": "Intex Raised Downy Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump, Queen, Bed Height 22\"",
    "description": "The Raised Downy Airbed is engineered with dual chamber construction: the lower chamber functions as the box spring form on a traditional bed, providing extra firmness and support while the upper chamber functions as a mattress. It provides the convenience of a portable airbed with the comfort of sleeping on a raised platform. Plush, waterproof flocking covers the mattress top for a luxurious feel to provide a cozy night's sleep. The Raised Downey is equipped with a quality-tested, 20.8-gauge waterproof flocked top, along with 15-gauge vinyl beams and 16-gauge sides and bottom. The resulting surface is comfortable and secure, whether you're sleeping at the in-laws' overcrowded house or setting up a guest bed in the basement.\n\nIn addition, the Pillow Rest is remarkably easy to inflate thanks to the built-in, high-powered electric pump; quickly and easily inflate both chambers with the touch of a switch. Then adjust to any level of firmness for the ultimate in comfort. The airbed inflates in about 4 and 3/4 minutes and deflates completely for travel and storage. No more fussing with tiring hand or foot pumps or rummaging through the garage for your detached electric pump. And should the mattress feel a little too soft or firm, you can customize the comfort level with the touch of a button. An indentation on the side helps grip fitted sheets so you can feel comfortable in the bedspread you already have.\n\nRegarding Inflation: Measurements will vary based on the manner in which it is inflated and packaging disclaims \u201capproximate size\u201d. Airbeds are measured from the widest point including the beams (bulges) on the side and off the tallest point from the floor including built-in pillows if applicable. Location, temperature, and humidity will affect the airbed\u2019s firmness. Airbeds will need to be occasionally re-inflated (topped off) to maintain desired firmness when used for more than a few days as vinyl tends to relax over time\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\nDesigned for comfort and reliability, this Intex Raised Downy Queen Airbed offers the convenience of a portable airbed with the comfort of sleeping on a raised platform. Plush, waterproof flocking covers the mattress top, and an indentation on the side helps grip fitted sheets. The bed easily inflates and deflates with a high-powered built-in electric pump. It features a dual chamber construction, with the lower chamber functioning as a box spring to provide added firmness and support. It has a 20.8 gauge (.053mm) waterproof flocked top with 15 gauge (0.38mm) vinyl beams and 16 gauge (0.41mm) sides and bottom. \n\n This Queen-sized bed measures 60 by 80 inches (measured from bulge to bulge) and rises to 22 inches from the floor.
