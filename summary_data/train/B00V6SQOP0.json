Gas blowers are way more, louder etc. Very happy with this unit. Update - used it 2 months this past fall, 2 months this spring, the trigger is no longer working, bummer. Battery is still super strong but blower may not be as well made as expected....",

I haven't run down the battery yet, but I do have Oregon's chainsaw (for 3 years now) which uses the same 40v batt, and typically get 30-40 minutes of cutting time before needing a recharge. I expect this blower will not use nearly the amps of the saw. Plus now I have 2 batteries. The unit is compact and has a 'Turbo' button that will blast the gravel off your driveway...so easy does it! Like all Oregon products, the quality is here and I am glad I purchased this blower...and the chainsaw, too. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "Love the blower. It\u2019s quiet and powerful. That said, I have two concerns. I ordered the 6 Ah battery, but they sent the 4 Ah. Amazon quickly refunded the difference in price, so that was great. The problem with the 4 Ah battery is that it only lasts 12 to 15 minutes before it\u2019s dead. The 6 Ah would give you closer to 20 minutes. The turbo feature is awesome. You can move wet leaves with ease, but it eats the battery life fast, so use it sparingly. I\u2019d rate this 5 stars if I could get 30 minutes of use. I\u2019d be sick of leaf blowing by then. Happy to take a break by then. \ud83d\ude0a",

Have tested the turbo and it works really well but so far I haven't had a need for it. The regular power moves leaves, acorns and twigs without issue. (My only surprise was that I thought Oregon was American-made. Was surprised to see China on the box).",

After that, a partial depression of the switch would work for a couple of seconds, then shut off. A full depression of the switch does nothing, until you wiggle the switch around a bit, then goes on full power. Poor quality switch. Also, it takes a good couple of hours to charge the battery, so plan on charging between projects, not during.",

I bought extra battery just in case I might need it for extra heavy cleaning. It's a little heavy and using it on turbo really uses up battery buy is so powerful it doesn't take long to clean up both yards (about 3 times quicker than my old blower).
