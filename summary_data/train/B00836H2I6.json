This one takes amazing photos, easy to use and in full auto does the right thing. Since I am not (yet) a photo expert, it adjust correctly but also gives me the ability to alter f-stop and shutter speed and manually focus on the object. The only minor complain t is that the lens has some screw on light blocker (plastic ring with flaps) that if you leave on when not sunny will add a dark spots to the picture where the flaps are (like I said I am not an expert). Great camera overall.",

I've been trying all kinds of modes and combinations with the settings, I've even tried the reverse lens technique and love it. Video not the best same with the auto focus (not that fast), but it's an F3.. SO it's perfect for what I need, if not I can just switch to manual focus BAM problem solved, so no biggie. I would recommend this as a really good camera for those looking to \"UP\" their photography from a point and shoot and that aren't quite ready for a DSLR.",

It took a while to charge right out of the box but now it only takes an hour and lasts quite a while so kudos. Bottom line, it was a wise investment",

Luckily, the brightness of the F3's LCD panel can be increased to minimize the issue, albeit at the expense of battery time. Something to consider when purchasing a camera.",

It was perfect for it UNTIL almost every time I take a picture, I get the infamous camera error, which flash on the LCD; It looks to be a shutter error that sony knows about. Only way to get it to work correctly is to take the battery out then put it back in. Looked into getting it fixed but I have to send it off and it cost too much, Im not buying another Sony camera ever again.",

      "text": "Wish it had an electronic viewfinder because the screen is hard to see in the outdoors, plus you have to buy it separately. If this is important to you, I would buy the NEX-5 instead.... and it only excepts the manual viewfinder after market. For my purpose of using it for backpacking, the lighter weight and interchangeable lenses will fit my purpose. It is quite easy to use and very comfortable to hold. Decent price as well.",

Building stabilization into the lenses enables the camera body to be remarkably thin and light. \n\nAnti-Dust Technology\nAnti-Dust Technology helps keep the CMOS sensor clean, resulting in consistently clear pictures.

Then vibration automatically dislodges dust from the sensor. \n\nDual Format Media Card Slot\nFor cost-effective, convenient storage and sharing of your images, the camera accepts Memory Stick PRO Duo\u2122/Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo\u2122 and SD/SDHC media (Class 4 or higher recommended).

Choice of Multi, Center and Spot metering accommodates a full range of shooting situations. \n\nManual Focus Assist \nGreatly magnifies the viewfinder image when you touch the focus ring, making it easy to get razor-sharp images. Works with E-mount lenses only. \n\nPeaking for Precise Focus \nThe Peaking function makes precise manual focusing much easier by highlighting the edges that are in focus in your choice of three colors ( white, red, or yellow). This is especially helpful during macro or portrait photography where accurate focus can make or break your shot. \n\nP/A/S/M operating modes \nThe NEX-F3 offers a full range of controls from the beginner's iAUTO mode to P/A/S/M: Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual. On-screen prompts help you refine your skills, build your confidence and exercise greater creative control for still image capture as well as movie mode too. \n\niAUTO (Intelligent Auto) mode\nUnifies and simplifies Sony intelligent technologies. Takes advantage of Intelligent Scene Recognition, Face Detection technology, and Optical SteadyShot\u2122 image stabilization without leaving Auto Mode so you always get the best shot. \n\nEnhanced Tracking Focus\nTracking Focus continuously tracks a user-designated subject and is now more effective at tracking people. If the subject turns away from the camera, face-detection tracking automatically switches to subject tracking and continues tracking. \n\nAuto Portrait Framing\nSimply photograph a person and Auto Portrait Framing will save an additional, optimally framed image in portrait or landscape orientation. Combining Face Detection and By Pixel Super Resolution technologies with rule of thirds, Auto Portrait Framing provides beautifully composed and appealingly balanced full resolution portraits. \n\nPhoto Creativity interface\nThe Photo Creativity interface enables you to easily enjoy the creative expression of SLR-quality digital imaging without complex jargon. Changes can be combined/ removed and viewed in real time on the LCD making it a breeze to make adjustments.

Each is unique and each give you a new and exciting way to make your images and videos pop. \n\nClear Image Zoom \nUtilizing Sony\u2019s exclusive By Pixel Super Resolution Technology, Clear Image Zoom increases the effective focal length of your lens up to 2x by digitally magnifying the center of your image with nearly imperceptible degradation. It virtually doubles the effective focal length of whatever lens you\u2019re using providing greater shooting flexibility. \n\nInterchangeable lenses \nCompatible with Sony\u2019s E-mount series of smaller, lighter lenses designed specifically for \u03b1 compact interchangeable lens cameras. Opens up a world of creative options. \n\nSweep Panorama\u2122 Mode \nCapture expansive landscapes automatically. Press the shutter, sweep vertically or horizontally. The camera does the rest, continuously shooting images and stitching them together. Up to 23 MP image size. Up to 202 degrees maximum sweep angle (16mm focal length). \n\n3D Sweep Panorama\u2122 Mode\nCapture vast scenic vistas and 16:9 shots in spectacular 3D. As you sweep across the panorama, the camera records separate right-eye and left-eye images that make landscapes come alive on your 3D television3. Records both JPEG and MPO file formats. \n\n\nAnti-Motion Blur mode \nCorrects for subject movement to capture amazingly clean and sharp images in low light. The camera leverages the large, APS-C image sensor and captures six images in a fraction of a second. Combining the data from all six creates a single image that minimizes subject blur. \n\nHand-held Twilight Mode \nGet cleaner and sharper nighttime pictures\u2014beyond the capability of traditional cameras\u2014without using flash or a tripod. The camera leverages the large, APS-C image sensor and captures six images in a fraction of a second. Combining the data from all six creates a single image of extraordinary detail and low noise. \n\nAuto HDR built into camera \nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) photography captures more scene contrast than a single exposure can handle by combining the best highlight detail from one shot and the best shadow detail from another for one incredible shot. Until recently, you needed a computer and editing software. Sony builds HDR in. Handles severe backlighting and other high-contrast scenes. Captures in a split second. (Recommended for still subjects.) \n\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) \nDynamic Range Optimizer improves results with backlit subjects and recovers details hidden in shadows. Settings include Auto, Level with a choice of five operating levels and Off. \n\n\u201cBackground Defocus\u201d control \nCameras with APS-C sensors take beautiful pictures because they can blur the background. That helps make your subject stand out as the center of attention in portrait photography. But you\u2019ve had to know about aperture f-stops and shutter speeds. Now Sony makes it easy. Simply turn the Control Wheel one way for backgrounds in focus, the other for background defocus. \n\nFace Detection technology \nThe camera can automatically detect up to eight individual faces and adjust focus, exposure, white balance and flash to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. Can prioritize children or adults. \n\nSmile Shutter\u2122 technology \nCaptures a smile the moment it happens.

Combining the data from all six creates a single image of extraordinary detail and low noise. \n\nSix Creative Style settings \nControl how the camera processes your images with six finishing styles: Standard, Vivid, Portrait, Landscape, Sunset and B&W. You can even fine-tune contrast, saturation, and sharpness to your personal taste. \n\nIndex and Slide Show Display \nQuickly review your photos using 6- or 12-frame index views, or as an automatic slide show with fade-in/fade-out effect. \n\nHDMI\u00ae output for HD viewing \nEnjoy HD movies and stunning still images on a compatible HDTV.11 The camera includes an HDMI\u00ae output.
