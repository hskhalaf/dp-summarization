Right at first a whole puff seems a bit big, so I break off the edges of the star and introduce them that way. It lets my baby get used to the feel of it on his/her tongue before it dissolves away. I love that this bulk pack saves me about 40 cents per canister when compared with the price at my usual grocery store.",
