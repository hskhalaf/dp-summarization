I have had 5 rings fail so far. Luckily the kids were close to the ground each time and we have just gotten used to them failing. We wouldn\u2019t be using the product, but since we\u2019re in the Covid19 lockdown, we\u2019re short on options. I\u2019ve been replacing the metal rings with climbing carabiners that I have.
