      "text": "Sigh. I first found this product in an article where Drew Barrymore was singing its praises. She has lovely skin for her age and seems a little more au naturel. I do use retinoid products but I figured I\u2019d try a natural blend. Unfortunately for me, it created breakouts and cystic acne. My skin is clear, more on the combination side, but sensitive. I just can\u2019t use straight oils, no matter how purified and of high quality. It may work for others, but unfortunately did not work for me. The scent was mild and did not bother me. The texture was smooth, a hint of tackiness and very organic smelling and feeling. I returned it at Kohl\u2019s.",

I can't use thick moisturizers because they make me break out, I have reactive sensitive skin and this oil hasn't caused any problems. It's not too thick, but does an amazing job moisturizing. I will say though, that you can tell that it's on your skin, I don't mind that that much, especially since I rarely wear makeup. If I feel that it's making me a little extra shiny I'll just put some translucent powder over the top to matte it out.",

I would use this 20 minutes or so before bedtime. You won't see results in a week...unfortunately skincare takes about 6 weeks to see true results. If you are looking for more immediate results, you should probably use a hyaluronic acid as this pulls water into the skin. This product is great for more long term effects.",
