Amazon sent a replacement, and it had the same problems. 2 of the pictures are my old ones purchased ~11mo ago and used (not abused) consistently since. I'd say which 2, but Amazon reorders them.

      "text": "Have you ever tried cutting a wire with a thick pair of scissors? And as you put pressure the scissors kind of bend out of shape and really struggle to cut it? That's a little bit how it is working with these snips. These things are AWESOME for small zip ties, and would be great to throw in a portable kit of some kind, but if you're thinking of cutting anything other than the smallest wires (Doesn't work well on stranded core wires) then you're going to want something a little beefier",

Removes nylon/plastic tie straps without nicking wire insulation. 3. Let's you cut a wire harness sheath off without touching any wire inside.",
