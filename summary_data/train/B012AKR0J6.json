It doesn't have the excess of zippers, useless compartments, or the long adjustment straps that are hallmarks of \"freshman\" backpacks. Overall, it remains functional without looking dorky, and it comes at a fair price. I really don't know what else I could ask for in a backpack, and I am so glad that I bought it!\" |the Teen Boy|",

Best advice is that you get an external laptop sleeve to go around your laptop and put it the laptop sleeve. Otherwise top marks for a backpack at this price point.",

There is plenty of room for a purse, change of clothes (no shoes) and your plastic bag of grooming supplies and meds for an overnight.

It is spacious, holds more than I ever though it could. Straps are comfortable and the color of the bag goes with almost anything. I give it an \"indestructable / 10\"",

The color is exactly what I expected and looks great. I'm a small lady and this backpack holds everything I need without sticking out too far. It has a pocket inside perfect for a laptop and another small pocket on the side inside. The straps are padded and comfortable. I'd definitely buy it again.",

I've also used this for an overnight trip. It worked great!",
