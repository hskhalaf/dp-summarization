      "text": "First of all it is quite sturdy once properly assembled. But there is no finish on the table top or the chair seats. The wood has been stained but not protected with any finish. So, to protect the table top against spills or stains you will either have to sand and coat the table top with several coats of polyurethane or apply paste wax. Another issue is that the table legs are not positioned exactly at the corners. Thus narrowing the seating space on the long sides of the table making it impossible to have more than one chair on the long sides. But still not a bad dining set. Just think carefully about your needs before choosing this product.",

I was able to put the dinning set together by myself and I\u2019m sure it took about 1-2 hours.

UPDATED: do not call the customer care number for Ashley furniture just call this number, 888-280-4331 and Amazon will take care of you. Thank you Amazon! I can always count on them to make it right.

Be warned, the good price does come with strings attached, you may find some damaged pieces.

While they are very sturdy, only one of the 3 was level when set on the floor. The table was level and sturdy once put together. The only negatives on it were the scuffs on the edges and top, and one of the threads in the legs came out when screwing the bolt in. I just tapped it back in and didn't tighten it to much.",
