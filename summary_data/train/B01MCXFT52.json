      "text": "Due to being empty-nesters now, we downsized our gas grill. I was a bit worried bout having enough heat for a good grilling session since we went from a three burner to the two burner. However, I can get temperatures up to 650* with this grill. We use the side burner to fry bacon. The only issue we've had with it was keeping the temperature of the side burner high enough to fry the bacon during a very windy morning. It eventually got the job done, but took much longer than normal. Other times we've used it to fry bacon there have been no problems. You can't go wrong with a Weber.",

      "text": "I traded my old propane grill in for the Genesis II. The grilling before was good, but this grill is phenomenal. The control I have over the temperature and the ability to do indirect grilling has changed the way I grill. At first I laughed when they talked about the flavorizer bars enhancing the flavor, but believe me they really do. All of the built in features including the grill light, knob lights and gas measuring system really enhance the grilling experience. I love this grill and plan to use it for years to come, experimenting more now with this remarkable grilling system.",

The sideburner is ideal for sauteing onions and mushroom topper. The only negative is the unsightly exposure of the natural gas hose on the side. It seems there could be a shield of some sort.
