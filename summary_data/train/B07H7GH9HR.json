It will fit that role by the carbon fiber construction and solid locks for the legs and the 360 degree head. Super good work Geekoto.

Tons of breathtaking scenery that would have been difficult or impossible to photograph without a good tripod. This tripod lived up to it's claims. Lightweight enough for travel (we were on the move the whole trip - planes, jeeps, cable cars, hikes, you name it). Tough enough to handle the travel with no signs of wear. Steady enough (with the help of the camera bag hooked to the bottom for added weight) to allow night photography in mild to moderate wind, adaptable enough to use effectively as a monopod and macro-tripod as well as a traditional tripod. Definitely a keeper.",

The monopod steps are too involved and cannot easily be done during an event or day trip. I will have to continue carrying my other monopod instead. The folding process can sometimes pinch your fingers. The inversion of the legs is also awkward. I can live with these but will hope the designer will take this feedback into future designs.",

When you use this tripod, make sure you are extending all three legs, all the way first before raising the middle neck, it becomes terribly unbalanced, if you don't extend legs first and just do the neck. Also if you have a heavier setup you must use weight like back pack hanging from center so that it is more stable.

It will easily hold a 13 lbs rifle steady out to 600 yards shooting from a sitting position with arca swiss attached to the rifle.

The legs are adjustable at several angles. It was a little confusing at first because the legs close by folding up (which does help protect the head of the tripod in storage).",
