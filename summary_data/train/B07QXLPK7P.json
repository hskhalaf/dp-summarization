Cleaned it very well. Easy to clean. Blade comes out easy. I sliced turkey really nicely. Great power for how little.. also sliced Genoa salami. It was no problem. Very good slicer for the buck. Hope it last a long time.",

Clean is not hard but the bottom of the blade is a little hard to clean as others mentioned. I have used this twice already to slice meat very thin for hot pot. The sliced meat was thin and cutting was easy even blade rotates slightly slower tan I expected. I can already tell how much money I will save this winter by slicing my own meat for hot pot. Great slicer!! I am definitely a very happy customer.",
