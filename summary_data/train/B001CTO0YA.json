Easy to fit in a purse, backpack, sports bag or lunch. Healthier than chips, candy and pop for kids. My family loves the variety of flavors. They are even mom-approved.

They hold a different texture and are stickier than other leathers I have tried. Portions are sized appropriately although you will probably eat more than one.

It could\u2019ve just fallen out as it was being packaged. I have never had this happen before, though. Overall, these are delicious and we love them.",

I've tried a couple & we both agree that most taste very alike, so I'm not sure flavor really matters, oddly enough. The downside is that they are really sticky so my son uses the wrapper to hold on to it. To me, that's annoying. If he asks for more, I will buy them.",

Great for the entire family. The only flavor that lingers is the apricot, but even that one tastes great. The fruit leather is soft, but not too much that it sticks in your teeth. I buy this as a snack for my toddler, but mommy takes one to work now and then since they are so tasty. The apple in this pack is actually different than the warehouse club, a great surprise.",
