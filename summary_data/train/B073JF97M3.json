I tried them tonight for the first time, and they worked like a charm. No burning or tearing up at all.",

What a bummer! Because they are so comfortable and offer more peripheral vision due to design but obviously something is way wrong causing significant distortion underwater. EDIT 1/5/19: eversport sent me 2 new goggles to remedy the complaint about distortion above. They are completely different style and colors but at least the company tried to remedy the problem as original goggle not usable due to distortion.",

The Nose Bridge area would get irritated even with replacing the nose bridge with the bigger alternative (note I also had issues swapping out the nose bridge as it was extremely difficult).

These scratches do affect the ability to see underwater. My kid's goggles get much more rough treatment and do not have any significant scratches.

I bought these in Nov. 2018, and will be getting a back up pair Oct. 2019. One pair had the clip break, and we are using the back up pair. But really for a kid that does both summer and indoor winter swim, leaves goggles and caps everywhere, this is a great inexpensive option. They get the job done for competitive swim and its not the end of the world if they get lost or broken. Plus you always have a back up.",

The strap is wide so the goggles don't slide down. I would definitely recommend these goggles.",
