I use real golf balls with it, chip about 50 balls/per day at it (I don\u2019t hit that many into the net, to be very clear! I\u2019m no pro!), and it often just sits in the yard under the sun. I put it up in the winter, but otherwise, it\u2019s out and ready to go each day. This daily routine gives me a high degree of comfort around the green and has cut no less than 5 strokes from my game. Love it!",

I have used it in the backyard, garage, park and on the chipping area at my course with actual golf balls. I use a chipping mat in the garage and sometimes in the backyard.

Have a chipping/hitting map coming and a wedge set, so I can't wait to set up the whole rig. It folds up small, like a junior camp chair, with ease. Also, each target hole has its own closed net, so it's easy when you retrieve balls to see which hit the bulls-eye, which hit inside the yellow, and which hit in the outer, black ring. Pretty cool.",
