The fact that there is NOT a built in strap at the front of the boot meant that this gear could NOT be used at tournament. If you are looking for practice gear only then i would highly recommend this gear. If you are looking for gear to use at practice and at tournaments, the select another brand of Foot Gear. I did purchase Hands, Shins, Head gear and all of that product is perfectly fine and I would purchase those again.",

The foam is sturdy and thick and it is absolutely exactly as advertised. Zero complaints. My only issue (and it is with all brands of protectors) is that they are listed as small, medium, large etc. There is no shoe size equivalent for each measurement. I initially ordered one size too small, however, I was able to immediately return and exchange them for the correct size. The order came fast as well. The guards are well priced and I can confidently recommend them.",

Cut the elastic off the worn set I was replacing and threaded it through the slots on the front of the pad, sewed it in place, and voila - no more problem.

There is nothing on the bottom to help keep your foot secure, which of course requires you to make them very tight, which of course causes foot cramps. I can't recommend anyone buy these. Of the cheap sparring boots out there these are very poor quality.",
