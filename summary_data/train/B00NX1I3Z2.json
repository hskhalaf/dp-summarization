Worse yet, though - even if it did, the bolts heads would be snugged down against nothing but a thin piece of plastic. With this installed I'm pretty sure I could just tear the exterior lock off with a small pair of pliers. This is a nice idea but poorly executed, I'm disappointed.",

Presuming you can get it to work don't go to far because the plastic baking is what is holding your lock now so anyone with a screw driver or anything similar can rip it out of the door.",

First off, the plastic baseplate provided and pre-cut holes do not last under the weight of this product and will therefore strip. Second, the internal teeth are so closer to the internal parts that the rub up against them and render locking and unlocking completely useless. To sum things up, I have a $100 paperweight and this has been the most dissatisfying product I have bought in a very long time.",
