I'm working through a temporary back issue, and side-sleeping has become necessary (I'm usually a back-sleeper). This pillow really does the alignment trick, and the best part is, I don't have to strain or adjust to position it correctly, since for now, doing so while also tangling with bedsheets and blanket all while not waking up the wife is difficult, and a little painful. The strap makes everything easier, so I'll also say, you gotta have the strap!",

I also chose this pillow because it had a strap that can be adjusted to your leg or completely removed. I have been using the pillow for over a week and my lower back feels much better in the morning. The strap keeps the pillow attached without having to be adjusted when I turn over but I have never used another type so I assume the strap is a plus.",

      "text": "This is the best knee pillow I've found. It is smaller than a lot of them (approx. 6\" x 10\") and the narrow section in the center is only about 2 1/2\". This works perfectly for me, since I am a smaller person. The foam is much denser than others I have tried and as a result, the foam in the center doesn't get flattened. I really like the adjustable strap to help keep it in place. It also works well if you want to have it a little higher on your leg, such as right above the knee, giving your knee more room to flex/bend. Overall, a good product at a good price.",

Propped just above my knees it stays in place when I turn at night and it is so light weight I forget it's there.

I can also use the knee pillow to do my physical therapy. I feel like I'm getting a better night's sleep using the knee pillow. Very satisfied with my purchase.",

I thought the earplugs were a pointless bonus until a barking dog woke me up. They tuned out to come in very handy.",

I was afraid that it would squish down in the middle and just disappear but so far it seems to be holding up and benefiting me, so regardless that it does squish somewhat it still does help a LOT. I would recommend. The cover has a zipper so I don't worry about leaning it. The cover is also very soft.",
