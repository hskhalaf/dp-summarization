At the gym, I had to have the volume all the way up which, IS audible to the people around you. This is the first thing I\u2019ve returned to Amazon after two hours of use.",

The originals: when I put in earplugs they would get louder. New ones: not at all. Originals: when I would press them into my ear to really hear a good jam, they would get louder and richer, almost as good as in-ear phones. New ones: no louder and they get tinny sounding. Originals: overall volume much louder. New ones: Perry weak. Such a huge disappointment. Why they are not exactly the same sound, with just a more comfortable setup, I don't understand. Maybe I got a set of counterfeits?",

I drive over the road for a living and want to be able to keep my ears open while enjoying music during the long hours behind the wheel. So far, these seem perfect.

Sad to read the same criticism on the follow up model, the Aeropex, so apparently this has not been addressed (there were complaints about this issue on the AfterShokz support forums too). Otherwise, I'd recommend them for active people on the roads (runners, cyclists, ...) who need to have situational awareness.

Those were great but would fall out of my ears when I got really sweaty on hot days and long runs. These are absolutely amazing as I can hear my music and the outside noise and I don\u2019t have to worry about them falling out of my ears I wish I would\u2019ve bought these a looooong time ago.",

I have come to love the sound and the feel of these. At a moderate volume you can continue to have conversations and fully hear the environment around you. They have great sound even at full volume. I don't think I will ever willingly use traditional headphones or earbuds again. So so impressed.",

He likes them as they are more comfortable than having earbuds in his ears on a long run or bike ride, but he said the sound isn't a huge difference and he needs to have the volume up pretty high to be able to hear the music over the ambient sound, which defeats the purpose. He does wear them for the comfort factor and enjoys them.",

Highly recommend especially for the Amazon price and shipping speed.",
