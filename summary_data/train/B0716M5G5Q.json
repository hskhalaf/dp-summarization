The side pockets are very small but they will hold a multi-tool on one side and tire irons with a very small patch kit on the other side. The inside holds two tube boxes and miscellaneous items. On the door is a hook for keys, a small mesh pocket and you can clip a rear light. In addition, there is reflective tape around the bag. The straps do an excellent job of holding the bag in place and seems to be designed to fit every road bicycle.",

Plus it perfectly matches my black and yellow Giant road bike. Love this product! Highly recommend it.",

For the price two years isn't a horrible amount of time, but I would have expected it to last longer, I will be replacing with something different.",
