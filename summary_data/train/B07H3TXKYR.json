Have not stained from Cheeto's in my son's lunch either. Fresh rinsed grapes did not leak. Kids think he has a \"cool mom\" Cause he has cool baggies. I feel better not putting plastic in the landfill from regular baggies. and no losing the lids to the sandwich containers! Highly recommend. Will update after we've used them for a few months as to durability....",
