I have thick, wavy hair that I get cut on the shorter side and it does a great job. It doesn't run when I sweat and gives me an all day hold. I've tried several pomades but I don't care for the overly styled appearance. I recommend this to anyone not into the high shine, trying too hard look but wants a product that still gives them a strong hold while leaving the hair feeling soft.",

Cons: product dries out and becomes much harder to spread. If you don't use much and you don't apply it often, it loses a lot of its moisture and tends to pull pretty hard when applied. Product does have a scent but it is mold and I can smell it once applied. If your hair gets wet from rain or sweat, this will lose its hold pretty quickly and easily.",
