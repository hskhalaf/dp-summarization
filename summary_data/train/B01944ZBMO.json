LOL! How the wheel spins! Now Jobs is regarded as a genius whose posthumous autobiography is regarded as canon by the Apple-faithful. In reality he was a charlatan thief who was, at best, a leech. At worst, he can be realistically regarded as a megalomaniacal self-absorbed fanatic. Oh yeah, go Google! ;o) My wife loves her new tablet!",
