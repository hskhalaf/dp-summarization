So every time I open the garage door and walk to the mailbox I do a quick scan of the lawn. It's not that big. Any weeds or mystery plants get \"The Treatment\" using this hand weeder. I am absolutely winning the war against them thanks to this tool. It takes under 10 minutes a week. Now, the weeds tremble when Inopen the garage door and walk out. They are doomed!",

The metal seems thick enough, but this tool looks extremely poorly put together. The ring between the metal fork piece and the handle is simply glued on, not attached to the metal fork whatsoever. The glue is exposed and messy, the ring isn't even, and the hole where the metal fork piece sticks in the handle is too wide for the fork, so there's a visible gap. Going from looks alone, this won't last more than a year.",
