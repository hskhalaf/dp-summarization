It appears to be sturdy and stable, and should serve your coffee table needs as long as you don't intend to tap dance on it wearing a lampshade on your head. I'm happy with my purchase and will definitely buy more home furnishings from the company.",

Very sturdy. Table was easy to put together. However, the finish nothing short of garbage. After approximately a month of use, the surface has two bubbles around light scratches, and now has peeled up at one corner, FYI it's a giant sticker. There is no sealant over it whatsoever. I certainly would not purchase again, let alone recommend it, not for $60. This is a $30 table.",

This thing has zero water resistance whatsoever, which isn't really practical for a coffee table. I'm giving it two stars because I like the design, and for the price I paid I can repurpose the legs with a better tabletop.

The only reason why I'm not giving this 5 stars is because the wood-like top seal does bubble when liquid is left on its surface. Once we discovered it, we avoid that issue by using coasters :-)",
