I now give it 5 stars since I discovered how to defeat the foam while adding even more nutritional value. All you have to do is start with a squirt of liquefied coconut oil, make a smooth paste with the product and then simply add the water (I also add power beet and super green powders and sometimes opt for avocado oil). There is zero foam!",

I sometimes add a half cup or so of almond milk for flavor- it doesn\u2019t clump or separate after it\u2019s mixed with that hot water. With unsweetened almond milk, it tastes great.

I dumped the mixture into a glass blender, added 3 tblspoons raw cacao powder, a splash of coconut cream, and lakonta maple sweetener, and blended. The consistency is ideal, and the powder fully dissolved into the mixture. I garnished with cayenne. Steal my recipe.",

    "description": "A Worldwide Traditional Superfood\n\nFor centuries, our ancestors around the world used bones out of necessity. Hunting an animal was so rare they used everything from the meat, hides and bones. Once the pot was invented, people would prepare the bones to make a broth and add vegetables, tubers and meat. Cultures around the world have bene making bone broth for thousands of years. (evidence of soup existence goes back to 20,000 BC) and is still very much apart of traditional cuisines\n\nAntioxidant Capacity and the Benefits \n\nGlycine stimulates the production of glutathione; the body\u2019s master antioxidant. Glycine may also work to reduce oxidative stress in people who suffer from metabolic issues and promote quality sleep without disrupting the next day with brain fog and sluggishness. In fact, studies show that glycine encouraged better memory and alerts the next day. Proline plays an important role in apoptosis, the process by which the body breaks down old cells, cleans up waste products, and recycles raw materials for use in healthy cells. In addition, proline has the capability to scavenge free radicals before they wreak havoc on the body\u2019s tissues.\n\nMore benefits you will enjoy with Necessity Nutritions Grass-Fed Bone Broth:\n\u2705 Necessity Nutritions Bone Broth is organic, non-GMO, Gluten Free, Soy Free, Dairy Free and Grass-Fed\n\u2705 Manufactured in the USA following GMP procedures.\n\u2705 Each bottle contains a 22 Day Supply of 20 grams of protein per scoop for you to use daily.\n\u2705 Whisk into hot drinks, soup or dressings.

      "ENCOURAGE BONE & JOINT HEALTH - Bone broth contains glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate to supply joint lubrication so one part of the bone can easily glide over another. Collagen has also been shown to relieve joint pain. Drinking a product made from bones only makes sense to benefit our bones - from the amino acids, phosphorous, calcium and other nutrients. A true leaky gut repair supplement.",
