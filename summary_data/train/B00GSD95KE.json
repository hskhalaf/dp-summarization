There is a hood and nice snow bib inside the bottom of jacket. Lots of zipper pockets as well. I am 150 lbs and this large was perfect size as I wanted a little extra space for a fleece underneath. The medium I originally ordered fit but was too tight for a fleece underneath.",

I agree with some other reviewers that it seems to keep you warmer when you are being active as opposed to when you are just standing or sitting somewhere. It has great wind protection and is waterproof. I wore it in 30 degree temperatures with a sweater underneath and was warm enough. I also agree that it runs a bit small. I am 5'7 137 pounds and ordered a large which I think fits perfectly. I have room to layer underneath comfortably but it doesn't feel too big with just a t-shirt underneath.",

Not warm at all, more like a waterproof shell but there\u2019s no way to layer underneath unless I get at least, the large or x-large. Very stiff and this jacket reminds me of when I get men\u2019s clothing where it\u2019s very tight against the chest with no room for a woman\u2019s breasts, not even a small woman. Sleeves are also very narrow so again, hard to layer underneath. I would have returned but did not try on until months later. I\u2019ll donate this one.",

The only thing I am missing from my other Columbia jacket is the neck protection at the top of the zipper. I usually wear a turtle neck anyway, so it's not that big a deal for me at this time.",

I used it while rolling around with the dogs in deep snow, where the hood and skirt and adjustable cuffs kept the snow from getting in anywhere and I used it on snowshoe hikes when it was really cold and just unzipped a little if I got too warm.

When I received it, I was NOT convinced it would hold up during our Colorado trip. I returned it and for $30 more i purchased this jacket. WOW. It did not disappoint! I am from TX and felt warm wearing this while snowmobiling in Vail. Worth it. Wish i had done the same with the highly rated non-brand snow pants on Amazon and socks :/",
