I did run into one glitch, however, this machine is set up for 4 times a day, my patient only needs three. I couldn't find instructions on how to set it up for three. My solution was to set up evening and night prescriptions for the same time. Problem solved. All of my patient's caregivers are praising this product. PS I named her \"Big Mouth\". But, in a good way. On the loud setting, she can be heard from anywhere in the house.",

I am delighted with the unit and would buy it again if this one were damaged from a fall or something. We gave one to a neighbor in assisted living too.",

So, if I was not in the room with the alarm, I could not hit the stop button quickly. It does not turn off after a certain amount of time. So, it would screech for 10 minutes or more. I was in and out of the hospital so we missed the 30 day return deadline. The seller will not refund the money. I won't buy from them again.",

The only thing that would make it better is to set your own reminder for things other than meds. But that is not its purpose. It works well and is easy to use. I highly recommend it.",
