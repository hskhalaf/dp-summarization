We've mounted GoPros to the inside and outside of trucks for years, but to get TV-quality resolution I needed to utilize a more professional camera and the Fat Gecko facilitated this. In fact the Fat Gecko performed flawlessly, even though, (as the attached video shows), my unstabilized Canon 6d did not. As it turned out a highly-stabilized camera is essential for off-road filming. My next plan is to use my Fat Gecko to attach a Lumix G9 - which has five-axis stabilization.",

I replaced the item assuming it was just a defective product but nope, even the replacement had the same issue. You set everything up, then screw on your camera and watch as the arm slowly starts to slip and rotate because of the lose bolt. I tried to tighten the bolt but nothing worked.",

Up close it seems big but truth in fact, it's not obtrusive at all. In fact, since it does the job intended sooooo weelll, I don't care about size but be assured it's normal. Perfect in my opinion. I've already recommended it to others. Would definitely buy again.",

Includes depress button to evacuate the air from within the cup, and a moveable tab to release the vacuum once it's in place. I decided on the single cup instead of the double-cup based on the recommendation of a captain who has used a single-cup for years, without a negative result. Given that the downside of the Gecko mounts is their bulk, I opted for the single. The only downside I perceive is the bulkiness, thus the 4-star on versatility. However, that bulkiness is what achieves the sturdiness. It's a well designed piece of equipment.",

Overall, although someone will always find faults in every product, I sincerely believe that the Fat Gecko will be an excellent mount for the majority of your needs.",

I tested the mount by driving approximately 20 miles over smooth and rough roads, very rough roads. between the mount and the built in steady feature of the camcorder there was no vibration or unwanted motion of the camcorder even when driving through dips in the road. I used the horizon as a reference point when available and houses when the horizon was not available. By the way, I was using the extension that came with the mount because of the slant of my windshield.",

And finally, on the inside of the front windshield. It held without fail during my driving test of 25mph max. I drove slowly over several unavoidable speedbumps as well and it didn't budge. It is EXTREMELY strong. The components are either metal or a very strong and durable plastic. I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this product. Why can't more manufacturers sell products that actually work????",

Although I haven't had a chance to test it out at triple digit speeds, I did do a quick test on local streets and the mount seemed very secure. I would say this mount is just as good as the suction mount that comes with the GoPro cameras (which I also have). Here's a link to the Mic test using this mount:",
