The instructions were great. Other people have mentioned breakage, but the only issue I had was I chipped a small spot on the bottom corner of the sliding door when I was lifting it up onto the threshold. Should have padded the threshold... my fault. I installed it myself with help from my son, definitely a 2 person job. The 2 glass pieces are HEAVY, and the crate it came in was barely movable by one person.",

      "text": "For $750 it's hard to complain. This style in a customer door is $2,500+. The entry portion has a rail siliconed to the floor. This really should be considered an optional install item but I'm sure the manufacturer/ installers don't want water damage liability. If you know water will not leak out of the bottom of the sliding portion (when in closed position) you should instruct the installer to simply not install that piece. Best case scenario it takes away the \"threshold\" look. Worst case scenario you call the installer back for a $50 charge probably.",

The roller operation is smooth and silent. Looks fantastic in a contemporary bathroom. Two things to note: First, the panel next to the showerhead is fixed so you have to stand in the shower to turn on the water. Second, since there is not a full bottom track on the sliding portion, a small amount of water will seep under the door. It's not much if you keep the spray pointed a little away, but it's not something that happens on a full track door.",

      "text": "42 years in remodeling. Do not try to install this if you don't have someone that knows what they are doing. Walls and pan MUST be 100% dead-on plumb and level. Very high quality, but the instructions are fair at best. Mostly, the lack of telling you that all of the bolt-ons are eccentric. That's good for the adjustment factor after installing, but the main guide rail bolts that hold the stationary glass should not be adjustable. Double check your measurements off of the top of the glass when you put these on. It will cause problems if they are not even.",
