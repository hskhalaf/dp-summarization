He has the matching head that goes with this stick and that for sure made a difference in his accuracy. He said he can\u2019t even imagine having anything else other than this. Don\u2019t hesitate to buy this for yourself or your son.. well worth the money. My son has at least 10 wooden sticks and breaks those like nothing but the dragonfly held up with flying colors.",

      "Our exclusive Surface Veil Technology is engineered to increase the overall toughness of the Dragonfly Eight",
      "Our proprietary 12K Intelligent Weave Technology is designed to stabilize the hands and push energy towards the head of the stick when passing or shooting",
      "Uniform Release provides a consistent flex profile throughout the top 2/3 of the shaft regardless of a player\u2019s hand positioning",
      "We achieve flex by manipulating the orientation of the carbon fiber. Our shaft\u2019s bend when you need it to, but retains its firmness for maximum control. Conventional shafts that tout flex often use fiberglass, a cheaper, less durable material, to increase the bendability",
      "Intelligent Weave allows for a more uniform construction as the carbon filaments in each tow (row) are spread out creating a thinner and more closed woven fabric providing reduced weight, optimal mechanicals and minimal voids in the composite layup. By reducing \u201cCrimp\u201d (when carbon fiber runs in a uniform direction(s) that is not structurally beneficial) we can decrease weight by reducing non-essential material while maintaining the structural integrity required by lacrosse"
