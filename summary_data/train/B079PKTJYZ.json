I think it was a little much to do in one sitting but as he has a distructive younger brother we were afraid if we didn\u2019t complete small pieces might go missing. My sister and daughter ended up joining us and while frustrating deciphering the graphics near the end(there\u2019s just so many pieces it gets hard to tell what goes where) we enjoyed it and best of all it was quality time spent together with a fun outcome. I would purchase another project just maybe not attempt to complete on a school night! ;)",

If I had to do this all over again, I would have started her out with a significantly smaller K'NEX kit to gauge her interest, as we did with Legos. (And Mosaics)",
