      "text": "This is a well-designed and well-made tool. These are actually made in Japan, too. Excellent. This cutter has impressed me. In my opinion, it's cheap considering the quick work it makes of cutting hard cable and wire. I have had it for about 8 months now and cut a variety of materials, from steel cable to copper to wire coat hangers. It has had no problem cutting anything that will fit within its jaws. Which is one, small draw-back. The jaws don't open very wide. See the attached photo to see it fully opened with a penny for scale. I will buy another when this one wears out, which should be a long time from now.",

It cuts 1/8 cable cleanly without frays and the handles are long enough to reduce the cutting efforts. I have completed about 100 cable cuttings so far and the cutter works the same as the first cut. We shall see how long it stays as a precision cutter but I do have high hopes. I would definitely recommend this cutter over the 3 other cutters that I have tried. Good value for the price.",

The cutter blades are sharp and make very nice clean cuts that leave no frayed wire strands. The handles are vinyl dipped and contoured, so are reasonably comfortable in your hand and also give good leverage for cutting. They have a spring to hold them open and a flip lever to keep them closed for storage. These cutters have \"Made in Japan\" stamped on them and seem to be very nicely made overall, so I'm very happy with the purchase.",

Don't expect cheaper wire cutters to perform this well. These are reasonably priced, considering there are cutters that cost twice as much. Like others have stated, these are made in Japan.",

Now I always heat the spot I'm cutting until it glows and then let it air-cool first, softening the metal so that the jaws aren't damaged. On the bright side the cut ends are clean and square- not pinched like with bolt cutters -and they work great for bicycle cables and housing.",

The protective casing is vinyl-coated 1/8th inch aluminum, which this cutter also cut mostly well. It bent the ends a bit, and took multiple tries, but I think that's because of the spiral structure of the casing. Since I'm not sure if it's the structure of that cable or the cutters themselves, I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. Hopefully it holds out over the years.",
