I was hesitant to purchase though because the reviews were so mixed, with many stating that the bed was damaged or missing pieces. I took a leap of faith and ordered it anyway because the price was unbeatable and I REALLY wanted this bed....and I\u2019m glad I did. We received a well packaged product in pristine condition with all of the necessary pieces included. It took my husband about 2 hours put it together by himself and the outcome was perfect! Such a beautiful little bed, perfect for my little princess!!",
