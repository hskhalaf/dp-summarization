The OGX brand has been growing in popularity, so I thought would give it a try. I put the OGX, in my hair after showering, and then blow dry. It does not make my hair feel smooth and soft, instead it's just feels like it has a residue on it. I am not loving the fragrance either. This may work for someone else but not for me. I just don't care for the way it makes my hair feel, so I will not purchase this again.",
