These sinks have disappeared from the marketplace, and we were fortunate to find the replacement through Amazon. Good news was the replacement was several hundred $$ cheaper than the original 3 years ago. Shipping was very quick, and the packaging was outstanding. Since it was an exact replacement, installation was (relatively) easy. It is heavy, so you need a strong plumber. The pictures show the broken sink just to let you see what can happen if you get too clumsy.",

A 30\" sink should be no more than 30\". Adding trim or caulk to cover gaps is easy, but increasing cabinet gaps on frameless cabinets is not easy or aesthetically pleasing. My review is exclusively related the lack of precision in the specs provided. Hopefully somebody finds this helpful because I didn't see one review, question or comment mention the width being over. Even the Home Depot site lists this at a 30.25\" sink (probably due to several people having the same issue).",
