When I ordered it I made sure I purchased the adult size however, when it arrived it was smaller than his current youth Douglas brand backplate. The design and quality was nice but the adult size is very small. I also made sure that it was the adult size and not the youth size I purchased. When it arrived it was clearly marked adult backplate.",
