      "text": "I do sound work for film. I used to use Sony MDR-7510's for post production mixing and editing (I prefer to use those for production work still because they are smaller and lighter and still give great sound) but I got these for post production mixing after a recommendation from a producer. The difference is remarkable! Compared to the MDR-7510's, I can hear the different layers of sound independently instead of being blended together into one layer of sound. The music, sound effects, dialogue, etc, all sound independent from each other and make for an incredible listening experience. I use these on my MacBook Pro for editing and for watching movies. I think they're worth every penny.",

My only real hangup is how quickly the material can come apart on the headband, and that over roughly 6 months of use how the material in the can over the left ear began to separate as well. This is not an uncommon issue, as I deal with a number of these headphones at my school studio. Sennheiser should likely address this in future models of this product. However, the headphones have great sound quality, they feel comfortable over my ears, they do cancel noise, and very effectively, and these will likely last me for years to come.",

Since the coils begin immediately out of the phones, even adding an line extension wouldn't help. Too bad. It may sound trivial, but even while using my $15 headphones, I can reach that state where I'm not aware of having headphones on during hours of practice. This impossible with the heavy coiled cord of the HD280. Would gladly buy if it had a straight cord.",

If intended for computer or phone use I would recommend purchasing a separate portable amp to drive them, and they sound pretty lifeless through a typical sound card. So really they are a $200 set of phones if you count the purchase of an outboard amp/DAC. But even with the extra cost of an amp to properly drive them I believe they are a steal at the price point.
