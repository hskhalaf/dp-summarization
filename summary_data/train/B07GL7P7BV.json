However, this time my feet hurt worse than when I wore the pair before. I compared the memory foam on my old to new, and the new is thinner! No wonder my feet hurt worse! I won\u2019t be buying Skechers anymore and they were always my go to brand for standing 8 hours at work. The search is on.",

      "text": "This is my second pair. I still have my first pair as well. They are as comfortable as slippers, but provide enough support for working several hours on your feet. The great part is you can wear them as a full shoe, or slip-ons, since the backs fold in if you want to wear them as more of a slipper or mule. They also wash beautifully in the machine. Just remember you need to air dry after washing. Do not put them in the dryer. I love these shoes!",
