Doesn\u2019t have the bells and whistles as my old on but the platinum surface makes a big difference. I have a lot of thick, treated hair that gets frizzy because of the humidity on the Gulf Coast where I live.",

My hair usually straightens very well but this left my hair puffy. Returned to seller and sticking to my larger tool.",

It actually gets the job done and your hair looks good after it, not frizzed out or damaged. The only thing that I don't like about it but not a huge problem, is that the \"on and off\" switch light doesn't light up well on mine. You can't tell whether it's on or off, unless you have the lights off in the room. So I would always just make sure to actually switch off when you're done, or unplug immediately- don't rely on the light :)",

At first I thought it was taking a bit too long to heat, but now it seems fine and I am very glad I kept it. Don't be tempted by the less expensive mini irons, as the quality is far inferior to the Babyliss. You get what you pay for. I have already bought a second one for my travel tote.",

It got my hair straight and reverted very very slowly for a humid climate. My only complaint is that the top and the bottom of the flat iron (on the other side of the plates) is so poorly insulated that it's really really easy to burn your fingers if they slide too far up. That's pretty easy to do if you're used to a bigger flat iron- because this one is itty bitty. Otherwise, I'm happy. Beats my last flat-iron!",
