They have on-off switches, so you can save battery/ bulb life. (Apparently, the battery can be replaced.) 3. These \"candles\" emit a decent amount of light ... not some anemic flame. 4. The light flickers, just like real candles. 5. LED candles are safer than real candles. 6. The price was right.",
