Anyway, the toy has already provided hours of fun for my daughter (and myself). The part that you fill with Play-doh to make the hair come out is super easy to clean and my daughter loves to cut and brush the hair that comes out. You can also make braids with the Pascal piece and the inside of the hair brush. FYI: A bobby pin will remove Play-doh stuck in the brush with no problem. I would definitely purchase again!",
