It is heavy and feels like a solid piece of equipment It's something of a fiddle getting the included batterty in placeAs a bonus it has a keyhole cutout in back and a fold out stand. The leads aren't impressive but heavy duty looking, I will replace the alligator clips with mini grabbers It will replace two el chepo meters So far accuracy has been fine for my hobbyist needs. My only caveat is plan on replacing the leads",

No instructions came with it but common sense allows easy operation, If you want a simple DMM, this one very well could serve your purpose unless the backlit display is desired. I will not return it as it functions but will need to replace it very soon as I need a backlit display. 3 stars due to the display and lack of a users manual but aside from that it would be 5 stars.

The concept is great, just needs a tweak in this department so the alligator clips have a more solid contact.",
