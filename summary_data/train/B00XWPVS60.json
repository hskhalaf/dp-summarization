I like the half sizes, i got 10+1/2 UK and I have to say they are perfect. The soles are firmer / harder than I thought that they would be, there are bouncier trainers out there, but, i still give these a five star rating. They are well aerated and yet warm on the feet, by the way. I hope you enjoy your pair as much as I'm enjoying mine. So well priced, I might get a second pair for broader colour co-ordination with my wardrobe!",

Nike have made the mid-foot area of their trainers narrower over recent years and i cant wear most of their premium trainers now unfortunately but these are a pinch wider in thus area and therefore manageable.",
