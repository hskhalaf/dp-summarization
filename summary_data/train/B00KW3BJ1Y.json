      "text": "As a photographic artist I want to capture every detail of a scene with complete clarity, right into the corners of the frame. My Nikon D800 DSLR does that beautifully, but it is useful to also have a pocket camera for those fleeting moments. The RX100 does this, and its RAW files let me make and sell stunning prints up to 50x75 inches. I bought the RX100 Mark 3 as a replacement for my Mark 1. The new lens is even sharper, and the slightly wider zoom suits me better (even if also slightly shorter). I also enjoy the RX100 for its build quality. Anyone who enjoy handling a gem-like mechanical device will love this camera.",

Nothing negative to say about this product. All expectations met or exceeded. If you want a camera that is almost SLR quality but still fits in your pocket and costs a fraction of what an SLR + lens(es) costs, then this is the camera for you. Some tips on battery life: turn on airplane mode unless using NFC to transfer photos, turn down the flash exposure, you can also set the view screen to turn off with the dial button if using the view finder instead.",

I didn't have to be. Superb quality of build, superb results. Am genuinely thrilled !! Am looking forward to experimenting a bit more with manual settings, as initial results have been good.
