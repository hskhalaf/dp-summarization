      "text": "I had a perfectly fine travel roller bag but Alaska Airlines recently went to enforcing a new maximum carry-on bag size of 22'' x 14'' x 9'' - these dimensions include the wheels and handles. My previous bag was about 1 1/2\" too long with the wheels. So I had to order this bag where they claimed the dimensions are 22 x 14 x 9. I just took the bag out of the box from Amazon and measured it. It seems that it is 22\" x 14\" x 10\". So they are not quite right in their dimensions on Amazon. I can only hope that Alaska and other airlines do not get too picky by the extra inch of depth.",

It's also easy to store in the overhead bins - I'm only 5' tall & usually ask a taller passenger to help me get my bag down from the bin - well, I was able to lift it out of the bin by myself. Very happy with this bag & recommend it.",

Of lightweight material, when packed for an international trip, suitcase usually weighs around 44#, well under the 50# airline limit. Using 'packing cubes' (highly recommend), interior space is generous; have yet to use the expandable option. A needed improvement would be on interior straps. If not for 'packing cubes', I do believe contents would shift extensively. Outer pocket offers easy access to a coat; smaller pocket for umbrella or extra bag. Prefer two-wheeled luggage which better accommodates stairs, rough surfaces, escalators, and the partially hidden wheels are less prone to damage.",

In many places where the stitching ends. they didn't bother to trim off the end and in a few places where that end was near the zipper, it would cause the zipper to jam.

We also got this because it had the two wheels in the back rather than the 4 wheels which would be almost impossible to maneuver up our gravel driveway.

There is plenty of room, the wheels are high-quality and roll well, and the handle is easy to extend and retract. Best of all, it survives well through the gorilla-like handling that airlines put luggage through. This is definitely not a carry-on, but I like it so much I'm considering buying their carry-on for shorter trips.",

It has straps with buckles that fasten over the zipper closure --- but the bottom strap is not long enough to allow the buckle to connect when the suitcase is expanded, which is exactly when you are most likely to need the straps. I had thought it was just this one bag but it looks like others have had the same problem. Not sure if all the bags are like this or there was just a manufacturing defect affecting some of the bags.",

It seems very well made. I've owned a dozen carry-ons in the past, and this is one of my top favorites. While it lacks the swivel roller function, I think that's a good trade-off for lighter weight and more space inside for packing.",

      "text": "I loved this choice in luggage. Hubby and I went on a 4 day trip to Vegas, and it was large enough to carry clothes for both of us, yet small enough to be able to check with Southwest Airlines and not be over weight on it. It was also VERY EASY to spot coming down the luggage conveyor as the purple and black color scheme made it stand out. It really seems to be very good quality luggage, and I'm happy I bought it.",
