My 27 year old daughter also loves it and says it clears up her skin if she gets the odd breakout. My 19 year old son has also used it to soothe razor rash on his neck and it worked like a charm. What's not to like? I'm back ordering more!",

Within 10 days I noticed a big difference. 9 months later -- i switched to the Jarosa brand because they had a good sale and it has the pump bottle which works better for me than the dropper. I keep mine inside the fridge door so to just open the fridge and do 1 pump is so convenient. I keep the above dropper bottle now for travel. Pretty much all the brands are probably good but its the pump bottle that I'm sold on.",
