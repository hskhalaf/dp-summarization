Make sure you read the instructions beginning to end BEFORE you start constructing it. I really wanted a gold bar cart, but couldn't find one for a price in my budget. So I bought this one, spray painted the frame gold, and put marble contact paper on the glass shelves. It comes with little suction cups that help hold the glass shelves in place once set on the frames. All in all, it is a very well-made, quality material, very sturdy product. I am very happy with this purchase.",

Funny thing is I put the top or the middle on wrong and ended up having the wine glasses hang on the wrong side but I actually like it this way and it freed up another shelf so...that was lucky. Anyways if you want a quality looking cart pick this one. I choose to leave the wheels off but there are wheels that come with it as well.",

I love how it has multiple shelves of various heights (tall enough to fit even Costco sized handles). Assembly was pretty easy and I managed to put it together by myself in a matter of about an hour. There was an issue however with several of the holes not being completely drilled out. Some of them had little pieces of metal protruding out which made it incredibly difficult to screw in the screws. But i was able to knock most of them off with a small screwdriver.",

Each row holds three 20oz wine glasses or 5oz snifters. Would've liked it to hold four, but this is ok. I've compared to some $500+ ones and this one looks just as great, if not better.",

Tried to put the new wheel on, but it must be the thread on the inside of the frame because the wheel will absolutely not go in the hole! Not sure why this is happening. Make sure you get whatever replacements you need before the year is up. Beautiful item, was easy to put together.",

When my replacement order arrived, I was missing assembly pieces (no L key and missing washer pcs), and the glass on the second level pops up a bit, it won\u2019t lay flat.

My biggest issue is the fact the glass on the bottom shelf does not fit properly, meaning the pieces aren\u2019t exact. This is only on the bottom, all the other pieces fit perfectly.
