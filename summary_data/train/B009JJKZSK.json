With us in the living room and the key receiver in our sun room (App.35 ft.) we were able to connect with the transmitter but could barely hear the \"up to\" 90dB chime, as we moved farther away, app .45 ft. the transmitter was unable to connect with the receiver. These are ok for the use of finding items in the house as you move around and that's probably what they are made for. So its not a bad purchase as long as you don't expect to achieve the ad claims",

The design does not seem robust to me, but for some reason, they take quite a beating. Being on my keys and in my wallet is not an easy life for any piece of technology. The most impressive feature is the Click'N'Go customer service. I had issues early on several years ago, and they just kept replacing no questions asked. I prefer a supplier that stands behind their products.",

To share my lesson learned, if you plan to use or are using these key ring receivers for your keys, I would recommend taping the battery covers before you lose them like me. Too bad that mine is out of warranty. I will have to find a different band for my keys.",

If I had know it would fall off, I would have at least taped it on so I wouldn't lose it. Overall, these have rescued me several times when I couldn't find my keys and were well worth buying just to prevent the frustration that misplaced items can cause.",

They worked great until the batteries died (the battery life did leave something to be desired). Some of the trackers came with a foam adhesive pad to stick them to things. While they were thoroughly stuck and in no danger of coming off, they covered the battery access. There was no way to unscrew the backing without unsticking the tracker, which rips the foam, meaning new adhesive foam is required. That seems like poor planning. Still, they do work, and they are loud enough for me.",

It always works when we try to use it and battery life has been great. I definitely recommend it especially for people who are constantly losing and trying to find stuff. I would like the finders to be a little smaller (the size they are not makes it impracticable to use on phones or remote controls) but, for the price and the reliability of the product, I really can't complain.",
