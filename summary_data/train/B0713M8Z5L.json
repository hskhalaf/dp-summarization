This pail is frustraiting to get the diaper into the second resovoir, causing you to have to shake the pail (this shaking the doodoo scent out into the room), plus it holds about 1/4 of the diapers the Munchkin does.",

Bags rip easily thanks to the poor design of having the latch mechanism so sharp. We have five kids, three in diapers and go through many changes. We have one of each Diaper Genie model and you can see the difference in the amount of diapers the old model vs the new will hold in my photo. I'm positive the company changed the design in order to induce more purchases of the refill bags. Both models block the odor well.

I was under the impression this would lock the odor away but it is sub-par at best. We've taken to using left over grocery bags as they are more effective. I suspect the older model that \"twisted\" the diapers and sealed them was far more effective at odor control. This is just a fancy trashcan with overpriced refills. I recommend you look for another product. EDIT: after a bit of research I found the original design twisted the diapers sealing in the odor. This module doesn't do that and isn't effective at controlling odor. Look elsewhere.",

My issue is that this one holds WAY less diapers than our original one. The mechanism that allows the diapers to fall down actually gets caught on the diapers that are in the bottom making it hard to open. I don't like having to stick my hand all the one in the diaper genie to push the diapers down...yuck! Poorly designed this time around.",
