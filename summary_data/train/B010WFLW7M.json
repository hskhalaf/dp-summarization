They have been the perfect flip flops and I was excited to buy another pair. However, after wearing these new ones only a couple days the foot bed developed painful \"bumps\", glue starting seeping out of seams that shouldn't have been glued, and the top band shrank. I don't know if the pair I received was defective or if these were counterfeit...this is NOT the quality I expected from a pair of Crocs. I really hope this is not the direction Crocs are going for quality.",

The last thing that these excel at is they seem to take on minimal foot odor so whatever compound they use is pretty effective.",

Typically the shoes last about 2-3 months and then start to delaminate towards the front. Once I contacted Crocs direct, and got a new pair, but the process was more than tedious. I find the best solution is to use Shoo Gloo and glue the two bits together at the front as soon as they first start to come apart. Not a perfect solution, but it works. Never had this problem with the older Croc flip-flops, just with this newer version. Still love the shoes in spite of this ongoing issue.",

Overall I'd recommend them.",
