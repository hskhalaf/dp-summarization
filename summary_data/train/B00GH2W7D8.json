      "text": "I'm only giving 4 stars because the description and the package say these are 1500 thread count Egyptian cotton but the actual sheets themselves do not say what they are made of anywhere, just instructions on how to wash them. But, in fine print on the back of the package says they are \"they are made of high strength micro fiber yarns.\" I believe they are microfiber. I have another set of sheets that look (stitching and all) and feel exactly the same and they are microfiber. However, they are comfortable sheets. I've only washed them once and they shed in the dryer like crazy. Hopefully that's only because they are new.",

They do not tear easily, mostly in the corners from stretching. Given the price and quality, I'm happy to replace my sheets every other year and get new designs & colors.",

Well, if you got a hell of grip and can manage to pull these until the brink of tearing, then yes. I do like the feel of these but because they don't fit the mattress right, I would not buy them again.",
