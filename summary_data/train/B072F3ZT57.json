      "text": "My elderly cat loves this product, any flavor, so I'd typically give the product 5*. My issue is the packaging. I realize the design allows the packet to stand upright, but It is extremely difficult to get the entire contents out of the poorly designed packet. I have to cut it open with scissors and use a utensil to scrape out the last of the product--which is no small amount--trapped in the bottom crevices of the packet. It annoys me no end and I wouldn't purchase this brand again if my cat didn't love the gravy mix so much. (The typical B.F.F. canned food is too dense for her to eat.)",

The catches of fish are also certified to have been safe for dolphins and turtles, as certified by the ships\u2019 captains. The Textures - Gravy and Aspic . BFF is available in cans and pouches, and all flavors deliver high moisture. The cans come in both gravy and aspic, and the pouches are all in gravy. The gravy is what you\u2019d expect it to be\u2026simply Cat-tastic for those kitties that love to lick! The aspic is similar to Jell-o in that it starts off as a powder that is mixed with water, but when cooked, it takes on a gel like substance.
