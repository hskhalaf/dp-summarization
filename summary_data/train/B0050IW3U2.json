Great reminder to stay focused on what's important. Two reasons I only gave 4/5 stars: 1. the book is relatively expensive for something that can only be used for a one 12 week period. 2. I bought the book primarily for strength training workout recording - I use myfitnesspal for meals and such; would love to see a simpler book for those of us really into fitness and wanting purely workout related recording space.",

The best way to get started on a healthier lifestyle or to meet a goal that u have set for yourself is to plan it out ahead of time. Have a solid plan and set your schedule.

So I decided to grab one and check it out. I have to say, for anyone who has decided rat today is the day to get started and needed to set a schedule. This is great!",

      "text": "Fitlosophy Fitbook: Fitness and Nutrition Journal to Plan, Track, and Reach Health and Weight Loss Goals by Fitlosophy is a twelve week exercise and food log. For example, a typical week gives a person the space to record their time, flexibility, cardio, and strength training activity. There is also space for recording body weight and another space for writing down your workout goals. There is also an area where you can write down your reward for doing so and fit tip reminders such as making sure to drink at least 64 ounces of water each day (page 5), a nutrient tracker, and spaces where a person can write what inspired them (inspiration area).",
