It\u2019s completely tasteless, dissolves (better in warm/hot liquids) thoroughly and guickly and has lived up to its claims. I\u2019ve been taking this almost a month now and as a dancer, have noticed that I have a bit more energy, no joint pain, my skin is clearing up and I\u2019ve actually lost a few pounds (not entirely due to this but I feel like it\u2019s helped). I drink 1 scoop every morning in my coffee and I feel like this container is lasting forever!!!! Will be purchasing again.",

Most importantly, I can feel the difference using it. I've gone through one container. I've noticed a huge improvement in my joints, skin rejuvination, reduction of celulite, and digestion. Tip: A diet high in vit. C and other antioxidents greatly improve the benefits of collagen as they work synergetically.",
