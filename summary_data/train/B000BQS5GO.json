A little is natural bc of the pressure on the tube of caulk. But this one my husband has raved about, even on his FB page.",

If you are caulking a small bead, it requires more pressure to push the caulk out. You squeeze the trigger to advance the push bar and it just slides down the bar, pushing nothing. A high school kid could design better. I was not trying to caulk with something exotic. I was using DAP silicone caulk which I have used forever.",

This is rated for the majority of products, but some adhesives, particularly extremely viscous construction adhesives, need more pressure that this products mechanism might not push out. Also those products tend to use larger tubes than can be put in this unit. I have used this to dispense acrylic latex caulk, room temperature vulcanizing silicone caulk and marine adhesive. I have had no problems, other than issues caused by leaks in the plunger end of a silicone tube.",

Much better caulk flow control, when you stop it stops very fast, not any or only a tiny bit of flow after without dripping. Took a little getting used to as I found I was expecting the continued flow some after I let off the trigger. Well worth it, highly recommend! Now if I can just remember to wipe it off when done each time so it won't get covered in crud over time. :-)",

I was using this for a storage area with non-removable shelving and the only drawback is that it cannot be used in a small cramped area so I had to find a hand squeezable chalk tube to apply chalk in that area.",

I love this because when I'm caulking I can stop anytime I run my bead. And it stops coming out too. Unlike the old caulk guns when you stop it keeps coming out unless you release the loader that pushes the caulk out. You not only have a mess but your wasting money. But with this dripless caulk gun, to me it's the next thing to slice bread. You won't know until you get one. Thanks Kevin This",

However, this gun is so superior to anything that I have used before, its startling. In the past, it was a race to see how fast I could pull back the rod and to try to stem the inevitable overflow before it made a mess. With this gun, you finish a line and shazam, everything is so tidy. No overflow, no leaks. It's well constructed and operates very smoothly. And the price is right.",

After years and several big box stores cheap caulk guns (that typically broke after a year or so of use) I purchased this after reading many positive, informative reviews. The difference in quality and ease of use is night and day. This caulking gun does not continue to expel caulk on its own once started...you have to push in the handle to allow it to come out...which makes getting the correct amount much easier than generic caulking guns. The best part, was that this caulking gun did not cost much more than the ordinary, cheaper models I made the mistake of buying in the past.",

    "title": "Newborn 930-GTD Drip-Free Smooth Hex Rod Cradle Caulking Gun with Gator Trigger Comfort Grip, 1/10 Gallon Cartridge, 10:1 Thrust Ratio",
    "description": "Size:10oz\n\nThe Newborn 930-GTD Drip-Free Smooth Hex Rod Cradle caulking gun has a steel half-barrel frame that fits 1/10-gal. cartridges and has a 10:1 thrust ratio for use with low viscosity materials such as latex. The smooth pressure rod requires less force and is quieter than a ratchet-style pressure rod. The rod retracts after each pull of the trigger, removing pressure from the tube to help prevent dripping. The handle and trigger are padded for comfort. There is a welded plate in the back for securing the cartridge in place. A seal puncture tool and a spout cutter are built into the side of gun for opening cartridges without a knife, and the hook on the back allows it to hang on a ladder. \n\nCaulking guns, also called caulk or cartridge guns, dispense a controlled flow of products such as caulk, sealants, and adhesives from a tube or cartridge. A manual caulking gun consists of a frame which holds the tube, a trigger, and a rod which moves forward when the trigger is depressed, dispensing the product. Manual caulking guns have a thrust ratio; the higher the thrust ratio, the easier it is to dispense the caulk, sealant, or adhesive. Air-powered or pneumatic caulking guns also have a frame and a trigger, but are used with an air pressure regulator that pushes the product from the tube using air pressure instead of a rod. \n\nNewborn Brothers Company, Inc. manufactures sealant and adhesive dispensers and accessories. The company was founded in 1974 and is headquartered in Jessup, MD.\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Newborn Brothers Gator trigger drip-free hex rod caulk gun features the patent pending, anti-drip gator trigger with a thermoplastic comfort grip ergonomically designed to reduce hand fatigue. Other features include an all-steel construction for increased durability, a professional strength hex rod, and a ladder hook for added safety.",
