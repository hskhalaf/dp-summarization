I have NEVER and I repeat NEVER seen such excellent customer service in my life. System is working great and at a fraction of the cost of other systems. I highly recommend Ring. And what they stand for as a company - they will stand by their products at all costs. They want to disrupt the market and they will. Thank you Ring.",

How is it that this simple function doesn\u2019t integrate with the cameras and security system. Ring\u2019s sad solution is that cameras can work on a daily schedule that you need to set. Our lives are more variable that M-F 8-5 type of timing. I just want interior cameras to record when we set our alarm and we are away.

Installation was a breeze, and there is virtually zero maintenance on anything (we have had ours for over 6months and the rechargeable battery on the keypad hasn\u2019t even needed to be charged yet!). Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a security system that is extremely easy to install, and works for you, not for a security company! It also integrates flawlessly with other ring devices, such as doorbells and security cameras. Love that we can see everything in an easy to use app!",

Otherwise your notifications will be going off on a continuous basis. Great Product and have recommended to friends & family. This product is especially great for individuals that travel on a consistent basis for constant updates & constant visuals on home.",

Then a contact sensor stopped working and resetting it with a new battery did not work. We have a ring doorbell and stick up cam we love. Alexa integration works.

So now I have no \u201csound\u201d indicator when any door or window is opened. So full functionality no longer exists. Maybe 2nd gen devices work better but I would probably steer clear of this version of the product no matter the price, unless partial functionality is what you are looking for.",

There seems a slight longer delay in notification to your app but that may be a little nit picky. Contact sensors work well.
