I was looking at this box and the MTX terminators. Go with these everyday. You\u2019ll spend an extra $100 but you can see the Rockford Fosgate quality the second you take a look at the box. Everything works great and my god is the box beautiful in person. I\u2019ve had it for a week and received countless compliments from coworkers on how badass they look. You can tell it\u2019s a quality box with some quality speakers, even if you know nothing about car audio.",

The one and only gripe I have is the lack of protective speaker grills: they can be purchased separately for $20/each.",

Well I didn't have to so i didn't and I was able to get this originally priced setup for $240 instead of $250 and I was stoked. I could not be happier with the outcome I have now running a 1000watt hifonics amp to them at about 350-400 RMS at the moment but they can handle. The deep clean bass is superior, and if you are considering this system among others there is no need you will not be let down by these Fosgate subs!",
