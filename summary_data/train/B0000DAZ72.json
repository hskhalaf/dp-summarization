Then offered to replace the part that melted. No thank you, why would I risk ruining another meal and let toxic smoke into my home I am done with the Presto brand. All for a mere $45 refund. Well done Presto.",

I've been frying all sorts of things in this fryer since I got it, and it's great to have the larger size to try cooking larger pieces of food. I love that I don't have to adjust anything - just plug it in with oil at the fill line, and wait 15-20 minutes for the oil to hit temp, then cook. I found that waiting a full 20 minutes gave me best results and got just to my desired 375 degrees using peanut oil. 15 minutes wasn't quite to temp but close.",

Also, if a larger portion needs to be prepared, then they could remove the divide and just utilize the entire space for their food of choice. After presenting the gift and utilizing it several times, my parents have given me nothing but rave reviews of this product. They are so pleased and happy to have their fryer back, only this time larger and capable of handling more food, saving them time when cooking and entertaining. THANKS AMAZON.",

    "description": "Fry two different foods at once without intermingling. Large capacity up to 8 servings. Snap on cover lets you store oil in fryer. Removable divider for cooking large pieces of fish. Thermostat automatically keeps oil at the perfect frying temperature. 1500 watts 120 volts, 60 Hz only\n\nAMAZON.COM\nIn the homespun days, food was usually fried in a big cast-iron metal pot. But modern times demand simpler solutions. The Presto DualDaddy electric deep fryer fits on a countertop and is so easy to use. Just add oil, plug it in, and in 15 minutes it's heated up and ready to fry. Its sleek, elliptical black bucket shape matches form to function-- simple and classic. \n\n The DualDaddy holds up to eight cups of oil or four pounds of shortening, and it can handle up to eight servings of food at a time, as well as being large enough to accommodate larger pieces of meat or fish. With the divider in, two kinds of food can be frying at the same time with no intermingling of flavors. The internal thermostat keeps the oil at the optimum frying temperature. An accompanying scoop, slotted for draining, is for lifting food in and out or for turning food halfway through the cooking time. The power cord has a magnetic safety connection, so that if the unit is jostled during cooking, the cord will disconnect, shutting power off immediately. After straining the used oil, it can be poured back into the unit and stored, covered by the accompanying snap-on plastic lid. \n\n After frying, unplug the unit and allow it to cool completely before attempting to empty oil. Wash the DualDaddy with warm, sudsy water and dry it thoroughly; it is not immersible. To preserve the nonstick finish, inside and out, do not use steel wool or harsh, abrasive cleansers. The Presto DualDaddy measures 9 by 14 by 8-1/2 inches (including handles). Presto guarantees this product with a one-year limited warranty. A simple instruction and recipe sheet is enclosed. --Garland Withers\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe easy way to fry two foods at once! Big capacity fries up to eight cups of food.
