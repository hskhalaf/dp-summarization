For a product that promotes health they do an awful job of promoting obesity with such sugary products. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum of 25 grams of sugar per day, and this product has 8 grams per serving, or about 32% of the daily recommended intake. The obesity epidemic is being driven by high sugar intake. This only serves to promote it while it \"helps\" you get your vitamins.",

I've never had a fish-flavored gummy before trying these. Now I really know what that tastes like and it isn't good! If you're willing to deal with it, I suggest chewing and swallowing quickly so you avoid the aftertaste (not easy when an Adult dose is 6 of these). I won't be ordering any more SmartyPants. :(",
