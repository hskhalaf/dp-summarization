This product fit me well though I use small size as man but this is unisex size, so I choose Medium and fit me well. I think this product need to show a size chart to prevent wrong size. Thanks for the size chart from another online shopping site, where I learned that unisex size is one more size for men due the combination of both gender.",

Bottom line is it is worth the money (have you seen how expensive polar fleece garments are?) and I would recommend and buy again if needed.",
