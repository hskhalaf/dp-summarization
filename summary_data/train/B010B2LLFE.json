I've included measurements for A, R, D, E, G and H liners in the pics (height/length & width) plus a soda can for scale",

      "text": "I bought a simplehuman trash can because they are well constructed and good quality bags are available that fit it perfectly. For years I paid a premium for small packs of those bags, but it was worth it to have perfect-fitting bags that didn't leak or break and I only felt slightly guilty about paying a premium price. Then I found these packages of 100! Now I am in trash bag Nirvana because I no longer feel that little twinge of guilt each time I put a new bag in the can. I hope you find that too.",

For starter they actually fit your trashcan perfectly and so there's no sliding down and material doesn't get into the trashcan itself.
