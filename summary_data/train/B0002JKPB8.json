First, it's more compact than my original, which also required the use of salt and this model is more convenient. It steams quickly and the rollers heat up within a minute. My hair is not thin but it's fine (it greatly helps to have a stylist cut your hair accordingly.) After I remove the rollers, I don't brush it, only run my fingers through it to fluff it up.

I had been concerned that it would take a long time to curl my hair since the rollers are heated one by one but a new one was ready by the time I got the previously roller in my hair. There was no slow down at all. The only challenge I had was putting the covers on the rollers to secure them in place. I didn\u2019t want them to partially unroll when I let go. That may very well be my own personal challenge and will get better as I use them more. I am very happy with this purchase.",

Since it\u2019s a moist heat my hair does not dry out. I dye my hair every 6 weeks so my hair gets dry and I use a lot of biotin in it. The combination of the moist heat curlers and biotin leave my hair soft and shinning. It\u2019s so nice to take so little time with my hair, it curls and dries quickly. Just use caution because there is steam coming out of the machine.",

This version doesn't use the salt and is a bit more portable (smaller) and the variation of rollers has greatly improved. Also, it steams faster! However, the overall concept and ease of use is the same. I adore these rollers, short or long hair, course or fine...they will give you plenty of lasting volume withOUT any heat damage. Best of all, they can stand the test of many year. A great hair investment, I must say!",
