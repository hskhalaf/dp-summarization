      "text": "My normal shoe size is a 5 but I purchased a size 4 1/2 as the sketchers I bought last year were far too big and they were a size 5. These sketchers are a lot better but I do not feel I have full support as they are still big but a size smaller and the length of my foot would not fit them. The best ever sketchers I have ever bought were the Gowalk 2 in 2015 and they were a size 5 and fitted perfectly but unfortunately I cannot get them in my size otherwise I would have bought them again.",

When I checked they were too wide and too long - at least 1 cm bigger than the same ones from last year. I thought maybe they were mens but the label said womens. So too late to send them back as I had worn them out but totally useless",
