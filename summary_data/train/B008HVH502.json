This morning I woke up to a broken mail box. They shoved a crowbar on the top slot and bent the front of the box. The result was a gaping hole they used to pick my mail.",

The \"wings\" the design includes apparently meant for appearance and weather protection ended making a perfect fulcrum for prying the door open. Luckily, all we've been receiving is junk mail.

It's easier to install the lags if you have a ratcheted wrench given you have to turn it within the mailbox. I was hoping to use my drill with a socket bit, but it would not work given the height of the box. Make sure your holes are drilled deep enough to install.

Other: Probably the best locking mailbox in the $100 price category. Security is easily adequate for my suburban neighborhood.

The design is such that when the top is opened, the inner panel swivels up, making it virtually impossible for a person to get an arm inside the box to grab your mail. This is VERY well constructed. Solid. I also appreciate that it was easy to install. It mounts DIRECTLY to the optional metal post with the hardware provided. If you want to mount it on a 4x4, use the optional bracket (I didn't need it). An excellent product and highly recommended!",

The only issue with this wood trim is the outgoing mail flag would not flip up because of the wood trim above so I removed the bolts securing the flag and rotated it 180 degrees. The flag and now points straight down when not needed or flipped forward straight out when needed and works perfectly. Hopefully that will help others with the same constraints. Do a video search on locking mailbox theft before you make your final purchase. We chose this one for its appeal, feature and security.",
