Although this unit, a Drive Medical Steel Rollator is a bit heavier than its aluminum counterparts--the benefits of increased strength and more importantly--stability--in my opinion, more than make up for the weight factor. With this model there are never any issues related to tipping. It is solid, safe, and the end-user is more than pleased with it. The Rollator has improved the quality of her life--and mobility. It is also a great value for the money spent. Highly recommended.",

The walker moves and turns very easily, and the fully rotating front wheels make it very maneuverable, even for a person with diminished strength. Her home has mostly hardwood floors, but she has no trouble moving across carpeting. My mother is extremely small so this fits our needs perfectly, but I'm not certain how it would perform for a larger than average individual.",

I am able to maneuver it around very easily. Parking and brakes are adequate. Folding it up is easy. I picked the right size bungee cord to keep it tightly closed once it is collapsed. Appears sturdy and should last for a long time. The larger wheels are better compared to my wife's rollator made by the same company but with 6\" wheels. Overall, I would recommend it and feel confident in doing so.",

I bought what looked like the same model, but there have been some design changes. 1) the basket is now an open wire basket so it's not so good for keys and a credit card. 2) the basket has to be removed to fold the rollator to put in the car. 3) the mechanism to tighten the handles in place is now a plastic lever that can break with too much pressure. They also are on the inside of the handles, so they hit your hips if you sit on the seat. Disappointed.",

I like that I can put something on the seat and walk it over to where I need it. Well built, easy to operate. It's a bit of a struggle to get it into and out of the trunk.

Phone reports indicate she is walking her dog for the first time in a long time and having the same great experience I had.",
