You can either use it with the legs folded up or extended just depends on what you need. It is a bit heavy but is well built. Definitely will last. Well, it is July 2017 and I still love this product. It has taken some abuse and still is very solid. The weight is something to get used to but I don't mind. As well and solid as it is build, I would definitely recommend this product. Definitely worth the money. Everyone that we camp with ends up buying one for themselves.",

Right now we are using it without the legs extended, when he gets a bit stronger we will use the legs. The platform is the right size and easy to navigate, he really likes the non slip tread. It is very sturdy and gives him a sense of security, this platform will last.",
