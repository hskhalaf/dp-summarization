A cold solder joint at the RCA jack assembly was fixed properly and the unit works again. It looks like the manufacturer uses decent components but their assembly team needs some work.",

I just wanted good sound inside the cab and a streamline fit, and this worked perfectly. UPDATED 6/30/15 :Much like many of the reviews that I read, and unfortunately ignored, the unit stopped working after 45 days installed. Amazon customer service has assured me that they will take care of it even though I am past the return date. This product was a HUGE DISSAPPOINTMENT! I Never ran the unit at full blast, and it was professionally installed. This is just not a very good product",

      "text": "This subwoofer sounded suprisingly good for being only 8\" and having no real box to it. This won't thump hard, but adds good depth to a car system that is lacking on the lows. Despite the wattage rating, its pretty easy to get distortion out of the subwoofer at moderate volume levels, so make sure you either have the remote at hand to turn it down or a subwoofer control on your head unit. If you are tight on space and don't need thundering base, this is a great buy and I would certainly recommend it to a friend.",
