At first I thought it had more capacity than I needed but after research, it had the best combination of capacity, features and price for me. I had the tech install and setup the new computer for me including the WD backup mainly due to a complicated file transfer, but I think I could have added it to an existing computer myself. My best recommendation is that the tech said he was going to buy one for himself after he finished with mine.",

This updated version is reported to be faster so maybe will be able to stream HD content. Surely hope it runs longer than 0.3 years (1.5 * 20%).",

My big complaint and the reason for only a 4 star rating is that it doesn't prevent access to you files by unauthorized devices on your network like your Xbox or any phone or tablet that has DLNA capabilities. So if you give anyone access to your home network there is no protection for your data unless you turn off the streaming feature on the NAS which also prevents you from streaming any data at home or from a remote location. Its a bad security flaw in my opinion and needs to be addressed.",

      "text": "I had this nas for about 2 weeks. It worked in the beginning but as I started loading it would start seeing communication issues that looks like WD has no real answer or fix for. So with that said its a home Nas and should not require a experienced IT tech to find a work around beside that this thing gets hot even with a plastic housing its like a Hdd toaster. I cannot speak for the smaller units or their larger pro grade, but i ended up with a netgear 104 and populated it with wd reds, and have had no communication issues.",
