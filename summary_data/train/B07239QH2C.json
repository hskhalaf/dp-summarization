As is though it is a pain. Word and 3 browsing tabs are all it took to make it unbearable until after the upgrade. Now there is no slowing ti down (well, with normal use).",

Sometimes it will struggle to load web pages to the point of forcing me to kill them and reload-- and this gets worse and worse until I restart the computer.

Manageable problems, though, and other than that the computer has been fine. (Also, there's no light indicating whether or not the number-lock is active...)",

Good screen, battery life is still good more than 18 mos after stock date. Good wireless access, rarely dropping signal. Only feature missing is a back-lit keyboard.

All the other hardware is good to great, and I have no complaints there at all. To fix the speed issue, I installed a new solid state hard drive and the computer is ultra fast.

Also, the second time I turned the computer on to wipe/reset it, the touchpad/mouse stopped working. reset/shutdown hasn't solved this, and I am forced to use an external mouse to get the computer reset. I've had many ASUS products and I'm sure they would have helped me solve this issue. I will continue to buy ASUS but be warned, the pictures make it appear sleek/slim, which it is not.",

Also why can you not turn off track pad gestures completely? The best I've been able to do is only turn some of them off. Edit: This trackpad is AWFUL. Worst I have ever used.
