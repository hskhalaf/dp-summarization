However, I have had a couple of cases arrive, with some of the cans bent on the end of on the top, making them difficult to open/drink, or to sit down on a surface. Also, the packages are sometimes, torn open on one end, from shipping and handling, I assume. Shipping is usually very fast, too!! 14/15 Stars!!! :)",
