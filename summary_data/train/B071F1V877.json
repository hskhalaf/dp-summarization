The oil hardens when it\u2019s hot at the risk of clogging your drain. When pulling and swishing after a few seconds you can feel residue or food come out that you might not have fully flossed out the night before. That\u2019s IF you floss. Don\u2019t throw out your Listerine though: it\u2019s best to take it in tandem with an antiseptic mouthwash to make sure you have all the crevices in your mouth covered.",
