      "text": "This is a brilliant product, that installed quickly and was as close to \"plug and play\" as it gets. Bought the adapter to solve the problem of hooking up an older stereo receiver and speakers to bluetooth, in order to stream music. Several years ago, had bought an Apple Airport Express to solve the same problem (by wifi, not bluetooth), but that was cumbersome to set up and never worked reliably. This adapter was set up in 5-10 minutes, and connected easily to devices by bluetooth. Sound quality is excellent (you wouldn't know it is a bluetooth connection). Highly recommended!",

There's no optical digital or digital coaxial output, so you will be able to connect this to a DAC or to your receiver's digital ports through anything other than RCA. That said, this is an impressive device, with great build quality, and connectivity, that will probably work just fine for the vast majority of users who are just trying to hook up a pair of speakers at the pool or something.",

I actually used this to enable Bluetooth on an old Logitech sound system. I'm sure this will last just as long as the speakers I hooked it up to. It requires power and the headphone jack input, so make sure you have a plugin where you want to use it. Thanks for an awesome product :)",

Bummed I threw the box away yesterday because I'd send it back and find one that works properly. In the Q&A this was addressed, but I didn't read it until I had the issue and honestly, I assumed I'd be able to disconnect it like EVERY other bluetooth device since the beginning of bluetooth.",

      "text": "It works well and pairs easily but usable range seems less than the 50 feet line of sight and less than 30 feet thru wall. The problem many have talked about is that it maintains bluetooth pairing even when not using it, so you can't hear Alexa or your phone (ring and speaker). The way I worked around this, was to use a smart outlet for this device ()and have Alexa control it. So when I tell Alexa to turn on my bluetooth audio, she turns on my sound system to the correct port as well as the outlet that powers this device. Then I can choose what music to play and whether thru Alexa or my phone.",

This made all my other Bluetooth speakers throughout my house have choppy audio, even when this wasn\u2019t even remotely connected to my phone.

Also it\u2019s very hard to disconnect from this device, you either have to forget it or completely turn off Bluetooth. I do not recommend this particular Bluetooth adapter.",
