      "text": "My daughter has 2 children, ages 3 and 4. She bought a set of these shaped cutters about 4 months ago and they have been a real hit. She makes sandwiches for her kids (2 standard slices of bread plus meat, cheese and lettuce) then uses the cutters. The Dinosaur shape is the one they like the best. That being said, I ordered a set recently for my household to be able to make fun food when my grandkids come over. I tried them myself to cut my sandwich the other day, used the heart shaped cutter and it worked very well. Them seem adequately sturdy, sharp enough to push down through a sandwich, and they are easy to clean.",

When I saw these on Amazon, I thought this would be the perfect solution, and it was!! He gets so excited to see which shape his sandwich will be in, and usually requests the train. He is now eating his ENTIRE sandwich again. These cut the crust off perfectly and do not waste any of the actual sandwich part. They are easy to use, sturdy, and even cut the sandwich in half. I highly recommend these, especially for those picky eaters!!",

If it was just a perimeter design with nothing through the middle it wouldn't squash it quite so much. They are still fun though.",
