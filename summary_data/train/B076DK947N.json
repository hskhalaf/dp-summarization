      "text": "Full disclosure: I am a radio nerd. I used to fall asleep with a transistor radio under my pillow, fascinated by the chatter from across the country. Since then, radios are made more cheaply I suppose. Never seen one that came close to reception ability of these older models. I've tried radios that claimed they had more crystals, more diodes, more of whatever gives a radio the means to get clear reception from far away stations. Not impressed. Until this one. I live in the middle of nowhere. A real dead zone blocked by mountains. No cell phone service, no radio. Nothing. The Vondior picks up more stations than I ever thought possible. Unbelievable reception from such a small package.",

Then when you open it, there's the cheap radio you ordered, and the body sorta fits together but not really, and you look back down at the box at what could have been. Save money on the box. You're shipping the product in another box anyway. CHEAP OUT. Put it to the Radio.",

I think that is a great way to earn faithful clients. The product arrived in good condition and works well. The volume is good and it has a good range of stations. I do not know anything about the long term durability or battery life but I am sure if I have any issues the company will help to resolve them.",

And it's supposed to work when I go camping or hiking out of town!!! Amazon is not what it used to be. I have been having issues with DVDs, too (ie, they clearly state, in English, a DVD has subtitles. I buy it, when it arrives, it has subtitles for sure but in Spanish!.. )..",

The AM reception doesn't seem too great, but in my city, there are really no AM stations left",

It should swivel from the back to front, also annoying. The sound quality is super staticky.
