I replaced it as 1.5ton wasnt cutting it and the seals were leaking. The picture seen of it lifting a purple car was 10 pumps from resting. Didn't take much force to lift the cars front end. I'd also note at 10 pumps for a minor lift up it's by no means a speed demon, but rather built for ease of use. Please remember to always use jack stands, hydraulics can fail at any moment. I will update my review after some good time and add below.",

So I let him have my jack while I was between homes..... Now I'm all settled in and replacing things. I did a lot of research and decided to go with this jack. I'm VERY impressed.... It's much lighter than my old jack...... operates very smoothly...... easy to ease it down when I lower it.... I can raise a 3/4 ton truck with no problem. Its built very tough..... I suspect this is the last jack I'll ever need.....",

I feel ridiculous heaping a ton of praise on a floor jack, but it really is that good. I expect my tools to work every time, and so far this jack has stood up to every vehicle I've thrown at it.",

The weight is perfect, and it fits the jack points of my Prowler perfectly, which was a gamble as the car sits so low, and the jack points are critical on the car as the frame is all aluminum. Great price and great floor jack.",
