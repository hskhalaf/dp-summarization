The shower head works perfectly and came with a few extra nipples. One thing to note: the bigger the area of the rainfall shower head, the more water it will use. We went through our hot water much faster than our old low flow shower head, so I bought a water shutoff adapter. I open the nozzle about half way and problem solved. For the whole set up, I spent about half of what a rainfall shower head would cost alone at a big box store.",

Unfortunately, the shoddy assembly and sub par materials have become more evident as time has gone on - over the last few months, the nozzles stopped pointing straight, so the streams go all over the place. Then, a nozzle fell out, which made one stream 10 times stronger than the others and aimed at the wall. The finalfinal straw was a split in the seam holding the two main pieces together - now half the water shoots straight out the side, soaking whatever you have it pointed at. It's now completely unusable. Save your money, skip this one",

Both items even came with teflon thread tape. After attaching both and lightly tightening with a wrench, I turned on the water and it works great!! This is a great product and I can't wait to enjoy it. Nice chrome finish on it and seems to be well made.

This way you can have the shower flow straight down. I'll be honest - I was a little apprehensive about buying a \"cheap\" shower head. But I've been using this for several weeks now and all is well.

I would pay even more money to have this, it's life changing. I never knew how much taking a shower suck before compared to this wonderful shower head. I'm starting to realize that it all depends on the shower head, and how the water hits your body. Highly recommended..",
