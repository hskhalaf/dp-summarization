      "text": "Over the years my husband has seldom swam in our in-ground pool because it is not heated. He is very sensitive to the cold 76-80 degrees the water is often at. A year ago I had the brilliant idea to buy him Neoprene trunks. That got him in to the waist. Today we tried this Lemorecn wet suit jacket. Wish I would have thought of this sooner. It is the perfect solution! He normally wears an XL and the reviews suggested going up in size which we did. I ordered the 2x and the 3x. The 3x is perfect for his 230 lb, 6'2\" frame. We will be enjoying our pool together over the Labor day weekend. Sweet!!",

This suit is the perfect weight for warm Gulf diving! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is I'm not sure how durable it will be. After my first two dives in it, I noticed some light signs of wear (pilling) on the jacket, from my BCD. I will update this review after I've had a chance to get a few more dives in it, and see if the pilling continues to get worse.",

The advice was right on, but these wetsuit tops were just enough upper body insulation to keep us from getting chilled.

Wetsuits work best at keeping you warm when a little tight. The small I purchased is as big as I would want a wetsuit jacket to be including few wrinkles here and there that I would generally try to avoid. With that in mind, you may want to buy one a little small if you like your wetsuit tight and warm.",

I ordered an XL and the body fit nicely, but the sleeves are 7 inches round at the opening and 10 inches at the forearm. Maybe I have unusual proportions, but as a scuba instructor for over 20 years, I think I know how a wetsuit is supposed to fit. Anyway, I'll probably just cut the sleeves shorter to remove the tight finishing strip at the opening.",
