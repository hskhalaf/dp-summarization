It does have a slight hum to it but we could barely hear it over the radio. Feels pretty heavy duty and it got bumped around a lot with no damage or dings. I'd recommend this to family and friends. Update 6 months later: Still love it, works as great as the day we got it. I leave it in the center console compartment and love we can plug in our quick charge bases and don't have to spend money on quick charge car chargers.",

Long power cable allows it to extend a a good distance from your lighter port . Great product, highly recommended!",

This was the problem with my original inverter! Original review: It's quite large and doesn't it well into the front compartments of 2 of our family's 3 cars. The on/off button is in a rather inconvenient spot. It worked fine and noiselessly for 2 months. Then the AC outlets stopped working and all I ever used the outlet for was an electric razor.

The unit plugs into the rear 12 volt outlet and sits (my wife created a strap) on top of the console for easy access to the plugs and the on/off switch. The oxygen unit is actually louder than the cooling fan! By the way, replacing the outlets would cost over $200; the inverter was under $40. Next day delivery was a huge plus.",

This one works just like the bigger one, but is more compact. I highly recommend it if you have trouble keeping your phone charged with the USB port in your car (if you have one). I haven't tried to use it to charge a laptop yet, because I really don't have the need. This is perfect for what I need.",
