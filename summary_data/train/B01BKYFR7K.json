Our vet suggested cutting back her food. Suddenly she started bingeing and getting sick. We gave our cat an eating disorder! Noooooo! So, we switched her to this to reduce some of her calories and we're still able to give her the same amount of food. She is back to grazing and who knows if she's losing weight, she's happy and we don't have to withhold food from our fur baby. :)",
