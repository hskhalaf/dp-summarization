I should have suspected something with the price difference as some of the other oils are more expensive. It still has some of the pain relief effects but the STRONG camphor smell discourages use.",

If you order this go ahead and get the large size and get a carrier oil and some small bottles to put it in, either roll on or spray on, both of which I have. The oil is a combination of several essential oils and has a not unpleasant scent.",
