I'm 5'4\" and I need a footstool that's just a bit taller for me so that's the only reason I'm returning it and going with another footstool that's height adjustable (the Kensington Solemate).

I had the idea that it would be made out of plastic, and was really surprised to pick up the package and realize how heavy it is! After setting up, it makes a world of difference already. The foot rest isn't static in place, so you can actually move your feet back and forth on it, which helps with the relaxation factor. This was a great purchase!",

It's firm, so actually takes some effort to move it. It's compact, so will discreetly fit under your desk, on the passenger side of a car, or at the foot of a chair.

It defeats the purpose of having one of these then in my view. Also, tightening the screws underfeed doesn't work and be careful since they are held with a plastic covering that can crack, though that didn't happen to me.",
