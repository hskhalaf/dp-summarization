It looks sturdy enough to last even though the pieces are plastic. My son has dropped the table so many times and it still looks new.

The hammer is superfluous, a finger, even a child's finger, is enough to push the peg all the way down. No pounding involved. I was expecting to get a true pounder of yore, where a wood shape, say a cylinder, fit through the bench with serious friction, requiring serious, satisfying pounding by your young Bam Bam, if you recall the Flintsones. Good memories of my own pounding so long ago! But what I received was no more than a panel with 8 push buttons. Boring, Boring, Boring and quickly discarded by our own young pounder.",

The hammer is just now coming into play with her starting to grip and wield the hammer a bit at 17 months. It's study and it's better than another version I had gotten for my five year old grandson when he was that age. The pegs could be pushed all the way through on that version and eventually he did just that. They then got lost of course. This is sturdy and good product, with sharp corners rounded off nicely and I believe it's going to last quite awhile.",

    "description": "A beloved classic toy gets an exciting new twist with this deluxe pounding bench. As the colorful, non-removable pegs on the bench go up and down, they play peekaboo, taking turns showing their friendly smiles while the child has fun practicing fine motor skills. And you\u2019ll enjoy that because the pegs are attached, they can\u2019t get lost. A sturdy wooden mallet is included. Children delight in striking a peg with the mallet and watching one on the opposite side pop up. Once kids have seen this cause-and-effect in action, they will enjoy predicting which peg will pop up next. As they develop hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills, they will also be learning numbers and colors by counting the pegs and naming each color as it pops up. The Melissa & Doug Deluxe Pounding Bench Wooden Toy makes a great gift for kids 2 to 4 years. This product measures 5.25\" H x 10\" L x 5\" W and includes a sturdy wooden mallet. Add the Melissa & Doug Wooden Latches Board to round out the developmental play and learning experience. For more than 30 years, Melissa & Doug has created beautifully designed imagination- and creativity-sparking products that NBC News called \u201cthe gold standard in early childhood play.\u201d Today, Melissa & Doug is proudly partnering with the American Academy of Pediatrics to foster early brain development and help children build important life skills through play.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy Melissa & Doug\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom classic wooden toys to crafts, pretend play, and games, Melissa & Doug products provide a launch pad to ignite imagination and a sense of wonder in all children so they can discover themselves, their passions, and their purpose. \n\nSince the company\u2019s founding more than 25 years ago, Melissa & Doug has consistently delivered innovative products that inspire open-ended thinking, encourage kids to see new possibilities, and offer Countless Ways to Play.
