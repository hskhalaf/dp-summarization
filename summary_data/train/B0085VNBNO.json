It's way more than worth it. It's definitely a treasure for keeping. It's a sturdy watch, and the picture, definitely does not do the watch enough justice cause it's ten times better when you watch the actual watch function in action. The details are fantastic. I wouldn't think twice about buying or any other charles hubert paris pocket watch. thank you so much for the great buy.",

I was slightly afraid when I purchased it that it would be cheap quality. - It keeps time well. However, my boyfriend has only had it a few months and doesn't use it on the regular. - It comes with a chain. The listing does not depict this, so it was a pleasant surprise. - The open face gives it a beautiful vintage look There was nothing bad about this watch, it is beautiful and sophisticated. It made an excellent anniversary gift.",

It's a wind-up mechanical, so I don't expect it to be perfect...but after almost a week it is still accurate to the minute! I wish the entire front cover was completely sealed, but it is only the center of the cover that has the acrylic/plastic. I worry about dust and lint getting into the mechanism from my pocket. Quite honestly, I think it is a beautiful piece that I never tire of looking at and I enjoy the occasional winding that it needs whenever I see that the inner spring has become unwound.",
