No kid wants to wait for all that when it\u2019s their turn to ride. If it had a lever that moved the seat back and forth I\u2019d happily have this one a 5 star.",

      "text": "This is one of the best toys I have purchased in a long time. The price is very reasonable for the quality-outstanding metal construction, easy to assemble and the tires are not like typical cheap plastic ones-they have more gripping power. My 8 year old grandson helped me assemble it for his little cousin and couldn't resist a test drive - with the seat fully extended, he was able to hop on and go-then he wouldn't get off! He loved it. The handbrake really works and allows for cool spins and turns. I would recommend this strongly-and I never write recommendations!",

Only complaint is that the pedals are close to the ground (tires could be at least 1 in taller to pick the cart up further away from the ground). Also when the cart is coasting, the pedals continue to move. So my daughter has to pick her feet up and rest them on the center frame to keep her feet from slipping off and have her ankles hit by the pedals.",
