I'd probably go a size up for a full sized tree. The bulbs were lightweight and easy to affix to the branches. They come with their own pre-attached string loops so no hooks required. What I loved about them the most were the variations in texture. The glitter ones were the prettiest in low light. It's nice to have the look of \"fine glass bulbs\" without the shatter risk. I even used the extras to make a table centerpiece to match the tree. I'd definitely recommend and purchase again.",

My tree already being done i just wanted a few to bulk up the rose gold in the gaps and some in vases around the house. Some are perfectly gorgeous so they went on the tree. Those that i didn't love were used in decorative vases where they blend with others. Over all GREAT purchase for the price.",

The material feels like sturdy ping pong balls. The ornaments come with a stringed hook attached, as well as 34+ ornament hooks. I would purchase again next time, but in the largest size.",

When I do have a large tree again I'll also use these bulbs to fit in to those small areas on it. Great purchase! If these come in larger bulbs I'll buy them too.",
