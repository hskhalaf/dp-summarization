      "text": "I purchased these months ago after reading an article saying they were good for aggressive chewers. I'll be honest, my girls don't pick these to chew EVERY night, but they grab them fairly consistently from the toy basket and they hardly look worn down! I do notice a faint smell from these bones, but it's not intense nor does it stick to the blankets or dog beds. These bones also don't stain anything. When guest dogs visit our house, they also often pick out these bones. As a whole, I think they're a great, healthy, and natural choice for dog chews that are ACTUALLY durable and hold up to destructive chewers.",

I gave it 3 stars because it does work for my dogs, and they love the flavor, but not 5 stars because one is so tiny, the description does not say that... It leads you to believe you are getting two large, but you actually get a large and a small... I would return because of the price and misleading description, but not worth it in a pandemic with bored dogs... Grocery stores sell large for $6... Only if this combo was $10 and labeled for small dogs it would be worth it.",

Minimal mess, smell, long lasting, and lower pain when stepped on but they do hurt when you stub your toe on one at 3am. I'll take the bad for the good. And if anyone is counting, my preference for the above is 1) buffalo horns 2) elk antlers 3) the rest of them and they are way distant contenders.",
