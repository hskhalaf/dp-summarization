I also liked that they use Folate as opposed to Folic Acid. After my child was born, I switched to Actif Post Natal Vitamins. You take two of these per day, as opposed to one prenatal. And they deliver all the vitamins and minerals a nursing mother needs. My baby and I have been thriving post delivery. We are both getting vital nutrients we need, and my milk production has been great. I think these vitamins have played a part in that, and I highly recommend them to fellow moms.",

The folate is food derived instead of synthesized folic acid which is what I was looking for. These pills seem large but go down very easy. I've never gagged or had an issue swallowing these vitamins, unlike 99% of the other ones on the market. These are tasteless, don't leave disgusting fish burps in your mouth hours later and don't cause an upset stomach. I highly recommend to anyone who has the bank account to purchase them. Seriously, why are these so expensive?",

Don\u2019t buy those cheap, hard or gummy vitamins at the pharmacy...your body can\u2019t access the vitamins in that Little Rock or in a gummy....read up on it!

There was a difference in scent and flavor between the two bottles I\u2019ve ordered. The first bottle was scent less and odorless. The second bottle had a bit of a fishy smell.

I will finish up the bottle by taking one dose every few days and supplementing with another brand, I'm bummed because I like all of the ingredients, they just work too well for my body!! Also if the addition of choline excites you, do some research and maybe get an additional choline supplement as well, I take 975 MG/day which was emphatically approved by my doctor.",

As you know, that may not work with you, but I personally noticed a huge difference.",
