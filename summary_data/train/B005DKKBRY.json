It has indicators for the % charge it has, when it needs charging, and when it needs cleaning using the ultra-sonic setting. I'm very pleased with it. I'm looking forward to seeing how it operates after about 2 years.",

      "text": "I've been using a Panasonic wet/dry shaver since they first came on the market (yes, that many years). I've always used it wet with shaving cream, until I discovered shaving gel - a major leap forward in the march towards the perfect shave. I don't have a heavy beard. This model (LT41) shaves as close and as comfortably as Panasonic shavers costing twice as much, including the Arc4 shavers. If you decide to try wet shaving, I highly recommend using either King of Shaves or Lily of the Desert shaving GEL -- very close shave with no burn or irritation, and the gel rinses easily off the blades and screen (no need for additional cleaning).",

Sometimes there will be one random hair it just can't grab. The battery doesn't last as long as my past razors. The trimmer is aggressive and imprecise, good for cleaning up patches of hair such as neck, but not good for getting the neck line or trimmer back sideburns.",

Pros: I actually like the ultrasonic cleaning mode: it works quite well and was a feature my previous shaver didn't have. It provides a decent shave (but not noticeably better than previous shaver) Cons: Large bulbous shaving head makes it somewhat difficult to get a close shave just under my nose. All in all it works fine. Just not thrilled.",

In places where the beard is heaviest, it takes forever and still does not give a close shave. The biggest problem for me however is the weird, funky smell that emanates from the blades and embeds in your face. This started after 2 shaves and the first time I rinsed it with warm, soapy water as directed. I try to keep the device really clean, but the odor does not go away...weird, annoying, and very disappointing for the price !",
