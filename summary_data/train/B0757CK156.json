Definitely don't catch any inner cord fibers or it's toast. I can't speak knowledgeable about the rope's construction other than I read up on it and the 8 strand double braided polyester is a solid rope for what I need it to do. For what rope costs this is a good deal. I appreciate that it arrived on schedule and it was exactly what they advertised it was. Yes, I'd buy it again. Oh! I tried my Prusik cords and they work great.",
