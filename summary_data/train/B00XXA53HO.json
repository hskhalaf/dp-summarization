I ended up taking out the bottom rack as I felt like I couldn't really clean the sink after rinsing dishes, and I don't mind the mild scratches that result. The sink is heavy, deep, beautiful and so durable. My two-year old and four year old both took a bath in it last week. I much prefer the stainless look to the porcelain ones out there and the cost difference is unbeatable. This is one of the best purchases we have ever made. Highly recommend it!",

I love the fact that it includes a dish towel and sponge holder and bottom rack. I have experienced NONE of the slow drain problems people are complaining about. This is MOST DEFINITELY due to improper venting. I have a Moen disposal hooked up to it and it works fantastic. As for scratches ALL stainless will scratch even the $10K Wolf and Viking appliances you need to be careful. Fantastic sink!!!

You can't get too crazy...no one will ever see that spot because it is under the foot of the rack. Overall I think the sink is great.

Instructions imply can be flush mount but I don't see how unless you want to depend solely on caulk to keep water out. Undersink mount I think is the only practical option. Upon installation, the sink drains well. The grate they provide for the bottom is high quality with protective plastic on the feet as well as the sides which prevents metal-on-metal contact. The protection the grate provides more than outweighs the hassle of having to lift it for cleaning. Overall, a quality sink at a reasonable cost.",

Update: 2 years after the install, still LOVE it. 3 13 x 9 pans can soak in it (if I ever need that). My gbaby loves to take baths in it, too. If you are in doubt, BUY THIS SINK.",
