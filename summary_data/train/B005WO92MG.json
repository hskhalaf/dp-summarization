I used regular hot dogs, and since we had a bit of extra time at the start, I used a setting of \"2\", which was sufficient to not only heat up the hot dogs, but to keep them at a nice, consistent temp. When I first used the machine, I had it higher, and the hot dogs \"blistered\" a little bit, which of course only hurt the visual appeal.... \"2\" on this machine is a perfect setting.",

The three rows on the back have a separate control for fast cooking. It takes a while to get the hang of it. But I guess the major rule is to put them on there early and let them cook slowly, they taste better that way. CONS: The drip tray has very sharp edges, be careful when washing it. It can slice your fingers if you are not careful",

It works exactly as it is supposed to, cooking hotdogs at a higher setting on half the rollers and keeping the rest warm on the other half. My unit was slightly bent on arrival due to the lack of packing material in the box, just a cosmetic issue and I really can't complain given the price paid.",
