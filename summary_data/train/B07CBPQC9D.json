Camera now blink red and no matter how long i press the reset button it won't reset. I now have a nice blinking paper weight.",

We love the app and alerts and so far all is going well with it. Makes us happy to have a little peace of mind when they aren't around. Also has very good picture quality.",

My only complaint is I would like to see better instructions. Maybe a page that points out the parts of the camera, and what's included in the box. Basically, this is a very nice camera set up.",

I opened this product and read the directions and set it up looking at my back door and it's been sitting there for the past month, no problems. The picture quality is perfect.

The microphone feature is very good though, night vision is spactacular, backup battery is convenient, it looks sexy with a nice base, and when the footage is delayed, it catches up nicely.",
