For Father's Day this year, my oldest son got me a great knife roll-bag and said I should put my knives in it; but I didn't was to put my home kitchen knives in it. This special bag deserved special knives. After an extensive online search for affordable yet fantastic professional knives, I came across the Dalstrong series. I ordered them, and THEY ARE FANTASTIC! Consistently sharp, beautifully constructed, and well balanced. These knives are THE BOMB! Any chef looking for affordable quality should look no further than Dalstrong!",
