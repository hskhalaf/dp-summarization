I have just a small heated indoor greenhouse and last year I had floor to ceiling racks with bootstrap trays full of veggies and flower plants. For cleanup I fill a garbage can with water and some bleach toss in my trays as I empty them for a quick disinfectant cleanup. I hope they come up with the 4 inch transplant containers as I get tired of paying for new ones every year. Best planting trays ever! Plus I love that they are made in the USA",
