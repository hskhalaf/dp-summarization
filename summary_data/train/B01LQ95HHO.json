The first one was a Philips 6500 and it had obviously been opened so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement would not charge so again I returned it.",

I tried most of the cheap \u201creplacements\u201c and they were terrible. Finally I thought I would try a new moderately priced model. I couldn\u2019t see how Philips could stay in business with another poor product. This shaver is great. All of the features listed are true. So, for the price of 4 cheap replacement heads you can have the shaver that works like the one you had for many years. And since you now only need to purchase the circular blades and not the whole head, maintenance is less expensive as well.",
