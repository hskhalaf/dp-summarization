The zipper is of reasonable quality, but if I had to pick one thing to improve upon this would be the area that I chose. Don't get me wrong- I don't find it to be a weakness, but considering the profile of a covered cart I would have paid more for a kahuna sized zipper. I have high expectations and would definitely recommend this purchase to others.",
