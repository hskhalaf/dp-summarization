His school really emphasized sight words, so he never paid attention to letters, mixing \"and\" and \"the\" and so on. So, after working with word families for several weeks (on my own), I purchased \"Learn to Read.\" It has been amazing!!! My son has been able to blend the sounds so quickly, actually reading, rather than just going off his 45 sight word list from the school. He does about 5-6 lessons per day and we make it into a game after each one. Great buy! Highly recommend!",

We finished lesson 59 this morning, so we\u2019re more than halfway through the book! I truly love how open-and-go the lessons are, as well as the progression of concepts and the consistent review. There are additional resources listed in the back of the book that I\u2019m looking forward to exploring as well! Thank you Ms Braun for a quality resource for early learners.",
