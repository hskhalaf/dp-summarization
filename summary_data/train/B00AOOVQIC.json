Update: June, 2017: the ratcheting mechanism is still great, with a very strong \"pull: however, the hose itself is still fine, but where it attaches to the ferrule for the quick-connects(the side where you attach your tools) has split over time and caused an air leak. Fortunately, I had a new GOODYEAR (red) hose that I replaced it with(not too difficult). However, I am disappointed with the quality of this assembly as I have never experienced this type of failure with any of my other hoses.",
