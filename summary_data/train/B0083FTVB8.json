Instant entertainment! The sound isn't booming--you get what you pay for--but it is fine for home use. We are very satisfied customers.",

You can turn down the \"voices\" so that the music dominates and not the original singers. We had the singing machine (pink one) and it required cd's which were horrible. This is 100 times better then that and we recommend it highly!",

Also I should have taken note of the height adjustment since it is too tall for my son even when it is at its shortest setting. Other than that I suppose the next person might find it a good buy.",

The coolest is that there is a button to mute the singer in the song so that the karaoke star can have center stage and sing her/his heart out with just the music in the background.

It took us a few minutes to figure out the best way to get our music but after that we were up and running! We like the stand because it makes them feel like they're on stage. The sound is good. If you're a serious karaoke singer, this may not be for you. But if you're an amateur who enjoys singing for fun, it's a really good product at a great price! Don't forget to buy an extra microphone! You can hook up 2 to the system!",

I thought I would have to buy that myself. its nice that it comes with a 2nd mike attachment. the controls are straightforward. my only idea for improvement is for the karaoke machine to be able to record your session for later playback. no feedback on the mikes.",

We haven't done much with the karaoke aspect yet as they are just enjoying singing with the microphone and using regular songs from their ipods. The quality is good (for our use) and you can get an additional microphone to go with it, which I intend to do. You can also hook up your guitar to it.",
