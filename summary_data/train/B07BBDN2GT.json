      "text": "Almost fell in love with this product. Almost. Love everything except for one kind of important deficit. Unfortunately the makers of this back pack sling think the most you want to carry for hydration is a bottle less than 2 1/8 inches in diameter. That basically limits you to a tiny 7.5 oz soda can or something similar in circumference. Forget any respectable water bottle. You\u2019ll have to be content to carry that by hand. Would it have killed them to have a little extra fabric for that sleeve on the side? Granted, I know this is a first world problem, but from an athletic apparel company like Under Armor, this seems like a rather shortsighted decision.",

It is made to only go one way over your right shoulder, which is a bummer because half the time I put it on wrong! I wish it could be worn on either shoulder. Side pocket, that I assume was made for a water bottle is not big enough for any type of water bottle in my opinion. Even though this bag has a few cons, I am still quite satisfied with it!",
