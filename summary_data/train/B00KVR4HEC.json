This makes new gear more situational instead of being strictly better than others.

Progression (or lack thereof) is one point I keep coming back to when trying to give this another go. I just can't seem to get any traction to progress. Maybe I just don't get it?? Update: thanks to David for commenting on my post - took his suggestions and am digging it again. Thanks! :)",

This game also has a horror element to it with everything you do revolving around blood. I could rant about how lovely this game is, but you can only truly experience through playing it.

I didn't play any of the Dark Souls series after that - so I'd say I was relatively fresh to the Souls series. Bloodborne definitely isn't a Souls game, although it does have a similar taste. Bloodborne was also one of the most frustrating games I've played recently - until you understand how the combat system really works and how much aggression is rewarded in the game. Beating the game is genuinely satisfying, and when I finally get my platinum trophy all the frustration will be worth it.",

This game is pretty challenging and I appreciate that because it makes you put time and effort into the game. The graphics really display the power of the Playstation 4. This is a must have for your PS4 collection.",

You work so hard to progress/beat bosses that when you are finally rewarded, it is almost euphoric. I have literally found myself grunting out loud and flipping off the TV as a boss goes down. I can't say any other game has affected me this way. Get ready to waste a lot of your free time ;) 5/5 highly recommended",

The difficulty and the game design makes it very rewarding and force you to level up and kick every enemy's ass. The secrets, treasures and level design are just awesome.

Hours and Hours of play and quite a bit of swearing at the TV, great fun!!!",
