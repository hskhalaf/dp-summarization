I contacted Ashley customer support via email, numerous times. Sent them all the requested information required for \"what I thought\" was going to be a smooth warranty transaction. I have requested an update status to my claim, as of this writing 12/28, no confirmation of warranty status. The combination of poor material quality and poor to no customer support, would steer away from Ashley",

It\u2019s just that the sofa it\u2019s a little bit smaller than local brands we had tried out. Also, the fabric on the cushions and pillows does not seem to breathe as well as other fabrics we have had in the past. It\u2019s not hard to start sweating on a warmer day.",

It has a bit of a rough texture, but I think that will be a good thing for durability. Instructions for assembly were the worse I have ever seen. It was 2 steps... step 1: remove cushions, step 2: picture of completed set with a note to tighten all screws. Does not tell you how many screws, or where they are or how to orient the pieces.",

The furniture itself is sturdy and appears to be durable (hard to say since we've only had for a week...but they don't feel at all flimsy). When this arrives in its giant box, there will be some assembly required, but it was fast and easy to do so, and all the tools were provided. We're super happy with the attractive set. (We got the grey...it's a very subtle and pleasing color, not at all drab like one might worry grey would be.) RECOMMENDED!",
