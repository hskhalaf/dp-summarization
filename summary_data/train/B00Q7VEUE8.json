This is the second one I purchased and the range is good, wireless performance is good and it has the ability to use the same SSID as your router with support for both 2.4Ghz as well as 5Ghz routers. Also, it does have ethernet ports on it so that you can hard wire devices right to it. I would certainly recommend this for improving the wireless signal to the fringe areas that your existing signal is not reaching good enough.",

This extender, used with a Linksys AC 1900 Router, literally extends the same WiFi signal. No need to sign on to multiple selections, just obtain the ability to move much further from your central router seamlessly. I initially thought this thing didn't wok, but in fact it works flawlessly.",
