I use it for balance and weakness and the type of bottom on it helps so much. The handle, held the traditional way, is a little uncomfortable because of the bump but a slight adjustment in hand position adds comfort and stability.

Price was right as I knew it was only a temporary need. The only negative is having to use an allen wrench (which I was lucky enough to already own a set) and also how hard it was to turn. For someone who lives alone and doesn't have an allen wrench set, this may be an issue. Otherwise, I highly recommend!",

Turn cane upside down 2. Remove center screw completely with Allen wrench 3. Place cane on floor like you would use it. 4. Straddle the plastic base with both of your feet, holding it tight. 5. Now using cane handle, just forcibly turn it 90degrees. Now base is aligned correctly, front-back. 6. Turn cane upside down again. 7. Replace set center screw and tight with Allen wrench.

I could definitely see this being an issue for an older person who may have difficulty bending over or squatting. I do like the design.
