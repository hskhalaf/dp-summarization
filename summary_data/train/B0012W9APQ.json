      "text": "I've been using the Canon Pixma iP100 Printer for about the last 10 years, or whenever it first came out. I work in different law offices every day and needed a \"portable office\". The iP100 is reliable, prints quickly and is a hard worker. I print approximately 500 sheets of paper each week with the iP100 and it just keeps on going. After about 2 years of very heavy duty use, the printer starts to not feed the paper through as well or gets paper jams, so I know I need to retire it and get a new one. For the price, this is a great printer!",

In other words, I can't be racing back to the office to get that last minute motion done, or to write that important letter. I take my Mac Air everywhere, of course, and I use this wonderful little printer in the motel, even in the (parked) car sometimes to get the paperwork printed which is essential to the day. It has never failed me. I suggest travelers who have to generate print, consider this. And, don't forget to get a converter for 12v operation in your vehicle.",

After extensive online research, this Canon PIXMA iP 100 was the winner. Good luck finding another printer with this print quality for both photos and text, or this amount of versatility and features including portability (battery pack and bluetooth adapter are available options), and all for a price under $175, which is less than I paid for it's predecessor in 1995.

When I started over, however, I did so with the use of the drivers from Canon's website. I highly recommend that you do the same. That time the install took about 10 minutes and went smoothly. So, bottom line, great printer but make sure you download the latest software from Canon's site and DO NOT use the included CD-ROM.",

The bluetooth feature works perfectly using the Canon BU-30 blue tooth adapter which I purchased separately and installed in the printer. Print quality is excellent and the small size of the printer is amazing.",

I was very pleased when it also printed out beautiful photos. Didn't matter if I printed 4x6 blanks or full letter-size: photos looked great. One thing to watch though - you need space for the paper to come out so no interruptions in the paper flow.

I am very happy with the quality of the photos. Any printer will print B&W text pages but a moblile printer that will output quality photos is tough to find. Too bad that Canon makes it so difficult to buy their photo paper - but that's different story. HP, Epson and Moab photo papers all work fine.
