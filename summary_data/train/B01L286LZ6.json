Thank goodness we have a new toilet with an easy to remove seat but when the commode isn't in use we have to put the seat back on. After it arrived I realized the brand name wasn't the one we originally had been using thus the mistake was of my own doing. However, for those just purchasing the commode don't be surprised if the hood isn't a bit short.",
