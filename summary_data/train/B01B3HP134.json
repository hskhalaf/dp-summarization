It didn't burn, but it didn't do a good job of removing the hair. The tube was half empty when it arrived. OK, so they put 60ml (2.1 oz.) in a 4 oz. tube. This is VERY expensive for the amount you get. I'm going back to that big orange bottle that Sally Hansen sells--13.5 oz for the same price.",

I've got dark thick hairs and it works just as advertised. Simply follow the directions and you'll be fine.
