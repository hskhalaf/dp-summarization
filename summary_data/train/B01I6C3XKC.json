It was found useful for cross-training and also served as a great everyday walking shoe. Although it was liked by many, some people were not happy with the materials used in the footwear. But in the end, it came highly recommended for its performance and build.",

        "A majority of consumers found the Nike Air Epic Speed TR II light and comfortable",

(Squats, deadlifts, lunges etc) First thing I noticed was the minimal arch support. (Not an issue for me but obviously worth mentioning.) Almost as though the outer edge of the shoe (think pinky toe down to edge of outer heal) was elevated. Regardless the shoes were comfortable whilst training. By the end of the workout the shoes had definitely broken in and the seemingly elevated outer edge was much less noticeable. Not sure if I would wear these every leg workout but they are worth keeping in my rotation.",

They are super stable with the chunky heel, but also super soft, so I don't want to commit to using these for weightlifting, etc. I also didn't have a lot of confidence they would do rope climbs well with the smooth mid sole. I picked up some Reebok ROS Workout TR's instead, and I'm happy with them.",
