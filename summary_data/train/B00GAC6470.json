Careful not to bend over to reload one rocket while your excited child is stomping the other one... but I\u2019ve been hit at pretty close range and it didn\u2019t hurt. So... safe for all ages! Ha. We had the original version for a couple of years before the rockets tore apart (likely because of destructo-baby). These are a slightly different design but work just as well. Note that my husband bought a different brand of the same idea at a major toy store, and they barely flew, so we returned them. Get this specific brand for sure.",

Seems to be decent quality. This toy was enjoyed by kids and adults alike. When the adults/big kids use the stomp rocket those rockets really fly! My 3 year old said the rockets were his favorite part of the picnic and we had a bounce house and face painting too. I\u2019ve been asked by several parents where I bought it. I know quite a few children will be getting this toy for holidays and birthdays. Thank you for a great entertaining toy!",

For the weeks following his birthday he refused to come inside because he loved playing with this toy so much. My nieces and nephews (ages 3, 6, 8, and 12) all loved playing with the dueling stomp rocket, and so did the adults!!!!! The initial set up took all of 2 minutes, almost all ages are able to refill the rockets by themselves and anyone can participate!! The initial toy only comes with Red rockets so if you purchase the Blue rockets it'll make the distance competitions fun and easy to judge! Awesome purchase!! Would definitely purchase again!!!",

This product was taken to my in-laws as its an outdoor toy and we don't have much room here at home. A week later (and after being used for about 2 total hours), the fins on the rockets started to rip and one rocket was bent. You can tape the fins back on, but once the rockets start to bend, they won't go on the launcher properly and therefore won't launch correctly. Again, my kids love the product, it just won't last long.",

We had a party and had kids running and jumping to launch rockets without a single adjustment needed the whole time. The kids played and played. We love it. We even made paper rockets as a craft then launched them as well. It even will fit our rockets from our junior set so we are very happy with this setup.",

They do not go on tightly, so when you stomp on the yellow pad- they detach from the tubes. So we taped them with duct tape and that seems to have done the trick. The kids LOVE competing to see who's rocket goes higher!",
