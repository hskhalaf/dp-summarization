When I stretched the closure; it only measured to 10\u201d but my install was scheduled for the day I received the hair so it was pointless to send it back but the seller did communicate with me and offered me options to rectify the situation. I absolutely love my hair now, it\u2019s beautiful. Will be purchasing again.",

When I curled the hair the curls last long, longer than any other hair I\u2019ve ever had. I did a half up half down hairstyle and This last time, I bought 3 bundles and a frontal. Only issue I had was the frontal lace being dark but I made it work and the lace doesn\u2019t come pre-plucked so you have to customize it. Overall the quality of the hair is good, especially for the price. Check my Youtube channel @forevershani for a review",

This hair is soft doesn't shed and I love my closure as well. This is my first time getting it so I will have to write another review after the 2nd installment. I believe this is where they girls who sale hair buys theirs from and charge customers 3xs. Glad I took the chance and purchased them. Love it so far!!!!",
