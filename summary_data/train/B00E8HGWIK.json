The disk space usage meter has never shown a reduction in disk space used. Since my disk space used now shows at over 85%, I contacted TiVo to learn how to reset the meter. The response was there is currently no way to reset the used space meter. So at this point I can only hope there is enough space available when I set up new recordings. I do not recommend this product or any TiVo recording product that does not show current space used or preferably currecnt space available for use or both.",

But if you do the math you'll see that in 3 to 4 years that pays for itself and you can still sell the device to help buy a new one. Being able to record 6 shows at once is great and streaming to iOS is almost perfect and I'm sure it will get there. The Roamio is also quieter and cooler than my previous fios dvr and that's good. I wish the remote had a stop button, it's hard getting used to hitting left arrow or tivo central or even live TV to stop a show.",
