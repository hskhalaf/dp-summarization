It's organized the way I like it to keep certain things grouped together (IDs, CCs, Medical Cards, etc.). Some people complaining about the smell must not have ever owned real leather before. I am pretty sensitive to smells and this does NOT have an odor other than a slight new-leather smell which is fine.",

I would try to rotate them but then...yes...it would crack the bottoms! I picked this wallet for two reasons. The credit cards are kept vertical, so hopefully no cracking the edges off anymore. 2nd, it has a divider in the money holder so I can keep cash on one side and receipts on the other. It is made of a very soft leather and seems well built.",

When I got it I was happy with the capacity and the number of slots for cards, etc. However, after about 6 months of normal use the dye started coming off the leather, leaving big white streaks. It looked like I had had it for 20 years or I had washed it in the dishwasher or something, and I'm pretty delicate with my belongings. So, if you want a wallet that will look decent for more than a few months I would suggest you keep looking.",

The edge of the ID is flush with the leather trim around the window, instead of inside it where the trim could help hold the ID in place when it catches on the trim. Not a deal breaker at all, but it keeps that fifth star off of my rating.",
