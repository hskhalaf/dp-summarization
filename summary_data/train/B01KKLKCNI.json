Im happy with the small footprint, it does make noise but compared to my older game pc its very quite even when playing intensive games. You can open it up and upgrade it, which is a bonus, and the separation of the power supply from the main pc will help with good temperatures inside this small unit. There is a water cooled version (for the processor) I contact MSI and they do not sell the components to upgrade this unit, which is unfortunate.",

The case itself is very small and comes with a handle in the back to carry around my Loft with ease. The ventilation is very efficient and when playing Overwatch at 1440p 144hz on Medium settings my GPU never gets above 55C. Buying the Aegis was worth every penny IMO. I paid the extra $150-250 to have it prebuilt and to not have to worry about receiving any dead components and waiting for delivery if any part I bought individually was dead.",
