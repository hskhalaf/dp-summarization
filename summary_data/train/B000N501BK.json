I was making chili in it today and had it on the stove at medium heat with oil in it when suddenly it bursted into flames. This is extremely upsetting to me and it has caused damage to both my stovetop and made my pan unusable. I'm unsure if this pan just malfunctioned or if something is wrong with all of these products.",

This pan lost it's enamel shortly after the first month of use. It became impossible to cook anything , except water without it sticking. Terrible investment.

The pot is not so easy to clean, the high temperature lives some spots on the surface. It is ok with me. I am sure if you want to keep your pans and pot like new, don\u2019t use it.

Even heating with sealed-in moisture, and some of the easiest cleanup around, which is a massive consideration for something like this.
