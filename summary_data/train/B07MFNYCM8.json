I do like the gel consistency when you first dispense the product however I dont understand the turning to milk part...whats the point? And I absolutely agree with other reviews, it does leave a slightly oily residue on your skin but nothing that has been problematic to my combination skin. In conclusion, if you find a product you love just spend the money, you'll spend alot of time and money trying to find a cheaper alternative and its just not worth it.",

If you have dry, sensitive, or normal/balanced skin, this might be a good cleanser for you. For me, it didn't clean deeply enough and it provided more moisturizing than my skin needs.",

It is gentle. It does not irritate my skin It doesn't leave it feeling tight and over-dried. I like that is doesn't make a big foamy mess. (My plumbing appreciates that, too) I like that it is paraben, phthalate, fragrance and dye-free. I like that it is not tested on animals. I just plain like it.",

She reported no adverse reactions to the product, while praising the creamy and appealing consistency of the gel after it becomes wet. She stated the product completely removes makeup without any scrubbing or hard wiping, and afterwards leaves her face very soft and fresh. My lady highly recommends this cleanser, and plans to make it an everyday, go-to product.",

When I finished rinsing off my face, it did not feel clean and bright, it felt like I had a thin layer of something on it. I wound up washing it again with something else to get it off. I don't like leaving negative reviews, so I very much hope that other people have a different experience.",
