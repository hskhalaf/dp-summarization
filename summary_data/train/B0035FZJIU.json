When trying to find a camera that had all the features I'd want and the ease of learning for my parents, this was a no-brainer. While they aren't the most tech-savvy, figuring this camera out and all the options was an ease for them and they have enjoyed it ever since. I highly recommend this camera for not only beginners, but for advanced photographers wanting something pocket-sized instead of a DSLR as this can do so many of the same things.",

Now, my high end SLR is being relegated to very specific jobs that demand extremely high resolution and ultra wide angle lens. For the rest, and traveling, the SD3500IS, is the perfect companion. On top of that, the HD movies are very good, even though you can't zoom optically. Don't forget to leave the IS (Image stabilization) on all the time, specially for telephoto (80-120 mm) shots.",

This allows most of the controls to be performed by touch, but also allows a full camera size screen preview of a scene that my older eyes can see at arms length above my head for instance. Canon's settings screen are very intuitive and easy to navigate, much more so than the equivalent Nikon's. I have two, I liked it soo much.",

The night feature of the Canon is superior to any camera that I have ever used. When I travel, I will take both my Kodak and Canon cameras. The Kodak has excellent share capabilities and it is easy to manage my pictures on line. I like the rechargeable feature of the batteries on both cameras. The 5 optical zoom and motion features are outstanding on both cameras when shooting from the window of a bus or airplane. I purchased both cameras from Amazon and would suggest either camera.",

After a lot of research this one has a great shutter speed for such a small camera. It takes great pictures, I love the color accent feature.

I'm totally satisfied and using this product almost daily ,I would recommend it above and beyond all other digital Cameras , ENJOY Jay Gugel, Gold river Calif.",

Unfortunately, even though this camera is 14 megapixels, the images from the Olympus look much better. It almost looks like the camera is compressing the image too much before storing it on the card. Fine details in the image like hair, grass, leaves, carpet, patterns in clothing, etc. end up just a blurred fuzzy splotch. We returned the camera for this reason and ended up ordering the Canon Powershot S95.",

Sometimes you have to tap hardly. I also missed the printed instruction manual that comes with the SD870 in this highly priced camera. It is very complicated to go to your PC every time you need to learn about any camera function. Overall it is a nice camera that I would recommend despite the but high price.",

One drawback I find with the video is there is no way to use fades and wipes between scenes. I must also say the image quality isn't too shabby either . If you want a good, fun, and interesting digi-camera, then this is the one for you, but if you wan't professional results, buy a professional model because you'll only be disappointed.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD3500IS 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch Touch Panel LCD and 5x Ultra Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Pink)",
    "description": "Color:PinkFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Touch. It's always been the heart of communication. Simply put your finger to the brilliant 3.5-inch wide PureColor System Touch Panel LCD screen, and the versatile excellence of the Canon PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH is at your command. Naturally, a camera this smart and intuitive knows a few things about style. Color gleams, while smooth curves reveal a definite edge. Touch the future! \n\nPowerShot SD3500IS Highlights \n\nNext-generation 3.5-inch LCD with Touch Panel Technology\nJust touch your finger to the huge 3.5-inch wide PureColor System LCD screen with Touch Panel Technology and the PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH responds--creating a fun, natural interface that's just the way you want to interact with technology now. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH provides a natural, tactile method for viewing your photos: With Active Display technology, tapping the camera prompts images to playback, one after the other. Touch the screen when the camera is tilted, and the images will advance. \n\n\n14.1-megapixel resolution will generate high quality 16.5 x 23.4-inch prints\nWith 14.1 megapixels, the PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH provides amazing image resolution, catching the truly exquisite details that will make your photography top-notch. The PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH is the very image of photography at its best, featuring megapixels that's among the highest resolution of the Digital ELPH series to capture every detail of the world around you. \n\nThere's never been a better time to think big, knowing that every enlargement will be sharper and more full-of-life than you've ever experienced before. \n\n24mm ultra wide-angle lens, and 5x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer\nDespite its slim profile and small body, the PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH is equipped with a 5x optical zoom--no more sitting on the sidelines with the action too far away. \n\n\nThe lens is ultra wide-angle, with a focal length of 24mm. That puts more image in every shot for visual excitement and a high-end feel. And the best part? Even at the long end of the zoom, images are clear and steady thanks to Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer that controls camera shake. \n\n\n720p HD movie shooting capability plus HDMI output\nThe PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH lets you record video in beautiful high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies (and still photos) on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high definition TV monitor. \n\n\nYou'll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 thumbnails at once. \n\nSmart AUTO will do the work for you by intelligently selecting from 22 settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you're getting dramatic, memorable images. Even if your subject is moving, Canon's advanced detection technologies capture the action as it happens. \n\nShooting Modes\nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 19 Shooting Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nNew scene modes such as Miniature Effect and Fisheye Effect\nThe Canon PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH offers creative effects similar to those once found only in professional lenses. Miniature Effect creates an illusion where very large objects appear in miniature. Turn soaring cityscapes into a scene in seemingly dollhouse-like proportions. \n\n\nFisheye Effect uses barrel distortion to warp the image around the center, giving a distinctive curvature effect to the photo. The curvilinear images produced by Fisheye Effect can suggest the curve of the Earth, the inside of a dome, or the image you see through the peephole of a door. \n\nWith an ISO of 400-6400, the Low Light mode takes the Canon PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH where no ELPH-Series has gone before: into the shadows! Now even scenes notorious for having insufficient light, such as those lit by candles, fire, or street lamp, come through in fantastic color and clarity, with less noise. You can keep the feel of the scene intact without adding additional light, so the result will be scenes with the visual accuracy, depth and clarity you expect from a Canon camera. \n\n\nNew Smart Shutter technology \nSmart Shutter, which includes Smile Self-Timer, Wink Self-timer and Face Detection Self-timer, detects faces in the scene and releases the shutter automatically in response to the appearance of an additional face, or when a smile or sassy wink occurs. These technologies help to make your photography less rushed and more natural, so getting the perfect shot is even easier. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * PowerShot SD3500 IS Digital ELPH Body \n * Lithium-ion Battery Pack NB-6L \n * Battery Charger CB-2LY \n * Wrist Strap WS-DC10 \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400",
