      "text": "I\u2019ve been using it for around 2 months and am really enjoying it. The lights were pretty easy to install and the built-in control is very convenient. They look fantastic! However, my [small] caveats are: 1. The app is a bit slow in starting up and connecting. I usually just use the built-in controls for this reason. 2. Sometimes the colors don\u2019t actually flash with the music. Once in a while I can get it in sync, but oftentimes it\u2019s flashing on its own mysterious beat. Vid attached is from one of those few times it worked properly. ;) Overall, purchase was worth it. Edit: 10 months in, they\u2019re still working great!",

Pros: - Music changes to the beat of the music with is great for a music lover like me. - Able to be controlled via remote or on your phone which is SUPER convenient - Gets people's attention if you have your windows up or down because of how bright they are at night!! Only Con I have: - Colors don't fade into others, its a static switch which is okay but i would love that feature That's my two cents on this product and i would DEFINITELY recommend this to your friends and family!!",

Update as of 3/9/19: I have purchased a total of 3 of these kits. The original one is working well, and one is still in the box. The third one was installed today: half of the lights are dim and only show some colors, but worse, the cigarette lighter adapter started to smoke, filling up the car immediately. I\u2019d keep my eye on these, and possibly go with another brand in the future.",

EDIT: someone from the company contacted me promptly and gave me a solution. If you download the app and update it fully, it will correct the noise. Wonderful set of lights.",

Also the cords are rather cumbersome which creates a problem if trying to stick them anywhere but right under your feet. This product would benefit from wireless blue tooth technology, and each strip having it's own batter source, but that would of course make it too expensive.",

If I would've taken the time, it can be pretty easily concealed. I'm definitely not a car person, but was able to figure it out without issue. The only complaint I have is the adhesion that comes with the product. It refused to stick. Like others, I had to buy some external tape which seemed to do the trick.",

Adhesive isn't very strong, tried two different kinds of tape, still looking around for more to keep lights stuck. The lights don't sync very well with music unless the music is really loud, lights still jump around between colors even when music is paused. ALSO, I have a Bluetooth FM Transmitter for my music and when I use that with the lights, there is a ringing sound, but only on the colors purple, orange, and white. So I guess I will just have to use my aux cord. But all these problems can be fixed and still have good lights.",
