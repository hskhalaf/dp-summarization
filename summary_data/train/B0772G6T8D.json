      "text": "I watched a ton of YouTube videos about inflating this kind of thing and thought I'd be able to do it with relative ease. I bought two to take to an outdoor concert in the summer. Well... my practice filling sessions taught me that unless there was a breeze I was going to be a sweaty mess from running around trying to get enough air into it. I would also be the featured comedy act for others at the concert. I returned mine. That was easy to return and the vendor was fine, it just wasn't a good product for me.",

It's good for its intended purpose of carrying to the beach, but definitely not good as a spare chair around the house or as a gaming chair.",
