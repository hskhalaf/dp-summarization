I take breaks and or sit down because I partial seize sometimes and can't control my hand. Usually pressing the razor down hard against my skin with tight grip and can't move my hand. Or my hands shaking so much I'm terrified to attempt it and can't hold it straight. I've sliced off chunks of skin with other razors because they're not flexible like these. Thank you!!
