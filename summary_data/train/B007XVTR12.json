I did not enjoy the strike force sections. I played the first one then skipped the rest. The play is not to difficult but enough to let me play several times before I get tired of it. I played through the first time in a few days and enjoyed it. I like that you can change your load out at the beginning of each mission. The Zombies I don't know meh.",

Also the multiplayer is as bad as everyone complains about with children and trolls. Seems like a downgrade overall to the previous installments. The single player graphics are marginally improved with a faster pace than struggles to keep inline with XBOX hardware performance.",

Story is a great continuation from the original Black Ops and Graphics are top notch. You do have to play it through Steam so create an account if you do not have one but the story line and ability to choose different outcomes throughout the game was a real refresher and not something you see very often in a FPS. Treyarch has always been my favorite CoD developer and there was no shortage of awesomeness from WaW to this from Treyarch. 5 Stars",

I liked it, but it just didn't overtake me like the previous games. I will say that this hasn't been an issue with COD BO2. not only is zombies back (which takes up the majority of my video gaming time) it is awesome, and I really like the new multiplayer as well. Graphics are great, story in campaign is pretty good, although the campaign is pretty short, but let's face it, we don't buy this game for the campaign. did I say how much I love the new zombies mode?",

It also had one of the weakest endings of a game and the final battle against the villain ends up being the lamest of the COD games, where you only fight his henchmen and not him, who simply gives up without a fight.",

With code you can play online zombies and multiplayer. You need to be connected to internet in order to play which is a down side, but at least im not paying to play online. Another thing is that not many people play online too much. An average of 900-1400 people play a day. Although i prefer xbox version(Xbox version average of 40k-60k play a day) , this will do.

Granted you can get away with just using a quarter of it and still play, but if you want to be competitive on the public maps, you need all of that. LAME.

Overall, the areas that need major improvements are in the spawns, line of sight issues, and eliminating hackers and cheats. The return of dedicated servers would go a long way toward addressing this last issue. Are you listening, Activision?",

A couple of the missions were fun and challenging with the new advanced weapons they've imagined, but it was more of a chore to get through than anything else it could have been. This is a game clearly banking on bored kids to buy and play online until Activision shovels out another installment in the franchise. Buy it cheap, play it if you must and then move on to something (anything) better.",

In this conflict, the mechanized creations of men reign supreme, facing off against each other as their creators stay safe and unconflicted, and in the process grow ever softer. In this scenario an important question will be asked: What happens when enemy steals the keys? To understand such a possible future, you must understand where you have been.\n\nPlayers of Call of Duty: Black Ops II gain an understanding of this and more through the game's additional timeline set in the late Cold War era of the 1980's. Within the campaign story, which spans these two eras, players will see familiar faces such as Alex Mason, his son David Mason, and Sgt. Frank Woods. Linking these together will be the rise of another player in the conflict, Raul Menendez.\n\nKEY GAME FEATURES\n * An all-new Call of Duty: Black Ops storyline featuring new characters and and returning characters\n * A unique single-player campaign that contains two time periods linked by characters and their actions\n * Special Strike Force missions, in which the players action affect the outcome of gameplay and the overall campaign\n * A variety of multiplayer modes and play options\n\nZOMBIES\n\n\nThe Biggest Zombies Experience to Date: Call of Duty: Black Ops II Zombies features three different ways to survive the zombie apocalypse.
