Since this is a two-pack I actually keep one in the car and the other in our diaper bag for changes. I was previously reusing the store bought wipes pouches, but these are of much better quality and the wipes don't dry out as fast. I also like that they don't have to just be for wipes either. They would be great receipt holders or pen cases. I can see myself using these for long after we are past the \"baby-wipes\" stages.",

The only thing negative I have to say about this product is I wish they made a smaller version for face towelettes!",

I can never get wipes to come up like a kleenex box, but don't really mind. Wipes keep moist in the bag for even up to a month and adding new wipes keeps the contents inside moist.
