I will say categorically that the attachment fitting will not work with ANY bike that has hydraulic brakes and probably won\u2019t work with many bikes made in the 21st century. It will not work on either of my bikes, one a hybrid Cannondale purchased in 2013 and the other a Cannondale street bike purchased last year. I have investigated alternative solutions to make it work including longer bolts and different washers - nothing doing. The fitting concept needs to be thoroughly re-thought and redesigned for modern bikes.",

I was actually able to very easily set this up myself in 20mins, it hooked on the bike very easily and very sturdy on the road! Great buy! I don\u2019t regret this purchase at all! So my advise...JUST BUY IT!",

The front wheel that comes with the trailer is just so-so. Its a hard city stroller type wheel. Other than that we enjoy cruising around in it. The seats are much much better than the ones in the pacific cycle and current schwinn trailers made. This has a padded cushion and better construction. We also enjoy the water bottle holder and zippered compartment along the handles. Plenty of spots to put water for our long bike rides with my 5 kids! =)",

My only complaint has nothing to do with the bike trailer itself, but my 22-month old can lean forward and easily get the Velcro to come undone, even when it's buttoned on the sides. She'll throw her shows out of it. Of course we've remedied this by just placing her shoes in the back. But ugh...it drove me nuts at first. I know she'll grow out it. Anyway, we love it and all the room it has. We put her beach toys and a blanket in the back and just go! It's awesome!",

Love that I can use it for when we go to Disneyland, it packs easily in the trunk of my Honda Civic and is easy to pop on the wheels and go whenever I need to get going. Also, love the fact that you can use it as a bike trailer also! Great choice for use as a double stroller. We go out frequently with both our grandsons 4 & 2 and they both fit in it and they love it. Great purchase, would recommend to anyone that is looking for a multi function safe way to travel with little ones and comfortable for them to boot.",

I am still confused as to why there doesn't appear to be a door to this trailer, other than undoing and redoing velcro, and there isn't a great place to tie back the plastic cover that I have found. The instructions are just OK... other than that, it drives smoothly and I barely remember that I am pulling anything behind my bike. We got it for our smaller dog to ride in for when my husband and I ride our bikes to the brewery. :)",
