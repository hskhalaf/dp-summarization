Been talking to tech support since Christmas and they said they couldn't find the serial number and needed a receipt, so finally I told them that I just want a refund cause it was a defective product and they were unwilling to fix their mistake. And they said they can't do refunds... Don't waste your money or time with this terrible company.",
