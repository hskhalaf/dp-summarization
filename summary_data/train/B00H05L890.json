I contacted the company to see if maybe there was a mistake, I even sent them this pictures, but they said that's the way there are, they said \"half full\" but as you can see in my pictures that's not even half full!!! And second it has a strong nasty smell! So, I will never buy this stuff again. I'm very disappointed with the product and with their response of \"half full\"",
