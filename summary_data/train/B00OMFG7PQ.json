Standing in long lines, it provided a place to sit. Maneuvers quite well, and the front bar removes, if the person wants to face forward and scoot along. To fold, you pull up on a strap. It does not lock into folded position, which was unwieldy sometimes. It is a bit heavy, but super sturdy. We recommend taking off the bar in front before giving to an airline, because ours came back with the foam ripped badly during baggage handling. Would highly recommend this walker.",

I purchased this walker to help me move about my home with help because my lower extremities are week and my balance is hindered by neuropathy. I am able to use the seat to rest when I feel like I can no longer stand up. I am a larger woman and I made sure this was a higher weight capacity, which it is by more than 175 pounds over my current weight. I also like the fold up feature as well.",

The wheels on my first one bent after 4 months and the replacement wheels cost half as much as a whole new walker so I just bought a new one. Sometimes they have a hard time folding up and you have to force it but most of the time it folds easily.",

I use bungees below the seat to keep the unit semi closed. Ugh. Would have been so much easier if they'd added something appropriate themselves.",
