I wanted to try the planar technology, so I tried these HiFiMan 400I. I believe they will be my favorite. They are worth the original $500 price, but at $250, they cannot be beat. Light, comfortable with tremendous soundstage. They do not leak as much as the Beyerdynamic DT 990-Premium 600, but a bit more than the Sennhieser 650s. The cord is a little short, so I am buying the longer replacement cord. I recommend these cans to anyone that loves music!!",

So much worse that I switch to Phillips SHP9500 in the non-amp situation. But driven correctly, they are far more enjoyable than my SHP9500 and anything else I have tried. Perhaps the best $179 - $199 phones currently available. Note- make sure you order the HE400i, Not the similarly priced HE400s.",

I searched around a lot for something DT 990 \"like\" and came to the decision between the 400i and 400S. Finally after searching fourm after fourm I pulled the trigger and am actually pretty blown away by the sound quality. I'm using a JDS labs 02 Amp revision B. The dac is run from the optical. Really comfortable headphones. They do get hotter on your ears than the DT990, but its worth the trade off for the sound improvement. All in all I'm very happy with em!",

These tracks included recordings encoded at 44.1/16, 96/24, 192/24, and DSD 2.8. Bottom line: 1st Class audio performance.

It doesn't really matter how good they sound if you can't wear them. Hifi does sell a replacement headband, but it costs $75.00.
