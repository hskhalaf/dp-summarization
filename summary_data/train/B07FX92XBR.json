You can put it on auto takeoff. Like everything, an APP is useful but you can fly without. These little babies really move. They zip all over the place. At first and beyond, it was hard to control and keep track of them. They're well lit, and they're fairly durable, I guess, even with out newbee experience, and out of control play. Mesmerizing for sure. The kids like them. Folds for storage.",

I was able to get a bit higher than I anticipated and still maintain control. Perfect size for beginners. I love the bright colors. I haven\u2019t had any problems so far with the remote or link up.

They are still learning how to perfect their moves, but they enjoy this a lot. They are 7 and 9 years old.",

My husband fared a little bit better, but I sure didn't, and we lost one drone (would no longer work) after just one play session. (In fairness, it did tumble out of the sky.)
