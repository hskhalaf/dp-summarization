On the other hand, it received negative remarks for its narrow sizing and insufficient cushioning.To sum up, the Salomon X Ultra 3 Mid GTX is a good choice for those who want a\u00a0light yet supportive gear. However, to get the best out of it, one must not use it frequently on untamed trails; wearing it with an aftermarket insole can also help.",

They offered me 15% off a replacement pair which I feel is derisory. To sum up, I\u2019m extremely dissatisfied. Salomon have had the chance to remedy this situation but have fobbed me off. My advice is to choose another manufacturer as I will be in the future.......AVOID.",

They have been heavily used for months and are so comfortable. Highly recommended but do buy with care as the sizing is way off.",

The ground was very wet in places and the boots were submerged many times in water but never leaked.
