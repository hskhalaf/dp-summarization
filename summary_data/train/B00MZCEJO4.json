I decided to search google for a decent set of headphones for under $100 and these popped up on a couple of sites. They do not disappoint. They're comfortable to wear, adjustable, the sound quality is great, and they're surprisingly good at noise canceling without being advertised as a noise canceling brand. I also like the groovy, minimalist style.",

Cons: -Bass isn't it's strong point, may disappoint fans of Hip Hop, EDM music etc -Silver headband looks a bit toyish -A little flimsy, feels like it could break easily If your looking for a solid pair of headphones for traveling or light use these are for you!
