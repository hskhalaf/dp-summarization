      "text": "I started taking this b/c my family has a history of thyroid issues. I started having severe indigestion and found in my research that those issues can be connected to thyroid issues. All of my blood tests come back low normal so I am not on medication. I took this supplement and my indigestion went away. After I finished my first bottle, I decided to go without to see if it made a difference. 2 weeks later I had indigestion again so now it's part of my daily routine.",

She declined because she didn\u2019t want to start taking another medicine . She was lethargic and no desire to do anything. I sent these to her and she started taking them...she was feeling better within days with significantly more energy. She takes it regularly now because it makes her feel better. I don\u2019t know how it works but it does. Worth a try for anyone looking for natural thyroid support. Aptly named by this reputable company.",
