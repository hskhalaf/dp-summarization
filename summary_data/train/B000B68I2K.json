      "text": "Waist level finders have always appealed to me whether using an SLR or a medium format camera. So when the R1 combined a waist level capable finder with a giant CMOS imager and a wide zeiss lens, I had to give it a try. I am not disappointed. While it is not the fastest focusing camera out there,it is great for anything short of quick moving subjects. Images are sharp, sharp, sharp. Image stabilzation would be nice, as well as faster focus. But with even these shortcomings..the R1 is worth every bit of its price. Am now hoping for an R2 upgrade of the R1---will be on it like white on rice.",

    "title": "Sony Cybershot DSCR1 10.3MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer The Cybershot R1 camera is the world's first integrated lens digital still camera to combine a professional-grade, 10.3-megapixel image sensor and the flexibility of live preview while shooting. With its ultra-wide Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* zoom lens (24mm to 120mm) and free-angle, two-inch LCD, the Cybershot R1 brings professional level imaging performance to mainstream consumers.\n\n A Class of Its Own\nPhoto enthusiasts know that image sensor size is one of the most important influences on picture quality. Professional-grade image sensors, sometimes referred to as advanced photo system (APS) or APS-class, are many times the size of compact sensors used in point-and-shoot cameras; large sensors deliver extraordinary resolution, high sensitivity to light, and lower image noise or graininess for exceptional pictures. At 10.3 megapixels, the R1's sensor offers one of the highest resolutions available in the APS class.\n\n \n\nThe Sony R1's vari-angle LCD display allows for \"live\" preview and makes complex shooting situations a cinch. Unlike digital SLRs, the Cybershot R1 unit's sensor allows for a \"live\" preview thanks to Sony Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Until now, the extraordinary power consumption of these large sensors has limited their operation to image capture only--unable to support the benefit of a live preview. Sony's distinctive design is employed to reduce power consumption, as well as increase image processing speeds.  The camera's electronic viewfinder or two-inch LCD lets you evaluate scene conditions, such as exposure and how color is rendered before taking a shot. Because the R1 camera can preview electronically, using the image sensor itself in real time, framing is always 100% accurate.\n\n Built Digital from the Ground Up\nThe R1's integrated Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar lens was carefully crafted to take full advantage of the resolution, clarity, and color performance of its APS-class CMOS image sensor. Because of the sensor's live preview capability, there is no need for the camera to have a traditional \"mirror and prism\" construction common to digital SLRs. This allows a lens-to-sensor distance of as little as 2 millimeters, optimizing image quality and color accuracy. \n\n Another benefit of this structure is the ability to incorporate an extraordinary wide field of view and zoom range. The 24mm wide end of the lens is particularly suited for architectural photography, landscapes and large-group portraits, while the 120mm telephoto end is perfect for filling the frame with distant subjects. This is a range not easily matched by any other lens for use with cameras using large-scale image sensors. \n\n Furthermore, no mirror and prism construction means that the R1 is a quiet camera, perfect for shooting at a tennis match or in nature without disturbing wildlife.\n\n Get the Shot without the Backache\nThe Cybershot R1 sports a two-inch LCD screen that folds flat and swivels so you can shoot from nearly any position. This flexibility allows you to get the shots that other cameras miss. For example, you can hold the camera low--down to the ground--for eye-level view shots of kids and pets without having to bend yourself into a pretzel or crawling on the ground.\n\n The Power of Optimal Image Processing\nA 10.3-megapixel camera needs a fast processor. Sony harnessed the power of it Real Imaging Processor LSI to achieve fast response times, low power consumption and clear images.\n\n The new camera features a one-second shot-to-shot time, three-frame-per-second burst shooting, and a shutter-release time of only 7.5 milliseconds. Because it consumes 70 percent less power than Sony's previous processing circuitry, the camera has a battery life of up to 500 shots per charge, which can vary according to use and camera settings.\n\n For enhanced versatility, Cybershot R1 offers three different modes of color reproduction: Adobe RGB used for professional graphics and offset color printing, Standard sRGB for most computer-based uses, and Vivid sRGB for more intense primary colors. \n\n The camera's user selectable Advanced Gradation Control System (AGCS) optimizes image contrast, in order to avoid \"blown out\" highlights in high-contrast scenes and \"crushed\" blacks in low-contrast ones. AGCS evaluates the distribution of brightness and then automatically applies the appropriate gamma curve to achieve better pictures.\n\n Users will also enjoy the added convenience of storing images onto Memory Stick PRO media, as well as CompactFlash Type I and Type II media or Microdrive media. The camera supports both JPEG and RAW formats, which can then be manipulated on a PC using the supplied Sony Image Data Converter SR software.\n\n Other Features\n\n\nShoot with Memory Stick PRO media or Compact Flash I/II cards.  * Dual Media Capability: If you've already invested in high-capacity Flash Memory cards, the DSC-R1 is the camera for you. It accepts Memory Stick PRO media, Compact Flash Type 1/II media, and optional Microdrive media. \n * Memory Stick and Memory Stick PRO Media: Digital. Powerful. Transportable. Memory Stick media is compact, portable, and rugged, connecting a variety of hardware and software applications. \n * Three Color Modes and RAW Capture: Choose standard sRGB for accuracy, Vivid sRGB to emulate reversal film, or Adobe RGB for advanced applications. RAW mode brings the latent image into the Digital darkroom. RAW files must be converted with Sony's Image Data Converter SR software. \n * Advanced Gradation Control System (AGCS): Enhances dynamic range, avoids crushed shadow detail and clipped highlights. \n * Advanced Viewfinder/Monitor Displays: Choose grid lines, zebra stripes, and histogram. Enjoy full-time exposure indication of aperture, Shutter Speed and Exposure Value over/under. \n * Advanced Creative Control: Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Program shift, EV compensation, and full manual exposure control allow you to adjust quickly for a wide range of shooting situations. Capture fast action, control depth of field, and more. \n * Versatile Manual Exposure: Adjust the aperture from f2.8 to f16. Set the shutter from 30 seconds to 1/2000 second, or choose Bulb exposure for up to 3 minutes! Adjust ISO from 125 to 3200. Choose Auto White Balance then fine-tune color temperature by hand. \n * Live Histogram Display and RGB Playback: Available in capture and playback the Live Histogram displays the concentration of Pixels at each luminosity value making it easy to evaluate correct exposure. Histogram in Playback mode also includes RGB information \n * 5 Area Multi-Point AF System: By evaluating 5 separate focus areas of the frame, Sony's Multi-Point AF system can intelligently focus on the subject and avoid mistakenly focusing on the background. In addition, you can manually select a point or position a point anywhere in the frame with Flexible Spot AF. \n * Manual Exposure Control: Flexible Exposure control is provided with Aperture Priority (f2.0 to f8.0), Shutter Priority (30 secibds to 1/3200 second) and Manual Exposure modes. Exposure Value Compensation (EV) and Flash output level control allow for even more control over your images. \n * Slow Shutter Noise Reduction: During long exposures, those longer than 1/25 second, the camera captures two exposures with each press of the shutter button. The first exposure captures the scene, and the second exposure captures the CCD noise pattern with a dark frame exposure. By subtracting the two, even long exposures can be clear. \n * Raw Mode: Capture raw data directly from the CCD before any in-camera processing, while a separate JPEG is stored for viewing convenience. Sony's IDC RAW converter software provides extensive control of Gamma, White Balance, color, and sharpness for fine tuning the image. \n\nWhat's in the Box\nSony R1 digital camera, NP-FM50 InfoLithium battery, an AC-L15 adapter, a USB and video cables, neck/shoulder strap, and CD-ROM software with PicturePackage and Image Data Converter SR for RAW.",
