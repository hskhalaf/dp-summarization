      "text": "I was looking for an easy-to-use wireless home printer (the scanning and copying were just a bonus). This one is wonderful. I'm using a MacBook Pro and have an Airport Extreme Wireless router. Follow the instructions step by step for the setup. After installing the software, I hooked up the printer to the laptop and finished the setup. Once it was all done, I was able to unplug the printer and move it all the way down the hall into a back room out of the way. It immediately found the signal again and worked smoothly. Just keep it filled with paper and I can print from anywhere in the house. Very quiet operation.",

Somehow it cuts off your ink supply before it even completely runs out. Then it shutsdown until you order a new cartridge through Lexmark. It will not allow refills or over the counter brands.

Also, I am getting a weird message since installing the printer software: Microsoft.Net Framework 2.0 must be downloaded (in order for everything to work correctly). Well, I tried to download it from the MS website and the graphics that come up are so old looking this must be an ancient application - then it finally says it doesn't support 64 bit. So far, I am really disappointed - I guess there was a reason it was on sale.",
