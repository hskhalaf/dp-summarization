It\u2019s not thick and goopy, zero lumps or clumps, and it goes on smoothly without dragging your lashes through the ringer. It\u2019s definitely more on the subtle side \u2014 not intended for volume but more for the purpose of adding length. It stays all day in South Florida heat without budging or smudging. The only con (which is true of nearly all waterproof mascaras) is that it\u2019s very difficult to get off with soap and water alone. An effective make up remover is necessary, so keep that in mind when you purchase.",

Too big of a brush and you can't get close enough to the roots without smudging; too small and there's nothing for your lashes to grip on to. This created long, defined, very black lashes that lasted until I took it off at night. Plus it was easy too remove with a makeup towelette reducing lash loss.",

I feel like it's not quite as long-lasting as the Exact Eyelights waterproof formula was, but that's probably a good thing - I don't lose any eyelashes when I'm using makeup remover pads to clean it off.",
