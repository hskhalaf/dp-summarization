I was perfect for 2. Comfortable. Easy to set up. Easy to put away after the season. A little difficult to drain because the drain is on the bottom. I think it should be on the bottom of a side because the valve wouldn't stay open and, being on the bottom, the water won't drain unless we held the side up which is why I only gave it 4 stars.",

Would collapse overnight or after about 6 hours on one side and water would leak out over the side. I could not find where air was leaking out. I had to purchase a small pump and blow it back up every morning and add new water. Not worth what we paid. Found out real cost was much lower but price went up a lot during pandemic. Recommend they include a pre-sized solar cover option with it since there is no cover except to order a round one and cut to fit.",
