On a interesting note; I've noticed how invested I (early 30s) and even little kids can gravitate to different characters and feel like this game was made for us individually. very diverse I give this game a 9.8 out of 10",

I won't go into characters or stages, as opinionated as I may be, but the cast lineup is solid and the newcomers, diverse.

It also doesn't help that this game doesn't support the Circle Pad Pro as a c-stick. But like I said, it may take a while, but you'll get the hang of it.

Also keep in mind the main appeal of this game is to play with other people, where it can be insanely fun if you have some friends to play with. You can still play solo but it won't be near as much fun as playing with people you know.",
