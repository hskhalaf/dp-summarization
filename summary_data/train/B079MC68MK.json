After some research I came across this one & was immediately happy to see it caterers to colored pencils as well as regular. Many electric helical sharpeners only recommend use for regular. I sharpened my prismacolor verithins & saw immediate results. I even updated my review of those pencils as they are much better to use now. Also works great on soft core premiers.",

      "text": "I got this to be portable pencil sharpener because my university doesn't have pencil sharpeners in every classroom. On the one hand, it is larger than I expected. Not significantly, but noticeably. It sharpens pencils excellently, and is easier to use than my $30 pencil sharpener at home. I was disappointed that it uses a traditional power jack instead of a miucro usb connection. Would have been more convenient, as now I have to ensure I never lose the included cable if I don't want to buy batteries. However, all my complaints are nitpicks. So far, it seems like an excellent electric sharpener and for the price you can't do better.",

Did not seem to have an automatic shutoff, but got the pencils nice and sharp, and could hear a difference in the sound when that happened. Overall, good for the money.
