      "text": "Assembled in two days time. I love cedar wood because of its weather durability and appearance, but it\u2019s not the strongest wood and larger people should take caution. The slide comes in two pieces and when even the smallest of my kids goes down it I can see it bend in the middle where it was connected. My biggest complaint is the slide and how close the swings are to each other.. The kids bang into each other when swinging. It\u2019s a pretty cute set though and perfect for my kids at this age. They will likely outgrow it around the age 8-10.",

The only 2 things I\u2019d change are adding more space between swings and making the slide less bumpy (the support rod under the slide popped out few times when a bigger kid went down. But overall it\u2019s a great set for the value. The guy assembling it said that more parts used to come pre-assembled (like the platforms) but now the manufacturer assembles less parts since they are incurring shipping expenses (ships at no cost). Not sure how true that is but took him about 16 hours with a helper.",

My husband is good with his hands (a mason) and it took him 16-18 hours to put together by himself.",

Upon assembly I've found several pieces missing, so much so that I've had to call backyard discovery on 3 occasions to let them know. Several brackets, shackles, and one of the roof panels are missing so far. Its comical because at the end of each conversation they ask \"is that all\" as if this is common, so I asked if it was, and was told it was not. Its irritating that a set, that takes ample amount of time to assemble is missing so many pieces. Especially for the price.",
