I appreciate that it re-reads the temperature every few seconds so you can adjust the water flow and get an almost instant updated reading (if you want it warmer or cooler). My only complaint (and thus it lost a star) is that it is tricky to turn on. There is no button, it is turned on by motion. Sometimes I have to bang it on the side of the tub or shake it *just right* for it to turn on.",

It literally says above the temperature reading if it\u2019s out of range. It will say \u201cCOLD\u201d or \u201cHOT\u201d and when it\u2019s too hot a little red light flashes as well. This is one of those items that I never knew I needed until after the baby was born. We use it as a room thermometer too and the reading takes seconds. I\u2019ve tested it with other thermometers and it\u2019s accurate. Love it!",

I took the battery out and put it back in to re-seat the contacts and it worked for another bath or two then quit again. I then tried to put a new battery in, but now the battery door will no longer go on at all. 6 months of use is not worth it.",
