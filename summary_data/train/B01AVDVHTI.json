Fit Simplify support was understanding and said that they would issue a refund. Unfortunately, I can't replace the product because I am traveling and the shipping costs are too high. I do like the product when it worked and I used it 4 or 5 times a week but it really didn't last very long. For most people, this won't be as big of an issue as it will be easier to get a replacement if you are already in an Amazon delivery area.",

And yes, they will roll if you apply too much lateral pressure. I\u2019ve owned other bands before (physical therapy issued). These are a lot smaller, so they certainly don\u2019t do what the \u201creal\u201d ones do. However, for what I bought them for, they\u2019re fine. If they break, I may buy them again.",

Even when the gym opens back up, you might not be willing to start pawing all those public surfaces, and carrying these resistance bands can help minimize the number of questionable surfaces you'll be coming in contact with. Overall very happy with the purchase and look forward to seeing just how durable these actually are (for now they seem sturdy enough).",

I like the fact that there are a number of sizes that came with this but all are the same length. They are good on my legs for squats and lunges. I have not had any break but only used them for two weeks. The carrying bag is useless so I am not going to attempt to put the bands in and take with me to the gym. I would not recommend them unless you were only going to use for legs.",

I wish they lasted longer. If you go directly to their web site, they sell packs of 5 red and/or 5 black.

They are stronger and able to stretch further. You will feel the same resistance after a dozen reps. \n\nThese bands are free of non-natural materials such as Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE) - TPE materials cost 40% less, are not gentle to skin and much less durable. \n\nSecond, our bands are comfortable, soft and easy on the skin. The only way to achieve that is to let the latex rest for a long time in tightly controlled circumstances such as temperature and humidity before making the bands.\n\nBoth of these involve a higher investment for us but we think it's worth it to create a better product. \n\n\nWhat makes our resistance bands special?\n\nThese bands are rigorously tested to be snap, stretch and sweat resistant.\n\nYou get 5 resistance bands set and you can combine multiple bands to find your ideal resistance.\n\nThese bands are so lightweight that they make a great travel fitness kit!\n\nThis is also a great Christmas, Mother's and Father's day gift idea for men, women, dad or mom.",
