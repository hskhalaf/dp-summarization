Compared to $200 for sleep number sheets this is an amazing deal! Update: we've had this set a year now and it's still in great condition! Comforter is still fluffy and no piling on it or the sheets. Hubby did snap one of the elastic bands on the fitted sheet(it might be only adjustable versions that have these) but I'm pretty sure he was man handling it, he sucks at changing sheets!",

I have a queen ordered a queen. I love the comforter do not want to return just want the right sheet n I contacted them n they said it was outside of the 30 day policy but if my items r unwashed they will return them!!! So who puts new sheets on their bed wout washing them. ?? Extreamly disappointing n now I\u2019m stuck with sheets that don\u2019t fit and have to go spend more money now on sheets. So buyers beware!!!",

The sheets were so much softer than I expected and I couldn't be happier with the quality of both items. I've had no issues with tears or strings or anything. No smell out of packaging either.

Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it has only been a few days and one washing, so hopefully it will hold for up for a couple years of washing and use. Also have not washed and used the sheets yet that it came with, since we had another set all ready to go.",
