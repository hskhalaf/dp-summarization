It gets LOUD if you want it to and pumps out surprisingly powerful bass. To be frank, it sounds like an old-school boom box that could really bang, except the footprint is much smaller. This is such an upgrade from all of the ordinary portable speakers that I've encountered. This is also an upgrade from JBL products made just a few years ago, speaking anecdotally. This sort of thing has apparently come a LONG way.",

Watching the tiny subwoofers on the sides vibrate to bass-heavy tunes is great. It's a total dream. I highly recommend going with this over the new JBL Flip 5 as JBL made the shocking decision to make them mono instead of stereo. I can only imagine they did this to push their bluetooth-link feature and get extra speaker sales from customers who want stereo sound. Weak, but at least the Flip 4s are still available and AMAZING!",

I think that certain low frequencies must be causing this. Other bass-heavy songs sound just fine. It's an odd issue that I have not heard until this speaker came into my home.

When you plug in the speaker, it'll show that that battery is at 4/5 bars even though it just died.
