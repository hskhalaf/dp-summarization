The sealing process also keeps things inside the seal from getting out, muting the sound. However this system, at least to me, doesn't seem to have that issue.

Battery lasts no more than 30 min before it starts to interrupt your music and dings an annoying double ding to get you to charge it but it literally cuts off part of your song while it does that. The sound sucks and volume is limited. Best thing about it is the suction cup hold but that didn\u2019t even work in the bathroom like the reviews mentioned it was good for. Too much time and extra $$ to return. Still sucks.",

He used to put his phone in the corner of the shower on a ledge and it gave me anxiety thinking it would fall in and he'd have to get a new phone. I was looking around and saw reviews for this bluetooth speaker and saw that it was also splashproof with a suction cup and thought it was perfect. It came on time and exactly as described. He loves it and uses the suction cup in the shower. The suction seems pretty good and the sound quality it great too. Would highly recommend this product!",

I've tried putting it on multiple surfaces to see what works and what doesn't but this thing does not stick (hence why it dropped into a tub). I would give it a full 5/5 if the suction cup was better. I would recommend this speaker to anyone who wants a good speaker & isn't planning on sticking it to a wall/vertical surface :)",

I use the mini-caribeener to attach it to my pack when I hit the trails, or hang it in my tent/canopy/etc. after setting up camp. Keeps it out of the way of spills, being sat on or stepped on, getting knocked over, etc. I definitely recommend it to anyone, especially folks who spend a lot of time outdoors and want an easy way to keep the music going!",

Got it at a great price as it was on Today's Deals on Amazon. This will be great to take places since it's so compact. We own another wireless waterproof speaker that I paid $40 for that is quite a bit larger that we use out by our pool in the summer & the sound is only slightly better than this little speaker. Well worth the price!",

I use my cellphones wall charger and this speaker will still die if played at max volume. I have to reduce the volume to about 50% for it to stay on while charging. This is a small speaker, so 50% isnt loud enough for me while I have blow dryer or water water going. This is my only complaint about this speaker. Battery life. Speaker is loud enough at 100% volume and water resistant when placed in the shower but battery life is a buzzkill.",

It is just a little rubber flap with no gasket and could easily be accidentally moved when pushing buttons in the shower. I have been very mindful of that and have not had a problem. At the price (~ $16), I would definitely recommend it.",

Cons: Difficult, sometimes, to change the volume, because it requires holding down the button that also controls fast forwarding. Volume button only changes the speakers volume, not the device's volume. As a result you have to consider two separate volume settings. The Suction cup doesn't stay affixed for very long.",
