I had not heard of this brand but after some research seems people have had these for years and years. Great for soups, super powerful, you can feel the entire pot of soup being sucked down in the vortex this creates, no chasing around the pot to blend all the areas in the pot, this has real power. I prefer to buy things once and get my money's worth. This is well-made and great quality. Highly recommend.",

I also bought the SliceSY food processor and it's expensive, but well worth it. I use it almost every day. It's also nice that it comes with three different blades instead of just one like most blenders.",

Other than that, it is absolutely perfect. I also hear their customer service is outstanding (which is so important)",
