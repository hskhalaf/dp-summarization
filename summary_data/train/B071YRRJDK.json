Oliver is a rescued dachshund (mix?) that is VERY fussy about his treats .He won't take just anything and he won't take it from just anyone. He took to these right away though. It lasts more than the average treat, something to really fulfill that desire to chew without packing on calories (or toxins)...a healthy snack for the furbaby is always a treat! Video clip is a bit of the chewing action....",

They are also more tender than others that we have bought from other sources. I will definitely be purchasing more for my 9 year old baby!",
