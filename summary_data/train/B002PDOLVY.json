The problem is that they are impossible to clean because the rim around the outside of the sandals has a groove that lets in water and debri. In my case, tent camping in the jungle, this led to the sandals acquiring mold beneath the footbed, and there being no way to clean them. Even soaking and high pressured spraying could not clean beneath the footbed. This I consider to be a design flaw. Very sturdy and comfortable for while they lasted though (3 months).",

I use them for my everyday shoes and as my shower shoes at the local swimming pool.",

I wouldn't recommend them for swimming since the cushion will get wet and that would just mess up your sandals.",
