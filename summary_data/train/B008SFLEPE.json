The springs in the clips don't put enough tension to even close, and they definitely don't hold on to what they're clipped to. I definitely expected more durable connectors, and will have to shop for more elsewhere.",

      "text": "It's really simple idea, but very well executed. If you are a rookie in electronics its amazing kit, if you are kind of advanced in electronics you may find this a little high valued but is still reasonable. The quality of the board is excellent, and what I liked the must is that is open source so if you have kind of advanced electronics/programming skills you will find that this is more than just a fancy key maker.",
