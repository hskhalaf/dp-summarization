It basically erases the smell of plant soil, reuben sandwich, roasted garlic, lamb stew, stir-fry, pan-seared salmon, canned sardine in oil, etc. Some other reviews complained about the residual chemical smell, and I detect that smell, but I don't mind it. This also works well when I take the trash out. Works better than Febreze odor eliminator without any strong scent, which they long discontinued, and none of their current lines is good.",

It doesn't remove smells any better than anything else, either and at sixteen bucks a pop I'm not going to spray double or treble the amount just to get better results. Very disappointing and not remotely worth the money, a 99c air freshener did the job better. If I got a lemon, it was still an expensive one and I'm not inclined to try again.",
