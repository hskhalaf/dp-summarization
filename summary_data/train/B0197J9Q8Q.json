      "text": "Very nice rod. Most other inexpensive rods advertised as \"fast action\" really don't come close. The Toccoa 5 wt is much better. I loaded it with a 5 WT, WF line 1/2 wt heavier, and it is easy to load and casts very well. Even the pro at the fly shop where I bought the fly line was impressed with the action. No problem handling several shad last week. It comes with a really nice rod case. This a a great buy on some very good equipment.",

The only thing it doesn't have is a fancy name you can show off. Good case, Excellent cork, 10 guides including 2 stripper guides. Cool alignment marks. Attractive dark blue and silver wraps. Priced less than my Cortland 7' 3wt cost 20 years ago. Great buy.",

    "description": "This rod easily competes with rods two or three times the price. There's rarely a need to spend hundreds of dollars or more on a fly rod, and this rod will prove that to you. \n\n Product Specifics \n\n - This is a 4 piece, travel ready 5wt. rod, but will handle 6wt. lines also. **Note that we offer a 3wt. rod as well - look in the size drop down above. \n\n - It's fast action for longer casts, handling windy conditions, and has backbone for determined fish.\n\n- An extremely versatile 9 feet long.\n\n- Made from IM8 graphite (carbon fiber). It's designed for maximum sensitivity and durability. So you can focus on presentations and fighting fish, not breaking your rod.\n\n- Your rod will be protected in a four compartment cordura rod tube.\n\n- The rod tube includes an adjustable shoulder strap for worry free bushwhacking and long approaches. Sling it over your shoulder and go.\n\n- Assembles easily via alignment dots, which help get the sections lined up right the first time.\n\n- Stylish dark gray color: looks great, and is a natural color to help avoid spooking fish with overly flashy or distracting colors, thread, etc.\n\n- Half well, high quality cork handle. Comfortable and avoids fatigue for casting-heavy days.\n\nThis rod is intended to meet you where you're at: a great first rod to enjoy for years, or a solid choice your go-to streams for the more experienced fly fisher. If you ever get the chance, we encourage you to stack it up against rods that cost two or three times more. \n\nThis listing is for the 5wt. rod only . Stay tuned for more offerings from us.",
