It does have a start up time required before it actually gets acclimated /cold and whatever you do, don't turn the thermostat down and leave it or you'll freeze everything overnight! My daughter & son both made that mistake. So if you are looking for a college tested machine than this may be the one for you. It has served well for my kids and I would definitely buy this again.",
