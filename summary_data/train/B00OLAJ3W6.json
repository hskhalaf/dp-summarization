I spent 70$ to buy it, but the flute couldn\u2019t play several notes (e flat, f..etc.). When we found out that one of the keys to play the note didn\u2019t close all the way ( there was the smallest gap that let air out), we paid $40 to fix it. Find out that now other keys have the same issue. Done putting money into a piece of junk. As of right now, I have spent $110 on something that does nothing but sit in the carrying case in my daughters closet. Pure JUNK!!!",

That seems like too much responsibility to put on a young child. If you are thinking of buying this flute for anyone under 18 - do it. You can\u2019t go wrong!

The flue is quieter than a trumpet, and much easier to disassemble and stow away. This flute fit my needs perfectly. I've been at it for a few months now and I can easily play the lower octave down to the low C, but the higher notes are still a struggle. After learning all the fingerings for the notes, I keep this flute out on a stand at all times to just pick up and tinker with whenever the mood strikes. It's been a lot of fun learning and playing!",

I just wish they included a cleaning cloth to clean the inside of the instrument. The only minor inconvenience is that when it comes straight out the package; some notes won't play such as the B natural. However; that is because the flute is still new and the keys are still compacted, and you have to play around a bit for the keys to naturally loosen. Once you've done this, you will produce a very vibrant sound that I think is even comparable to my $750 Yahama Flute!",

      "text": "This product lasted one year for my 6th grader. Starting 7th grade after it sat for a summer a few of the keys wouldn't seal so she couldn't hit certain notes. Meyer Music wouldn't repair this brand, and their rentals and purchase prices were more than buying this same product again. So even if I had to buy her a new one from Amazon every year it would be more cost effective than buying elsewhere. I'm re-purchasing this same thing but opting for the extended warranty this time in case the same thing happens.",

This has been something that is noted in many reviews. I didn't notice them until too late, though. Upon contacting the seller, they were not helpful at all. Their statement was to just return for a replacement, but by the time we decided to return it, it was too late. If you're considering buying a flute, my recommendation would be to save your money for a better quality flute.",

But, as the old adage goes - you truly get what you pay for. I need to find a good name brand refurbished flute for my daughter to use, since she still has four years of marching ahead of her.",
