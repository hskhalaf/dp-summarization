The tubes size adjustment occurs at three interlocking prongs which sounds like a great idea, if they were not too loose. The thing kept coming apart and dropped my posters on the floor too many times. I ended up taping it at the seam to prevent it from unlocking. Yes it may look cool, but has shoddy construction, and I\u2019d say buy something else.",

While it isn't durable like a PVC pipe might be, it is adequate for my purposes. In contrast to some of the negative reviews, so far I'm seeing a good positive locking of the adjustability design, and the shoulder strap is ample. I took 2 different densities of foam and cuts discs to press into the base, and a smaller diameter foam duo (so it would fit inside the tube) to glue into the cap, so both ends are well protected.",

The strap isn't super adjustable to wear across the chest and is a bit awkward if you're female. The locking mechanism is simply plastic indentations like a zipper that you slide up or down to adjust size- it's not as secure as other poster tubes I've used.

These objects are more delicate than paper and vary widely in width, so a reasonably durable and easily adjustable tube is necessary. The Nozlen tubes have performed superbly on their first outings in every respect except one: the cap that fits on one end and can accommodate a label comes loose too easily during the rigors of travel. Once that happens, the only way to identify what's inside is to take it out and look at it. The caps can be taped on, but doing so makes changing the label more difficult. All in all, the tubes are a worthy product.",

Also, it is hard to adjust the length. The locking mechanism is rather primitive and takes some force, which can distort the tube and damage whatever is inside, so I have to take my documents out if I need to change the length.",

It's a bit hard to explain, but basically when you push on it, because the tube can be squished and such, the notches end up moving. But since the plastic flexibility was created to make the tube not shatter when it falls, the notches moving when pushed too hard can't be helped.",

      "text": "The poster tube is great. I took it with me to a three-night stand of DMB concerts at the Gorge in Washington this past weekend for Labor Day. I'm on the East Coast, so this tube traveled on my back for the flights out and back and came with me into the pit for the first night of the three shows. I'd personally like it to be a little wider diameter, but it fit four posters snugly with craft paper and kept them safe. I was a little nervous about the \"ridge\" inside because it's expandable, but I didn't have any trouble. I suppose the craft paper helped. All in all, a great purchase.",

Excellent value for the price, my only knock & the reason this product doesn\u2019t get a 5 star rating would be the locking mechanism isn\u2019t super sturdy so if you\u2019re not careful it could easily loosen & damage your stuff. Of course I was cautious & didn\u2019t have this happen but it was something that I noticed. When wearing it with the strap over your shoulder you\u2019re less likely to have this happen but if you decide to carry in your hand that possibly of it loosening goes up.
