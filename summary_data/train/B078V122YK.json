      "text": "Filled the lower level of our fountain with these for our July \"Crabernet\" cocktail party (LOVE Will Bullas.) They inflated easily and looked super cute all evening. I'm not sure anyone put their drinks in them, as we were using wine glasses. Happily, many guests left with crab(s). And ducks. My husband insisted that we be both crab and duck free by night's end. Would buy more next time but I am on spousal crab and duck probation until further notice.",

The bottom of the holders still look nice and pink, but on top where the sun has been hitting them they're faded and looking old despite only being used for one season. I suppose that's something I should have expected, but I didn't think of it at the time of purchase. Not bad for the price, but don't expect them to look amazing after a few months of sun.",

They will probably work ok with canned drinks. The resorts serve in plastic glasses which may or may not work. I thought these crabs were red but they are very pink. Not sure how that\u2019s going to go over with the guys in our group.",

Then I tried a beer can, tipped over. I think the only thing that would work would be a very small cup, but I haven't tried that yet. What I'm going to try next is to cut out the bottom and push my Yeti all the way in. I think that would work. I will update when I try it. I'd return them, but the return shipping doesn't make it worth while. I would not recommend this product.",
