      "verdict": "The Salomon Trailster is a trail running shoe that has excellent workmanship and good grip for running in demanding terrain conditions. \u00a0Also designed for heel-strikers, the shoes are known to be lightweight and breathable to help make sure the feet feel comfortable during an extended run. Even with some reviews of the Trailster having a narrow toe box, we can conclude that we are talking about a trail shoe that, for a very economical price, will not disappoint those who take their first strides in the world of trail.",
      "pros": [
        "A notable number of Salomon Trailster wearers were impressed with the shoe's excellent grip even when running downhill at full speed",
        "Mentioned by most runners was that the Trailster provides ample cushioning for the very technical trails they run with lots of rocks and tree roots",
        "Also noted by wearers is how well put together this running shoe is",
        "According to a lot of users, the Trailster is a great lightweight shoe that offers flexibility and feel to the ground beneath while running",
        "A handful of users also liked the shoe as they say it had a very comfortable footbed, and after the first few miles, their feet were feeling at home in the shoe",
        "The Salomon Trailster is also easy to clean when necessary, which made quite many wearers happy",
        "A couple of runners particularly appreciated the shoe's thick ankle cushioning which helped a lot with their stability in running various types of terrain",
        "Majority of those who have purchased the Trailster agree that the shoe is a great value for money"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The shoe's toe box was also noted by several wearers to be narrow and shallow, causing a few serious blisters on their feet",
        "One user had an issue with the shoelaces saying it was very slippery and untied easily",
        "Most trail runners thought that the shoe could be better if it had some reflective element to it for night trail runs"

When I first put them on I thought they were a bit tight, but they're just snug. You should probably get 1\u20442 size larger than normally, as they are a bit on the small side. (In that sense they remind me of Adidas, which also are a bit small and snug; I don't know if this is a hangover from when Salomon was part of the Adidas group?)",

A 9 would have been much better so my recommendation would be to get a half size up from your normal size. Other than that, I like them.",

Time will tell whether they stand up to regular trail-running, but with the Salomon brand I'd hope that I can rely on them. Recommended.",
