You could easily wear this for 12+ hours. It is also not difficult to remove considering it is water proof; it balls up like latex and has a glossy finish. Does not transfer onto my oily eyelids or get anywhere under my eyes. Perfect eyeliner.",

This product is okay but when you splash your face/eyes with water there s still a little transfer of product to the under eye area. The product is a little flaky as well. If you went your finger sna touch the liner, it will crackle and come right off. I will continue to try other brands.",
