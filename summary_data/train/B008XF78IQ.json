This mixer, powered by a DC motor, was attractive for its power and quietness. As soon as I received this beautiful mixer, I unpacked it, turned it on, and tested it. OMG... Noise was repeated while rotating. As the speed increased, it sounded like a Steam locomotive sound. Another defect was found. the paint was peeled off. When I finished the test, I asked for a return. And Amazon handled the return quickly.",

      "text": "I let the smoke out of my previous Kitchenaid mixer and it was beyond the return period offered for a refurb. I finally did the research I should have done previously and found that the versions that use DC motors don't suffer the problems under high load that the AC motor versions do. If you use the bread-hook, get one with a DC motor.",

      "text": "After wanting one of these for years, it was pretty darn exciting to finally get one. So far I have made meat loaf, shredded chicken barbecue, cakes, cookies, and pasta (with the KA pasta roller and cutter attachments), and it really is a joy to use. I have checked out some library books on cooking with a mixer and found all sorts of interesting recipes, not just desserts. Since we're watching our weight, I will been getting creative to see that this earns it's counter space. That's a challenge I am enjoying already.",

      "text": "This is my Mother's Day present for this year. Over the weekend, my existing KitchenAid died. I had stripped the gears because I had used it so much for making bread for our neighbors and us. I wiped it down, and made a double batch of bread today. I noticed how quiet it is compared to my older, worn-out one. I would recommend to everyone to read the instructions thoroughly and when you are making bread, keep it on #2 like the instructions say. Even though the instructions say that you can put the pieces in the dishwasher, I will always wash things by hand.",

The only complaint that I have is the paddle still hits the side of the bowl, in a way it shouldn't, even after adjusting it. Thankfully I have not found any bowl pieces in it, just a little annoying in the sound that it makes.",

There was a slight ticking sound in the beginning while using the paddle and whisk attachments but after just the slightest of bowl adjustments, which took about 15 seconds, it was gone. Not to mention it's a gorgeous looking machine. I'm glad I made the investment.",
