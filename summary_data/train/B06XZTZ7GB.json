The one flaw is the lack of padding on the underside - if you put a laptop in the laptop carrying sleeve, it will likely *bonk* the floor when you set it down \"normally\" (you could also solve this by laying the backpack on its back on the floor, but who does that?). The design would be easily upgraded to 5-stars if they added a thick strip of protective padding on the bottom of the laptop sleeve. For me, it was easily fixed by layering a very thick winter sock in the bottom of the laptop sleeve - no more bonk, problem solved.",

      "text": "I ordered this backpack for my daughter to carry her new Dell Inspiron in for a competition. Technically, it \"barely\" holds the laptop in the main compartment (not the padded computer sleeve) with the zipper extremely tight around the corners of the laptop. When you put the laptop into the laptop sleeve so that it is properly padded, the corners of the computer stick out past the zipper. If the corners were less rounded, the computer may have fit.",

I can't believe how much stuff you can fit into it yet still get the slim look, due to it's design. One feature that others haven't mentioned, which I use and love is THE ZIPPERS HAVE HOLES FOR SMALL PADLOCK WHICH I USE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL TO PREVENT PICK POCKET THEFT. I took this bag to Spain, Portugal, and Africa. It helps to have those zippers locked to help deter a quick pick pocket. While I didn't think I'd ever use the power bank feature, I think I'll try it in the future.",

I ran to target for a replacement, too expensive (we're talking like $89.99, and still felt cheaper than this bag). I ran to try Walmart, a bunch of junk. Quickly went on Amazon while I was still at walmart, and it just got delivered at 6PM. Only took 8 hours lol, I'm pleased.",
