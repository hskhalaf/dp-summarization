The build quality is excellent, and the design of it makes it extremely easy to access the internal components. It IS very large, though, so be prepared to put it into a spot where you won't need to move it very often. I, unfortunately, have to carry it two rooms over if I need to work on it, so if there is any hassle to this, that would be it, however, I see no reason to deduct any stars for that. An overall excellent product from Corsair, one of many, and I definitely recommend it.",

It is mostly plastic, does not have a completely tool less interior (the expansion port thumbscrews are set so far back you can't get as firm grip), and the side panels are so thin as to be likened to aluminum foil coated in paint. My CoolerMaster HAF 935 was very well built and I would never have replaced it had my idiot brother not dropped it while moving it to another location. Too bad I could't find another! If this is representative of Corsair's new line of cases, I'll have to say I'll NEVER by another case from them.",

My unit came with a few of the USB ports on the case not working properly. They were loose. Contacted support and they mailed me a replacement part. Quite timely too. All in all a good case. It is huge, just keep that in mind",

The only complaint I have is it's easy to scratch the display window on the side panel. It's a given since its some kinda polymer and not glass which would make this really heavy and also a lot more pricey. So I'm glad it's a light material but be careful about moving it so you don't scratch it up.",

In order to run the 2 360mm radiators you must remove the cage that the drives go in. So basically the drive slots are useless if you want to put a 360mm in. I had to buy 2 new 280mm to use the setup I have. But this is a excellent case, just very misleading in the configuration allowance ( or maybe was just me ). But I do highly recommend this case to any massive overclocker.",

Lots of room in the back for cable organizing. Bottom filters are easy to slide out for cleaning, and allow for a power supply to be mounted to draw air from the bottom instead of from the case.",

The clear window on the side gives it an extra cool look to it. I love being able to see the inside glow of my case and being able to easily access all of hardware for upgrades and cleaning. The extra large size is also amazing for airflow and has tons of room for fans and all the fans are easily accessible. Hands down the best and totally worth the money!!!",

If your looking for a case with a solid build and an obscene amount of space for upgrades, I recommend this case. Just shell out the extra money for a new one.",

I have used electric duster on it but it does not remove all the dust properly. Other than that I have no other complaints about the case, definitely worth buying",

Owning one - I wouldn't hesitate to spend a premium up to $250 were it necessary to acquire another. The details...well, you should research this one. Huge by any standard, with considerable interior spacing and room for lots of fans. Plenty of room for my twin GTX 970's to breathe. Overall dropped my heated in-game temps down more than 8 degrees Celsius. Seriously, Corsair thought of everything in this design. ...And I am still looking for the cup holders I just know are around here somewhere. Peace.",

    "description": "A nicely-built high performance PC can be a thing of beauty. This is truer than ever with the sleek, artfully crafted, and undeniably stunning Graphite Series 780T. The striking Graphite Series 780T full tower PC case is the perfect place for your high-end PC parts and delivers a knockout when it comes to performance capabilities and ease of maintenance. Evade the aesthetics of yesteryear with 780T's rounded corners and smart design principles inside and out. A windowed side panel reveals incredible expansion and layout options, including space for dual 360mm radiators or up to nine 120mm fans. With room for nine drives thanks to the modular tool-free hard drive cages and side-mounted SSD bays, you'll have tons of storage flexibility. The front panel offers a lot of functionality, too: a three-mode fan controller makes you the judge of optimal noise and cooling ratios, and there are two ports each for USB 3.0 and 2.0 devices, as well as headphone and microphone ports.",
