I suffered through so many years without this. And I regret every one. I finally sucked it up and went to buy one--only to discover the Amazon Warehouse link. I paid less than the LC outlet in the Woodburn, OR, factory outlet store and did not find the \"obvious flaw\" the product was supposed to have. So, watch for the link to other sellers and definitely cash in on one of these. Even without the deal, these are sweet pots.",

We purchased this 5 1/2 quart model and were puzzled that it is virtually the same size as our existing 4 Qt. Using a quart size pitcher, I was able to get just about 5 quarts into the pot, but that was right at the rim. 5.5 quarts? No way.",
