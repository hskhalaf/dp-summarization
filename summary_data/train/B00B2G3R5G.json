It is big and heavy and suited best for home use but is portable and rechargeable. Battery did not last 12 hours as (I think) was stated somewhere, but it did go 9-10 hrs at lower volume, such as ambient music where you also want to have conversations. Good bass and mid range, the highs are a little muddy at lower volumes which is the leve I use it for most of the time..",

The battery seems to last forever when it is not in used, and when in use I have not been able to run it out of juice (used for two hours straight multiple times).

You don't hear distortion even at the max volume levels. The device gets plenty loud, and it works as a speakerphone as well. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is somewhat heavy and doesn't have a good means (like a handle or a slot for fingers) to carry it around the house. The vocals (like lectures, guided meditation tracks) sound open and clear on this drive.",

Oh yeah, and it's cheaper than the *slightly* better or *slightly* worse sounding (depending on who you ask) Bose Soundlink. I was very lucky to find the SRS-BTX500 for $158, shipped, in \"like new\" condition; it's certainly not worth the $300 retail, but if you can find it for under $200, go for it!",
