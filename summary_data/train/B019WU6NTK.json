My favorite stains to try products on are grease/oil-based. Most do OK, but the stain is not always gone. Puracy took out the stain perfectly. Not only that, it took other stains I thought would set and stay forever. I've tried just about every stain remover on the market, and found some are good for this and some for that, but none were good for all the stains. I am wiling to admit this one sure looks like it can take on anything. I'm not only impressed, I'm a fan!",

The smell is gentle and not offensive. The older I get, the more strong smells bother me. This is great if you\u2019re like me. The spray bottle is easy to use, even with my arthritic hands. I learned a trick years ago: keep a bottle of stain remover at every hamper throughout your house. Before you throw your dirty clothes into the hamper, give the stain a shot and wash clothes when you get around to it. Final step: get off of Amazon and fold clothes.",

It's so dorky to be excited about a stain remover, I know. Adulting is so lame. But this one really does the job. And it's natural and plant derived, so it doubles as a lovely vinaigrette. Just kidding on that last bit. Maybe. I dunno, could be true. It says it's gluten free.",

We will probably reattack the sofa for stains specifically later but it worked well to get breast milk spitup off of the leather. My only complaint is that there is no mist setting on the sprayers and the product is thick (like a liquid detergent) so it doesn't absorb immediately causing a waste if product. I will definitely be buying more whenever we need it.",

Prior to washing I sprayed puracy on the dried blood stain and immediately threw it in the wash. The sheets came out spotless! I wish I would have taken before and after photos!

I didnt want to use a harsh chemical stain remover but regular detergent was unable to get out the stains. This spray has been a lifesaver! We use it almost daily and have been able to save numerous outfits, as well as chair / bouncer liners! Very highly recommend!!",

    "description": "Size:25 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Puracy Natural Laundry Stain Remover is the most powerful stain removing product available, yet safe for all fabrics. Our bottle features a new and improved fine mist sprayer to maximize coverage. It is the only stain remover powered by all six plant-based enzymes: protease (protein), mannanase (food, cosmetic)pectinase (fruit, sugar)amylase (starch)lipase (fat, oil)cellulase (general soil)we guarantee This product will safely remove any fabric stain you put in its path or your money back. Enzymes are proven to be the safest, most effective ingredients to remove and eliminate stains and odors. Our unique blend of plant-based bio-enzymatic cleaners will tackle hundreds of different stains, residues, odors, and spots - all without bleaching or discoloring fabrics. Think of it like this... If stains are the lock, then enzymes are the key. Our professional strength formula was developed in a lab by a team of Ph.D. Chemists with decades of experience working with Green formulas. It was then reviewed by a team of MDs to evaluate the overall safety and hypoallergenic designation. And finally, it was tested by parents, athletes, and laundry aficionados for performance. Using only a couple of sprays, the head-to-head tests have proven our proprietary blend of plant-based enzymes and natural minerals can clean as well as those packed with harsh, petroleum-based chemicals. Our unique formula will quickly dislodge stains, eliminate odors, remove residues, and leave your fabric clean and fresh. This product is 99.5% natural, per Puracy\u2019s \u2018what natural means to us\u2019 definition available on our website.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nNORMAL USE: Spray the affected area and wait at least 15 minutes before laundering. TOUGH STAINS: Spray the affected area and massage the affected area with a soft brush. Wait at least an hour (can be left on for days), then launder with the warmest water the fabric care instructions allow. Opt for the \"Extra Rinse\" cycle. Some stains may require two treatments. FABRICS YOU CANNOT PUT IN THE WASHING MACHINE: Use exactly as \"Normal Use\" states. To rinse, take a clean cloth and bowl of warm water. Saturate the cloth with warm water, gently wring, then press into the stain and move back and forth with light pressure. This will pull the stain remover from the surface and replace with fresh water, mimicking a rinsing effect. Rinse cloth and repeat the same steps until the stain remover is \"rinsed\" from the surface.",
