He'll vault over furniture to chase them, jump in the air to catch them, and pounce on the ones we flick along the floor.

      "text": "The pack of (6) used to be $18 just a few months ago and all the sudden they shot up to $24. Not really a deal anymore. I regularly alternate buying the salmon and chicken flavors. Twice now I've had (6) bags of the chicken flavor not be crunchy. Almost as if they've been sitting around so long and started to go stale. My cat didn't seem to like it despite normally enjoying these treats. Gonna stick with just the salmon for awhile, if this happens again I will abandon this product.",
