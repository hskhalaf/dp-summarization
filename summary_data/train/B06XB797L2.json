      "text": "Hitachi powered hand tools (corded and not) were the primary tools I used to build my current house and they were up to the challenge....every single one of them. As a result of that experience, I bought this cordless drill driver recently when my old, large, and heavy as hell 19V Craftsman was something I just didn't want to use any more. It uses the same 18V Li battery as my impact driver that I have had and beat the hell out of since 2013. This driver rocks just like my impact driver and it is small, lightweight, and torquey as all getout. Great quality and performance",

Great tool. never lets me down. If you will use it regularly, don't bother getting one that comes with batteries. Get 3.0 Ah batteries instead. You will be glad you did. They last so much longer.",

The true warranty is the period in which the store you bought it from will still take it back and refund your money. I really hate deceptive stuff like this.",
