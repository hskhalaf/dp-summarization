It arrived shortly after I left the state so o couldn't use it right away. I used it twice so far and on my second use it broke. I undid the latch and placed the mop in the bucket, spun it a few times pulled it out. Latched it again and started mopping. Next thing I know something flys out and the handle no long locks. It's very upsetting. I had high hopes for this mop,it would make cleaning easier and now I am back to square one. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed.",
