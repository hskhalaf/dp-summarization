We love our new iPhone X\u2019s but the standard charger is a slow charger for the IPhone X\u2019s which stinks!!! I feel if we spend $1000+ On a phone you should provide us with Fast Chargers like most Samsung phones do!!! Sorry \ud83e\udd23 for the rant..anyway these chargers are super awesome. Super fast charger and I should have bit the bullet sooner so guys if guy got a iPhone X this is 100% goto charger!!! I was so impressed I bought 2 \ud83d\ude09 BE sure to follow us for future purchases!!!",

It wasn't expensive but I decided to message the company online via Amazon. I was amazed receiving an immediate response and with no effort I received a new replacement charger within days. This company stands behind their product and thank you for replacing after 11 months the unit that failed.",

The lights work on battery or via USB power they cannot plug directly into a normal electrical wall socket. You can buy lots of single USB chargers but this one takes 2 USB plugs and uses only one of the normally dual wall electrical outlets. Magical!! It works perfectly with the LED lights and we are thrilled to have it. Note that the electrical plug does fold to get out of the way if you want to use this plug as a carry-along power source.",

I have a ten foot braided power cord and it still works fine. The charger is sturdy and well built. I like the fold down plug that snaps in to place when you need to plug it in. I also like the blue light that lets you know the charger is working. The light is not bright, so it will not disturb you at night. I highly recommend this charger.",
