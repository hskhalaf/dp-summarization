I no longer have chronic itchy scalp thanks to this shampoo and conditioner. However, it's a mediocre conditioner on the hair itself. I have thick coarse hair and this conditioner does nothing to de-tangle or smooth out my hair strands. I haven't had this problem with other conditioners before. With this conditioner, I have to use a hair serum on my hair afterwards in order to de-tangle my hair so I can comb through it. I'll stick with the shampoo, but I'm going to switch to a different conditioner.",
