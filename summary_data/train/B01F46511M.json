Just brought it out of storage and set it up, but now it keeps deflating for no obvious reason. I've scoured the thing looking for holes in the liner but haven't been able to find any. The company refuses to honor the warranty because it's technically past the warranty date (since I stored it for the winter), even though I've only used it for a combined total of eight weeks. Extremely disappointing. Was worth the price when I bought it last year for $400, definitely NOT worth the recently jacked-up price of $800.",

It can seat 4 I suppose abiet tightly. The most important part of seating more than 2 is that the jets only blow 1/2-3/4 of the circumference so one person would not get full jets. I knew I would only need to seat 2 so no worries for me. I would definitely recommend.",

But after registering my product and submitting my claim online, a new pump is on the way. I took a video of it running bad before attempting to restart it, at which time it would not. Should be back in operation in about a week. Not bad considering price. Will try to update after it is received.",
