My new off and desk are not height adjustable, but with the stock stands I at least have the ability to do so with the base stands. I love the Res, please not I have not changed much outside of turning the brightness down to 30% - 33%.",

I had to buy a cable (mini display port to display port) to connect the Surface, and the HDMI to HDMI cable in the box connects the monitor to my old laptop. Switching between the two inputs is accomplished with the touch of a button on the underside of the monitor. I \"extended\" both displays to be able to drag windows to the monitor and work without looking down (sore neck). As for the performance, I said I wasn't a technical person, but it is fine for everything I need. Perfect for adding screen real estate when you need it.",
