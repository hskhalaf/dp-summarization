I was very disappointed that I had to end up returning this mattress, but fortunate to receive a full refund. After going through about 4 various brands of air matresses over the past few months, I realize that I should've invested money in buying a conventional box spring mattress instead.",

We have used it once and it is reasonably comfortable and the built in electric pump for inflating and deflating is great. The only possible improvement that I can think of is that I saw some competitors that have a recessed compartment to hold the permanently attached power cord which the Coleman doesn't have. Not a deal breaker though and I am delighted with the Coleman product.",

Easy to re-fill, but may not hold the firmness night after night. Haven't tested it too much beyond that. I was told the person who slept on it thought it was very comfortable.
