Took a while to adjust from Windows 7 to Windows 10 but it is quite intuitive and now I rather like it. So far I can't really fault this laptop, just hope it lasts as long as my old Sony Vaio which is still going strong after 5 years of everyday use.",

The description and pictures have since been updated to reflect this, as before the pictures clearly showed a laptop with a back-lit keyboard. Despite this, the laptop is quick and the screen is clear and bright. The camera isn't the best quality but its perfectly fine for video calling. The battery is the best feature of this, as it lasts for hours. I usually get around 5-6+ hours of constant use which is great when you are using it on the go. It does charge quite slowly though. Good quality laptop for the price.",

In general though the laptop performs well, but product info could be greatly improved by more transparency in included features. Misleading advertising, but I note that this has now been altered - after sale!!!",
