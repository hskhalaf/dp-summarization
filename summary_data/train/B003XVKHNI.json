We were using our typical mattress box spring and we started getting soft spots causing back pain. We jumped for this foundation (adding the extra 1x2s and wood glue as all the reviews recommended). It went together easily, and the cover makes it looks very nice (washed it on cold and air dried before putting on the foundation). The difference was immediate and HUGE...all indentations and soft spots were GONE in the mattress and we are sleeping so well again. Best investment ever, and will last us a lifetime.",

      "text": "It arrived quickly, was packaged good. It was easy to assemble, I am in my 80's. I have tile in my family room so I assembled it there. I did use a cordless drill and socket wrench. I had ordered a new memory foam mattress and they said it should be on a flat surface. So, I cut up some 1/4 plywood (Lowes did it) and screwed it to the top. There is a little give to the finished product, but I didn't think that was a bad thing. The mattress is spread over a large area. You could buy all of the material and do it yourself, but I doubt you would save much money. This was simply easier.",

It is really difficult (and painful) to lift a heavy mattress and tuck in the sheets with that arrangement because your hands get caught between the wooden bed side and mattress. Therefore we looked for something that could be used to raise the mattress appropriately. This box spring replacement looked ideal. Everything fits together well making it simple to assemble. It seems sturdy, the pieces of wood are all clean with no (few) knots and I think it will last for many years. No more painful hands while making the bed.",

It did exactly what we needed- it lowered our bed height so we could use a 50 year old head and foot board with a modern, much thicker mattress than it was originally designed for.. The mattress now feels much better than it did with our old box spring. We purchased this from Amazon-not a freebe in return for a review.",

I must say this box spring replacement seems much sturdier than those in the store. Also the cover is nice, fits well.",

Adding a small drop of wood glue at each mounting location made the final process of placing the slats in place very easy. We have not creaking sounds and the foundation is very secure within the bed metal frame. Very satisfied with the outcome.",

I did not need gloves to assemble the two I had. Once the cover is on it, the roughness doesn't matter. This is a huge step up from the standard individual slats.
