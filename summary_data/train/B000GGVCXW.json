I've been hitting balls into the net with a regular hard, full swing and the net is fine. The only problem I'm having is making it stay secure in the ground, which I'll purchase a few more anchors to secure it better. And the mat/ tee pad is made of a strong heavy material. Makes me feel like I'm on the range hitting off the mats. My family made a good choice!",

      "text": "I purchased this net to practice my golf technique. Set up very quickly with included instructions, essentially being two \"tent\" poles that go through plastic sleeves (make sure not to rip the plastic while pushing the poles through). The netting looks like good quality to me. After hitting about 2 or 3 dozen balls with all of my clubs, I am completely satisfied. As a side note, if you are afraid of putting a hole in the net (like some of the previous reviews state), you can buy foam practice balls that feel like real golf balls.",

    "description": "3-in-1 golf practice set with driving net, chipping net, and driving mat Driving net's 2 expandable fiberglass poles extend to 11 x 7 x 5.5 feet (W x H x D) Weather-resistant 23-by-26-inch chipping net functions indoors or outdoors Driving mat with high-quality nylon artificial grass surface and heavy-duty rubber base All items break down for storage in weather-resistant nylon carrying bag\n\nAMAZON.COM\nPractice your driving, chipping, and approach shots without heading to the driving range with this three-in-one golf practice set. Equipped with a driving net, chipping net, driving mat, and nylon carrying bag, the set includes everything you need to hone your golf game in your backyard. The set starts with the easy-to-set-up driving net, which includes two expandable fiberglass poles that extend to 11 by 7 by 5.5 feet (W x H x D). Simply place the 1-by-2-foot driving mat in front of the driving net and swing away. The mat's high-quality nylon artificial grass surface and heavy-duty rubber base feel authentic, so you can line up your shots with confidence. (The mat includes both a fairway-like surface and a tee.) The driving net's large opening, meanwhile, will catch both straight drives and mis-hits, so you needn't worry about breaking your neighbor's window. \n\n The kit also comes with a weather-resistant 23-by-26-inch chipping net that takes up far less space than the driving net. With the chipping net, you can practice your pitches and chips in a relatively small space, including indoors. And should you want to practice at the park or while traveling, the kit breaks down and stores in a weather-resistant nylon carrying bag. Custom tailored to accommodate the complete practice set, the bag is ideal for transport and storage. You can also use the driving net to practice select golf, soccer, and baseball skills.",
