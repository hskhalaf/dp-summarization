It freezes up at least once every other time I turn it on. The screen flickers before it freezes then I have to do a hard boot to get it going. UPDATE: I have changed my star rating because all it needed was Bios updated:) Am now happy with my laptop and will continue to be a Loyal Dell fan!",

      "text": "After shopping for months for a 15\" laptop, in my price range, I finally decided on this Dell. I wanted an I5 processor with 8 g of Ram and this unit is perfect for me to run my business on. I use MS Office as a cloud based app so I'm able to use this anywhere I have an internet connection. The screen size is easy to see and the keyboard feels good to type on. The best part for me is the keyboard is back-lit. For me I have to have a back-lit keyboard so I can type faster. Overall it is a very good value for the money in my opinion.",

The only manual I've found online is related to taking apart and reassembling the computer. I need to understand basics such as what are \"sticky keys\" and how/when to use them! There is also an occasional loud hum in the audio that I don't know to whom i should complain..",

The tactil screen is also attractive and it wasn't as annoying as I thought it would be. Thanks Dell!",
