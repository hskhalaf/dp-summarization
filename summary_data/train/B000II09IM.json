It really didn\u2019t even pretend to try, the edges lifted moments after I stuck the label on. I have a brother p-touch at work and it\u2019s awesome. I got this cause it was more compact and had decent reviews. I\u2019d also prefer the letters to be like a keyboard unlike this which are just listed alphabetically. I got this just after Xmas but didn\u2019t have time to use it till just now. Unfortunately my return window just closed otherwise I would have returned it.",

I painted the inside of a cabinet with magnetic paint, brought these little, magnet backed tins from the Dollar Store , and then filled them with spices and herbs and made all the labels. Someone said the labels would not stick to plastic but all the windows in the tins are plastic. I also labeled glass, ceramics, and metal. There is a big space before and after each word which would waste tape so I printed a dozen labels at a time with 3 spaces between each individual label. Also, to remove the backing fold the label horizontally.",

I sent a short e-mail to DYMO describing the problem and after some troubleshooting, sent a replacement. Great customer service! That shouldn't have been a surprise, but I think customer service has mostly been ignored for quite a while, so it surprised me. Especially because it concerned a $20 item! Every one of their replies was pleasant and respectful. Bottom line for me is, I won't hesitate buying or recommending DYMO products. Their customer service is fantastic, and a special shout out to Khahn is deserved (Though probably won't be seen): thank you again!",

The only negative with this label maker is that it does waste alot of tape on either side of what you printed. So I recommend typing everything you need all at one, with around 4 or 5 spaces in-between the words. This lets there be a minimum of tape waste.",
