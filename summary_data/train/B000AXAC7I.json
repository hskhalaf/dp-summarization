You wont find a better basketball with grip that lasts for years. Ive tried the Rock, Spalding, Wilson but those tend to become slick after a year or two of use. The Baden ball is consistently playable. I have been recommending it to other coaches. I coach AAU and every game we have, this ball is chosen by the referees over the other teams ball everytime. Get at least one of these for gametime because of cost.",

Break-in point is about 1-3 months depending on how much you play and how you train. I train, do drills, and play 3-4 times a week, 3 hours per day. I couldn't be more satisfied.",

    "description": "The Baden Elite Indoor Game Basketball is our Top-Of-The-Line composite leather basketball in which we have dedicated the last (30 years) to perfecting. It was designed specifically for the Elite player looking for a premium indoor basketball that provides maximum consistency and playability. You'll immediately feel the difference the first time you pick up this basketball. The Elite\u2019s proprietary, advanced microfiber cover creates the perfect tack that won't absorb moisture, gain weight or discolor like many other basketballs on the market. To ensure you'll never get a bad bounce, we've engineered the basketball with our patented Cushion Control Technology (CCT), which embeds thousands of tiny air cells in the carcass, as well as our Stealth Soft-Valve System (SSS), which reduces the amount of exposed rubber from the valve stem and softens the entire valve panel. The Elite Indoor Basketball is also the only basketball on the market with a true symmetrical design giving the ball perfect balance and consistency. The Elite is approved by the (NFHS) and is the official basketball of many AAU, leagues, and state high-school associations across the country.",
