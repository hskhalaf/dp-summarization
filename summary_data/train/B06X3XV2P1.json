      "text": "I was really excited about these. I gave them a test ride on my indoor bike for 15 minutes and they kept my feet so warm that I had to take them off. They fit perfectly over my shoes and were easy to put on and take off. It warmed up to 37 degrees outside and I decided to go for an outdoor ride, they kept my feet warm and dry, but one already started to come apart at the seams..after one ride (only 8 miles)! It looks almost like a dog used it as a chew toy. Disappointed and hoping I can get a replacement. Otherwise I'm on the hunt for something better.",

Buy a size or two larger than you think you\u2019d need based on shoe size. Will update again as I use them if there are any surprises, but they feel like they\u2019ll do good againt wins and rain.",

For a hour-long commute in the winter rain, I found my feet to definitely be dryer than they would have been without the overshoes but I still needed to dry my shoes after the ride. I would not say this is a design flaw - just keep in mind if you are looking for a completely waterproof option. They are definitely warm! They stop the wind really well, which helps with numb toes.",

      "text": "I bought the XXL. All previous brand-name booties (eg Sugoi, Bontrager) could not fit around the heel of a size 14 MTB shoe. THis bootie has a new heel design (two velcro straps) that makes it much easier to use. Still a tight fit mind you, I would have preferred a larger size, but it seems practical, unlike the rest. Cannot speak to durability, but so far it has done the job on two rainy 10-mile rides.",

They kept my feet warm in 30 degree mountain bike rides - i normally do not ride any colder than that so I cant say how much lower they can work, but they will prevent the wind form cooling your feet. I use SPD clipless and no issues with function. The bad: I am a man 10.5 normal width (no bigfoot here) and the XXL seems to barely fit my low profile mtb shoes. Not sure if this is Japan sizing? Good thing I read the reviews first and ordered up the size.",

While they keep rain off your shoes and the wind out, they offer no thermal protection, and the edges of the soles wear out fairly quickly if you dare walk in them on the ground.",
