However, as with any stainless steel product, it will get hot when near heat. So I guess every owner is different...just keep that possibility in mind if you're considering buying a stainless steel toaster. Bread came out nicely toasted as expected.

The toaster toasts one side of a waffle or piece of bread and doesn't toast the other side at all, like one side of a frozen waffle is still cold. This morning the toaster began emitting a burning smell that only grew stronger after it was unplugged. This toaster was a total waste of $65. I should have purchased from a store; then I'd still be within the return window. Now I'll have to buy another toaster because this one is just not safe. Please be careful and be aware.",
