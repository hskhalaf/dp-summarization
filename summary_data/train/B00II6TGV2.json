      "text": "My cats LOVE these treats, however, the item is always shipped in a bubble mailer, so the delicate treats are pulverized in the process. The last 5oz bag I got was mostly dust, with just a handful of actual treats left. There was dust, then tiny treat fragments, then the actual treats. Very frustrating, especially since these treats are pricey. I end up having to sift out the dust with each package. The cats are happy with that sprinkled on their food, but it's not really a treat/reward at that point.",

This is human grade chicken breast that has been cooked, diced and freeze-dried. it is in a resealable pouch. I had not been aware that Cat Man Doo (which I am familiar with from its freeze-dried bonito flakes) was the manufacturer. Based on the excellence of the product, I am not surprised.",
