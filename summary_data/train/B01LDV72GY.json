I never abused these or did not wear these everyday. Returning. It's a shame because these look good. Update to 2 stars for the tear otherwise I'd give them a 4-5 stars.",

However, the TWILIGHT BLUE color in real life is not that dark navy blue shade like in the photo. It is more of a royal blue shade. I didn't want to rate it less than 5 stars because that is no fault of the shoe, just that they must have used flash when they took the pic. Otherwise, the shoes are perfect!",

I haven't had them for long and have worn them sparingly. They also fit slightly smaller than other brand 12s, which is a pain because the next size is always 13 and that's too big.
