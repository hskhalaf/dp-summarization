As you can see on the pictures above, the dial is different from the original watch (the little rectangles on the hours aren't completely white) plus the box and every other accessory is feels cheap the packaging is nothing like the one you would get when buying an authentic Tissot quickster and the seral number doesn't match! This watch is obviously FAKE! DON'T BUY IT! I'm at the moment waiting for an answer to my refund request...",

Solid links in band, had to remove two to fit it to my wrist. Seems 100% authentic. It is a little bigger and heavier than I thought it would be, but I am super satisfied with this watch.",

The date is very small and difficult to read if you need glasses, would have been nice if there was a small magnify glass built in. The stop watch hands, when using do not always return back to zero, easy to correct but annoying. The watch is slightly thick, could have been thinner. Overall a great watch.",

I have still to see the cells light up in the dark, but overall the watch feels nice, not to big not to small at 42 mm and sapphire crystal. Time is a little tough to read and take some getting used to. The chronograph flows nicely when activated and hands return to 12 o'clock position smoothly. This is a nice watch for the price.",
