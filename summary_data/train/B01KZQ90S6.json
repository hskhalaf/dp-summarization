This LED/UV lamp does everything you need - timers are great but I typically just use the motion sense function and which counts while your hand's in and remove it when I hit my desired time which triggers the light to turn off. I also like that the cord is removable and there are no bulky bulbs - instead they are all built into the lamp making it worry-free for travel. Very sleek looking as well. Thanks!",

I have not needed to use the low heat mode yet as I don't find it necessary, but it's nice to know I have the option. I find with the Gelish polishes I have been using that the power of this is perfect for 60-70 seconds to cure. Overall very pleased.",

The auto sensor works great, the dim LED light for when using the clear gel so the heat doesn't spike when the nails first enter the lamp is genius!! as well as the timer settings, and the fact that you can put your whole hand in and it also has just a counting timer on it as well. Very happy with this product and the price was excellent!! Much better than competitive pricing and you get the same great quality!",

The lamp is easy to use and I've had no problems with the lamp not curing anything properly and have no complaints so far.",

You have 3 preset times (10s, 30s and 60s) or you can do the gradually increasing intensity. The removable lip is held on my 4 very durable, strong magnets.

Just not powerful enough, I suppose. This MiroPure lamp came highly recommended, and I'm glad I decided to go for it. It fully cures everything I throw at it, and really does do it faster than I've experienced in most nail salons. I feel great being able to do my own acrylics again. The claim that it doesn't cause heat pain/discomfort is also true from my experience so far. I'd recommend this to both DIYers and licensed techs alike!",

I haven\u2019t used long term yet so I can\u2019t speak to longevity but so far, so great! Thanks!
