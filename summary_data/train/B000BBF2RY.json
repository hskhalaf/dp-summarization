I bought a Sawyer gravity, a katadyn gravity 6L, life straw, and the MSR MINIWORKS EX. If I go on a trip by myself I will be bringing the MSR. If I go on a grouo trip I will be bringing the MSR and the Katadyn. You could bring the MSR for a group and be just fine but you'll be doing a lot of pumping. I would 100% recommend this filter. It was recommened to me by a person who takes regular BWCA trips. He has had his for 8 years.",

The downsides to this are weight and cleaning. You can get a more lightweight pump. That said, if your pump fails in the wilderness you want to be able to fix it.
