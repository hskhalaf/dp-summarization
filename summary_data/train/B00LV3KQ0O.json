In my experience, they are high quality but not high priced and their Tech Support is awesome also. I needed help in figuring out how to wire some Visionis components with non-Visionis equipment and they answered my questions quickly and accurately. I would give them 10 stars if I could.",

We mounted this to the top of the door, I think it would have been even better if we mounted closer to where the normal lock was because the door does flex a little more towards the bottom than the top where the lock is.",

Lock surface temperature is a bit warm, which is normal. I installed it together with a stand alone access controller, and a mini access control power supply. It takes much longer time to wire the entire system than to install the lock itself. update: on 5/18/16, I chatted with the online customer service rep on fpc-security.com, and I was told that the electric coil inside the 600lb was made of aluminum, not copper.",
