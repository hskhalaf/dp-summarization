      "text": "This pad is awesome despite the fact that you might have to blow it up a bit. We are somewhat seasoned car campers that gave it up due to aging - we are 50+ - and sleeping on the ground not an option - compact car so no room for additional stuff. This bag is supper compact when deflated - although a bit bulky and large for hiking and backpacking. We slept so comfortably and it helped keep us warm through our temp drops - gotta love Oregon! Highly recommend for car campers or seasoned backpackers who can carry extra weight and don't want to slide apart in the night :-)",

However after a full day and a dozen puffs of air, this pad wasn't comfortable at all, even sleeping on my living room floor. I'd expect it to be even less effectiveon the ground in a tent. This isn't my first experience with self-inflating sleeping pads, but this one is unsatisfactory. Lightspeed makes a superior pad but I haven't found a double wide one, hence that's why I tried the king camp pad...my mistake.",

I was incorrect, it is filled with a cheap foam that doesnt hold any shape whatsoever so really what is the point of even using it. For $80 I was expecting it to have at least memory foam inside since i can buy a 3 inch memory foam topper for less than this. If your a back sleeper you may find some comfort in this but if not it's going to be painful. This is easily a $30 to $40 dollar product.",

When rolling to the top part, let the air flow out for a while, then close the valves. **2. Secondly, don't open the valves, unfold the pad, then rolling the pad again to the top part, open the valves, let the air flow out. Then close the valves. **3. Repeat 2 until you can fold the pad into the carry bag (about 3 - 5 times)",
