If you need a bright light like in a kitchen, think you may be disappointed. For \"show\" the light is very good quality. No bulbs to replace so when the light burns out the fixture will need to be replaced.",

The reviews mentioning wire tangling they must have changed packaging because mine came neatly wrapped and zip tied in spots to ensure they weren\u2019t tangled. Super easy to install and even easier to adjust to the tilt you like. I installed on a slopes ceiling and am very happy with the look.",
