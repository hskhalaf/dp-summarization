Bought this to go in a Ryzen rig with the nearly ubiquitous Gigabyte AB350 Gaming 3. I was initially dismayed to find the board wouldn't POST with this RAM running above 2133 MHz. However, the most recent BIOS update (as of September) has fixed the issue. Now running at 2933 MHz, which corresponds to a decent performance boost. If you're having compatibility issues on Ryzen, make sure to try flashing the newest BIOS.",

I do not overclock, I use my computer for daily work and prefer low fan noise and stability over speed. If you are a gamer, you probably want to look at a different Motherboard. The Gigabyte MB is not the greatest for gaming but it has more port and other things I needed for my work, thus my choice there.",

Similarly, if you have a Ryzen series build that is, after standard troubleshooting, infinitely rebooting without posting a BIOS screen - you should look into your RAM being the source of your problem (this was my issue).",

To do this, check the documentation/manual that came with your motherboard. With the current prices of RAM (8/21/2019), these are a pretty good deal.
