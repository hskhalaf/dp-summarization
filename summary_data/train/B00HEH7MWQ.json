      "title": "Too Small: Sold as a 3-Quart Pot but Only Holds 2",
      "text": "This pot is much smaller than advertised. Indeed, I sent the first one back, assuming that Amazon had made a mistake. But indeed, the replacement was just as tiny. Advertised as a 3-quart pot, it really only holds 2 quarts in practical use and overflows at 2.5 quarts. The advertised dimensions are 8 inches by 7 inches, but I measured the external diameter as 7.5 inches and height at 4.5 inches. Indeed if you do the math, a cylinder of 7.5 inches by 4.5 inches has a volume of only 1.85 quarts. On the other hand, if this pot was the stated size of 8 by 7 inches, it would indeed hold 3.03 quarts.",

It seems well-constructed, but over the course of two years (never under high heat, always hand washed and only used to cook soup), the bottom starts warping a bit inward on a gas range such that it's imbalanced now. I am hesitant to recommend this over a longer duration for this reason, but two years out of a heavily used saucepan (probably every other day in a home setting) is ok.",

I am very pleased with the weight of it also;it\u2019s heavy but not so heavy that my arthritic hands and wrists can\u2019t lift easily! The price is added bonus so next time I need a piece of cook ware, I am going to check out this brand!",

Heavy and thick were my first impressions of the pan. Made of heavy aluminum and a sturdy riveted handle. My favorite feature is the non-stick surface. My son cooks six eggs for breakfast daily and is so easy to clean. Now the reason for the four stars..... the coating on the rivets started to come off soon after about a month of cleaning. See attached picture. Overall, I enjoy using this pan, but I wish the coating was better on the rivest. FIVE STARS PAN... one star coating.",

We needed something top notch to pair with our Bob\u2019s Scots Porridge Oats. Only complaints might be that the handle to body weight ratio and resulting center of gravity causes the pan to tip when empty if you\u2019re not careful. Also the lid is difficult to have cracked open as the non-slip surface is efficiently so. Some kind of internal marker for cups one, two, three etc would be handy. So whilst not perfect for our hallowed purpose - this is a very good little pan and we\u2019ve become quite attached to it.",
