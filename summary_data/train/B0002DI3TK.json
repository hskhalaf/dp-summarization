The only thing I didn't like was you have to clean it more often than a water bowl itself. Pink mold was growing. I didn't realize you have to take it all apart and was. The black motor had a bunch of mold. If you're going to clean this one a week, I would recommend and it's a great product. If you're a bit lazy like me, much quicker and easier to wash the water bowl, then I would not recommend this. Hope this helps!",

When my others got noisy it was because they were gunky, but this one seems to prattle on on occasion, even when it was brand new. Whether this is a quality issue or design issue I don't know, but I know when it gets going it's incredibly annoying (to me. The cats don't seem to care).",

The places where it snaps together, meaning the curved top into the bottom tray, will not come apart. I never had this problem before, and now all I can do is remove the little crescent shaped top and the water reservoir. I cannot get to the motor at all. I am not happy with this purchase at all.",
