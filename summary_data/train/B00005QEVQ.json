(I have had other router makes, but they don't stand the test of time). The P-C routers need two wrenches to change router bits, instead of a shaft lock. Shaft locks wear and require some way to grip the router body to either tighten or untighten the collet. This twists the router shaft unduly. Two wrenches will securely tighten the bit in the collet without twisting the router shaft. The P-C 690 is a long wearing, reliable product and represents a great value. I highly recommend it.",

This has been a problem for me with some rabbiting I was doing. I was able to work around it but it would be nice if it came with maybe two base plates to help with this..

This newer version had a much easier to use locking mechanism and being able to switch over from 1/4\" to 1/2\" collets is a big plus. This model has been a workhorse in my shop for many years now. While it doesn't have all the bells and whistles some newer models have, (reason for only 4 stars) I consider those \"bells and whistles\" to be mostly superfluous.
