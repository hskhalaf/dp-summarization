The only downfall is the thick wire and staples. This board will push darts out. Only board I've ever played on that you can stick a dart and as you are walking up to pull your dart it falls out. Where can I get a real board ? I only have it one star so I could post.",

I'm an I.T. administrator and getting out of my chair is essential ;-) Our old board had thick wires that continuously created bounce outs. This board has been wonderful as far as rejecting bounce outs. The description states it is self healing. That seems to be the case, although when pulling the darts out you can see the hole it created. Once another dart enters the board this hole disappears. Overall this is a great board. Not as good as the old fashion horse hair boards but very similar. I recommend this board to whomever likes to play darts.",

The metal rack separating the scoring segments is built into the board and is very thin. Bounce outs are very rare. This may be trivial, but the sound of the dart hitting the board is solid and satisfying. I have no complaints, installation was easy, and it looks very sharp.",

Overall, I've purchased probably about 10 different brands of dartboards, but consistently come back to this one. Just a great dartboard!",

      "text": "This board is made up of high quality pieces, which is unfortunate because overall the board is low quality. The fit and finish of wires, paint, and board surface is ultimately what gave it 2 stars. Not self healing as well as other Sisal boards I have played; DMI, Winmau, Unicorn. Very uneven scoring surface, some wires are buried where as some protrude close to 1/16 of an inch. Paint bleed over on several doubles and triples.",
