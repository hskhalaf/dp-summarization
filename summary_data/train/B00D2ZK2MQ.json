This game is both amazing from the graphics, game play, and story; to the ultra-creepiness when the sun goes down on the town. The town is graphically stunning in the day light hours, but once the sun dips below the horizon, there is absolutely no light besides your little flashlight. I enjoy the slower-passed Fallout and Skyrim-type games, and I love the way Far Cry plays in first person. Dying light is all of that, with zombies and exceptional graphics. This is a must for any gamer.",

The only issue.. the campaign was really short, but I know they plan on realizing DLC to add onto the story ( At least I would hope! ) The game is fun, and at times challenging and scary! The game really does change one the sun goes down! While running try holding down Y, or Triangle this feature is great fun while running from the night runners at night! Brings a new whole feeling when you are actually able to look back at your attackers but at the same time not knowing where you are heading! The suspense and terror!",

Night and verticality. Night time is when it gets bad. There are stronger more resilient zombies lurking at night. Verticality impliments the ability to climb more thus creating good places for loot. I have to say these two things scared me about this game but I actually like it. They always say fear change and I'm one. So yeah grab this game without a doubt if you like zombie games. I made sure not to spoil anything by my descriptions. Enjoy!",

So we were all shocked we had not heard of this game sooner after playing it for our first time. Fast paced, fun multiplayer or solo with non stop intense action. This game will make you jump while playing more than you care to admit. Definitely worth the buy if you are into fast pace, objective oriented character leveling zombie games.",

I like the upgrading of the weapons and the different types of Enemies. Don't go out at night, for the first few days I had the game, I had believed that it had been night already and it wasn't that bad. Haha. Then it happened and I was screaming in terror. You'll see.

Dying Light is not a clone of their previous work but a full expansion into new territory. The landscape is impressive, combat entertaining and the story (side missions included) interesting enough to keep your attention. While I would not call Dying Light a Dead Island clone - it does bring over some familiar aspects; weapon crafting, heavy melee combat, skill trees and overall gorgeous design. I highly recommend the game to fans of Dead Island and those just getting interested.",

I made it to 70% story complete and quit playing for no other reason than I felt there is absolutely nothing keeping me interested. I felt that way at about 40% but pushed to 70.

Vaulting up to a building, zip lining across a chasm and then grapple hooking your way up to a bridge is oh so satisfying and fun. It also has 4 player co-op and this just adds to the fun when four players join up and take on the hordes of zombies together. I highly recommend this game if you like first person traversal games (such as Mirror's Edge) and zombies.",

You upgrade your character's survival skills and combat abilities through experience and missions that you complete. Parkour is your ticket to staying alive as you climb walls, run across roof tops, zip line through rough urban terrain, and leap from building to building. This game is hours of fun!",

Most objectives involve climbing tall objects, and the controls for this are pretty bad, making the climbing more frustrating then fun. Another odd feature is that the game started out difficult and got progressively easier as you obtained skills that made running and combat more efficient. I think most people prefer to get eased into a game and have the difficulty increase as you progress with the story. I did play the game to the finish, and the co-op was a nice touch.",
