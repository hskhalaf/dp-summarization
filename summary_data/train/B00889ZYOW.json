This company obviously doesn't care about producing a qaulity product as evidenced by all of the negative reviews here. My previous air compressor was a cheap Walmart Campbell-Hausfield that lastest 18 years without a single problem while the California Air Tools compressor lasted only a few months under the same conditions. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this company and thier products. They do not build qaulity products and do not stand behind thier products.",

      "text": "This compressor lost one star because of the location of the tank drain because it isn't at the bottom of the tank! It is hard to believe, but, the drain is set off to the side near the edge of the tank allowing about a half inch or so of water to stay in the tank after draining. You can tip the whole compressor up on one wheel to get all the water out if you want. I understand that the bottom of the tank isn't easy to reach because it is under the center of the compressor, but, I'd expect that a premium brand like this to design a drain that gets all the water out.",

I needed air for my shop; I use brad and finish nailers, maintain my car, use a blow gun, and occasionally fill a portable tank for offsite projects. This compressor is fast, quiet, and well made. Some of the problems mentioned in earlier reviews have been fixed. The wheels fit right. The quality of manufacture is decent. It's not an Ingersoll Rand, but I can easily hold a conversation with the unit running, and still hear the radio, the tank fills quickly. And it is very compact - fits right into a corner of my shop.",

Somebody complained about the wheels but they only go on one way. If you have them flipped over facing the wrong way they rub against the brackets and don't turn. Flip them over and you are good to go.",

So quiet I can use it in the house and carry on a conversion in the same room or even talk on the phone. It is quiet. After 6 months of use, no problems.

It was bullet proof and I would say I got my money's worth because I got much accomplished. Very quiet and portable enough to carry up a flight of stairs. IF it isn't one thing its the other with these compressors. It'd be nice if they offered extended warranty to 3 years. Would I buy it again? $350 is high. I'm thinking of the 1HP 6.3 gallon $199. I have a Husky 30gallon compressor in the garage that rarely gets used after I bought this. Food for thoughts.",

Only con is that handle is so low that it makes it clumsy to move around. Will probably add an extension to handle to make it easier to move. Strongly recommend for places where noise of a compressor is critical (inside remodeling, small shop, etc.).",

Was very surprised that Amazon would carry a product that was so poorly made. Would not recommend to anyone.. Compressor might have been good but workmanship and quality of total unit were very poor. The only good thing was that the compressor was very quite. I'm not sure if compressor put out as much air as advertised because I never got the broken line fixed.",
