My boyfriend is a very busy guy right now as summer is really his busy time of year so I am not surprised that he did not catch it lol. But I saw that was a complaint with other people too. is it the watch? does it need new batteries??",

The watch came packaged in a nice tin, and when it arrived the battery was already ticking. It remains to be seen how long the battery will last.

I purchased the extra warranty, but doubt that they'd do anything about this. Don't think Amazon would either, not to mention all the hassle of returning.

First it has some buckle marks on belt so seems like it was being tried by someone earlier. So I couldn't gift it to someone. Second the box it came in was having a dent abd inner packing was also not looking premium to me. I wouldn't blame seller for this since it may came from Fossil in this way.",

They could have easily just spent the extra 2 seconds it would have taken to stitch the connector loop, but instead they opted for a cheap glue that breaks in 6 months????? Why would you ever do that? The stitching was so nice everywhere else! The Watch came so close to being correctly made.",
