They really should have added a solid bar at the gate latch side to prevent that from happening, If they had done that you would be able to tighten it up against the wall surface. The directions left a lot to be desired, not very clear",

They are only held in place by the tension from each side. As a result, if you want to temporarily remove it, it will come apart into 5 sections. The gate locking design is also very bad. You have to squeeze the sides in enough to \"close the gap\" between the frame and the latch. Save your money. Installation and operation of this model is a nightmare.",

The gate works by pulling up a lever which makes a piece either extend, which locks the gate closed, or retracts, allowing it to swing open. The lever itself still works fine, but the connector no longer retracts, meaning we have to pull the lever up and manually force the connector to slide back. In essence, a one handed task now requires two, so you will need to put your child down each and every time you want to pass through the gate. The gate itself is sturdy. It's a shame they skimped on the materials that matter.",

For install its important to note it's not just tension-- you have to screw little cups into the wall to hold the gate. It's not difficult but it will leave 4 holes.

But it\u2019s not usable at that size because the pressure mounts become extremely flimsy and the lightest pressure will cause it to fall down.... but for the right doorway width, this is awesome. So I ended up buying a four inch extension from the regalo website for under twenty bucks and now it\u2019s super sturdy for my 59 inch doorway.",

The company should invest in better technical writers. My rating is reflective of the poor documentation. If you buy this gate search for an installation video on YouTube.",

My 2 and 4 year old can easily operate the door so they don't need me to open and close it for them 100 times a day. Our opening is 48\" wide so we used the extenders and it fits great. There is an optional second latch on the bottom that wouldn't be so easy for a toddler to operate if you don't want them opening the door. So far I'm really happy with this purchase.",
