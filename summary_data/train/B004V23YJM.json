I put my 2.5 month in there with the canopy and the toys and she stays entertained for a long time (she used to want mom only before), and then when I notice she\u2019s getting sleepy, I take the toys on the canopy off and she falls asleep BY HERSELF, which she never used to do before. We use it as a cosleeper which is great, and it\u2019s so lightweight that we bring it downstairs on the couch during the day. We haven\u2019t traveled yet, but needless to say, this bed is following us wherever we go because it\u2019s the best thing ever!",

The sides are too soft and we always fear that the baby might roll over. Overall it feels flimsy. Not what I had expected and definitely not worth the price.",
