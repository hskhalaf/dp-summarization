I\u2019ve always had bikes with more gears and was worried about going up hills but it\u2019s no issue at all. I do have to stand sometimes to get more peddling power. This bike is very lightweight, which is necessary for me as I carry it up and down stairs daily. It\u2019s good quality especially for the price. I zip tied a crate onto it to haul groceries and UberEATS deliveries. Overall I\u2019m happy with my choice. And I was able to find a matching helmet \ud83d\ude04",

In the intervening years I put in considerable miles on touring bikes. This bicycle arrived excellently packaged, unblemished, and it was mindlessly easy to put together. I don't believe it took me any longer to assemble than it did to strip the wrappings from the parts. Have a tube of white lithium grease at hand for assembly. As I tried out my new bike, I thought about how my biking friends from the past would laugh... Then it dawned on me that they're probably riding these things too. No granny gears; just grannies.",

They clearly use the same instructions for all their bikes which are completely different, and the instructions can become confusing. They should have specified more about the front wheel bolt assembly, they should have included the bike cap into the instructions. And the seatbelt instructions weren\u2019t very clear. It\u2019ll take you around 2 hours to assemble. Also some of the bolts in the picture are different than the ones they give you so that also was a bit confusing.",

Much nicer looking than our rusty, Schwinn Hollywoods from 1969! Only ridden twice; so far so good!!! Not sure if the additional lifetime warranty is necessary, I will have to see what all is covered. I think we will order matching fenders.

My one criticism is they don't come with the screw holes to attach a water bottle holder to the frame, but that isn't a big deal. Also, I was able to install 3rd party baskets and child carriers on each bike without issue. I had one quick question I emailed the company, and their response was thorough and fast.",

Also, be sure to tighten the handlebars really well\u2014they got loose after a ride or two but have been fine ever since we re-tightened them.

Also, be aware that the directions may not be exactly for the varied bike you recieved. They were slightly different than my model but easy enough to understand.

The only problem is that the actual color of the bike looks a little darker then the one shown in the picture, but regardless it is still a beautiful color!
