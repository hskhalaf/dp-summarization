One side fits but the other side is almost an oval shape. A picture is worth a 1000 words. It will be a hardship for me to repackage and return. UPDATE: the vendor responded to my review immediately and shipped out a replacement without me even requesting it. Unfortunately I have been out of town and UPS wouldn't leave it. Hopefully I can connect with them for re delivery. I was very impressed with the customer service of this vendor!",

Our hope was to be able to take advantage of the two bars to maximize space. However when fully loaded, even evenly on both sides, the upright bars buckled and the rack became not sturdy. Would probably be fine of all the clothes were lightweight shirts and dresses, but it could not handle men's suits, sweaters, pants, etc.",

The manufacturer should consider an enhanced design that will allow a mesh flat top for laying things such a wet sweater for drying, etc. Overall, I'm very happy with this product.",
