The Large size cover fits my MC perfectly. Overall I've been happy with the Dowco Guardian cover. I live in Florida and my MC is not garaged so the only protection it gets is the cover. The XL cover did a great job resisting sun and rain over the last year. The only problem was that it dropped and sagged so the lower part of the cover was always sandy which I didn't like. The new cover shouldn't have that problem. It also comes with a lifetime guarantee. I highly recommend this cover.",

The vent ends up hanging upside-down and is positioned so that it will let rain in. Maybe someday I'll excise some of the extra material from above the gas tank and use to add some gussets to allow it to fit over the mirrors.",

      "text": "Dowci finally made this out of one durable fabric which will last years! Over the years I've bought three of these. But the previous years the bottom half was a grey fabric and that grey fabric would rot and fall apart. The upper black fabric would last forever. So I am confident that this one will last a long, long time. I guess the minus is that it is no longer two-toned and less visible.",

However, when I fit it to her bike, it was too small and not fully covering her pegs and only half of both wheels. Returned the item and ordered a size XL; it arrived and fitment was perfect for her bike. We have had this cover on her Vegas, outside in the elements, for over six months and no complaints. Particularly like the built in tie down strap and buckle for keeping the cover in place in windy conditions. Recommend, but watch that fitment.",

Took me a few minutes to figure out the holes on the sides but the front pegs fit through them. I'm impressed with the fit. My one nitpick is that it could've come with better instructions. Overall I'm very happy with it.",

A soft cotton protects the windshield and a heat shield is used to protect the cover from warm pipes, allowing immediate use after riding. An elastic shock cord and a polyester webbing belly strap are sewn into the bottom to provide a snug fit and prevent the cover from coming off in high winds. For added security, the cover includes a sewn-in hold for a wheel lock to be passed through, as well as a sewn-in alarm pocket for a Guardian Cover Alarm (sold separately).
