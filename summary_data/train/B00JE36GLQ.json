Mine was cold by the time i got out of the shower (~20 mins after making it)... all-in-all really cheaply made and disappointing. Save your money on a name-brand.",

The screen is easy to clean and the finish looks just like it did when I first got it. For the price, this is a great deal UPDATE I bought this near the beginning of 2017. Used 2-3x a day. The joint between the rod and the filter failed 12/06/17. Usually these fail because the rod becomes unscrewed from the rod assembly- this was not the case.The entire filter assembly fell off the rod and the rod assembly. Needs to be re-welded.

Unlike the glass presses, I don't feel worried all the time about breaking the press while cleaning. Mine came with one screen installed, with two extra screens included. I'm currently using all 3 screens at once, and have a clean cup of coffee every time. I would definitely buy this again if needed, or recommend it to friends",

      "text": "I was tired of breaking my glass French press coffee makers, so I thought I would give the Secura a try. I'm glad I did. This coffee press is double-walled and high-quality construction. It's also beautiful. I like that the company includes extra filters in case the stainless steel, reusable filter that it comes with ever needs replacing. Most important: It makes excellent coffee, and it keeps the coffee HOT. I highly recommend this French press, and I would also recommend it as a gift. It works and feels as though you spent MUCH more on it than you did, and it is sure to impress the recipient.",

The outside of the press stays cool enough to touch because of the design which could not be said of my last one. Hopefully it will last and stay in great condition.

In addition, the extra screens are great, but not sure I'll use them because the edge design of the screen holder is much better than my old glass press, where the edges were often frayed. Overall great product, and am enjoying the press along with no longer dumping plastic pods in the trash.",

This French press coffee maker is so easy to use, After all the steps of Chemex, it's a joy just to grind the beans, put them in the French press, pour in the heated water, wait 4 minutes or so, gently press down the plunger and voila! Truly excellent coffee. I've used it to make just one cup, and two cups. Both are good. This was not the most expensive French press Amazon sells, but I can't imagine the pricier ones being any better. Plus, it's great to look at.",

Not only that, friends and foes, it also leaves a very, limited amount of floating grounds in the coffee. The instructions are as precise as can be and only those need to be followed. You don't need to clean it during only certain moon phases or when your cat hates you. Fabulous coffee maker that makes my mornings worth getting up for. Nice and strong and you can adjust even THAT to your level of strength simply. Most definitely recommend.",

Also easily cleaned, and it works sooooo well. I'm an old, retired, Marine, used to drinking coffee made with a heavily stained cup filled with plain hot water.

I like to press anywhere from 2-4 cups but I have to guess at the amount of water to use.
