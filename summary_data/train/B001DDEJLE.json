I really like that these phones are relatively small and unobtrusive and do not require a heavy band over the top of my head. I can even wear them with a hat or a bicycle helmet. I've been buying them since 2011. I'm sure there are other comparable designs, but when I break or lose my Audio Technica immediately headphones, I immediately try to replace them with the exact same model.

However, if you are looking for headphones that you can play on high volume without having other people hear it, this might not be the right one for you, because the speaker is actually exposed. Another thing would be that it doesn't block out the sound from the outside entirely because it just rests above your ears, making the sound softer than if you were used to actual headphones or earphones.

They are very comfy, fit nicely around my ears, they can weirdly enough be used as a mirror, sound is very good, could still hear pretty well around me but not enough that it disturbs me and my music, I had them on for a short run and they stayed on perfectly, this is a great headset. FYI: 1 cord is longer than the other, if you didn't know, but if your cool with that than go nuts. This headset works great.",

But I was surprised to find that they're actually pretty good headphones as well. The sound quality is above average and gives off a crisp and clean sound. Overall, I'm happy with my my purchase. They not only sound good, but also look cool and feel comfortable.",
