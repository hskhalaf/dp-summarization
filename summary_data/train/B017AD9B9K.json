      "text": "Much More Than Expected. I had a series of appointments with Physical Therapist and my should was fine for several months. Then as a result of not doing the recommended exercises, the pain came back. I still wanted to be active, so before mowing, I put on this brace. The next morning, I realized that I had not awakened in pain at all during the night and that I wasn't having any side effects from the mowing. I have mowed twice since then with the same great results. I will be 80 in less than a month, so this is extremely great news and results for me.",

This is my 1st shoulder brace though so maybe I need to do more research into shoulder braces to find a better one that suited for me .",

Cuts under the opposite armpit (even tho it comes with a little pad) the arm cuff also cuts under the Bicep of the treated arm. But most importantly at the end of the day, it doesn't really stabilize the shoulder or provide any relief. Would not recommend. Would return but I tossed all the packaging.",

It isn't all that comfortable as it wants to lay across the nipple. If you try to get it lower, it rolls up and is still uncomfortable. I'm not as worried about that as it is difficult to get correct support with comfort on shoulder braces. The main knock off is a quite bad chemical smell. I will wash to see if this comes out, but it is pretty off-putting. If the smell comes out, it will still be useful, but not the most comfortable of braces.",
