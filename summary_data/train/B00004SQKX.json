      "text": "I purchased these locks for my Stealth trailer. The lock has a small drain hole at the bottom of the lock to let moisture out, but as shown in the picture the trailer requires the locks to be sideways. Since it cannot drain in the sideways position, water collects inside the lock and freezes making it impossible to open the lock with the key. Fortunately nothing inside the lock warped. It was a sunny winter day when I needed to get in the trailer and a bucket of warm water was enough to thaw out the locks. I'm confident this could happen regardless of lock position when cold given how easily water can get inside the lock.",
