These headphones can be worn over my hearing aids and behind the head. They are lightweight and did not shift. They permitted me to still hear outside noises like cars and critters which ear buds do not. Old school, but still work real good!",

I have never been advised of having big ears \ud83d\ude09. 2) There is a cable channel in the headband. It's no surprise they probably use this item on other headphones. The problem is that the edges of this channel cut into the top of my ear. I've attached a picture of these channels. Combined, these two issues make it a very unfun item to wear.",

However, working overnight listening to music for hours the discomfort becomes apparent rather soon. Wrapping a strip of duct tape around the band by the ears will save you some pain, if you don't mind how cheap it will make them look. If you want a long-wearing solution I'd suggest elsewhere.

Thery're not Cadillac or even noise-cancelling, but for the money, they can't be beat. I especially like that they fit so comfortably that I can wear them while lying on a pillow...in any position. Many times I'll wake up, realize music has ended, drop them on the floor next to the bed, and then go back to sleep. (Although there have been mornings where I'll wake up and realize I had them on all night.) If anybody ever perfects a 'sleep learning' system, these will be the headphones you'll wear.",

Comfortable wearing up to 3-4 hrs, then irritation behind the ears. Good for bench pressing but not lying on a pillow. Bonus star for value.",

They fit perfectly, they have great sound quality, and they last more than people suggest. Yeah, they feel flimsy at times, but nothing that bad, and they're more durable than you might think. Always pleased with these. :) For the record, the reason for having bought a second pair is because the right side of the headphones on my first pair was no longer working. Which is to be expected considering how long I'd been using them. Nothing to complain about, especially at the price. :)",

Now my son uses these when he's playing video games I don't want to hear, so at least we found a use for them!",

I like this style of headphone because they're more comfortable than having buds in my ears, and they give me a bit more ability to hear when someone approaches than the large over ear headphones would. I think they're ideal for casual use with my PC while sitting in my office at home.",
