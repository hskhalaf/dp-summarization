What I like : same comfort and size as my prev ones even they were diferent model Im a 43 eu in normal shoes but with this brand im a size bigger. This works for every model so when I asked for the new ghost it respected the rule. They feel exactly the same as my prev model but better, more comfort. Feels soft for longer time and doesnt weight much when wearing them.",

Just got my Mom a pair LOL So if you are like me. running some, but not a fanatic and you are wondering if buying more expensive shoes is worth it, give these a try. Sheesh. Well done Brooks!!!",
