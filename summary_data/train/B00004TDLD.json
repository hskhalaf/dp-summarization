Round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round you'll go, until dinner is burnt and the kids want to throw the gameboard. If you can get your hands on the older version do it. But don't buy the new one. USER TESTING folks.",

For the older kids and grownups, it\u2019s a fun game of mathematical chance. A round lasts long enough to be satisfying, but not so long that the younger ones lose their patience. And it\u2019s never the same game twice. Absolutely brilliant! This is a must-own game!",

Includes gameboard, 4 swamp creature game pieces, 2 number dice, and an operations dice.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nKids will have a terrific time learning math skills as they avoid the hilarious pitfalls of the Sum Swamp. Designed for two to four players, this game is sure to develop and sharpen beginning math skills, because the only way to escape the mire is to roll the dice and add and subtract your way around the board. If you're lucky, you'll be able to take the Crocodile Short Cut, although sooner or later everyone gets caught in the Endless Loop. Landing on special squares, such as Even or Odds or a number space, makes things even more interesting; you could get stuck for quite a while. The best part is that this is a game kids can grow with--children 5 to 6 will find it a learning challenge, and older kids can play for fun. The game is an Oppenheim Best Toy award winner. --Marianne Painter\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nVenture over the crocodile shortcut and through the swamp to the finish by adding and subtracting numbers on the dice.
