However, I was WAY wrong about that. :D Within 15 minutes of receiving it, I had the router set up and working beautifully. It's very easy to use! Also, after having it for several weeks now, I'm pleased to report that my network performance has never been better. I love that the dual band tech lets me set up dedicated networks for different device needs. I've put our smart tv's on the faster network to better accommodate streaming, and our computers/mobile devices are paired with the primary network. Being able to direct traffic this way, so to speak, has improved the overall user experience for everyone!",

After firmware update it won't let me connect any new wireless devices that weren't already connected before firmware update. 4. It only has 3 ethernet ports 5. It keeps randomly dropping the connection entirely to all my devices including the hard wired ones like my phillips hue bridge and my computer. 6. This uses the asus internals from the asus version of this which my dad had the asus version of this lock up on him. I would never recommend this product to anyone.",

Various environments, power supplies replaced, programmed with different computers (no, not transferring some virus or something). They will lock-up, lose their settings, fail to pass data . These problems occur via wired and wireless modes. I would NEVER recommend this particular model to anyone.",

You need a dual band if you plan on utilizing the highest speeds of your internet service and wanting to operate multiple devices at the same time. Very easy set up less than 15 minutes.

We have multiple smart tvs running wifi, several devices and phones running simultaneously and service is very good. Download speeds on wifi are about 150 Mps and upload spreads are 25 Mps, but this will vary greatly depending on your internet service provider. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "I'll start by saying that the wireless signal and speed are every bit what the description makes it out to be. This router was extremely easy to setup, even in my unusual network config. HOWEVER something that is not made clear is the 4 ethernet posts (1 WAN/ 3 LAN) are NOT gigabit! They are 10/100 ports! This is only really a problem when using a wired connection. As a wireless repeater it works perfectly. Fast speeds, reliable connection, and again, SUPER easy setup! If you're looking for a cheap wireless extension, this is DEFINITELY a great buy! However, if you're looking for a primary router or wired extension, this will only help you up to 100 Mbps.",

      "title": "Using as a wireless bridge",
      "text": "I've used this for a few months now as a WISP access point and as a client/repeater - basically I extend my wireless to a wired network where I have my TV equipment. For some time it would frequently lose its wireless connection to the main router, and would just become a standalone network until I rebooted it. I turned of the 2.4GHz wireless and changed the 5GHz wifi bandwidth setting to 40. After that it has been stable. Speed is good and I'm really happy to have it finally working reliably.",

I have 200mbps internet spectrum service and this AC6 says it will give you up to 300mbps via 2.4GHz and 867mbps via 5G. Spectrum came out to my house today and said this router will not support speeds of over 100mbps. I talked to Tenda customer service and they confirmed that this router, even though it is advertised as 300mbps via 2.4GHz and 867mbps via 5G, will not support over 100mbps. AVOID!",
