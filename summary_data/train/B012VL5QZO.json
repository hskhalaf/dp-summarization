Instead they shipped a cheaper unit that lacks the stage and status and progression of the cleaning function. It's frustrating that manufacturers are allowed to mislead consumers and I am expecting Amazon/Norelco to ship me the correct cleaning station. In the meantime you've been warned....what you see is not what you'll be getting!",

However, there is a major quality issue: I have been noticing for the past 2 months one of the blades is slipping out of the lock every 2 to 3 days. I keep reinserting the blade and the locking yellow ring which lasts for 2 to 3 days. Unfortunately I was late by one day for service guarentee. This I think is a manufacturing quality issue that need replacement. However, it looks like I am stuck with this after spending $180. Will never buy a Phillips product.",

      "text": "I've owned this razor for over a year now. While it does give a very close shave, especially with a shave lotion (hence the 2 star rating), the design for securing the blades is one of the worst I've ever seen. Inserting the retainer clips is such a frustrating endeavor that I often have to quit trying and just return to it later when I have more patience. Couple that with the fact that they often pop out while shaving resulting in a buzzing noise and an explosion of retainer clips and blades when you open the top to rinse it out after shaving. I can't recommend the razor for this reason alone.",
