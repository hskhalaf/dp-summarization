I haven\u2019t quite figured how to reset it immediately. The Win10 printer app won\u2019t delete the job. But then mysteriously it will start working again some time later. About 1 in 20 odd docs have done this. I think clearing the job out from the printer front panel might be the secret, but this shouldn\u2019t be happening at all. But it\u2019s fast, and decent print quality. But it does smell like a laser printer too - probably ozone - but they all smell a bit.",

Downloaded and installed the drivers 4 times from the Canon Website exactly the same way before it finally worked. Also, the directions are wrong for finding the serial number to register it. The serial number is available via the touchpad instead of being printed on the label on the machine. The customer support folks are good, but be prepared to hang on the line for many minutes.",

Scanning quality is excellent, much better than I anticipated despite that I used a previous generation I was already happy with. I mostly use the scan to SMB, fast and great quality. For years I have used Adobe Acrobat Pro to scan, but that won't be needed any more. The crispest, most detailed B&W and color scans's I've seen on a MFP, blows away my previous Canon 6100 series. Can recommend this one enough, especially at the price.",

Decided to try one of these instead, after seeing good reviews, and I am much happier with it. I liked the Brothers until they stopped working properly- but this works very nicely, and I like the touch screen. It is on a wired network, so I can't speak to the wifi functions. Works fine as a networked printer. I love the easy ability to scan documents to email. When I saw one here at a good price again, I bought a second one for home, to replace my Brother printer there.",

With new scan software, can't name the target folder/file on the fly - have to go to settings to change the filename & have to \"name\" the target folder which doesn't work when I have 70+ clients with \"2019\" folders. Tried calling their \"help desk\", was put on perpetual hold... Overall, printer seems good but scan software is terrible - any efficiency gained from one-pass duplex scanning is lost in fighting with the settings.",
