The quality you get and this ridiculous price makes you constantly wonder why you ever spent most of your life buying over prices mattresses at the box store. The mattress it self, is very very soft and well shape around your body. I like my mattress as far away from firm as possible, and this is right up my alley. I couldnt be happier. No back pain, and I sleep through the night without tossing and turning. If you like a plush/soft mattress, and dont like paying a grand + on a mattress, this is just for you.",

So far I do like the mattress a lot - it was super simple to remove from the packaging, and expanded to it's final size within a couple of hours, I still let it settle for about 48 hours before sleeping on it. It's fairly firm for a foam mattress, and I like the feel and support quite a bit more than my old tempurpedic. I am not sinking into the bed with the Perfect Cloud mattress like I was with the tempurpedic - it was difficult to roll around in the tempurpedic, but very comfortable to roll around with the perfect cloud.",

      "text": "My wife has back problems and our old very firm mattress was causing her major discomfort. She received many recommendations to try a memory foam mattress. I did a little internet investigating and Perfect Cloud was highly recommended. The Amazon price was the clincher - if the memory foam experiment fails I only wasted a little over $400 rather than the $1500 to $3000 price I was getting for the more popular brand names. She has used the mattress for less than a week but so far the results have been excellent. No pain getting to sleep or waking up. If the \"memory\" of the mattress stays consistent I think we have a definite winner.",

I tried taking a heater to it,leaving it in another room, but no... nothing so we ordered the atlas , which I can't say thatbi like too much but we just staked them for now.",

This made for an uncomfortable experience waking up in the morning with my pelvis deep inside the bed and my shoulders and neck propped up. I had back pain a couple of times and returned it. If there was more support under the hips, and a little softer under the shoulders, I honestly think it would be amazing. But because the opposite was true, and it gave me back pain, I don't recommend this item.",
