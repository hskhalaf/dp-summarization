The diameter needs to be at least a couple of inches bigger, and it could be longer too. Or perhaps it just should be offered in different sizes. I gave mine to my 12-year-old niece and it's perfect for her.",

Being all wool, when it gets a little gross after a couple days of hiking and breathing into it, it's easy to freshen it up with a thoroughly rinse in water, and then hang dry.
