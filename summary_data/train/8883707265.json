I think it would be better suited for the $15-19 price point, unless they can improve the porosity of the paper without compromising the smooth texture. It can be done, and has been at the price point I have indicated.",

      "text": "I LOVE writing notes in this. I use markers and the bleed through is really not that bad, I didn't get distracted when studying at all, (and I easily find things to get distracted over). I used the papermate fine marker pens and they worked awesome. A pilot G2 bold will show through, but again, nothing distracting for me. I hate when pages are stiff and sturdy, these are thin, but really flexible and fluid. I also got the soft cover, and again, I love it. I will buy more once I use this one. No smudging for the markers.",

The moleskin is a novelty, the pouch on the inside back cover is useful for storing a few leaflets of paper and the binding appears strong. Certainly it has withstood being jammed with innumerable mementos. The whole thing is kept tidy with the elastic that is firmly attached to the body of notebook. No way would you ordinarily pay this much for a mere notebook but for a specific project this makes a very good purchase.",

But the 70 gsm paper ghosts so much onto the next page, my notes are a mess. Probably wont repurchase, which i'm really sad about because i really wanna love this notebook.",
