I ran through a massive puddle about 6-8 inches deep and with a bit of high-stepping to stop it overflowing the top, iI came out with completely dry and warm feet. Well worth the extra cash. the only complaint is that the grip is not good in slippery mud, but the are great on rocky trails.",

These are light (though not as light as the pace gloves because they offer more protection) and comfortable. They provide more cushioning than the pace gloves, so are better over longer distances, but not as light, or as gait friendly. Also, I don't love the neon colours (despite them being fashionable). I would have liked grey/black, but these weren't available.",

Very comfortable but had to buy half a size larger as they came up small. I am a fairly heavy runner and these offer fairly little in the way of cushioning but on softer ground this is not an issue.",

      "text": "Bought 2 pairs of these, tried them last weekend on the South Downs and was really disappointed with them. They are sold as trail shoes but had no traction and grip in slightly damp conditions. Also that the mud clung to the bottom of the shoes and therefore were not designed to shed mud at all. I ended up getting taller with more mud being added to the bottom of the shoes and the little traction/grip there was nullified be even more mud. Please don't buy these shoes for changing/challenging conditions there are much better options on the market.",
