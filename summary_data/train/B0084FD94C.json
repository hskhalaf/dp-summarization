Finally I tried this inversion table. I started slow and at a small angle for 30 seconds. I could feel the pressure releasing off my lower back. I worked up to basically upside down for 4 minutes every other day and my back has no more pain. This is a great well built Table that is nice and sturdy. Easy assembly and easy to adjust.",

I have purchased sponges as suggested by another reviewer on here and it has improved the situation but it still leaves something to be desired.

I got the Teeter, set it up easily and the first time I hung on it, everything popped back into place. For the first time in months, my feet have been warm!

Overall, a bit pricey, but built to last and high quality. It has also relieved sciatica pain that other people were telling me I'd need surgery for. That alone was worth the cost. I think these are great for back health. I lift heavy weights and like to use this after days where the lifting compresses my back (squats, overhead press, etc).",

My only criticisms would be that, if you have a back problem that makes fiddling with something down by your feet difficult or impossible, you should consider getting the model that has an extended lever so that you don't have to bend over to clamp your ankles. The other thing is that the ankle supports aren't the most comfortable thing in the world. But what do you expect from hanging by your feet. They're actually not that bad if you wear shoes with good padding, like a light hiking shoe. Still, I think I'll end up purchasing the gravity boots that they offer.",

      "text": "My husband ordered this teeter after thouroughly comparing the many different ones on the market. Although this one is more expensive, it is certainly built to last and is well worth the price. He uses it several times a day, and it has helped his back pain quite a bit. He has had 2 past back surgeries, one at the neck, and one for his low back. Our chiropractor recommended using an inversion table to relieve his low back stress, and it certainly has done that!",

Teeter shouldn't have infomercials, though. I feel it cheapens the product. This is a very good heavy duty product.",

I was assured that the product could be safely used in the interim - which I did without incident.",
