These are really good looking,and very well made jars, and instead of using the supplied clamps and pole extensions, we have them directly on the deck . The flame is higher than I expected, and they seem to use quite a bit of oil ( this maybe normal ), but that gives a great \"campfire\" effect when sat out at night . I am seriously thinking of ordering 2 more units. One tip however, the wick gets extremely coated in black oil residue, so make sure you screw off the cap to refill with care .",

The outside box was in tact but no buffer inside between them and the box, so they are all scraped up. See the pictures. Good flame and I like the different options however they look cheap due to the marks.",
