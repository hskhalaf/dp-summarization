When the laptop is placed in the backpack it will stick out about 2\" too far and the zippers will not zip. One review that I read said that he used a knife to cut off the bottom of the padding and was able to get their 17\" device to fit. The specifications for the pack say that it is 19.5\" lengthwise however the rounded ends cut the maximum device length to 14.5\".",

I used it with my Asus ROG laptop for the first time over the weekend and I could either not zip it up or risk scratching the corners of my expensive laptop.
