Some reviewers clearly didn't do that and were upset about the extra foam. - I recommend getting an auto siphon - the rack thing was too hard for me to do by myself. Don't let any of these be a deal breaker. Follow the directions carefully and you'll have some great beer!",

So after a week and a half a have a gallon of murky yellow liquid not fermenting. I noticed that it looks like some of the red alcohol in the thermometer seems like it's trapped in the top.

Since then, I've made over 100 gallons of beer (in 10 gallon batches though). This kit got me started and got me hooked on it. I still give 5 stars because you really wouldn't want to pay for a kit that included the extra needed items. * You'll need a couple of 8 quart pots (2 gallon), a funnel, and a double strainer. These items make life much simpler when brewing.",

He has since got the materials for 5 gallon batch he's but still prefers the short time this kit takes for heating etc. and likes to try batches on a small scale before deciding if he wants multiple gallons of it.",
