      "text": "Loved this powerbank when I initially received it (ordered in Feb 2018) and it has only been a few months and a USB port has already stopped working. I tried to use different charging cables, thinking it was the cable that was faulty but cables work with wall charger, just not the portable charger. Disappointed because this product had wonderful reviews and I really liked the high charging capacity and the small sleek design. Previously I owned portable charges with similar charging capacity but they were much more bulky. I guess my search for a great portable charger continues.",

Update: Following this review I was contacted by Anker and they sent out two replacement batteries. The batteries worked well for 10 months then wouldn\u2019t charge and we did in fact recharge with an Anker multi charging port (works great no problems) and Anker cable. Maybe these backup batteries only last a bit less than a year or so, though that\u2019s not what I expect as a consumer. Otherwise, Anker puts sells solid speakers we own, among other Anker products. This is why I\u2019m so disappointing about these backup chargers.",

      "text": "This is a really excellent power bank. It charges reliably and holds that charge very reliably. The indicator lights are pretty accurate in displaying how much power is left (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%). The charger has some heft to it. It's not exactly light. But it has big batteries in it, so that's to be expected. The casing is hard plastic. There is no padding on the outside of the device and I suspect it would crack if dropped, given the charger's weight. If you take it to the woods, try to keep it cushioned.",

      "text": "Might be just a lemon, but this battery bank needs over 2 days to charge when connected to a wall outlet. I just charged it overnight (a good 10 hours or so) and it didn't even fill a single charge barldot (out of FOUR). Either this battery bank can end up serving as an uninterruptible power supply for 3 families, or it has an issue. I use this battery to power my VR headset (~5 hours continuous playtime on beat saber, ~3 hours on ALYX) so I can't say for certain whether the charge capacity warrants such a large charge time. Works decently well for travelling. I don't travel much so by the time I do it's probably fully charged.",

PROS - High Capacity. - Can charge two devices at the same time. - Well made. - Accurate indicator lights. - Charges devices fast. CONS - Takes awhile for the bank to charge, I know that's standard but it takes AWHILE. Overall, I am very happy with this power bank. I highly recommend!",
