      "title": "Nice caulk gun, but test it out first before using.",
      "text": "Nice smooth action. Tube barrel rotates independently from handle. I was looking for a drip less caulking gun but this unit doesn\u2019t stop dripping. The good thing is how easy the release functions. The seal breaker is too thick requiring the caulk tube top to be opened more largely than necessary. Couple that with the high ration trigger and you have a recipe for a mess. Don\u2019t use the breaker on the handle and cut the tube to your preference unless you need to caulk a large gap. The gun takes some time to get used to but it does work well.",

      "text": "It feels like I am using a Ferrari to lay caulking. For years I used the cheapest big box guns I could find, but this one makes me regret not switching to quality sooner. It is very smooth loading, so each bead is controlled and I don't ever worry about jumps or slop in the mechanism that would make me blob during use. Overall, this or any quality gun is worth the money over cheapos.",

THe grip is too far out requiring straining to get it started then the squeeze takes way too much effort and the caulk oozes out when the trigger is released. I bought the yellow plastic gun at the same time for $12.00 and it works way better, no drip and easy trigger squeeze and 1/5 the weight = more enjoyable experience. I have used the yellow plastic in the past but they are hard to find. Sherwin Williams carries them.",

The release tab that removes pressure on the Caulk tube works easy without fighting free. If you want the best hand operated caulk gun it doesn't get much better than this.",
