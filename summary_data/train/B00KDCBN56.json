They each curled over or rode up. But this corset fit snugly, broke in quickly, helped me sit up straighter, and supported me when I lifted the baby or weights. It doesn't dig into my hips when I sit, or my ribs. After months of physical therapy, suddenly I'm making incredible progress closing the gap in my muscles. Sadly, after 22 days of intermittent wearing, the ribbons inside are shredding and the mesh is tearing. If I could get just a little more use for the money I spent, it would be 5 stars.",

I am writing this for my wife as I do all the Amazon ordering. She measured at a 35 inch waist so we ordered the XL. She has worn it a week and has it laced within an inch of being all the way. So the Large would have been a better fit. All in all we are happy with the price and the quality. She is not sure if this will reduce her waist along with diet and exercise.",

If I have this directly under bust, it pushes my lower bulge down causing me to feel very self conscious that I have a fat roll hanging down. I can't wear pants/shorts without having a bulge, if worn under bust, or feeling like \"Urkel.\" Maybe I'm wearing it incorrectly? It is my first corset so I'm doing more research on it before I return it. I'm hoping to find a longer corset, hopefully from the same company since it seems like great quality and looks good.",
