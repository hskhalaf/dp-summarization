The sets are all different, but they all work together. I also bought extra wheels so they could make their projects mobile. Cleanup is easy, but I do have them keep these magnets separate from their other toys. My only disappointment is that magformers doesn't make extra pieces to purchase separately so they don't get so many of the same pieces by adding sets. That way we could buy more pieces and it would be more economical to the parents. See what you can do, Amazon.",

My children (2yrs and 4yrs) sometimes have trouble pulling the magnets apart. Things we build do not come apart easily at all. And of course, the wheels on this set are a huge hit with the kids!!! I\u2019m honestly going to purchase a 2-3 more sets just to get the higher quality/stronger magnets. HUGE HIT IN OUR HOME!",
