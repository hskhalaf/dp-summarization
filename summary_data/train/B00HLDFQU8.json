There is a huge difference in the picture quality - especially when there is only a liitle bit of light - compared to other brands. Until now I think it is the best point and shoot of its class. The difference can be seen when you zoom into the pics on the computer. The pics are very sharp and the colors are \"relistic\" under different conditions.",

The many effects are fun to play with, and the creative shot can offer some pleasant suprises. I was a bit worried about the pop-up flash, but so far it hasn't gotten in my way. Night-time pictures come out beautifully, and the zoom is rather impressive, which is mostly what sold me on this camera. The wifi connection allows my to upload the pictures to my phone, so I can send them around with less hassle. I would highly reccomend this camera to anyone, especially condsidering the fairly low price. You won't be disappointed.",

Previous to this SX600, I owned an older Canon (husband ran over it with his tractor). The only thing I liked better about the older version is that it took standard AA batteries. This camera has a small square re-chargeable battery which has to be taken out the camera to charge - which is a pain. But overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. This Canon is light-weight, has a nice large LCD screen, is easy to operate and, best of all, takes great, crisp pictures.",

You have to turn it on and it pops up to have the flash turn off you have to manuley push it down. Somehow when I read several reviews I must of missed the part about the flash. The reason I bought this camera was to take spontaneous pictures of my preschooler's. I tried to leave the flash up but it would get caught on items as I had it hanging around my neck. Other than that, it takes great pictures, very clear and for the price it is worth every dollar I spent.",

Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of advanced Canon technologies to analyze the individual scene, subject and exposure to apply any of 46 filter options. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five additional variations of the composition. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.\n\nBEAUTIFUL IMAGES AND INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE START HERE\n16.0 MEGAPIXEL HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nThe PowerShot SX600 HS camera's 16.0 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor is the highest resolution CMOS sensor used in any PowerShot camera. The difference this makes in your everyday photography is remarkable. The large sensor takes in more light, so images are clear and beautifully detailed. High ISO shots are particularly impressive, with less noise and expanded dynamic range. And the 16.0 Megapixel resolution gives you the flexibility to be more creative with your shots: crop and enlarge any part of an image \u2013 you can be confident that the detail and resolution you need are there.\n\nDIGIC 4+ IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe new Canon DIGIC 4+ Image Processor powers the PowerShot SX600 HS camera's advanced functions and capabilities, including Hybrid Auto, Creative Shot, and Full HD video shooting at 30p in the easy-to-share MP4 format. Its accelerated processing speed creates fast, responsive performance, for a shooting experience that's easy and natural. The DIGIC 4+ Image Processor also enhances image quality in several ways. Processing of high ISO shots has been shortened by 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. This significantly reduces noise for brilliant color, smooth gradations, and beautiful detail even in low light. The processor also allows for the integration of electronic Dynamic IS. This advanced system compensates for multiple motion types, effectively preventing angular blur, shift blur, and blur caused by parallel movement and tilt shift. The result is images that are reliably sharp and clear at all lengths of the camera's powerful zoom. The processor's highly efficient design also extends battery life.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM HELPS PROVIDE EXCELLENT LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE\nThe slim, compact PowerShot SX600 HS gives you the power to capture beautifully detailed, naturally lit images even in low light \u2013 reducing the need for flash and the occasionally unwelcome effects it produces. That's because the camera's 16.0 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works with the camera's new DIGIC 4+ Image Processor to create the Canon HS SYSTEM, specifically engineered for spectacular low-light performance. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you'll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality at ISO speeds up to ISO 3200; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.\n\nGET THE COMPLETE HD EXPERIENCE\nCAPTURE STUNNING 1080P FULL HD VIDEO WITH A DEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON\nThe PowerShot SX600 HS not only preserves your special video memories with spectacular realism, but does it in a format that makes them easy to share. You can simply press the dedicated movie button to start and stop video recording, so you're always ready to capture the moment as it happens. The camera records in stunningly realistic 1080p Full HD, so even when played back on a big-screen HDTV, your videos are crystal clear, with smooth action and beautifully natural color. Thanks to the advanced DIGIC 4+ Image Processor, video can be captured at 30 frames per second in MP4 format. MP4 videos are perfectly sized for quick online sharing \u2013 whether you're showing relatives what the kids are up to or posting status updates on social networking sites.\n\nSHARE WITH A SINGLE TOUCH\nMOBILE DEVICE CONNECT BUTTON\nIt's now easier than ever to connect your PowerShot SX600 HS camera to an iOS\u00ae or Android\u2122 device* using the Mobile Device Connect Button. The button allows you to choose to transfer images to your smartphone or tablet for immediate sharing with the CameraWindow app**, or to your computer on the same network with Image Sync to make saving and organizing your images easier. Once your device is registered on the camera, simply press the Mobile Device Connect button for easy connection.\n\nBy connecting to a smartphone with the CameraWindow app using the Mobile Device Connect Button, you can browse and share images while still leaving the camera inside a bag. It is also possible to turn off the PowerShot SX600 HS quickly and easily, directly from a smartphone. Once your camera is linked to your computer on the same wireless network, you can automatically transfer images to it, for easy saving and organizing of your photos. The Mobile Device Connect Button is great for quick and easy sharing from a fun day out with friends and family.\n\n* Compatible with iOS versions 6.0/6.1/7.0, Android smartphone versions 2.3.3/4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3 and Android tablet versions 4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3. Data charges may apply.\n** This software enables you to upload images to social network services. Before uploading images, please be aware that image files may contain privacy related information such as people and places. If necessary, please delete such information. Canon does not obtain, collect or use such images or any information included in such images through this software.\n\nREMEMBER THE DAY IN CRISP HD\nHYBRID AUTO\nThe PowerShot SX600 HS camera features Hybrid Auto, which records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips and pictures* into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions, or any time you're shooting many shots in a day. With Hybrid Auto, this \u201chighlight reel\u201d is stunningly beautiful. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.\n\n* Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS AND VIDEOS\nSMART AUTO\nSophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button, Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. On the PowerShot SX600 HS, detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture, whether you're shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Movie Digest & Hybrid Auto Automatically selects shooting settings for optimal quality and records a video clip every time you capture a still image. One day's worth of clips are then combined into a single video. Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions. Creative Shot Analyzes the scene and applies a number of creative filters to automatically create five variations in addition to the original image. Portrait Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background. Smart Shutter The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame. High-Speed Burst Captures rapid action frame by frame, by shooting continuously at a high speed while the shutter button is held down. Handheld Night Scene Take clear and steady pictures at night without the use of a tripod. Low Light For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations. Fisheye Effect Now you can get the fisheye effect \u2013 a classic photographic distortion \u2013 without a fisheye lens. Miniature Effect Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image. Toy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with \u201ctoy\u201d or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect. Monochrome Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue. Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors. Poster Effect Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts. Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint. Fireworks Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Long Shutter Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography. Movie Record video in stereo sound. Unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode. Actual results may vary from examples shown above.\nFinal image may vary depending on picture composition.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nINTELLIGENT IS\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot SX600 HS, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re shooting still images or video.\n\nStill Image Shooting Normal IS Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning IS Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. Video Recording Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting. Active Tripod IS When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake. ECO MODE\nThe PowerShot SX600 HS features ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. The mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed. With ECO Mode activated to conserve power, you can even stay connected for longer with the built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae featured on the camera. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the night, you can be assured your camera can keep up.\n\nEASILY PRINT YOUR FAVORITE MOMENTS\nIt's quick and easy to make beautiful prints from your PowerShot camera. With the built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae on your PowerShot camera, it's easy to send your images to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) compatible printer. Or use the Direct Print system; simply connect your PowerShot SX600 HS camera to a Canon PIXMA or SELPHY photo printer with a USB cable and press the button to print.
