Battery life is incredible compared to any mirrorless I\u2019ve used. If you have Nikon dx glass you can\u2019t go wrong with this body.",

I just bought a 64GB card and I never come close to needing the memory. I can see why professionals and wedding photographers miss the backup but they probably opt for the D500 for other reasons.

I miss the second card slot which saved me several times in the past when I neglected to return the card to slot one. I have noticed considerably less accumulation of dust particles on the sensor as well.",

It makes it real hard to understand the settings you've adjusted, when you're trying to set them just right for that great picture. I'd like to return it and buy the D500 instead (which is a proven model), but can't do so, because I made the mistake of throwing away the original packaging.",

I've been a Nikon shooter for many years and its been worth the wait for this one. Four stars because I don't 'love' things.",
