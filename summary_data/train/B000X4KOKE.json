It wasn't until I started unwiring trees that I realized how much I'd be using wire cutters. I decided to stop being cheap and buy a wire cutter and man am I happy. It's like cutting 12 gauge. So effortless. As usual being cheap just ends up costing me more money because now I have an obsolete wire cutter. I keep that cheapo out in the garage for impromptu work and keep these bad boys in the tool pouch when it's time to get serious.",
