      "text": "Pros: Heats up lightning fast and offers more control. One minute or less and you're up to 350\u00b0F from a cold pan. More energy efficient than gas or electric. Lighter than you'd think, making portability easy. Cools down quicker. Cons: Not all cookware works with induction. Don't trust material indicated, look for \"induction ready\" or the induction symbol on the pan. Ventilation fan is a bit loud and continues to cool the unit after you've finished cooking. Typically this is 2-3 minutes. Temperature control only works with food in the pan. If the pan is dry, or only has oil in it, it will get much hotter than you want it to.",

It cooks on the larger ring, some people say it doesn\u2019t. It needs to be preheated, either in the oven or on the low heat cycle on the cooktop, never leave the cooktop unattended. It did a great job. Searing steaks to finish in the oven & stir frying.",

The fan puts out a bit more noise than NuWave, but that's simply a minor inconvenience. This was a replacement for my NuWave that broke due to the way they design their digital controls (the on-off button pushed right through the front panel). Besides being quite a bit less expensive, this machine does everything the NuWave did. So far I'm quite pleased with it.",
