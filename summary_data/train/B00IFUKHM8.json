The point is, I had this phone for at least 5 years maybe more. I had no choice but to upgrade as the apps today are installing on 6.0 and the android was only 4.2 I think. So many of my apps were no longer supported. But a great phone!",

      "text": "Came in advertised condition (new) with all appropriate accessories. Phone is sleek, functions well and very intuitive design. Display is high quality and camera is also pretty good, though I don't take pictures that much so I wouldn't know. Screen fits well in my hand (I have pretty big hands) and the gyroscope is pretty fine-tuned -- I'm easily miffed if the phone rotates from portrait to landscape when I don't want it to. 4 stars for being high quality phone at decent price. It didn't blow me away, nor did it have a fantastically low price. If you want a nice shiny phone without the $400 price tag this can be it.",

Technically speaking on this phone, it is already well known as Samsung Galaxy Note II killer, we don't need mention anymore and any longer. This time is my second purchase in one month period for my family member upgrade. I dare to say this phone's real value is much more than its price.

LG doesn't \"push\" these updates to unlocked phones. I had this phone for 3 years and never once was able to get an update. I've had a Moto 5 Plus for 1 year that has had 2 updates \"pushed\" to it already. I wouldn't recommend an LG phone if you are buying the unlocked version as it will not get updated.",
