      "text": "Until it failed after only 20 months, this was an excellent computer with lots of capacity for multitasking, a crisp display and better than average speed. In October 2016, the video board failed resulting in vertical lines filling the monitor. I took it to a computer repair shop, which diagnosed it as a catastrophic failure of part of the mother board. The technician believed that the cooling system failed first, resulting in overheating.",

Last October I received my new Dell XPS 127 (27 inch screen all in one) and in February the Windows 8 crashed. I called for help and learned that software support is for 30 days and I could purchase contract support for help. I declined and then found on line that I could order recovery software for free from Dell. I did this and have found that I could not get Windows 8.1 to reinstall. Again I called for help and was told for a price I could get help. Techs have since hung up on me three times.",

I like the touch screen and the windows 8.1 operating system seems much easier than my previous experience with windows operating systems years ago. While still not as easy or intuitive as the MAC the touch screen is easy to use and is vivid in colors and contract. I use it for programs that aren't available for the MAC but find myself using it more and more primarily due to touchscreen.",

After two in-person service calls and replacement of motherboard and screen that issue was resolved but three others popped up. Seriously long hours on the phone for a couple of days with the service center finally resulted in the computer being repaired. At one point we asked to return the computer but with perseverance all issues were finally resolved and the computer is working fine.",

This machine performs well, the included wireless keyboard and mouse and nice. I skipped using a wired network connection since it sits right next to my wireless router. It really just plugs into the wall and works. Even my speakers are bluetooth so no wires there either. I am very happy with this purchase.",

I bought one for the office and one for the bedroom which double as TVs since there is an HDHomeRun Prime on the network. The QHD touchscreen is 10-point and fun to use. My only complaint with this model was the SSD was only 32 GB which doesn't leave any breathing room for apps after you've installed Windows. The good news is that these models are extremely serviceable. I was able to add two 256 GB mSATA SSD drives in under 30 minutes. Can't believe I'm giving praise to a DELL product, but they really got this one right.",

My wife loves how crisp her photos look, which is a glowing endorsement from her. The Dell runs relatively fast, although I would have preferred a full SSD drive versus the combo HD/SSD drive. The keyboard and mouse are not the highest quality, but they work fine. Really the shining star here is the great 1440p 27\" touchscreen. Colors are nicely saturated and the graphics are tack sharp. This PC should last us a good 7 years before we need to upgrade again.",
