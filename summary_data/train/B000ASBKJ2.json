      "text": "Pass this one by for the ES-15 which has more features and capability. But if you can get it cheap, it is a good entry level recorder. The next step up is a HD recorder which is much better for time shift viewing, but the ES-20 is fine for doing the same as long as you have plenty of DVD-RW or DVD RAM disks. The RAM is better for editing out commercials and setting up chapters. It is an excellent machine for transferring home VHS movies to DVD-R. The DVD is actually of better quality than the VHS since the ES20 cleans up noise. Very happy with it.",

I got some cheap Staples DVD-Rs (100 for $18) and have been burning discs with no worries since. This Panasonic recorder is easy to set up and use and has only toasted one DVD thus far. I rate it very high on reliability and ease of use and those are my biggest priorities.",

The DVD Ram discs are great. For the money I would not hesitate again to purchase this product. Really like the Black that matches my other components. Unit does what it says and the setup is easy as long as you read the manual and understand everything first.",

      "text": "My wife and I have spent at least 5 hours trying to figure out why this thing operates the way it does. First, it more than occasionally locks up which requires you to unplug to correct; Second, it doesn't record based upon your scheduled setup...it either records early, not at all, or one day and not the next; Third, it will not play DVDs due to the Region Number mismatch even though there is an available menu option to play all DVDs (won't allow me to access this option). Need I say more? Don't waste your time on this one.",

    "description": "Color:SilverWatch your favorite TV shows or save your precious home movies on compact on durable DVD discs. This recorder is easy to use with User-friendly features that make it even easier to use with superior picture quality and playback. You can record to a permanent, write-once DVD-R disc or erasable, rewriteable DVD-RW disc. Use DVD-Rs for programs you want to keep forever, like a favorite TV series. DVD-RAMs are perfect for shows you want to watch once or twice and then erase. You can do all that while watching the start of the program while recording. 4x Natural Gradation 2x LP Horizontal Resolution (500 Lines) 1 Second Quick Start for Recording Plays pre-recorded DVD's & CD's Chasing playback allows you to watch the start of a program while recording Non-linear editing MP3 Playback 2 CH DVD-Audio Playback Records on DVD-RAM & lower cost DVD-R Will make discs that will play in most existing DVD players Simultaneous playback while recording is possible Uses the single layer 4.7GB DVD-R system and DVD-RAM 4.7GB systems Records in real-time using MPEG2 compression, Up to 8 hours per disc Quick recording function automatically finds the blank part of the disc Variable Data rate settings Flexible recording mode for optimized bitrate Built-in time base corrector that delivers highly stable, natural images Front A/V input Full RGB in and out IEEE1394 Firewire Port Flexible recording mode allows you to manually a time for recording and the player will set the best possible bit rate NTSC Progressive Scan Output Region R1 Compatible Playable Formats - DVD-RAM, DVD-R/RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD Video, VCD CD-R, VCD CD-RW, MP3 CD Recording Formats - DVD-RAM, DVD-R/RW, DVD+R Video & Audio Recording system - MPEG2 (Hybrid-VBR) & Dolby Digital 2ch Power consumption - 23W Dimensions - Width 430mm x Height 63mm x Depth 337mm Weight - 3.5 kg\n\nAMAZON.COM\nRecord your home movies and your favorite TV programs easily to DVD disc with the Panasonic DMR-ES20 progressive scan recorder/player, which can record to write-once DVD+R and DVD-R media or rewritable DVD-RW and DVD-RAM discs (the latter being a great choice for temporary storage of recorded material as it can be rewritten more than DVD-RW). It's easy to record TV programming with the built-in analog TV tuner with RF pass-through and seven-day electronic programming guide (EPG). In addition to standard DVD movie and CD audio discs and its compatible recordable formats, the DMR-ES20 can play back DVD+RW, CD-R/RW, VCD, JPEG, and MP3. \n\n Panasonic's Time Slip function consists of two features designed to give you added flexibility and control when making DVD recordings: Chasing Playback and Simultaneous Record & Play. With Chasing Playback, you don't have to wait for an entire program to be recorded before watching it from beginning to end. This feature allows you to watch a program that's currently being recorded from any point that's already been recorded--while continuing to record the live program in progress. Simultaneous Record & Play allows you to record a program onto a disc while simultaneously watching any other program that's previously been recorded on the same disc. \n\n You can set your recorder to one of five different recording speeds, each varying in recording quality and length. EP mode yields the most recording time, LP & SP modes provide less recording time with higher quality recording, and XP mode gives you the highest quality recording. There's also the FR (Flexible Recording) mode that lets you record with the best picture quality possible for the recording time and remaining space on the disc. \n\n The Direct Navigator feature makes it easy to find a previously recorded program on a disc. A list of recording dates, times, channels and (user-entered) titles are shown on screen. With the Playlist Playback function, you can perform simple non-linear video editing using, such as rearranging the order of scenes, skipping over unwanted scenes, or copying selections \n\n Jump directly to any spot on a disc and begin playback or recording right away with the Rapid Random Access function. Even if there is no sequential area of empty space available, this DVD recorder can record data on available space throughout the rest of the disc. You will also avoid searching for a blank spot to start recording, or accidentally recording over desired material. \n\n It offers an optical digital audio output for Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound and a Firewire (also known as IEEE1394 or i.Link) for direct connection to a digital video camcorder. This recorder/player also offers the following connection options: \n\n * Composite video Input: 2 (1 front) \n * Composite audio (L/R) Input: 2 pair (1 front) \n * S-Video Input: 2 (1 front) \n * RF Input: 1 \n\n What's in the Box\nDVD recorder/player, remote control (with batteries), AV cable, RF cable, power cord, printed operating instructions",
