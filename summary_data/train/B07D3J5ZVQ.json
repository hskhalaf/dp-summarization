It's nice and sturdy even with both doors unzipped and has a nice little peep-pocket on the side that can be unzipped to pet your animals without fear of it escaping. The clips on the zippers also give peace of mind that your pet cannot undo the zippers and escape. Unfortunately, this carrier was a bit too small for my pup, and I ended up giving it as a gift to my sister for her smaller cat (who loves it and sleeps in it all the time now on her own).",
