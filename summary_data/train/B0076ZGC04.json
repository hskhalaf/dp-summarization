If I knew now how poor quality this was I never would have bought it. I have a 14 year old Dyson that still works great. Quality most definitely has declined over the years.",

Needless to say I cancelled Macy's order which hasn't been an easy task since I'm still working on the return credit even as I write review. FYI- if you purchase from Macy's online be sure it's what you really want. Canceling a web purchase via Macys is a huge hassle and requires a great deal of patiences.",

Stringy stuff does get caught in the floor piece in the rotating whisker floor piece. It has some small fragile plastic pieces so I am hoping that they won't break with use. Make sure that when you empty the dust bin, you do so when there isn't a wind, because it will blow in your face and all over your pants. Good luck to everyone!",

The DC39 is both, and it's easier to detach the hose wand for edges than the stand-up models. The design is really cool, with the big ball serving as the vacuum's base. Also, I really like that the rotating brush is narrower than most other canister models, making it easier to get under smaller areas like end tables and behind couches.

Although I like it to some extent, dragging this vaccum is getting to be a pain. I like the way the electrical cord get sucked into the unit on a simple push of a button. Its not noisy (but not too quiet either). I recommend this only if there is 25% or $100 discount. I will amend this review once i get to cleaning and so more rugged use of it.",
