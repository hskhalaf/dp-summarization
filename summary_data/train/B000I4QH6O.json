Bought a pair of Saucony Jazz shoes about 20 years ago and remember thinking that these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I have never bought shoes online before but when I saw these on Amazon I thought I would give them a try. Very happy with my decision. They are still (for my feet at least) some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. One warning I would give to others is that Saucony shoes seen to fit a little small compared to others so I would recommend ordering a 1\u20442 size larger than you usually wear.",

They also have a very stabilizing tread that keeps me safe on those hills. The price was good, the free shipping while it took a little longer was not that much longer for FREE. People look at the shoes with admiration and wonder what they are as they are not the standard sneaks you see out there. They are in a class of their own. Very good Experience for me.",

According to mass reviews, seems like I got a defective pair. Which wouldn't surprise me because nearly all the bad reviews are due to glue and stitching errors in the manufacturing process.",

They're not the best running shoes for fast runners but they should work fine for a relaxed pace. The insoles are crap in every pair of shoes so I recommend an aftermarket insole such as superfeet green if you want to put some miles on them. They are definitely true to size. Since the white parts of the shoes are very crisp, they stand out a lot giving you a serious retro athletic look.",

The white bits are all a semi reflective plastic and just made the shoe feel/look cheap. Even adding a 'crinkle' sound if a i moved in a way that would cause the sides to bunch up. Go look at the vegan version. It is tan/beige where this shoe is white. The number of complements and the natural feel were amazing. The sole was thin on it so it was poor when walking on very rough terrain, but still an amazing shoe.",
