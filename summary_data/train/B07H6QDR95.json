Despite its positive qualities, the running footgear still received opposing views regarding the comfort and support it brought. While a handful confirmed that the shoe was comfortable in every aspect, there were some who thought against the grain. Overall, the footgear was still validated as a runner-up for being one of the most reliable training shoes on the market.",

      "text": "Nice comfortable shoes. I wish I could tighten the \"shoe laces\" a little, but they are elastics bands with the look of shoe laces: Just insert your feet into them. They would be perfect for someone who cannot tie shoes because of extreme stiffness or a disability. I am not sure if they would work as running shoes: I personally like to adjust sneaker tightness to prevent rubbing and these cannot be tightened/adjusted. I will need to install regular shoe laces. Update: I have tightened the elastic laces on the top and have been wearing them for long walks as well as driving; they are super comfy and soft!",

This is my 3rd pair of this type and 4th pair of avia brand. Still happy. A good everyday shoe. I have bad feet, arch issues so I wear shoe inserts in all my shoes. These shoes have enough space for that.",
