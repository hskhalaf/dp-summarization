There is no way that this recipe is correct. These recipes cost a lot of money to make, so typos with ingredients is a little hard to take.

I have yet to make a recipe from this book that we didn't like. Especially helpful is the substitution chart for different flours/liquids in the beginning - i.e. - substitution for almond flour. We have tree nut allergies - so several recipes we wouldn't be able to make without the chart. Recipes turned out great even with the substitution flours. Highly recommend this cookbook.",
