      "text": "Between birth and 3/4 months of age the IRIS 4 panel pen was fantastic for containing my puppy when eyes couldn't constantly be on her. She's a Chihuahua Shih-Tzu Maltese mix, so quite a small dog. However, due to the height of the pen and the slats running lengthwise, she developed the ability to climb (and later jump) over the pen with no issues. For a young puppy or a toy breed I consider this a fantastic choice due to its convenience and solid build quality. For small-medium dogs there might be issues with Mission Impossible style escapes however.",

Assembles by rods that go down through corners, which is very easy for the humans but I can imagine some escape artist pets might figure out how to get it apart. Also, not that tall so any larger dogs could probably jump out. We're very pleased though for the price, and it is perfect for what we wanted - a place to put the pup when we are home but need him contained when we can't keep eyes on him 100% (cooking dinner, showering, etc.) without putting him in his crate.",
