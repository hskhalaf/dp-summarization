The provided leads were a bit short in my opinion. The power leads (red/black) are only about 3\u2019 long. The battery in the rzr is under the rear seat and with the solenoid mounted in the front, it was way too short. I ended up switch the power leads for the winch leads (yellow/blue) and it fit, but was definitely tight. Overall, it looks decent ... again, I haven\u2019t actually used it yet so time will tell!...",
