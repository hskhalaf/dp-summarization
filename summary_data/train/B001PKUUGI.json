I have to use a vacuum to clean up everytime I shred. It is also very heavy and the hand to pull it is the same handle as the removable bin, so when you go to move the shredder, you accidentaly pull out the shredded bin, clunky. Aggravated because I spent so much on this.",

So far my only gripe is the machine opens on the side instead of the front (narrow side) so when I push it flat against the wall I need to turn the heavy machine to pull out the bin long ways to empty it. Pulling out a bin the length of the machine instead of the depth is more difficult.",

I think they claim 20 pages but unlikely it can do that except in pristine documents. The only drawback is the bin is not large enough and you constantly have to tamp down the shreds which means opening up the drawer constantly. Since the shreds don't always stay in the bag, there is a bit of a cleanup problem too but that is true with many shredders. Overall, it is a good choice and at $399.00 a very good value.",

It is a workhorse, able to shred continuously for a long time. Also it never seems to struggle with multiple pages, it handles everything confidently. The best part is the large capacity waste bin, which means less time having to empty it. I would recommend this shredder to anyone with a very large personal need or for most small businesses.",

I aways use a shredder bag, otherwise I could see emptying the bin would get to be a pain. With the bag, it doesn't take very much time at all to keep it clean. Very effective product.",

The only negative is that it sometimes takes a second for the shredder to recognize that there is paper in the shredder. This may be due to the safety features. Other than that, this product has met all expectations.",

Two days later I started to shred a second bag, but the machine stopped working; the thick rubber gasket that surrounds the paper slot was being sucked into the blades. Although Amazon accepted the return, it was not easy repacking such a heavy item (67 lbs) and \"dropping\" it off at the UPS store. I would have preferred a UPS package pickup, but I am going out of town. Cannot wait until Amazon starts using Sikorsky Sky Cranes to deliver and pickup heavy packages.",

It is not to noisy & it can be used for a longer period of time before needing to cool off. Love it! This machine makes quick work of our shredding needs!",

Don't buy other shredders that to strip cuts or have low paper capacity. Otherwise you will waste man hours of your staff feeding through a few sheets a time. With this shredder you can feed about 15 to 18 pages no problem.",
