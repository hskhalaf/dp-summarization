This is EXACTLY the same as the highly rated Cusfull stool which is slightly cheaper and doesn't have an unattractive logo on front. The gray is more of a medium gray on the other where this is a lighter greige, but the silicone non slip surface is almost identical and the clear non slip pads on the bottom are identical. I would only this one if color matters to you and logos don't. I would not recommend the Be-moming stool on the other hand, which has a slippery plastic 'non-slip' surface and rubber feet that fall out.",

A child would have no problems with this item barring horseplay. Glad I took a chance and ordered!!!",

      "text": "My son is only 16 months old, but tall for his age. I ordered another stool with only 1 step and it was too high for him to get on, but too low to reach the sink. The dual height step makes it possible for him to climb up himself. A good stool so far, though I do wish the top step were a little deeper and that the base was more weighted. It hasn't tipped over, but I think I would be more confident in the product if it felt heavier. Overall, a good purchase and he is thrilled he can reach the sink all by himself (and the water for splashing fun!)",
