You can take reading after reading without waiting 30 seconds or turning it off. Lightweight and fits even large hands well. As for shutting it off... You can wait 30 seconds for the auto shutoff - OR - hold down the trigger button for 10 seconds. That shuts it off on demand. I will buy more for my other cars.",

The gauge stopped working properly the second time I went to use it. I push the button to turn it on, wait until it calibrates itself, and then measure the tire pressure. When I pull gauge off of the tire stem the display starts flashing and continues until the gauge times out and powers off. It will work just once the next time it is powered on and then flashes until it powers off. I would try another brand.",

So I've tried many types of tire gauge and used several, including aneroids with a hose and a couple other digital gauges. This model is definitely the best I've ever used, so much so that I gave them to five family members and friends. The gauge illuminates the valve stem if you're in a dark garage, and is set at just the right angle to the stem so it's easy to get a good connection without losing a lot of air - a shortcoming of many gauges.",

For the price, it is a nice gauge to have stored in a car especially if you are attempting to check the pressure when it's dark.

Other than that very minor complaint I would recommend to anyone!",

Use this when airing up your tires anywhere and you'll do it perfectly every time.

    "description": "In any light, day or night, the TEKTON 5941 Digital Tire Gauge gives you an instant, accurate, and easy-to-read measurement of your vehicle's tire pressure. A simple push button turns the unit on and selects one of four measurement ranges. When it\u2019s dark, the lighted nozzle illuminates your work area, so you can easily locate the valve stem. With gentle pressure, the nozzle seals onto the valve stem quickly and completely to deliver an accurate measurement. The exact measurement instantly displays on a clear, lighted digital screen, so there\u2019s no guesswork or estimation like reading an analog gauge. After you\u2019re done, a 30-second automatic shut off means you never have to worry about accidentally running the batteries dead. Contoured to fit your hand, the ergonomic shape is complemented by a soft, nonslip texture for ultimate comfort and control. Check your tire pressure often. Properly inflated tires keep you safe on the road and help you save on gas. Store this handy tool in your glove box or console, so it's always ready when you need it.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n * (4) measurement ranges: PSI: 0-100, bar: 0-7, kPa: 0-700, kg/cm2: 0-7\n * Minimum increment: 0.5 PSI\n * Power source: (1) CR2032 3V lithium coin cell, (3) LR44 1.5V button cells (all included)",
