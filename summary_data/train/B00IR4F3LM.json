I was looking for one where it's safe to use in the car and this one was perfect as it doesn't have the hard rubber teethers that could smack the baby if it swung. The toy is meant to be down on the side of the bar during car ride for safety. For other reviewers who were hoping it stayed up all the time-- it's actually not safe. The colors and shapes really attracts my baby's attention: shiny soft plastic mirror, hard plastic rings, the cow rattles but not so much that it's annoying, and the bee is easy to grab. It's kept her entertained during dinners and it's soft!",

The only reason I have for not leaving a 5-star review on this item, is that the baby can pull the toy off of the car seat handle very easily. (He's 6 months old) I have an older toy that is similar from the same brand, but mine wraps more times around the handle and it stays put better than this one. The material on the older one also seems like it's a little bit better quality. so if you don't mind your baby being able to be get the toy off of the handle, then go for it!",

      "text": "It's okay, I should've read more reviews before purchasing. Definitely not big as I thought it would be; it fits in my hand crinkled up. I think it will serve its purpose for catching attention, but the baby can not reach it. I bought it as an add on item (cheaper) or I would have sent it back. Seems well made baby toy--possible better on stroller so baby can hold/touch it.",

I hang it from from her play gym, also hook it on to her Sit Me Up Chair. for the price order it and see all the places you could use it. love it",

I especially love that this can be used everywhere, I can wrap it around pretty much anything (including her crib bars) to keep her occupied. I saw this same toy at Target for almost twice as much! so this is an amazing deal!",

For carseats with handles that do not go straight across it may take some time to get it wrapped in a way you like, but we got it figured out! My son likes having things to look at and this is bright and hangs down but is not so low it is hitting him in the face, which we both appreciate :)",

I give it three stars however bcs it coils up on the car seat handle so it's all bunched together and the toys are too high for my son to touch. It would better if the toys hung down lower. I do at times hang links from this and attach other toys to it that he can more easily play with. The product appears to be built well and I don't foresee it breaking unless you intentionally take a scissors after it.",
