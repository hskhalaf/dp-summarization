It was easy to install, but it did take me a while. My husband was at work, so I did it by myself. It pumps much harder than the pump that comes with the pool. It is keeping our pool clean so far, but we have only had it a few days. Will update review if that changes. Sorry for the Snap photo. That's all I have! ha!",

I am using quikrete pool filter sand. All of the Ace Hardware's were out of the recommended hth pool sand. So I first backwashed, then rinsed. Then set to filter and runs for 4 hours and set the SWG for 4 hours too. So far so good.",

Local pool stores will have you spend a fortune on chemicals, instead do what I did if you see a guy doing pools out and about sit and have a chat. Could not be more impressed by this sand filter.

Save yourself the trouble and money, just order this along with your pool. The 2100 is perfect for our 22ft round pool, which holds over 10,000 gallons. All that's left is the $10 bag of sand from your local pool store, and you're in business! Pool is much more clear and balanced! I can't stress this enough.",

Luckily amazons frequently bought together brought it to my attention. I would have been slightly frustrated if I would have purchased this pump without the adapters/connectors because I would have had to wait another few days before installing. My only other regret was not purchasing the skimmer at the same time. This was mainly due to the fact that I am a cheapskate and has everything to do with my upbringing and again has nothing to do with this seller. Cheers.",

I wanted to buy an automatic vacuum, which meant I needed a bigger pump for the vacuum to work. The set up was so easy and I found the sand at Home Depot for $5.49 for a 50 lb. bag. I will say this, I could not find how much sand the pump would need in the description and had to google. It said 100 lbs. would be sufficient; however it takes closer to 125-150 lbs. The vacuum works like a champ now! I am super impressed with all Intex products, especially this one.",

I love that we don't have to but paper filters anymore and feel like this will save us money in the long run. This pump runs quietly and is very easy to set up and maintain. Our pool had gone completely green when our original pool pump quit working- this sand filter pump got the water moving and filtering and with minimal chemicals we were able to clear up our water and swim again after only 48 hours. I can't say enough positive things about this pump. It really makes maintaining our pool very easy.",
