      "text": "Makes great coffee. Unlike my three previuos thermal drip pots, this one never clogs causing coffee to spill all over my counter top while brewing. The only annoyance is that the design of the spout on the pot is such that if you pour faster than a trickle, coffee dribbles down the front of the pot and collects on the stand. The dried coffee residue will build up on the stand plate giving it a corroded appearance. I have been using my first Melitta 46894 for about 10 years and it is still going strong. I purchased this one as a gift for my daughter and she is very happy with it.",

The pour-interrupt (or whatever it's called, that lets you pour while coffee is still brewing) feature works very well compared with other units I've had. My only complaints, which are minor, are that (1) the water level gauge only shows water level above 6 cups, so it's useless for determining when the pot is almost done, and (2) there is only one such gauge, on the right hand side, which in my case is not easily visible. The carafe fits snugly into place and doesn't allow sloppy placement leading to messy spills. Highly recommended.",

The unit is sleek-looking and well-built. The display is minimalist and the button controls are zero-frill, and I like it that way. The thermal carafe keeps coffee HOT for literally hours - perfect for lazy mornings. It's nice for entertaining too... Just set the carafe on the table. The lid unscrews for full access to clean the inside of the pot. Considering the price of quality carafes alone, you are practically getting the coffeemaker free!",

Having tried many different brands over the years the thermal carafe with the cone filter is our favorite. The Melitta is easy to fill with coffee and water. The brew is hot and robust. The one curiosity is that even though this is a thermal carafe the plate underneath gets hot to the touch during brewing. Melitta makes an identical model with a glass carafe that needs to stay hot on the bottom while this version should not. I suspect either a model mixup or a surprising design change. Too soon to tell if the reliability will match the Starbucks model.",

I wanted a thermal pot to keep the coffee tasting fresh and the gizmo had to be simple. The reviews here praise Melitta, so I thought I had little to lose. Quite frankly, the coffee maker has surpassed my expectations. The robust setting makes my coffee taste great, the thermal pot keeps the coffee hot, and it is just about as simple as it gets. The only downside seems to be that the coating on the heating pad is peeling away. Still, if this lost-cost maker lasts half as long as my old Bunn, I'll be quite happy.",

After investigation, I found that a bubble would get stuck in the hole where the coffee was supposed to enter the pot. The bubbles stopped the coffee from flowing through, and hot coffee would build up on the top of the pot and begin to spill over the sides and everywhere.",

There is a warming element under the carraffe that rusts out within a year to year and a half. I have bought 6 of these so far replacing earlier ones that have rusted out.

The maker I had prior to this had the electronics in the bottom under the carafe. I had a senior moment and ran the machine without the carafe in place, made a mess and flooded the electronics and killed a $200 coffee maker.

It brews good coffee and has the three settings and we brew on the Bold setting and find it to be perfect.

The one time I used the timed/programmed setting, about 1/3 of the water in the reservoir leaked onto the counter overnight before it even began brewing.

It then took about 10 days to get the part, but it been making great coffee ever since! The pot keeps the coffee hot and the lid is easier to get on and off than my previous pot.",

It took a bit to find our perfect brew strength as the filters are different than we are used to but we love the flavor. Yay!",

The coffee temp is hot enough - I have to wait for it cool before drinking, and it stays hot without cooking for several hours. The spout is a tad leaky, but fine. The programmer works, or you can brew coffee that's ready in about 1 minute per cup. As other reviews noted, it is tall and you have to lift the handle to get the basket to sit properly. Neither was a deal breaker.",
