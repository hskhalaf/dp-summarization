The family pup is also a nice touch. As you can see in my pictures, the set makes a wonderful addition to any LEGO city scene. This set has also been selling for under $15, which makes the piece to price ratio very positive. I give this set a buy rating and think it's a must-have for your LEGO collection.

I don't like tent camping, so having a camper is the best option for me. However, my fiance doesn't want to pay for one. She was much happier with me spending a few dollars on LEGOs... She said I could even take it tent camping with us, so I could pretend that I had a camper.",

She particularly enjoyed figuring out the trailer locking mechanism and van/trailer hitch process. She then became a reckless big blue van driver with many trailer accidents. Some of the pieces in this set are very small, but overall, the pieces are larger than the smaller sets --- easier for a 3.5 year old to assemble/disassemble.",

My one complaint is that generally the van looks very plain, like it was made by a kid without instructions. However because the roof is just open studs you can add to it as you see fit. Maybe add some roofracks or some luggage?",
