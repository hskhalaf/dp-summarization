I received this camera a week ago and have used it everyday. I have taken over 400 pictures since then. mostly on an upland bird hunt. Action was great. The movie quality of this camera is better than my two year old Sony digital movie camera. I feel like I have a camera that does it all. A 2 gig card will hold over 500 of the highest resolution (3264X2448 pixels) I have not had to recharge the battery yet. I highly recommend this camera.",

The screen viewfinder is big enough to see clearly, even for someone who wears glasses for closeup work. Highly recommend this camera. Downloading is easy with the cord connected directly to my laptop or you can use the program that comes with the camera.",

      "text": "Very convenient small size, and great color (in vivid mode), and great sharpness (in default lens setting). Telephoto images (even in just the optical range) are disappointing due to degraded sharpness (even in bright light conditions). For a camera of this cost (nearly $300 in late 2007) some design aspects are disappointing. Specifically, the tiny recessed plastic on/off button broke a few months after the 1 year warranty expired. It doesn't make a difference how good a camera is if you cannot turn it on. I assume this is a design issue common to the SD Elph series.",

The video is way better than I expected and with sound too. My friends were so impressed, they went out and bought a camera just like this. Also, the digital macro actually works! You can get within a couple inches and it takes wonderful photos. Downside is it turns off the flash, but I can see why if you are within inches of an object.

ISO 400 noise level and detail are good enough for snapshots. Because the camera is so small, controls are close together so care must be taken to not change settings inadvertently. In very bright daylight, the screen is usable for composing but you cannot see detail in it. In that case you can use the optical viewfinder.

My husband's solution is to just charge the battery weekly as it holds a charge for lots of photos.)",

The memory disc has too small a capacity, but that was easily remedied with the purchase of a more spacious disc on the aftermarket. Also, when purchasing this camera, I recommend that you purchase an accompanying travel case for it.",

Am considering one for myself, but would love to have the 28mm option that is only currently available on the SD800.

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD850 IS 8.0 MP Digital Elph Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Discover a new inspiration. The PowerShot SD850 IS Digital Elph is a digital camera that will really get your creative juices flowing. It starts with a high-resolution 8-megapixel CCD, a 4x optical zoom with Canon\u2019s exclusive UA Lens and an Optical Image Stabilizer for steady zooming. There\u2019s also a DIGIC III Image Processor with Face Detection and red-eye correction, an ISO 1600 setting for sharper images in low light, 5 Movie Modes and a 2.5-inch PureColor LCD with scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating for easy viewing.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nManufacturer Description \n\n Discover a new inspiration. The PowerShot SD850 IS Digital Elph is a digital camera that will really get your creative juices flowing. It starts with a high-resolution 8-megapixel CCD, a 4x optical zoom with Canon\u2019s exclusive UA Lens and an Optical Image Stabilizer for steady zooming. There\u2019s also a DIGIC III Image Processor with Face Detection and red-eye correction, an ISO 1600 setting for sharper images in low light, 5 Movie Modes and a 2.5-inch PureColor LCD with scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating for easy viewing. \n\nPowerShot SD850 Highlights \n\n\n\n4x optical zoom in action Advanced 8.0-megapixel Digital Elph with 4x optical zoom and exclusive UA lens Count on the PowerShot SD850 IS Digital Elph for images that will make you say \"wow\" every time you shoot! Equipped with a high resolution 8-megapixel CCD, this Digital Elph is just what you need to capture life\u2019s greatest inspirations as you\u2019ve always wanted them. You\u2019ll get every exquisite detail in dazzling, eye-popping color. And you can print big. Plus, the SD850 IS Digital Elph is equipped with a 4x optical zoom that features Canon\u2019s exclusive UA lens with ultra-high refractive index glass to enhance your pictures while significantly reducing total lens size. Just imagine the possibilities! \n\nOptical Image Stabilizer technology for steady, long zoom shooting Life doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the elegant PowerShot SD850 IS Digital Elph is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake -- one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. So now even when you\u2019re zooming in tight you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. Just turn it on, it functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nDIGIC III Image Processor with improved Face Detection Technology and Red-eye Correction With DIGIC III, you get images of superior quality, the camera functions at top efficiency and battery life is significantly enhanced. What\u2019s more, DIGIC III enables Canon\u2019s newly improved Face Detection Technology and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the Shutter Button halfway down, and the PowerShot SD850 IS Digital Elph automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. To keep every face looking bright and natural -- without scary red eyes -- the camera controls exposure settings and flash, so every shot is just what you were shooting for. \n\nFind multiple faces with Canon's improved Face Detection technology DIGIC III features Face Detection AF/AE, which finds multiple faces in the frame and sets the most suitable focus point, when the shutter button is pressed halfway. And an additional new feature, Face Detection FE adjusts the flash, based on a person\u2019s face on the screen. Exposure and flash are controlled to ensure proper illumination of both the faces and the overall scene, eliminating the common problem of darkened or overexposed faces. \n\nRed-eye Correction detects and automatically corrects red-eye during playback for both regular and flash photography. In unusual cases where red-eye is not automatically detected, it can easily be corrected manually during playback mode. \n\niSAPS technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nVivid, high-resolution 2.5-inch PureColor LCD The camera\u2019s 2.5-inch LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether you\u2019re shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This extra-durable, high-resolution screen with tough scratch-resistant coating on the anti-reflective, PureColor LCD screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera\u2019s menu functions especially convenient. Clear and bright, it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. \n\nSensitivity range expanded to ISO 1600 The PowerShot SD850 IS Digital Elph features new ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater flexibility for shooting. \n\nISO 80 v. ISO 1600 Creative Light effects, and five movies modes A new Special Scene Mode \"Creative Light Effects\" brings you a new pleasure of capturing night scenes! You can select ant effect before shooting, then it transforms background bright spots to stars, hearts, music notes and more. \n\nShooting movies have also five options. With a highly flexible movie mode, you can create the movie that\u2019s perfect for any application. Select from VGA (640 x 480 pixels) and QVGA (320 x 240 pixels), with frame rates of 30 fps and 15 fps for recording up to 1 hour or 4GB. Also choose from Fast Frame Rate (QVGA; 320 x 240 pixels) recording at 60 fps for up to 1 minute, Compact Movie Mode (QQVGA; 160 x 120 pixels) recording at 15 fps for up to 3 minutes, and Time Lapse (640 x 480) recording at 1 or 2 sec. intervals. The PowerShot SD850 IS Digital Elph supports the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed standard, so you\u2019ll enjoy the fastest possible data transfer speeds when using a USB 2.0 Hi-Speed compatible computer. \n\n18 Shooting Modes including 11 Special Scene Modes  * Auto The camera chooses all the settings so you can concentrate on your subject. \n * Manual The ultimate in creative control, you set ISO speed, exposure compensation and white balance. \n * Color Accent Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome. \n * Color Swap Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects. \n * Digital Macro Shoot larger-than-life close-ups with one-button simplicity. \n * Stitch Assist Build awe-inspiring panoramas by neatly aligning sequential images. \n * Movie Shoot in VGA and QVGA (30 fps/15 fps for up to 1 hour or 4GB), Fast Frame Rate (60 fps for up to 1 minute), QQVGA (15 fps for up to 3 minutes) or Time Lapse (640 x 480 for 1 sec./2 sec. intervals). \n * Portrait The camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject \"pop.\" \n * Foliage Capture brilliant shots of autumn foliage, greenery and blossoms. \n * Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint. \n * Beach Get clear shots of people at a sunny beach without darkened faces. \n * Fireworks Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. \n * Aquarium Achieve proper flash-free exposure and natural hues at indoor aquariums. \n * Underwater Capture underwater images with reduced backscatter effect (Note: Optional Waterproof Case WP-DC15 required for shooting any underwater images). \n * Indoor Reduce blur and improve color accuracy when shooting handheld indoors. \n * Kids & Pets Reduced focusing time freezes fast-moving subjects, so you won\u2019t miss those special shots. \n * Night Snapshot Get natural-looking pictures with brighter backgrounds and subjects lit by flash. \n * Creative Light Effects Transform background bright spots to stars, hearts, music notes and more. \n\nThe Complete Print Solution \n\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading The PowerShot SD850 IS Digital Elph's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD850 IS Digital Elph to a Canon CP, SElphY or PIXMA Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print!
