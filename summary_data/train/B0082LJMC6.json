Three coats of this stuff left a smooth, glossy finish with very little effort. Be sure to wear full protective gear as stated. This stuff is a mix of paint and SuperGlue so eye, lung, skin protection is a MUST. And don't skimp on masking anything you don't want overspray on. Getting it off will be a non starter.",

Once done, don\u2019t touch it for a minimum of 24 hours, 48 is even better. Finally when wet sanding, mix soap into the water and turn or replace the sand paper frequently, and sand with light pressure. Trust my advice.

Do a few light passes, avoiding buildup and running and you will have a perfect finish. Just remember that 90% of painting is in the prep work. Also, don't forget to wear a mask; this stuff is toxic.",
