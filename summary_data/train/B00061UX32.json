Birds being on it doesnt seem to bend it much. When the bottom isn\u2019t attached to something, there is some swaying/bouncing. When the bottom is attached to a bar, there is very little bouncing and no swaying. Seems to withstand some chewing on pretty well. No frays quite yet and one of my birds has been using it as their chew toy as opposed to their actual toys. If you plan on connecting the top and bottom, you will need to buy/have some toy hanger clips on hand.",
