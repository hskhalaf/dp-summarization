Only thing that was nasty, was the sound control unit looked like they ate a bag of Cheetos while using it........Gross As for the operations of the headsets, the verdict is still in session. I have not used them enough to get the best sound out of them. They do sound great, just not sure about the 7.1 thing, as I can't really tell any different. I give them 5 stars for now, if something of interest pops up in the future, I'll come back and update this review",

I sent these back because they didn't sound good after trying two different high-end sound cards, one from Creative and the other from asus. Honestly just get a traditional headset and use software to create 7.1 surround.",

First, the shape of the headstrap is slightly uncomfortable during long play sessions, and the headset is pretty heavy and surely noticable while being worn. Overall, I would reccommend this headset to any and everyone including gamers, audiophiles, streamers, and movie buffs, this is truly a fantastic headset.",

Between the amp and headset the cable braiding split and the cable slipped out. It has since kinked and all left audio has failed.

The quality is good, but it is VERY quiet. Perhaps I've missed a few options to boost it more (yes, I've used microphone boost etc). Any ways, great headset, great sound, HIGHLY recommend a sound card though. Oh! Also very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.",
