The cross grain cut picture despite it looks like planed it is not, it is just right after cut, just incredible.",

Very thin \"razor\" blade with rip teeth on one side and crosscut on the other. This is a versatile saw and the long handle allows me to use both hands/arms once the blade is started into the wood. It produces a very fine cut edge and thin kerf. The face of the cut is remarkably smooth after a pass through the wood. It is a wonderful addition to my woodshop.",

After learning how to use the saw properly, I am now able to make cuts as square as I can measure without having to drag out extension cords and whatnot required for electrical saws. It's great for cutting the little edge blocks off of tenons: crosscut down, flip the blade around, rip cut over and done. Cheap replacement blades are a real time saver.

      "text": "This is a two-sided Japanese style \"pull\" saw, with a crosscut pattern on one side and a rip pattern on the other. The theoretical advantage of Japanese \"pull\" saws is that, since you are \"pulling\" the blade to cut, the saw doesn't have to be made as thick as a western \"push\" saw in order to resist being bent while in use. That means the wood cut (kerf) is narrower so there is less resistance to cutting, and the cut is more accurate. I ripped an 8-foot piece of lumber with less trouble and effort than a traditional western saw. Amazing product. Fair warning: You can't sharpen Japanese blades, you can only replace them.",

Once you get used to it, pulling is nice in that you aren't worried about blade flex on the cut stroke. This saw cuts through wood like butter. There's a definite difference in the performance of the crosscut and rip cut blades.",

The blade is extremely sharp. The handle is long and makes cutting straight and even much easier. Only thing I'd change is a longer blade. It's definitely designed for rough cutting boards to length or ripping boards to AK estimate width. Does not work with with most fine joinery work. Well worth the money!",
