Substandard material. Very light weight, but too light weight material. Better off just getting a stand and placing a top on the stand and getting a portable grill. That's what we had to do at the last minute. Would like a refund due to the faulty cheaply made product. For this kind of money you should get something a lot nicer.",

It was easy to assemble (coming from a guy who hates to assemble things) is easy to setup on the boat, and stores directly underneath one of the chairs. Looking forward to many great cookouts this summer! As an aside: A friend purchased a similar grill and tried to mount it on one of the railings - overhanging the water. It ended with the grill at the bottom of the lake. So I recommend NOT mounting on the raining and sticking with the post inside the boat - assuming you have a pontoon for this.",

If you leave theirs in as your running the boat water comes up through it unless you go really slow. 2, After you cook and let it cool down it;s very hard to take the pole out from the base of the grill. 3, It cooks alright and the only thing I have to say is it all fits into the inside of the grill after use",
