Classic comfort, looks, fit, and durability were among the highlights of this exceptional turf trainer. There\u2019s just one caveat; the cleat runs too large. But even that flaw was deemed to be an advantage for wide-footed players. From amateurs to professionals, this is one vintage turf cleat that is undeniably worth the buy; even soccer old-timers just can\u2019t get enough of it.",

      "text": "Classic football shoe for artificial pitches. A must for anyone with wide feet or high arches. I wear 3/4 length arch supports and these are the only shoes I could find which allow a comfortable fit and playing experience. They are not the quickest of shoes and have a wide sole and fairly rigid sides so suit a more measured and considered style of play. I can still run around quite happily in them and the sides are a good soft leather which allows for movement of the foot and takes the pressure off the little toes. Highly recommended if any of the above is important to you.",

UPDATED to 1 star since after 3 months the sole of the left shoe has completely split from the rest. I'm a moderate user (twice a week for 1 hour), expected better, cannot recommend buying this.",
