      "text": "I've used this on several outings now. This bag plus an ultralight bag rated for 60\u00b0 F got me through a 17\u00b0 night under a tarp lean to. It wasn't cozy and warm but it wasn't miserable. I was able to sleep. This wasn't a survival situation. I had access to a warmer sleeping bag, I simply didn't need it. My big gripe with this bag is that it's too short and too narrow! I'm over 6' and around 200 lb. My shoulders don't fit and the bag is so short that the hood is completely useless! This is straight up BS! THEY NEED TO MAKE A BAG FOR GROWN MEN!",

I don't think it would last 3-4 months on the PCT though for every night use, it says escape on it for a reason. I think it was 42 degrees F, and I kept warm all night. I have to say though, my body is like a furnace when I am sleeping, lol. This doesn't get wet inside like then normal bivvy's do. Do yourself a favor and buy this one over anything else, it is worth the gamble. Love it, and recommend it to anyone!",

You won\u2019t get overly hot with it but it pairs well with a summer weight sleeping bag for spring and fall use. I could easily roll it up and put it back in the provided carry bag and it does not weigh much. I might purchase the lite bivvy sometime for a comparison but I preferred the green color. Overall I recommend this for those who use/test the products they use for prepping. It does not replace a real sleeping bag but is a fair substitute or extra insurance on colder nights.",
