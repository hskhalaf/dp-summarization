The cover is just the right weight to keep the box in place while pulling. I love bamboo. It's the most awesome grass around. A great looking product, great functionality, and for a great price. I haven't tested the \"hiding spot\" functionality, but I can see how it may be legit. I only wish it was also available in other colors. A darker stain would fit some of my other furniture better.",
