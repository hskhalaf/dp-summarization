I barely used it and was stored in a soft case. I'm OCD and take care of everything I own as carefully as possible. It's been sitting on my shelf for over 3 years now. No use of it. Would not buy any Nikon product again. Ended up purchasing Sony NEX5 and love it. Traveled with it to Siberia and used it at -70 degree temp and it worked unbelievably great.",

I wasn't thrilled with being camera-less myself though so I went for a more pocketable point and shoot. It's been a nice camera and does a serviceable job. It keeps a charge and takes pretty good pictures. The only downside is on full auto it still requires tweaking the exposure compensation to get the best picture. If you want a purely auto hands off point and shoot that takes great pictures this might not be the camera for you, but if you don't mind tweaking things here and there it's a great little camera.",

This thing takes great photos, regardless of what I throw at it, low light, which thing to focus on, it's automatic mode rarely guesses wrong. The colors are so true that I almost never need to touch them up. The super sharp large monitor is great, too! Definitely would highly recommend for both the amateur and more serious photographer!",

I have been watching this Nikon S8100 for quite a few months because of its sensor technology, nice lens for compact and macro capability. I bought this S8100 for my family and persuaded a friend to buy one too, after I played with one at BestBuy. It is very fast to lock focus. The scene recognition is pretty smart and the flash photo indoor is very decent quality. Not to mention the HD video capability.

I'm pleased with the performance even though I haven't printed any pictures on photo paper yet. My only complaint so far is that the flash is a little bit of a pain because sometimes it's not automatic, but you get used to it. I would recommend buying this camera at about $250 or so.

Also, after 2 months the lens cover stopped opening when we turned on the power rendering the camera unusable.

      "text": "The camera has a very quick start up-to-first shot time. Also, the time between shots is very quick. Both take about a second. The flash does pop up where you normally hold it but if your finger is in the way, it tell you about it and can still take the picture. You just get use to holding the camera slightly differently. It is not a big change and not a deal breaker by any means. Overall, a very good camera.",

The first was the L810, I didn't like that one because my images were getting scrambled when i used the review function so I was pissed but decided to give Nikon a second chance and bought the S8100. owned this camera for roughly 3 months and now its not working I keep getting a lens error and the camera has never been dropped. Sometimes it comes on and won't even show anything on the screen. Straight garbage i won't buy another Nikon product any time soon.",

I gave it to her on the first day of our family vacation so she would have the option of continuing to use her expensive/bulky Canon camera or I would give her 'cash' (and I would keep the camera). Darn...she fell in love with it's size, quality and ease of use. She took the camera to the slopes, snowmobiling and all around town. After a week in Pagosa Springs, she had taken over 150 pictures that we viewed on the tv on our last day of our vacation. Nice camera...great pictures...we all loved it!",

It could be a GREAT camera with the following: variable speed zoom, manual aperatue and manual shutter speed, and a viewfinder for those sunny days. Instead, it is a nice looking but fairly vanilla point and shoot. The zoom is nice. I don't mind the slighly large size. I don't mind the flash position that everyone seems to dislike. The macro is fantastic in camera and movie mode and I would say that plus the zoom are the camera's best features. Come on -- please --somebody build a high quality small format for the days the SLR can't go! Today, I am sending to repair shop - lens will not retract!?!?",
