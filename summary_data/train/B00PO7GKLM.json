I\u2019m noticing that my skin has become darker. Overall, it doesn\u2019t work for my skin. Time to try something else. Update: The seller is nice to enough to contact me right after the review and offered 100% refund. I wasn\u2019t expecting that. Since they stand behind their product, maybe you should go ahead and give it a try. Nothing to lose here.",

If you're using Benzoyl Peroxide on your skin, I would definitely recommend trying Humane. While Humane is not overly drying compared to other Benzoyl Peroxide, remember to use a moisturizer (I use CeraVe) after washing with it.",

This one is stronger than most, but I like that it is a wash and not a serum you keep on your skin. If your skin can tolerate it and you have acne prone skin I'd recommend this product, its helped me a lot!",

The only problem I have with it is that it makes my skin very dry, so I need to apply moisturizer after getting out of the shower. However, I consider this a small price to pay for clear skin.",
