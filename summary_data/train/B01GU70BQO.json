      "text": "Excellent shoes with a nice look (in my opinion). I play basketball 3 to 4 times per week. Twice per week in local city league and twice in open gym pickup games. The shoes definitely had a supportive feel with cushioned support. Nike's seem to have a thinner feel to bottom of the shoe so these are a welcome change. I would give them 5 stars but they lost that new feel around the ankle portion in rough 3 weeks. I know the pros turn their shoes over more often (easily within 30 days) but I don't think that should be required for full support.",
