      "text": "For this price- I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these speakers. Low expectations lead to positive results I guess, but really- for this price, I'm impressed. Not only do I have no complaints, I still can't believe they sound as good as they do. No they aren't killer audiophile grade speakers, but they are marine grade and sound every bit as good as any average speaker, but way below average on price. The value here simply can't be beat.",
