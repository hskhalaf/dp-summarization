A spare charger is $35! These guys have lost their minds to charge this much for NOTHING! If they don\u2019t go bankrupt i hope version 2.0 has 10 hour battery life.",

The battery lasts longer if you\u2019re using it to maintain a hot temperature, but once it gets to the point it has to reheat coffee the batter is drained in 20mins. I love the idea, I just wish it held a charge.",
