That being said, this is still the best fitting strapless bra I\u2019ve found in my size range. I\u2019m pretty sure I can buy a band extender rather than search another 8 years looking for one that fits as close! Also, at $17, this is a freaking steal.",

A note on CK's size chart: according to it I should've been a 34A, which surprised me as I'm currently a 32C in all my other bras, including CK. Sometimes sizing can be weird with strapless, so I tried the 34A along with 34B, 32B & 32C, and the latter was the closest to fitting. So my advice is to ignore their chart, start with your regular bra size and go from there.",

I wear a 30C size bra and it's nearly impossible to find that size in brick-and-mortar stores who seem to think 32\" bands are the smallest women need. I'm delighted to see that Amazon carries 28\" and 30\" band sizes! This Calvin Klein bra fits wonderfully and comfortably without slipping. No gaps and no double breasts! My twins feel nicely supported in this bra.",

I wore the new bra a couple of times but no rashes at all. Based on this experience, I have concluded that the first bra I bought must have some weird chemical in the silicone liner on the right side that caused the rashes. Not happy with it!",
