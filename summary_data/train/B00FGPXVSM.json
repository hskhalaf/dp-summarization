It has been in the water, underwater, in rain and continues to preform. Shake the water out and keep on cooking. For the price you really cant go wrong. We ditched the bulky case and just toss this on the kayaks and go. A can of butane mixture lasts a good while. We go for 2-3 days at a time and bring two cans with extra at the end of the trip. Great little stove at a great price point.",

Seems the butane froze in the entry point. Had to put in warm shack to thaw put before could use again. Will have to use my propane coleman for frigid cold weather. Otherwise, this is a great compact stove. Could use higher heat as it does start off slow. But once the pan is hot and cooking, it works great! Cant wait to use this stove during camping in spring and summer months!",

But this stove gets hot fast and I usually was done cooking in so short a time that the butane cans are economical. Just follow the instructions printed on the stove itself. No match necessary. Lightly built but that's all it really needs to be.",

I feel like this stove will last a while and its case is pretty solid too. The only part that is a bit off is the cover for the butane canister. It doesnt stay closed very well and flops open sometimes.",

I set the lever to disconnect the butane can so the system is not pressurized when stored in the case. The ignition system works every-time. I use it only to heat water in a kettle for different uses: coffee, hot water, oatmeal. Very happy with this purchase.",
