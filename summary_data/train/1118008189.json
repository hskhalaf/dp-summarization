The author has done very well in explaining conceptually and with practical application and use of the development process and understanding syntax of HTML and CSS. Love it! I still occasionally reference it when I need to touch base with the fundamentals again. but i have let several friends borrow this book to learn coding. I would recommend to have it in your library as a go to resource and learning tool.",

There are plenty of clearly coded examples, as well as the source code for the examples in the book online. After working through courses in Swift, Python and C++, I wanted to study web design and management. I think I am getting well versed in the coding necessary to do that (PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery).",
