Had issues with the charging case not disconnecting the earbuds, and not charging them either. Possible mine were defective but I was so displeased I put them in a drawer and totally forgot about them, missed my return window",

However, in reality, the product is much bigger than it looks on the video. It is just massively sticking out of the ears. Also, and that could be personal, one of the earphones does not fit my ear with any combination of the sets provided. So, I constantly have to put it back in. With the same price as Apple, I expected to have a similar product but I was wrong. Bad buy.",

First, it drops pairing a lot. I had to put back into the case and reset it at least once every day. Second, it went out of sync every time I turn my head for no reason. Either left or right earbud briefly muted then resumed. It annoyed me so much because I used it in the gym. Not sure if it's because my phone doesn't have Bluetooth 5.0. But overall, I'm slightly disappointed.",

Sound is pretty good although quiet and the charging case holds a long charge which is convenient but I purchased these mostly for the Bluetooth 5.0 where I hoped better connectivity but I still can't walk with my phone in my pocket without it cutting out. Also they don't always pair when you take them out and it's awkward knowing when to have to manually turn them on. This is the only product I have ever not considered 5 stars from Anker which I do think is a fantastic company, I just don't know how these ended up falling so short.",
