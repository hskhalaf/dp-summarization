Tack sharp, brilliant color, gorgeously round bokeh. Yes, it's a heavy monster -- definitely not a 'walk around' lens like my trusty 24-70mm -- but it's the 'big gun' you break out when doing somebody's headshot in a studio. I've attached a couple sample photos (including a self-portrait) done on my Alpha 7 II camera (attached via the EAL4 adapter to this lens).",

Photos taken in compressed RAW, touched up lightly in Lightroom, and exported to JPG.

    "description": "Whether you need a large aperture to shoot in low light, a suitable shutter speeds for shooting action or creative control of background defocusing, the 135mm lens will reward you with stunning resolution and contrast where it counts. In addition to portraits and landscapes, this focal length is a good choice for indoor sports. Featuring Carl Zeiss T* coating and built-in image stabilization, this lens will make it easier than ever to capture crisp images.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nSONNAR T* 135MM F1.8 ZA TELEPHOTO ZOOM LENS\nWhether you need a large aperture to shoot in low light, a suitable sutter speeds for shooting action or creative control of background defocusing, the 135mm lens will reward you with stunning resolution and contrast where it counts. In addition to portraits and landscapes, this focal length is a good choice for indoor sports. Featuring Carl Zeiss T* coating and built-in image stabilization, this lens will make it easier than ever to capture crisp images.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nCIRCULAR APERTURE\nWhen changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. \u03b1 lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.\n\nED (EXTRA-LOW DISPERSION) GLASS\nAs focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.\n\nCARL ZEISS T* (T-STAR) COATING\nCoated optics were pioneered by Carl Zeiss - and this superb lens features the Carl Zeiss T* (T-Star) coating that virtually eliminates lens flare, internal reflection and light scattering that can otherwise occur at glass-to-air surfaces. The T* coating contributes to outstanding image quality, with high contrast and uniformly excellent resolution right out to the image edges. Not simply applied to any lens - the T* symbol only appears on multi-element lenses in which the required performance has been achieved throughout the entire optical path, therefore guaranteeing the highest quality.\n\nFOCUS HOLD BUTTON\nOnce you\u2019ve adjusted focus to where you want it, pressing this button on the lens barrel will keep the lens locked to that focusing distance. The preview function can also be assigned to this button through the camera\u2019s custom settings.\n\nDISTANCE ENCODER\nThe distance encoder plays an integral part in ADI flash metering, which delivers high precision flash metering that is unaffected by the reflectance of subjects or backgrounds. The distance encoder is a lens component that directly detects the position of the focusing mechanism, and sends a signal to the CPU in order to measure distance to the subject. During flash photography, this data is very useful in calculating how much flash output is appropriate to the scene.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nINTERNAL FOCUSING\nOnly the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if you\u2019re using a polarizing filter.\n\n\n2008 Sony Electronics, Inc.\n\nAll rights reserved.
