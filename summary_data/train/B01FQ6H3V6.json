      "text": "These are hockey pucks, they are black and hard (especially after they are on ice). If you suck they make a nice (ding) sound when they hit a post. If you have a backyard rink you may as well buy 24 because you will lose them all in the snow in the first hour. I also used a router on one so that I could use it to protect my pinch welds while jacking up cars. Yes, they smell...they are a solid chunk of rubber...they are not made from flowers or exotic dancers so they will be a bit strong smelling (actually I've smelled a few strippers that smelled worse).",

We play higher tier adult league and these pucks are almost totaled. Some are missing chunks out of them and some are even starting to show signs of cracking. Not sure if we had a bad batch or these arent very durable. Overall for the price they are okay if you are just using them for practice and firing them around.",

They do have a strong \"new rubber\" smell as other reviewers have pointed out, but they are in my garage and the smell goes away after a while.
