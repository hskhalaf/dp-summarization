You'd think that this was my first tablet. Everything feels snappy. I take an action and get an instant response. Haven't ran into any snags. The S-Pen is on point as far as I can tell & it doesn't need to be charged. Also, it came a day early & in perfect condition.",

They both were absolutely perfect and like new in every way except the box. I have recommended Klamp many times and will continue to do so. The tablet itself is great. The specs speak for themselves. I would say the finish is beautiful but slippery. If you are like me I would get a case to help prevent dropping.",

Nothing fixed it, returning it today and buying new. Don\u2019t waste your money on this refurbished junk.",

Highly recommend ordering this. It's $200 less than the brand new one but the same exact quality. You can go wrong with this deal. My tablet has no issues, no scratches or chips, and looks flawless. Lastly, the only gripe I have is that the tablet was loose inside the box and could've been knocked around a little bit during shipment. But don't let that stop you from ordering,ine has no issues whatsoever.",
