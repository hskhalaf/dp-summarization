Since adding this sponge to my beauty routine, I have far fewer breakouts, my pores seem almost invisible, and the skin tone is much more even especially around my nose and chin. I had rather prominent melasma spots on my cheeks from pregnancy that lingered for a few years, and using this almost daily has reduced (but not eliminated) them. It's surprisingly gentle, so it's kind of hard to believe that it does anything, let alone so much. One sponge usually lasts 2 months for me before losing effectiveness.",
