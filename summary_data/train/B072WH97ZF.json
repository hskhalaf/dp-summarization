I started with Dr.Axe\u2019s powders, which are great, but leave a strange after taste. This stuff tastes a lot better! The chocolate flavor is good and isn\u2019t overbearing. It also mixes better in the blender. Overall a really great option to try.",

Even the dang lumps sometimes form a lumpy film around each lump and on the spoon, as well. Horrible. Too late to return (don't even know if I could this being an edible item). Whoever makes this needs to reformulate it. This is not cheap either. Not worth the effort of mixing and mixing and mixing. Frustrating!",
