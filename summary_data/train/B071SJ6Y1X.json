      "text": "This review is for the Mummy Sleeping Bag colored orange. This is perfect for camping. It is really light weight and fit right in my pack. It was able to be strapped under or on top of the pack as well. As for the temperature, it keeps you very warm. I had to open up the easy to zip zipper to cool down in 35\u00b0f weather. Packing and rolling it up is a cake walk. The bag also has straps to shrink down the bag ever more to make more room for other things. The orange color can signal others in case of an emergency. I love everything about this sleeping bag. Thanks again!",

The weather didn't go too low so I didn't get to test their resiliance in the cold. However, they were light and easy to pack and unpack and very comfortable. Zippers seemed high quality and easy to operate. My only quibble is that they are a bit narrow and I found myself wanting a little more width, but all in all, for the cost these seem to be great. The cinch sack that comes in addition to the compression sack is great and I was able to compress this sucker pretty small. Great.",

Neither Amazon or the seller directly will allow this. ,The description still says (as of 1/15) that no return is necessary for a refund. I recycled the packaging when it came because of this, so I don't have the means to return it - at least not without paying for it myself. Truly surprised Amazon would allow this to happen.",

Any cooler and you should expect to be getting uncomfortably cold unless you put on more layers. The compression bag allows it to get pretty compact and is definitely a plus for saving space. My only complaint: the draw strings on the hood are right at face level, get in the way, and are annoying despite not even cinching the opening very well. Hopefully the manufacturer can move them downward or to another location that is out of the way.",

For dirt haters like me, the \"tent\" attachment that keeps the opening protected is a cool feature that I have never seen before. We have only opened the heavier one so far, but it's substantial, feels very warm, and designed well. The double-sided zipper works fine. I do think the stitching could have been done a tad bit better, but we aren't planning to do really heavy-duty camping so I think this should work fine. And the price point really cannot be beat.",

Disappointed, to say the least, but I'm going to exchange it and update my review once I find out whether the product was defective or just poor quality. For a product that boasts a \"quality\" zipper in its description, not too impressed.",

Bought it for a backpacking trip where we knew it would be down to 40. Got one for my wife and one for me. We both froze our butts off. We even planned ahead and bought liners but it was not good enough. Ignore the temp rating. It is a classic mummy bag design so it is tight around the shoulders, hips, and legs. The zipper is only a 2/3 zipper.",

I never had any problems with the zipper and feel that it is a quality product. The compression bag works very well at reducing the bag so it would fit in my pack's sleeping bag compartment. However, the bag originally came in a small black carrying bag that then went inside the compression bag. I've never been able to get the sleeping bag back into that tiny black bag, but it works just fine in the compression bag only.",
