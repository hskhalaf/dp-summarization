      "text": "I have purchased these a total of 3 times!! Awesome shoes. These converted me from being an Asics runner to a Saucony runner. Comfortable, durable, true-to-size, these running shoes are lightweight without sacrificing comfort/padding. The sole is soft and offers great support. These can take 400-500 miles before needing to be replaced, though the outer fabric may look worn before that time comes. Very satisfied with these shoes.",

      "text": "My go-to shoe for running. Moderate support shoe with low rise heal, ideal for forefoot or mid foot runners looking for a bit of support against over pronation. I switched to this shoe after running barefoot or minimal for a few years. My ankle prefers the pronation support. The foam midsole is not over cushioned, which I prefer. It is stable and gives good ground feel. Low rise allows more of a natural forefoot or mid foot strike. Only drawback to these shoes is the minimal approach to rubber on the tread tends to limit their lifespan, but on the other hand they are very lightweight.",

Heel to toe offset is 4mm, and there is good arch support from the removable footbed. Ample padding lines the collar and tongue. I would rate the flexibility as slightly below average, but it presented no problem in comfort level. If you are a runner, which, at this age I am not, you will be happy with the cushioning and stability of the Mirage 4. The sole appears to be fabricated of durable materials. Lacing is standard with \"throwback\" flat laces. Al-in-all, definitely worth the price.",

I have a narrow foot and these feel like they should serve me well. I doubt they'll last as long for me as the Mirage 2 did - a year and a half.
