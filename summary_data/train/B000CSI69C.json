It states the box is 8.72\" wide x 10.88\" tall. Ours was 8\" wide x 10\" tall. We bought it specifically believing an average medium-sized box, such as a USPS Medium Flat Rate Box, would fit, but they do not. If the actual size was what they claim, it would do perfectly. We instead had to buy the next size up, which is almost absurdly large, but we do like it a lot and would recommend it if you send or receive a lot of small or medium-sized packages.",

I then attached the mailbox to the post (a metal pipe sandwiched between 2x4s) using inexpensive, heavy duty shelving braces. A quick and easy installation. The Gibraltar is well constructed and very solid. I am happy with it and I know the postal lady appreciates the size because it is easier for her to place the frequent small boxes that I receive, and less trips to my door.",

The glossy black finish to this box is an upgrade to the rustic matte black one I originally had. Even nature decided to review my new mailbox, because not only 15 minutes of swapping it out, two bird turds were on top.",

My old mailbox just fit the smallest A1 Amazon box, this one easily hold an A3 Amazon box. Also the color matches my shutters, so win-win for me. There are plenty of pre-drilled holes for mounting and the simple latch works fine and is adjustable.",
