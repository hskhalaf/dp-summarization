      "text": "I've only put about 50 miles on this bike. So far, it is great. I've only ridden hybrid bikes in the past, but this is so much smoother and easier to ride I'm glad I bought it. I was looking for something to commute to work once a week (25 mile round trip), but didn't want to spend more than 500-600 dollars. I even tuned it up myself using videos on youtube and it shifts beautifully. Brakes aren't bad, despite some reviews I read. Shipped for free with Amazon Prime, I'm out the door for $429. Highly recommend for someone on the fence that doesn't want to drop huge money.",

Was able to keep up on club rides, and with friends on their Cannondales, and Pinarellos. Only replaced the pedals. It's been a great entry level bike! Just got new tires to save weight. Side note: last year they had the white, and red color scheme for the Libero. Which was much more attractive.",

      "text": "I ~probably~ ordered the bike one size too large, but I'm adjusting... Assembly was easy, and once it was tuned up & adjusted by a local shop, works quite well. The shifting mechanism is very different from anything I had before, but easy to get used to after a bit. Only real complaint I have is the lack of 'inner' break handles, forcing you to always lean forward in urban areas where traffic requires sudden breaking to slow down or stop completely. If that's a concern, I'd recommend another bike or (as I now am) plan to replace. In rural areas, however, this isn't really a problem; If my riding was 100% rural, I'd have gone full 5-stars.",

I've only had it a month, but here are some components you'll want to address: Brakes=suck. The pads hit the rim at an odd angle...look to replace. The seat=formally a torture devise in the Spanish civil war. Seriously. Spend an hour on this baby and you'll be speaking in tongues. It is not adjustable...look to replace.

(may want new handlebar too.) 2) Chainrings are cheap stamped, riveted crap, and heavier than necessary. Dump it as soon as able. otherwise a fine deal and I am happy thus far.",

The only problem I have is the front derailer shifter part grinds on the chain, I've tried adjusting it but can't get it right. Also the foot pegs are pretty cheap. Other than that the tires have been good so far, brakes aren't as bad as other reviews claim, they could be a lot worse. The integrated shifter are also awesome! I highly recommend this bike over ANY entry level bike and even some bikes in the $500-$800 range.",

It is easy to put together and is absolutely fun to ride. I have already gotten myself some upgrades (tires, tubes, pedals) because this bike has kept me interested in the sport.",

I made two changes (saddle and peddles) to please me since I was too lazy to get use to what the bike had on it.",

I've NOT had any mechanical issues or problems of any sort. One concern I did have, but just put to rest was the upgradability of the bike. Not a problem. I've just had the bottom bracket changed out to accept Shimano 105 Group set and changed the crank and chainrings to Shimano 105 (5075? I think) For under $400.00 and not know if I'd stick to cycling, it's been great. Definitely recommend.",

In assembly, they had switched the cables for the front brakes and the gear shifter, making both inoperable. Needless to say, it made the bicycle unrideable and dangerous. While I am sure this defect does not occur on every bike, it does not instill confidence in the manufacturer or their quality control. I will give credit to Amazon, though - the return process went smoothly and my refund appeared in my account the same morning I dropped off the box at a UPS store.",
