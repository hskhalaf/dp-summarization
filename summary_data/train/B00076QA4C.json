      "text": "Worked great in a 2016 Subaru Outback. Please note that I did have to drill holes and install the screws. In my vehicle I had to install the clips/hooks. Per the directions, I cleaned the car plastic with alcohol and then pressed the hooks in the locations that I wanted. The temperature was above 70 degrees and left it for 24 hours. The next day I hooked on the net to the hooks and one of the hooks popped off immediately. I certainly would not trust the adhesive backing only to hold anything. So, I then carefully drilled holes and installed the screws. It worked perfect and is very secure.",

The Challenger has a larger trunk, although no real place to \"organize\" anything and this gets the job done.
