The dot grid lines up fine (saw complaints about that on a different book when researching, not a problem here), and the pages are nice and thick. Minimal ghosting and I only have bleeding a tiny bit when I color. Fountain pens do feather a little, but very minimal ghosting and no bleed (unless coloring), so I can live with that. Overall I'm really loving the books and will definitely buy more in the future.",

(But then again shading and fast dry times are opposing design goals) On the other hand : you'll never have to worry about smearing what you just wrote or bother with blotter paper. Really my only issue is that due to the thickness of the pages it's impossible to to lay the notebook flat, especially towards the middle. There will be always that curve on either side of the binding that you can't use without holding the pen at awkward angles.",

The new notebooks I purchased in May 2020 for the same price have a non waxed completely different feeling cover and one of the corners was already bent on arrival. Disappointed that Northbooks cheapened the cardstock cover. It seems like it will not hold up and look presentable with use. I will not buy this version again",

That's my main complaint. Plus I miss the ribbon bookmarks and other amenities in the Leuchtturm. So I'll be shelling out the extra money for that purchase next time.",

The dot grid was evenly printed on each page and there was surprisingly no bleed-through and very little ghosting with Lamy ink. I appreciated the tearaway pages in the back. Per personal preference I'll stick to hardcovers from now on, but if you're in the market for a softcover notebook these are excellent.",

However, only the last 20 pages or so are perforated. What good does that do me when I wanted a notebook with tear out pages for note-taking? I'm giving them to my boyfriend. Disappointed.",

I tested out the paper with a fine nib fountain pen and blue ink. There was no feathering or bleed through to the back of the page. Next order will be for a 2-pack as the pricing is considerably lower per notebook when purchasing two. I would recommend it to a friend - it's a good notebook at a value price.",

There is no bleed-through, but as another customer mentioned there is some very faint shadowing (I use Staedtler Triplus Fineliners to write in my notebook). I find that the pages are perfect for its use and is not too thick and not too thin. The book is very lightweight and simple, but I cannot speak for its durability as I have had it for only a month. Overall, I am very happy with Northbooks and will most likely purchase again.",
