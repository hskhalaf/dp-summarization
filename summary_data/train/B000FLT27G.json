PROs - Keeps beverages really cold, not sure what type of insulation it has but it has kept my drinks cold for long periods of time. It is easy to put on and the adjustable straps are nice. The hood for Yoda is functional. Priced very well. CONs - It is not very large. Fits a few things like two 24 oz beverages. I just wish it had one or two more pockets, it just has one big one. No laptops but definitely a pad or whatever. Overall - I would definitely recommend this backpack if you like starwars or just cool things in general.",

The straps adjusted easily but you have to hold down one of his arms so his face will appear over your shoulder if you want to take pictures with it. Otherwise he looks like he's just hanging onto your back. Still great for any star wars fan to have.",
