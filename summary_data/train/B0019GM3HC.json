      "text": "Bought this kit as a birthday present for my seven year old son. He absolutely loved the game and within 10 minutes of arriving at a local park, he had assembled a little posse of kids and they were involved in an epic game of capture the flag. The belts were easy for the kids to attach themselves and the flags have the right amount of give, strong enough that they don't fall off too easily and not flimsy. The cones are pretty useless, they are very small and if the grass is in any way long, they are obscured. This however is not a reason not to buy, just substitute them for taller cones.",

I find the Velcro flag to be much better than a lot of the \"detachable belt\" capture the flag.

The Velcro for each flag is very sturdy along with the stitching that holds it together. The flag material is very strong. Belts have simple loop system that holds up well. All the kids loved it, most even said they wish their community flag football sets were as nice. The only thing that could've been nicer is bigger cones, but that was a very minor item.",

The belts are easy to put on and the Velcro attachments can move along the belt to be better positioned for all size kids. The belt straps are a little long (assuming this is to accommodate adults), so we have to do some extra looping so my 4 year old doesn't trip on it. The cones that come in the package are small - I recommend purchasing additional cones. Overall, a good product that provides lots of backyard fun!",

The closure is easy to strap on and when the kids pull the flags, only the flags come off....not the entire belt which we had had in the past!! The cones are teeny tiney and worthless.",
