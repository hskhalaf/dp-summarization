Now that one has died, have used it maybe 5 or 6 times. No warning of low battery, so when you're in a crunch and have no time to look for keys, and the battery dies, it defeats the purpose.

I solved this by looping a rubberband through the keyring of the locator, then wrapping the rubberband around the TV remote.

I tried another color. That one worked better. Maybe the first was a doozy. Either way, you get what you pay for. Update 1/17/19 - The company reached out to me directly and offered a replacement. The new item works just fine. This one worked from throughout my two-story row home. Great customer service.",

Some limitations with distance and intervening walls, just like your WI-Fi so don't expect it to work from outside the house, the yard etc. Just test it to set its limits. Worked well for me, so I got one for my mother. She misplaces her wallet/change purse all the time and she gets upset when she cannot find it. She is in Greece and the construction is concrete and bricks with stucco on the walls, so I don't know how it will work there. I'll update when she tells me.",

Beeper is loud enough that you can hear it if you're within range, but it's not loud enough to scare our cat when it goes off. Overall, very happy with the product!",
