It was smaller than I expected and I filled it 2-3 times with strong essences like Frankincense and got no noticeable difference in my car or home. Perhaps it is not strong enough to diffuse the heavier oils, like citrus, etc. The water tank is also way too small. I got a Radha diffuser instead (read third party reviews to find) which has great reviews on Amazon and THOUSANDS of them; it also has a full 17 oz water chamber and can run 10-17 hours at a time. Best part? Now I can SMELL the oils that I put in it!",
