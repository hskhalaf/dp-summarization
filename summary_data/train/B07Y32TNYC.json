The preinstalled windows 10 pro worked great right out of the box. No messing around with disks and drivers. Startup each time is instant from sleep mode, and super quick from complete shut off. I like the keyboard, touchpad, and touchscreen on this laptop. I also really love with the fingerprint sensor. Who knew how convenient that could be! Laptop also arrived quickly (ordered on Sunday, arrived Wednesday) All in all, this was just a great experience. I am very happy.",

I probably won't use the touch screen much. The real test of this machine's utility- will be when I install the new Moicrosoft Flight Simulator 2020 on it in a few weeks.
