I also like the easy mounting using the screw holes in the four corners versus other boards that have mounting tabs or hardware (much easier this way in my opinion). The only thing I don't particularly like is the unfinished edges (the channel between the two aluminum frame pieces is open. I saw this in the product photos before I ordered, so I was aware and I admit I will rarely look at it from the sides. Other than my personal minor cosmetic point, these are a great deal.",

I took a lot of time to review similar products on Amazon before deciding to choose this one. Most of the other products had similar issues in terms of being damaged when the product was received. This particular product did not seem to have those kind of issues and hence I ended up ordering this board. Maybe there are some fake reviews for this one that give it a higher rating than it should have..",

      "text": "As noted by other reviewers there was damage to the frame during shipping due to poor packaging. I was initially willing to let this slide as it was fairly minor. However, when I tried to remove the protective film is stuck along all of the edges. The result is that there are bits of film sticking from all but one of the edges.",
