      "text": "Bought this to replace a 25 year old brass faucet set. Getting to the valves can be quite a challenge or expensive so most/many people will be just replacing these parts like our old brass trim. You must determine which style valves you have to have everything you need for installation. You may need an adapter kit, which I did. Get the right adapter and understand how to cut the plastic pieces to allow the handles to sit snug to the tub surround surface. If you do that, you will have an attractive installation at a reasonable price. Moen support was helpful in getting the job done correctly.",

This was pretty noticeable when I opened the package and the materials were stewn about and smudged with fingerprints. Did not receive the required shanks (Moen 106378) but instead was provided other shanks and miscellaneous parts thrown in by the original purchaser. I wouldn't have given the bad review but this morning I tried to reach out to Moen to rectify and ran into further issues. Support hours stated in instructions state Sat 8 - 6:30. When I called them, the cheerful lady on the recording indicated they were closed on Saturday. So, overall a very bad experience with this product.",

Good thing I did because the bag holding the parts I needed to install the valve handles was torn open and the parts were indeed gone along with the faucet indexing pin and the o-ring lube packet. Thank you previous reviewers for saving me alot of trouble. Kind of makes me wonder if there was a factory seal on the box to prevent using products on the shelf for needed parts, if there was it was gone too.",

This faucet features a high arc swan like spout and two convenient petal like lever handles that give you control of water temperature and flow. The faucet is compatible with the Moen M PACT valve system that makes it easy to update your trim kit without touching the plumbing, and features a LifeShine brushed nickel finish that resists flaking and corroding for the lifetime of the faucet. With a transitional design and backed by Moen's Limited Lifetime Warranty, the Moen Eva Two Handle High Arc Roman Tub Faucet adds a classic touch to any three hole bath. *Moen Two Handle Roman Tub Valve sold separately.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nOffering an elegant, transitional design that gives today's home timeless appeal, the Moen Eva collection's tapered, sophisticated lines will never go out of style.

Install any of Moen's M\u2013Pact-compatible faucets once, and you can upgrade the style at any point in the decorating or construction process--or switch style years down the road--without replacing any faucet plumbing. All changes can be made above the deck or in front of the wall.\n\nWARRANTY\nThis Moen Eva is backed by a limited lifetime warranty against leaks, drips and finish defects to the original consumer purchaser. For commercial installations, it's backed by a 5-year limited warranty.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nMoen Eva Roman tub faucet, installation instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Eva collection offers an elegant, transitional design that gives today's home timeless appeal.
