I'm a network engineer by trade and the last thing I want to do when I go home is to fiddle with another router, so I wanted something that was plug and play. This router is pretty close to that. My big complaint is that while using IOS devices, data seems to randomly hang. If I kill the wifi and switch to cellular, everything starts moving again. I tried static IPs with no improvement. This router also would not pick up an IP address from the provider when the XFinity modem was placed in bridging mode. I ended up returning it.",

This is the best router I ever bought before adding the pucks and once I added 2 Google WiFi pucks it became insanely fast and never drops connection. Literally. I have had it on for 6 months straight now and 0 drops in that time.",

Simple set-up, good looking, and easy to manage via the phone app. However, the lack of advanced features, especially those related to security, is frustrating. You essentially have no control over your router; even something as simple as disabling SSID broadcast can't be done. Due to built-in hardware security, you can't run a custom firmware on it even if you wanted to modify soft settings. Overall, if you desire security, this isn't your router. If you desire easy setup and management, and a trendy looking router, this could be you. But for the price point... is it really worth it?",

One thing that should be considered is most smart devices only operate on 2.4Ghz and that makes it pretty tricky to set them up via the Onhub since it \"intelligently\" switches between 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz. Overall, I'll probably go with another router in the future.",

It allowed me to connect to the network wiring in the house, to maximize the supply to the middle floor, which I couldn't do w Google WiFi, by itself. Together it's a fabulous network companionship! I've included a screenshot of the connectivity history. The 2 oldest days were prior to the TP onHub being added. Since then, only one lower measured day at the beginning.",

      "text": "Updated: 2016-04-12 - To be fair, I had to redo my review that I posted a couple of days about the OnHub dying on me. The only thing I can fault T-Link for is not having the power adapter cord \"cat proof\". :-/ The OnHub continues to work great for us (after replacing the cord). No rebooting like you have to normally do with the traditional routers. The WiFi range is better than our old Linksys and Apple Extreme routers. I miss some of the management functions a little but I am willing to trade that off if I don't have to deal with the headaches.",
