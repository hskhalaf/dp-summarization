It was very handy for the move and we continue to use it to transport groceries , and is a pretty good work bench. I can\u2019t imagine being without one of these at work or at home.",

      "text": "Overall this is a wonderful product from a trusted brand. Purchased for a PTA to use at school when moving around lots of different things. My issue is that it only came with two swivel wheels, and the instructions said to place them at the handle. It is very difficult to maneuver this way, unless you plan to pull it everywhere rather than push! I would prefer if all 4 wheels were swivel, but am seriously considering bringing it back home to switch the swivel wheels to the 'front' of the cart instead of the handle side.",

The heavy containers of drinks are no longer a chore to bring in. There is almost never enough counter space to place all the grocery bags while unpacking. The cart solves that problem and moves from the refer to cabinets many feet away. It may be lazy, but after shopping I don't like frustration. RUBBERMAID has always been a great product. I haven't seen any deterioration in quality in the \"China\" era. It was a 8 minute assembly and was idiot proof. AY",
