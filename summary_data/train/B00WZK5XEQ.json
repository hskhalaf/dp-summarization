Trying to pull it out makes me feel like my teeth are going to come with it. I really wanted this to work, as my problem is clenching, not grinding, and this would work perfectly. Just miserable for me and a waste of almost $40. Not happy.",

      "text": "I lost my $600 NTI night guard fitted by my old dentist during a big move. My clenching only got worse since then (even resulting in gum disease). I was looking for something like the NTI guards that only cover the front teeth since full mouth guards wouldn't really stop the pressure onto my back molars. This was the best alternative at such a great price! Super easy to mold and remold if necessary, easy to maintain. The thermoplastic tightens a bit after cooling so it needs to be fitted a few times with some wiggling but you can retry many times until you get it right. Highly recommended, better than spending hundreds of dollars at the dentist!",

This little guard works!! Prevents your teeth from coming together. Does not allow the clenching unlike full mouth guards. May not work for everyone's situation, but has been a life saver for me.",

    "description": "Smaller, easier to wear. GrindReliefN is one-third the size of typical horseshoe-shaped bite guards, night mouth guards or TMJ mouth guards. Works better. Its Central Power Bar causes nerve reflex to reprogram muscles and reduce grinding or clenching. GrindReliefN is guaranteed to outperform devices costing $800 or more. Can be reformed as many times as you like. Lasts longer. Central force focus reduces grinding forces, therefore, GrindReliefN does not wear out as fast as other devices. FDA cleared to treat teeth clenching. Formerly known as GrindGuardN.",
