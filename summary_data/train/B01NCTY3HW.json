I have more energy and my thinking and cognitive processes are sharp. This is hard to explain. It's like my mind was full of cotton and now it is full of fresh air. I know that sounds strange, but it is really the only way I know to explain it. I love this product, am so happy I ordered, and will continue to buy it! I recommend it to everyone!",

Thanks for your email and sorry for the confusion. There are often color variations within the natural herbal & botanical ingredients. This is 100% natural and nothing to be concerned about. Time of year of the harvest & the amount of nutrients in the soil can play a role as can simple natural color variations within the plant themselves.",

      "text": "I've taken nootropics in the past that worked (like \"Alpha Brain\"). This brand did not affect me at all which tells me the source of the compounds (ingredients) is poor or the label is wrong and the doses are not accurate. Alpha Brain worked well for me, but I don't like the cost which is inflated to cover marketing... BUT, that one works. So back to it I go. Anyone know of a good alternative that works but doesn't come with the Alpha Brain price tag?",

I purchased to help with general \u201cbrain fog\u201d and the reason I say it\u2019s hard for me to attest to their effectiveness is because the placebo effect can be very powerful and I don\u2019t know if that was mainly what was going on. The change wasn\u2019t significant but I did feel better knowing a nootropic formula was at least in my system maybe defragging bits in the background. I used for 45 days pretty regularly, but haven\u2019t purchased again because I have some other supplements I need to get through first. I figure they can\u2019t hurt though!",

It contains all the anti-aging ingredients I\u2019ve been looking for (Rhodiola; L-Theanine; Tyrosine; etc). My brain fog has been eliminated & I feel more alert. I\u2019m not forgetting names or words mid-sentence when talking to people nearly as much as I was prior to taking \u201cBrain Support\u201d. I feel healthier, more confident socially & generally less \u201cold\u201d. I plan to continue taking it for the rest of my life. Thank you:))",
