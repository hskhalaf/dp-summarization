It's on my desk about 2 ft. from my head and Face ID works fine. The phone sits above a partial ledge that channels the bottom speaker sound upward. I'm not an audiophile, but the phone sounds good in the stand. Like my matching laptop mStand, It's beautifully designed and very well made.",

Hopefully they\u2019ll take this into consideration for the upgraded mode.",

The slider does not lock in. There are 2 screws but they cannot be tightened if you want to lock it in place. I ended up putting some tape around the bars that slide in to add some resistance and it works fine for me. I recommend they add a couple optional screws to the packaging to allow you to tighten it down, especially if you will seldom every remove the iPad from the stand.",
