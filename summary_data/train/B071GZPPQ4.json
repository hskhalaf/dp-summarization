I have to warn however that my bottle oxidized after 7 weeks. Using a couple of drops a day, I still have more than 2/3s of the bottle left. I stored it in my bathroom cabinet away from light and heat. I will contact the company to see what they can offer and update my review.",

I don't know what ingredient would make it feel sticky but I will discontue using.",

Vitamin C serum works on your skin when it is at the right pH for your skin. For me that is 3.5. I recommend investing the $6 in pH strips to test your products. Both bottles I have received have tested right at 3.5. Keep it stored somewhere dark and not in a spot that gets warm. Your skin color will likely brighten within just one week.",
