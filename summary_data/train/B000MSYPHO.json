She won't lick it off my finger, and I have to smear it on her paw instead, which she doesn't really like (although it's much less stressful than syringing her with the liquid laxative). But I put a little in a bowl and sprayed it with catnip spray, and she ate that right up. But it does work very well. I will buy this again.",

If you have a not-high-maintenance cat or you are willing to do some work to coax them to consume the product, it works great! Otherwise, I would recommend being willing to pay a bit extra and checking out the Feline Greenies hairball control treats.

They beg for this every night, and it works great. I have noticed that with regular use they never have hair ball issues, they seem to get them back if they go for a week or more without this, I have three kitties so I make sure to buy two at a time instead of one now, so I never run out.",

Since it is currently winter and my cat is not shedding as much I haven't yet seen the results. But the fact that my cat just loves to eat this makes me want to repurchase again and again. If I ask her \"you want some goop?\" She gets excited and licks it right from the bottle. So no mess for me! Based on reviews and my veterinarian's recommendation I believe that this will also help her pass her hairballs more easily and barf less often.",
