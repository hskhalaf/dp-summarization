Fortunately, my co-teacher was able to quickly find a solution so we were still able to launch the rockets. Update: I reached out to the company directly and let them know about the problem. They were able to send a replacement part so we could continue to use the product in its intended way.",

Or buy a parachute for a big estes model rocket. We made our own nose cones, out of poster board, in stead of another bottle. This made it fly straight and High. The poster board also allows the nose cone to easily separate, releasing the parachute. If you are able to find your way around a tool box, and basic home repairs, then this will be easy to put together. I didn't even read the instructions, and it worked perfectly.",

I played with a neighbors water rocket back in the 70s so this brought back memories for me. I'm handy so putting it together was a breeze. You should really find an open field for this launcher so the rocket want land on a neighbors house or car, as it goes up very high. Customer service from Relationshipware is also excellent and very responsive! Great product, great fun, and great support!!!",

    "title": "Relationshipware StratoLauncher IV Water Rocket Launcher + StratoFins",
    "description": "Our StratoLauncher IV kit includes a water rocket launcher made of aluminum, stainless steel, durable plastic, & brass parts, a set of StratoFins & collapsible water fill funnel. Assembly is quick & easy with no further adjustments required regardless if you use our StratoFins or your own homemade rocket or FTC (Fluorescent Tube Cover) rocket thanks to the screw-on nozzle. Employing a nozzle makes this a universal launcher for most any style water rocket and eliminates problems such as bottles not fitting over a launch tube, O-rings wearing out, or accidental launches due to falling collars. The restricted nozzle facilitates lift offs that are 3 \u2013 6 times slower (depending on PSI) than typical water rocket launchers enabling you to see the blast off and yet the nozzle rocket will fly equal to or higher in altitude. Also, the nozzle requires only 1 cup of water per launch for optimum performance although you are free to experiment. StratoLauncher IV ships unassembled with a QR code on the box label that you can scan with your smartphone to view a PDF containing assembly instructions, launch procedures, upgrade kits, videos, and future accessories. NO additional materials are required for assembly, but you will need an adjustable wrench (or a 14mm wrench), 4 & 5mm hex wrench, & a Phillips head screwdriver. Our StratoLauncher IV will enable you to propel a 2 liter soda bottle over 350 ft. into the sky using only water and compressed air from a bicycle pump or an air compressor. Fuel (water & air) is essentially free and readily available allowing countless launches without additional expense. You control when the launch occurs by squeezing the black lever and releasing the lock at the end of the cable from a safe distance of 10 ft. and out of the splash zone. StratoLauncher IV comes in 3 models: Standard, Deluxe, and Ultimate. Any of them can be upgraded to add additional features and all come with a 125 PSI safety valve to prevent exploding bottles while pressurizing.",

    "feature_bullets": [
      "Easy to assemble metal water rocket launcher with a 125 PSI safety valve. Rocket will NOT fly straight without an aerodynamic nose cone made from a second soda bottle and use only 1 cup (237 ml) of water.",
