So this dude is good for basically practicing all or most styles of martial arts. And I almost forgot I manipulate his wrists & arms for Aikido or Aikido type of moves. But I must say his body does get some what pushed in from all the strikes, but yet he's always still able to take more physical abuse, and seems to bounce back to form.",

The funny part was that the hands were bound with rope so I can only imagine what my neighbors must have thought. My only issue was the very sticky shipping label that was affixed to the dummy. Otherwise, it is great for working out with. Its definitely a dead weight so dont let the weight fool you; it's very heavy!!",
