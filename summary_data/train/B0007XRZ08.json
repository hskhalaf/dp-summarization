      "text": "This sound card has great sound over the standard on-bourd sound that a laptop comes with normally. Like one reviewer said though, you can still get really good sound from the default hardware and software provided with the laptop. Some advantages of this are: - S/PDIF - fiber optic output - Bundled software gives greater control over your sound allowing you to tweak it to your environment Some of the software seems like a waste of time - like DVD audio player that doesn't seem to support the S/PDIF output. The card extends beyond the laptop making it harder to pack in a laptop case, so it is difficult to travel with. Overall I am happy with the purchase.",

I bought some speakers that just plug into the computer but it just doesn't have the capacity to transmit the sound without error so I decided to buy this card and WOW ! it encodes the music into such a pristine state that I have actually had people compliment the sound of my music as better than the exact same CD they have. If you appreciate sound for music or games this card will complete your life.",

I have the Gateway Tablet PC, and at first I had a lot of problems with this card, but after about 2 hours of configuring it, and my computer, it now runs with no problems in high end games. I also have a lot of experience with computers though. If you are going to be playing high end games then I would recommend getting this, if you are only going to be playing music, find an alternative.",
