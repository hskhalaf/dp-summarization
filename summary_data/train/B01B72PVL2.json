Adding a more dialed-in fit and breathable mesh only ensures the loyalty of Paradigm fans while gathering even more to the bandwagon. It is a shoe with good arch support, very comfortable interior, and max cushioning that still retains a dose of flexibility and responsiveness.",

        "Comfort comes mainly from the max cushioning and spacious room in the forefoot, according to most reviews",

        "Some runners with back or knee issues were able to enjoy their runs again in this shoe",
        "A good number of heavy-framed runners have used the 2nd version of the Paradigm both as an every day and fast-paced trainer",
        "A few mentioned the slight increase in the volume of the toe box, which made their runs even more comfortable",
        "The traction is really solid, as observed by a handful",
        "Reflective details make it great for low-visibility running",
        "This is a do-it-all shoe that can tackle short distances, marathons, and ultra-marathons on a variety of surfaces with ease, based on the reports of more than a handful of expert reviewers",

I bought the shoes in a size bigger than what I wear in a casual shoe so that there would be a bit of space between the end of my toes and the end of the shoe, which is what the manufacturer recommends. The only explanation I can see is that the fabric is not very strong or durable. What a shame because I still feel like I'm walking on air - except now I have some unwanted air conditioning!!!",

As soon as I switched to these shoes the pain went away. I also really like the wide toe box. I used to wear Vibrams, but because of injuries it was recommended I switch to a shoe with more cushioning. I was having a hard time finding a running shoe with cushioning but zero drop - until I found the Altras. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think they are unattractive.",

I have another brand of super cushion (Hoka one one) hiking boots, but these Altra's are lighter, shaped for my wide foot with a round toe-box, and ultimately less expensive. Highly recommended! Also the sole is reminiscent of the old 'Earth Shoe' (a.k.a. 'zero drop) so it's flat from heel to toe. I find this adds to the comfort since your foot isn't sloping towards your toes.
