I've had many video files refuse to save, numerous random crashes during recording without saving the file, and has absolutely terrible battery life. Time lapse shooting is of poor quality (screen won't shut off) and the wifi connectivity is useless. The second time I attempted to close the case the plastic latch broke before it was even tightened. I hope akaso can improve on this because they have lots of potential but at this stage of the game all i can say is that it's a dud.",

The video and audio is on par with the GoPro's at 1/3 the cost. Hopefully the attached video quality isn't reduced too much by uploading to Amazon. We only record a couple of minutes at a time racing, but, a single battery charge lasts over 2 weekends of running. The only complaint i have about this camera is how easily the rear viewscreen and front lens can be scratched just cleaning them occasionally with good microfiber towels.

The V50 Pro did not clumsily muffle speech, and captured sound in almost microscopic details.

I can say that so far it works. I have gotten some very good videos. But I am not impressed. My number one complaint is it constantly loses time and date. The navigation of the settings screens are cumbersome. The battery lasts about 1 hour and 15 minutes on 1080p. Luckily it comes with two batteries.",

It takes great pics and videos, and it's easy to switch between camera and video. I already had some accessories like head harness, chest harness, selfie stick, etc., and this camera will attach those just like my old camera (which was a different brand). The app is a little slow, but once it connects to your camera, you can see real-time streaming of the camera on your phone, plus browse pics and videos you've taken. This is pretty cool since it means you don't have to have a computer to transfer pics and videos off the camera.",

The accessories delivered with the cam were right on with several different mounts AND a waterproof case AND 2 batteries with charger. The video is great.

I was scared that water might leak into the case while it was underwater but the case is so well made, nothing leaked in. It was a great buy! Definitely recommend!",

In comparison to a less expensive model, it is well worth spending a little bit more to get camera which performs very good and has A lot better features. I like the camera mount on the bottom of the camera. The microphone and speaker are much better. The software for controlling the camera from your cell phone works very well. The batteries seem to be better, and the battery door is much easier to open. I would recommend this camera and look forward to using it while fishing and snorkeling.",
