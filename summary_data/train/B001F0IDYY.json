Google Gun Dog Supply and you can find these dummies, with the necessary rope included and attached, priced Under $5 each. So, either the manufacturer, or, Amazon, think we are The Dummies. Without a cord dogs tend to chew the nub with the hole, ruining the dummy (it will sink). Finding suitable cord to make your own throw rope ends up costing you more time and money.",
