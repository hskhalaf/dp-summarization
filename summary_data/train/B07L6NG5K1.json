I have two other too faced palette\u2019s and I love them as well, so I am not really surprised. But I do my research, read reviews and watch reviews and thought I would leave one to help maybe a more mature person decide if they can use this palette; and yes, you can. I really enjoy it and would highly recommend it.",
