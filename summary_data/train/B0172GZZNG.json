I've always been happy with Speedo's swim equipment so I decided to pick up their kickboard. After a few swims it's a great board! It's lightweight. Right amount of buoyancy. The grips on the side are really handy. It looks sleek. It feels solid and high quality. Doesn't drag through the water. Basically it's what you want in a kickboard. I read a lot of reviewers complaining about the smell. I didn't notice anything bad, a slight \"new\" smell. But after a few swims it was gone.",

The shape makes it glide through water seamlessly which allows for little extra friction while swimming. Ridges on the side allows for a good grip. The material is durable and the board is quite hard to break in normal use.",

Don't be fooled, the \"Side finger scallops\" and \"Underside finger grooves\" are not useful features. They save Speedo money by eliminating material while sacrificing buoyancy. I've swam competitively for 16 yrs and never once held a kickboad where the \"Side finger scallops\" are located. I've always rested the entire length of my arm(s) on the board and gripped the front. I'm 185lbs and this kickboard can't generate enough buoyancy to lift your face/mouth out of the water while looking forward. Also, this kickboard is made in Vietnam. I returned for a full refund.",
