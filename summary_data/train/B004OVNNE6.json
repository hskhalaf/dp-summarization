It is also larger than I expected (the measurements provided are accurate, I just failed to properly visualize it in the space). Assembly was straight forward. My major gripe about this unit is the odor that emanates from the grips. It is possible this is only an issue with the unit I received but figure it is worth mentioning. It smells like burned rubber mixed with formaldehyde or something to that effect - very \"chemically.\" I ended up removing the grips entirely and scrubbing the inside of the tubes to get rid of the smell (this worked).",

I will need to modify the hand grips or move the back pad farther back to make the unit work for me. As it is, it's too cramped and I cannot straighten my arms out to grip the handles. The unit flexes a little when doing dips. Great vkr for a normal sized person, but not perfect for taller/heavier people.",

I tried several times but could never get it to stand completely flat without loosening a couple of brace bolts slightly. I don't think it's a problem though since you're working with locknuts.
