Inadequate controls - has only 6 settings for the sound which do not produce the sound quality expected. Was very easy to set up. Bass is very good. ****** 1/3/18***FOLLOW UP: Reported the problem to Polk. Polk promptly sent me a replacement bar that has outstanding performance. Evidently the bar I received initially was defective but Polk stood behind their product with a resolution.",

It does turn off automatically if there is no sound for a while (I'd estimate about 10 minutes). It would be nice if that feature could be adjusted or turned off, but not a huge issue. The remote is nice but sometimes you have to press the on/off button more than once to get it to respond. I've used it with the included optical cable as well as with bluetooth. Very happy with this purchase!",

Come up with a stronger remote with faster response times and this soundbar would be virtually perfect. Polk rocks!!",

The product right out of the box was a seamless/no fuss installation/setup. It's intuitive, lightweight, and sounds excellent. Inputs: optical, analog, and Bluetooth. The included optical cable is convenient, and the Bluetooth pairing was smooth. If you are indecisive and still shopping around, stop and save money/time...purchase this product.",

Haven't played organ music on it yet, but I'm sure it will pass with flying colors. Unique shipping box is the only unusual thing.

The base made my floor-standing lamps dance :-) However wall- or TV-mounting it is proving to be a pain... still waiting on Polk customer support to let me know how that feat can be achieved.",

I set it up on my Harmony remote and all the features worked and the volume was much louder. It does make a difference with voice volume. I like this sound bar but the remote is terrible. I needed to press the buttons several times, sometimes it would work sometimes not. Sent an e mail to ask for a new remote never heard from them.",
