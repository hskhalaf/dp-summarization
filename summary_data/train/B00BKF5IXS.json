Mostly golf, tennis, bowling and ping pong. These were some of my favorite games as a younger man. I played golf and tennis until I was 50 yrs old and never thought I would play again. The games are so realistic that I actually feel like I am really on the gold course or tennis court. etc. This has gotten me off the sofa and now I am getting some much needed exercise. thanks PS3.",
