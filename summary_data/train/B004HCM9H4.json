With carnauba I typically have to wax every few months to keep the water beading up; this has lasted six months without need for a re-do. The shine looks just as good on my dark blue truck as well. Plus, it is a lot easier to remove than carnauba. This is definitely my new go-to!",

Carnauba is important here in FL against the unrelenting sun, but I am sure that this wax will protect your vehicle's finish in other climates where sun is less of a factor and where bad weather and road salt conditions are present. When I lived up north, this type of wax provided excellent protection.",

I think my favorite feature of this wax is that it doesn\u2019t leave a crusty white residue. Some words of advice: Just do one part, like the hood, at a time and have a few good microfiber cloths on hand to buff away the remnants of the wax. While it won\u2019t leave a white residue, you still have to wipe away the cloudy residue.",

It applies super easy, doesn't stain any plastic trim or black rubber, and it buffs off easy. It's been about 6 months since I've put it on one of my cars and it still beads up well. I would say for northern states you could easily get away with applying it 2 times a year and maybe a spray touch up wax in between applications.",

This wax is nearly invisible regardless of what you put it on. I used 2 full containers to do a 38 foot Class A RV, and it shines like a new car; repels water ; and allows road dirt and grime to wash off very easily. I highly recommend this product and do follow their instructions regarding the use of a microfiber cloth to remove the wax. Microfibre cloths work MUCH better than cotton rags or any other materials I have tried.",

However, I did use this wax on my girlfriends black car, and the wax was visible when it hazed. Nonetheless, it applies easily and smooth and removes in a similar fashion.
