      "text": "This is a well made product by Callaway and it does what it's supposed to do. Two issues I have with it are first, I carry 14 clubs and with this bag at times it's difficult to pull a club with out pulling up two (or more) others. Also, it's difficult to replace clubs in the bag because it's crowded. Lastly, in windy conditions on a few occasions the bag has blown over. Is it a big deal, not really, but more of a pain.",
