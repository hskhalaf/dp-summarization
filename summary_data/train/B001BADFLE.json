      "text": "I'm no pro but I like the way this call sounds. It breaks without too much effort. My brother, who is by far a more experienced hunter/caller was surprised by how easy this call was to use. He was complaining how hard his call was to get to break and then he tried mine. He got on his phone in the parking lot of the Waterfoul Management Area and bought one on the spot. I can't speak to how well the geese respond to this. I duck hunt and will shoot geese if they come in, but we don't lay out goose decoys. We did not see many geese this year out in the WMA here in Utah.",
