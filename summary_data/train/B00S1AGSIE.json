      "text": "We purchased this vacuum for quick clean ups of our downstairs hardwood floors. The pros are that it's easy to get out and use quickly, the cord is nice and long, it has a bag which we prefer for allergies, and the unit itself is very quiet while running. As a negative, we found that the vacuum head that comes with the unit scratched our hardwood floors (Brazilian cherry so they are dark). We ended up purchasing another Miele attachment for hardwood floors only to use with this unit, and it works very well. Also, the head that comes with the unit does not pick up debris along the edge at the baseboards, the new attachment does.",

Not having a hose also didn't work for me. I tried this vacuum on carpet and tile with no success. I could try to vacuum up strings and go over them several times without success.

Less is more and suits me just fine - but this one is a pain to operate. Not smooth at all. Wish they'd still produce the ART vacuum which was close to perfect and very spiffy.

It's very quiet like my canister Miele, which is great. I don't get the point of the telescoping neck, it's rather too heavy to use like a dust buster or vacuum the ceiling in my opinion. It does make everyday kitchen sweeping more pleasant.",
