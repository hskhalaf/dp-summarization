Charging is not difficult but is a bit fiddly. I would therefore recommend buying the cradle to do this. The battery is perfectly adequate for all routine use. Would recommend without hesitation.",

It's a very versatile piece of tech, with a lot in the ways of features and also usability, with its incredibly thin screen and responsive touch-screen. The only slight niggle I have with it however is the waterproofing. The charger cover is weak and has, eventually broken off, unfortunately rendering the tablet susceptible to the elements.

On full battrey charge I easily manage to watch two 2hr length movies and still have around 30% battery left. This is definitly the best tablet of the year.",

It is an incredibly beautiful product and is worth the money, is a great tablet to show off ;)",

Others have also various problems with other hardware components. Luckily my unit only has the touchscreen problem and hasn't developed any other issues - thus, I haven't bothered to get it replaced. Short story even shorter: be prepared to get your unit replaced as various hardware problems might crop up.",

It's not the resolution (although this is somewhat below par), rather than the buggy touch-screen performance. Sometimes overly sensitive and sometimes unresponsive, it makes using the tablet a wearisome experience. Try using the on-screen keyboard and you'll find letters repeat or aren't registered at all, meaning you have to watch for every keystroke - touch typing becomes impossible. Maybe this problem is limited to a certain production run but's seems I'm not alone with my experience, see:  I ended up returning the tablet for a refund.

I have a 64 gb card in mine which can handle thousand's of pictures, albums and video's without me worrying about space. I have always been an apple fan and previous to this I used to take a mac book pro away with me, but this makes my camera equipment so heavy which mean a tablet was a much more manageable solution. I have had 2 Ipad's but this Sony is so much more practical for me with my photography and travel.",

That may seem like an arbitrary compliment, but sometimes products just have a certain \"je ne sais quoi\" about it, be it form factor or something with the build that just feels right. The most noticeable thing about other than the sleek looks is simply how light it is. It's unbelievable. I hope Sony continues with this type of quality product.",

The screen is absolutely stunning as it makes my laptop screen look dim in comparison. I have it on max brightness and get a couple days of good use on a single charge. This tablet is ridiculously thin, super light, waterproof, and feels very comfortable in landscape mode. It is what you would come to expect from Sony build quality. I recommend buying from the Sony online store as you will get the magnetic charging dock for free. Highly recommended tablet!",

If you watch a lot of movies or games, this is fast and brilliant.",

The manual was no help since the only included documentation was a quick start guide - not even a manual on disc. Touch screen was not particularly responsive. Very poor effort from SONY.",
