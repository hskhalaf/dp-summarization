      "text": "Immediate observations: - Thick material and less wrinkles than most covers - Well placed air vents - Initially thought it might be small buy it is a nice snug fit. - Quality straps, really like the design of securing to trailer as opposed going under the boat. -UV protection is TBD but this material already looks better than some other covers that have faded after one year. Only design suggestion I would have is to have a gray strap option. Black straps are very prominent. Will not fit a boat with tower, however going up one size probably will.",

Blowing winds, lightning hitting trees across the street and the boat filling of water from the torrential down poir. I was able to get it on and secured to my 17\" Bowrider, solo. I don't have a center support so I knew there would be puddling. I ran out there inbetween rain storms and it held steady. Didn't tear or budge in the wind. The bow is tight enough to not need any rods for support. So far. After a few hours of having it, I am pleased. It's keeping the boat dry!",

There is ONE D ring for the aft end too. I got it just in time to put on before snow covered it up.
