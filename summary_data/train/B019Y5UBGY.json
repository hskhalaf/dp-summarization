      "text": "Really enjoying this camera. Good resolution. Film simulations are great. Excellent color. Raw files are working great in Luminar software. I was a little worried about battery life but that has not been an issue. In fact I haven't had to use a spare battery yet. Form factor is great. Manual controls are excellent. Screen has been good even in daylight. I love this camera but it is really geared toward advanced amateurs in terms of physical controls. Auto mode works very well but really only scratches the surface of what this little camera is capable of. Very happy with Fujifilm.",

Fuji needs to make a few improvements (better AF, auto detecting wide angle lens,better battery life, etc), but no major issues. In bright sun, lcd can occasionally be difficult to use -- this didn't cause any major problems. I don't use the video feature.",

Definitely a great vacation camera for fuji enthusiasts.",

Jpegs have outstanding color reproduction. WiFi interface works well. Tilt screen is perfect for taking photos from odd angles, or discreet photos from around your neck. If you like to travel light yet want pictures with good image quality, I would highly recommend this camera.",

The manual focus ring is a challenge which is small and buffered right next to the F-stop ring - my only real complaint - most manual functions work well and the auto switch comes in handy when I want to go the auto mode fast.",

It has a lot of manual dials around the camera for changing the aperture, ISO, F-stop, and others. It's great for those that want to have the \"unlimited\" film of digital cameras, but still have the \"old-school\" feel. Obviously, Fuji's other cameras have aspects that are better, but this camera is amazing for the price and a great way to get back into photography in the digital age.",

    "description": "Color:Silver| Style:BaseThe X70 Premium Compact Camera is a camera for everyday use. Featuring a 18.5mm (28mm equivalent) F2.8 wide-angle fixed lens capable of covering everything from snapshots to landscapes. The newly designed FUJINON lens is optimized for the 16.3 MP APS-C sized X-Trans II Sensor and produces outstanding detail and sharpness. The small and lightweight X70 offers intuitive operation with at-a-glance checking of important exposure settings. The lens features an aperture ring, while shutter speeds and exposure compensation are controlled by dials on the top -plate. Apertures can be changed in 1/3 or 1 stop increments for precise control, while the dials are milled from aluminum for ease of use and a comfortable feel. Selecting AUTO on the top-plate Auto Mode Selector Lever switches the X70 to Advanced SR Auto, where it automatically selects the optimal settings according to the scene. This delivers instant high-quality results with settings chased based on 54 pre-programmed scenes. The X70 features Intelligent Hybrid AF, which automatically switches between Phase Detection AF (best for speed) and Contrast AF (best for low light). The phase detection pixels in the center of the image sensor deliver AF speeds as short as 0.1 sec. Six AF modes, including Zone and Wide/Tracking for moving subjects, will ensure you capture the subject, whatever the conditions. The X70 is the first X-Series camera to feature a 3.0-inch 1.04 million-dot 180 degree tilting touchscreen LCD screen allowing users to shoot from a wide variety of angles and flipping the screen 180 degree upwards is perfect for selfies. When shooting, the touchscreen allows users to select a focus area and use Touch Shot to take a picture quickly. Other features not to be overlooked: 11 Film Simulation Modes based on color reproduction technology perfected through more than 80 years of film manufacturing.
