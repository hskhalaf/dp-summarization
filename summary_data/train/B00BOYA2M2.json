Both are the more expensive variety with four rotating arms rather than two. I find that the less expensive one with just two arms actually works better.

Having used it for a couple of months now, I hope it holds up",

The four rotating massaging heads are rounded and slightly squared off like fingers or knuckles. It changes direction every so often and feels like a professional masseuse. You can adjust the pressure by how hard you lean against it. No appointments or great expense. If you choose to use the heat function, it shuts off automatically after a while so it doesn\u2019t overheat. It\u2019s quiet and very relaxing and soothing. Very helpful for pain relief and very portable as well. I\u2019m sold. Yes, I would buy it again.",
