The stand is sturdy enough to withhold having the weights dropped onto it rather carelessly (post-workout apathy, am I right?) and was a breeze to assemble. The neoprene makes the weights easy to grip, and the hexagon shape provides stability for moves such as plank rows. The diameter of the grip does get bigger with increasing weight, but I'm a tiny girl with tiny hands and it doesn't pose a problem.",
