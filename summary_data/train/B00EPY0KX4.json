      "text": "THERE IS ALMOST NO BASS. Now, if bottom-end is more important than loud, clean sound, look elsewhere. I do love a pounding movie soundtrack, and enjoy my main home theater system. I don't need that in my bedroom setup. I just wanted something to elevate the audio, without blowing me out of the room during action scenes. This has a great night listening mode, which I keep it on. The most surprising aspect is how loud the volume can go, producing a very well-simulated surround effect throughout our average-sized bedroom. I bought one through Warehouse Deals used, and I believe $130-$150 is a fair price. $200+ is pushing it, especially since, there's no subwoofer out to add an extra kick.",

It was great for sports and music, but horrid for regular TV shows, Mitsubishi said the problem was with DirecTV.....DirecTV couldn't figure it out. Our of desperation, I went to an outside sound system....shutting off the audio on my Mitsubishi. RESULTS: !00% perfect sound. My DirecTV remote controls volume and off/on.....The TVOne provides excellent sound in all formats and all sound levels. It saved my TV. For TV sound it is GREAT. 100% recommended.",

And this device has filled in the gap quite nicely. I had acquired a Boston Acoustics radio in the past and the value I've gotten from it (cost/performance and again, compared to a Bose Wave) has been amazing. This experience drove me to look into this sound plate when I was looking for one. I browsed and I got it from Amazon for $180 as an open-box of sorts. Definitely worth every penny.",

Not only does this system sound better than the Bose Solo, it turns off and on with your TV! It learns your remote control and offers Blutooth! Don't pay more for the Bose Solo! This offers way more for less.",

While Boston Acoustics techs are friendly and try to be helpful -- even calling back several times -- they have no fix for this problem other than to ask their engineers to fix it in the next model. We are returning it to Amazon and have replaced it with a ZVOX 555 that has better sound plus bass and treble controls.",
