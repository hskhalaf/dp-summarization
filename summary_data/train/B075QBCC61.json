These seats are 1/2 inch wider and it seems to make a big difference. The soft closing seat and top take some getting used to and to remember when you are in a place without the soft closure not to drop the top --Very nice looking on both the Kohler and American Standard. Colors match well for beige and white, at least as well as can be expected for a toilet.",
