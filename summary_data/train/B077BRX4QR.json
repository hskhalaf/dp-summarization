Fortunately, the fabric wasn't torn, so it could be mended. Then one single tooth on the zipper fell off causing the zipper to catch. My Aussie-mix's coat already requires a bit of management not to get caught up, so this isn't helpful. However, I'm thinking of just adding a couple of velcro strips to solve that problem. I like the vest though, it fits well and looks good. Plus, it matches my own which is always good for a chuckle.",
