Everyone said it was the best turkey they ever had. I also used the Memphis on a pork butt and made pulled pork and I tried both the Memphis and Carolina on whole chickens. It was all fantastic. I was new to smoking and BBQing but these and my PBC are so simple and they come out so good, my friends think I'm some kind of BBQ savant haha. Just try them you won't be disappointed. Going tot to try them on wings next.",

I've tried a few different rubs, all were ok, usable. And then the BBQ Bros Southern Style kit arrived. I tasted each one - no overpowering salt! Instead, great, unique, USABLE flavors. Each BBQ is now an incredible experience of flavors, and for the life of me - perhaps a first - I can't even tell you which one I like the best - they are each that good. They've got me hooked on their product, that is for sure. Great job BBQ Bros!",

The Memphis is my fave, but the New Orleans is a close second. Will definitely be getting some other types from you guys to try!",
