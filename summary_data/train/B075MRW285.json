      "text": "Second pair of Beyerdynamics. First pair are DT770s. Compared to those studio monitors the DT 240s give a detailed sound but with slightly less space between instruments and vocals. however there is a little bit more bass with more excitement. The DT 770s are more clinical in presentation. I bought these to use on my travels although they are not noise cancelling they do have good passive isolation and are easier to drive so plenty of volume from phone or tablet. Another pro is the detachable cable.",

Virtually no sound leak although the sound isolation for the listener is not that good, you can't just pop them on in the office without music and think you'll have some quiet - plus why put yourself in the vice-like grip if not listening to music. Too tight, the cans are quite small as well, and I thought I had a narrow face.. Sound quality makes up for it however.",

I was able to use them straight out of the box and plugged into my phone, they are a really comfortable fit and when meditating they block out other sounds so enabling me to concentrate. The added benefit at this time of year is when I'm listening to my music on my lunch time walk they keep my ears warm too and don't mess my hair up like a hat would :-) Amazing pair of headphones and would (and will) recommend them very highly.",

As a retired professional musician, I have used all the top brands provided in recording studios and these are as good as any of them. Solid rich bass with good performance in middle and high range too, and I would recommend these to anyone that is serious about listening to speech or music in the highest quality at a price most people can afford.",

The soft leather cushions also completely closed of my ear. The sound is true... I couldn't perceive any exaggerated equalization or, stated more accurately no compromise on audio quality.. Whether listening to music or speech, the audio sounds exactly like it should. The leather covers are easy to remove and replace for cleaning for example. My son (7yo) also uses them, and with a much smaller head than mine doesn't have any difficulty with the same snug fit. They work just as well for him as they do for me. Great buy!",

      "text": "These headphones' sound good and the earpads are very comfortable, but they're actually half-way between an on-ear (supra-aural) and an over-ear (circumnaural) design. The top fits around my ears, but the bottom squashes my earlobes. Because of the softness of the memory foam, this is not uncomfortable - just not what I was expecting. The headphones are let down by the cable which is rather stiff, and the plug connecting it to the headphones is a little loose, so whenever the cable brushes against anything it is clearly audible and can be distracting.",

The frequency response is fairly balanced, but compared to other headphones I have used (as a professional recording engineer and based on even slightly cheaper headphones) they do lack the Treble sparkle to my ears (in the 8k upwards region) that I am used to so I have to eq the sound from my unit. The result is a sometimes sound that is erring on the slightly boxy but at this price that is not that uncommon in my experience. But Despite this overall they are still a quality piece of kit.",

The ear cups fit snugly around the ear which helps to isolate external noise and the build quality is high as expected from Beyerdynamic (the headband even utilises a metal runner). They are compact and lightweight so I feel they will be great for my future travel plans. The bass is surprisingly well-pronounced yet accurate which I did not expect from a cheaper pair of cans.

They're really comfortable too and the feel and presentation is really premium. Really pleased to have taken the plunge with these cans (came next day for free as well).",

I'll continue using my DT250s (250 ohms) with my home setup and opt for these when on the move due to the lightweight design and handy bag included in the box.

I usually use a few different headsets and have to change them constantly so that I can get that crystal clear sounds half way with just one set. With these, it was just one set. I was very excited. The quality of these headphones is superb and the durability is out of this world. They are very flexible as well. Another thing I liked was the carrying bad that came with them. This helps with making sure that they are not going to get ruined during my travels. I do highly recommend these.",
