      "text": "I LOVE the idea however this is not the perfect device. The major problem and my reason for 2 stars is that the lid drops into the trash way too often. It is true the lid closes very smoothly; the problem is when you open the lid or even accidentally touch the lid. In this case the compactor portion of the lid fails into the garbage. This always happens when company is visiting! The fix is simple, instead of using magnets to hold the \"Compactor Lid\" they should use a \"Twist to Unlock\". This would make this a FIVE STAR Product.",

      "text": "This thing is fantastic. As advertised, it gets at least double the amount of trash as one without the compacting feature. More would make the bag way too heavy. It has an internal liner -- sort of a can within a can -- that the bag goes into and over the rim of. This does a pretty good job of locking the bag in place, and depending on where you put the can may make it slightly easier to change the bag. It does for me. The lid can be locked open, which is very convenient for messy jobs where you just want to toss something in the can and keep going.",

It arrived dented, although well packaged, we thought about keeping it in spite of the minor dent. The TK10 compaction device does not have strong enough magnets to keep it attached to the lid. Practically every time the lid closed, the compaction device would fall into the trash can \u2013 annoying. I ended returning the trashcan. Be mindful of the returning shipping cost, expensive.",
