They have been so amazingly comfortable, there\u2019s been no break in. And they are very very warm. I haven\u2019t dealt with snow, but I\u2019ve dealt with rain and they are airtight.

I like these boots as they were comfortable right out of the box and are light weight. After having them for a few months I would like to add a few more comments ,one being the laces never come undone and they appear to be waterproof. They only question that remains is durability,time will tell.",
