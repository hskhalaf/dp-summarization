It has integrated well with our nightly routine and how it counts works well with how we input our nightly deposits. The only quandary I have is it doesn\u2019t differentiate between the denominations of bills, it only counts the number of bills run through the machine and doesn\u2019t separate each bill count so you have to do each stack individually. It\u2019s a pretty minor thing and overall it\u2019s a great machine highly recommend",
