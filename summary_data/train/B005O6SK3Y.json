      "text": "Hamilton beach classic chrome is a nice little toaster at a good price. Looks nice. Works nice and is compact in size. Bagel setting toasts one side, the flat sides of bagel. In front of the slots, there is a picture that shows which way the bagel should be placed. Toast setting has many settings and toasts just right. Crumb tray is large and easy to access. The Hamilton Beach toaster is replacing a VERY expensive name brand toaster that worked for only a few years with very light usage and it burned everything...no matter the setting, so for such s small price I am very pleased.",

First thing I noticed is the crumb tray is on the back side and not under the dial as pictured on one of the photos. A bit of an inconvenience just because of how it sits on my counter. Second the slots aren't deep enough for a larger slice of bread such as sourdough. Only 2/3 of it gets toasted, if you turn the slice around it gets burnt. I purchased this thinking I'd use the older one in my camper and the new one at home. Nope, keeping the old one for everyday use.",

My choice was given a two thumbs up and we are happy toaster eaters once again. So, now it's December 2019 and our perfect little toaster is still going strong. Holding up to all our use and really nice. Very good quality.",

One side of the toast is always darker than the other so I flip it over and toast it again. Not ideal on rushed school/work mornings. Next time I\u2019ll probably spend a few dollars more and get a different one. We will continue to use this one but it seems a little cheap.",
