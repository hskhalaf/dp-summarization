Do not listen to their technical support who will tell you the automated setup will not work with the Bose proprietary wiring and corresponding subwoofer. It absolutely will work. Just ignore the subwoofer setup failure message during setup and the subsequent steps work perfectly when it listens to the positioning of the speakers to understand the size of your room. I don't remember the exact names of the steps, but just know it will work so hit continue after the first step. Highly recommend this for the money.",

It doesn't need to be connected to the Internet to work (or serve up ads). Our previous unit (Onkyo NR 515) stopped working after about 18 months. The Marantz is coming up on 12 months with no signs of wear. The only 2 cons are: - Switching between channel formats - hold the \"movie\" button and the options will appear - not intuitive - The set-up menus could be a little better organized",

It was also hot to the touch, which required more open space above it than we could give it. Anyway, we love the size, sound quality, easy hook up, cool touch and overall look of the Marantz slim line. Better sound than we imagined possible; works very well with our 5 speaker system - better than the Onkyo, actually. We love the calibration system/technology also. Easy as pie!",

The bass has more bite, the strings of guitars have a more palpable presence, and the stereo separation is much broader. I also now have the added bonus of Dolby which sounds fantastic even with just the two speakers. I would like also to add that anyone wanting new speakers should seriously look into Tekton Design Speakers.",

I found a small subwoofer that would fit where the passive woofer went and removed the amp from the powered one and located it in the cabinet with the 1403, and replaced all the speakers with Klipsch. The owner was stoked. Solid receiver. good buy",

      "text": "I bought this product in July of 2012 and had 0 complaints. Unfortunately after 6 months a problem developed. The receiver would overlay big blue boxes over the HDMI signal along with small green boxes of static. Additionally no on screen menus would work. In my opinion it looks like a problem with the video chip. I have contacted marantz and it is under warranty. I will update this review when my unit is repaired/replaced.",

Marantz support totally unhelpful and even rude, joking I should buy a new TV to work with their receiver. Unbelievable.",
