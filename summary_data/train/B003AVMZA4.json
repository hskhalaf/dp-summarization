Has many font, stitch, and embroidery designs already set. Everything you need to get started is in the box. It is downright amazing. I definitely recommend this for novice to expert level crafters. I reviewed many machines before purchasing this one, but I am absolutely certain I chose the right one.",

So if you sew pull enough thread that you can hold it with one hand until the bobbin thread catches it or you will spend your precious time retread ing the machine. Don't use the thread cutter unless you are changing threads. I am disappointed. I have a janome that sews circles around this brother.",

My machine was up and embroidering in no time, and I've already created dozens of projects with it (in just under 3 weeks).

I've had to scrap or try to fix at least 15 projects! I sew every day and this has finally made me want to return it. I'm calling customer service to see what can be done. I was hemming a knit dress I just made, and as you can see, it now has a hole in it...so I either raise the hem and start again, or find a work-around for this. Horrible!",

This is the perfect machine for beginners with awesome functions like auto backstitching, thread cutting with a button, easy to use embroidery functions and fun heirloom stitches. The drop in bobbin is also really easy to use. I personally am having a blast with the embroidery part of the machine and have even gotten into digitizing my own designs. I would note that while it does come with a lot of parts, you'll likely end up spending a small fortune collecting all the things necessary for sewing and embroidery.",

My oldest headed off to his first year of college the week after my machine was delivered; and of course, I didn't get to the personalizing until about 4 days before the departure. Needless to say, I had never operated a computerized sewing machine, and I was anxious that I hadn't given myself enough time to learn how to operate it. To my surprise, I finished monograming his wash clothes, towels, and hand towels....along with a few lightweight throws...within a couple of days. Thankfully, It was easier to operate than expected.",

The best feature for me is the thread cutter. It's AWESOME! I'm a quilter and the start/stop button comes in handy when machine quilting.

I love the needle threader which is semi automatic, and the ability to trace your design before stitching is very helpful. I'm hoping Brother comes out with a clamp hoop for this one.
