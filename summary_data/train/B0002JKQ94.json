Theses rollers are not the same the foam is not the same on the rollers and does not hold the curls like they used to. The foam feels very hard. I still have some of my rollers and can prove that they are not the same. Have bought new ones over the years and cannot use anything else so am very very disappointed",

The steam rollers really heat the hair through and through and the curls last for at least a day or until I shampoo. I like the large and jumbo size rollers because with longer hair, it helps evenly distribute the heat so all the heat isn't just on the part of the hair you curl first.",
