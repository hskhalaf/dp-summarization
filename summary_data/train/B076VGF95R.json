I guess I won't be hunting vampires with this because of the flashlight....",

Bought them as a replacement (obviously) for the ones that came with my rocket. Perhaps they will loosen with some time but i am willing to bet they snap first. If by some chance miracle they do limber up and perform better ill change my rating but for now this is it. Not good for varmint hunting whatsoever. Possibly ok for target shooting if you only ise a half-pull method.",

I estimate just under 300 fps with theese.",

It had a big sticker that was slapped sloppily over another sticker (which I assume is the original manufacturer in China), and the black case was broken and cracked on 2 sides (2 big holes). Who sells a brand new product in a case like this? For such a nice slingshot I was hoping to get a nice case with it, but now I have to find something else to carry this in because this case is unacceptable. I ordered the black version by the way.",
