      "text": "Typical Excalibur quality (outstanding)! Not much of a review....haven't used these for hunting. The cutting edges and point, of these heads, are keenly sharp. The blades fold forward and detent pressure holds them into the aerodynamic flight position, retaining accuracy. Loss of accuracy can be a problem with standard broadheads. The forward tips, of the folded blades, are blunt on the exposed forward facing edge. On impact, this blunt area resists penetration for a micro-second, instantly deploying the blades causing a large wound channel. The quality, of these heads, is really good and they are built with very good materials. Will be getting more of these. Expensive, but seems worth it.",
