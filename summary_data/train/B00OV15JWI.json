These aren't the cheapest gloves out there, and you get what you pay for. These are her second pair, only because she lost the first ones. I bought her size medium and they are a touch big for her nine year old hands, but that cuts down on the time it takes her to put them on and off in the dugout.",

You don't have to worry about blisters that they get from the thin gloves. Hoping the white will stay white, time will have to tell. Glove does fit a little bit large/big, but nothing drastic. We ordered a Youth Large. Update: After one hour of hitting, my son got blisters on his fingers and hand. So, not as protective as we had thought!",
