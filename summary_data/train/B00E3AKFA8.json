Every so often there will be a loud stutter and it appears to lag for a few seconds before correcting. Is it a huge problem? Not really. But if I spent $1,200 I expect longevity and consistency. I'm sure you do too. I am going to contact Sony or the seller to correct the issue and will update then.",

One of the speakers (not the sub) has a little distortion at certain voice frequencies. Not a big deal as I tend to listen to it fairly loud when on the elliptical. The speaker is either $40 or $44 or so depending on which one it is. This minor problem we have encountered it the only reason I didn't give it five stars. Otherwise we love it. Sound is awesome. I can hear the sub in other rooms when my wife has a movie cranked up a bit.",

It was easy to set up and delivers very clear, accurate and room filling sound. The controls are simple, once you understand how to access the settings. I don't know how it compares to its replacement, the HTST 9, but my guess is that they are fairly similar and this is just $500 less expensive. I would recommend getting one of these while they are still available.",
