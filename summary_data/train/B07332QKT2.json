Comes with 4 chairs but we only use two, that'a all we really need plus it's easier to store them inside the table when you fold it. Table has sturdy enough construction to support cooking gear, dishes, water jar, food and all necessities for a quick bite on the go. Umbrella is an extra option available from the same company. I highly recommend to get one as well as the table.",

Seems very durable, a fantastic addition to any car camping kit. Love that the seats close into the table! My little nephews, 2 & 3 years old, were able to get into the seats without too much trouble, and they were also comfortable and sturdy for adults present, thin and not-so-thin :)",

UPDATE We were contacted by REDCAMP noting that we found their product to be unaccfeptable. They made an offer to send us a picnic blanket to make amends. I thought this was amazing.

However, the umbrella picked a bit, and our table did as well. Now it's bent in the middle, and does not alight properly when unfolded. Regardless, this product did become helpful, and was nice to have on our trip.",
