The reason you want to use this instead of some other cleaners is that this is an alcohol based cleaner. Water based cleaners leave behind water that can get into the crevices between hardwood planks and eventually cause problems; alcohol from alcohol based cleaners evaporates. Additionally, if you have an issue with your floor at some point, this cleaner will not nullify your warranty, like some other hardwood cleaners.",
