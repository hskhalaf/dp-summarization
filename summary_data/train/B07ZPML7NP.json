Firstly, as someone who has never experienced noise cancelling before - this is \"OK\" at best, but it definitely does NOT block out alot of sound. It tones down things like AC Units and constant drones - but you can CLEARLY hear people chatting and keyboards typing away if using it in an office environment. I find the right ear pod quite painful after a while too. The sound quality is OK but I expected to be blown away for \u00a3250. They're not much better than regular wired iphone headphones - it's more the in-ear insulation that makes it sound better.",

Didn\u2019t realise upon setup the AirPods get linked to your Apple ID which makes sharing them with your partner not so simple. Sound quality is average, battery life is below average, however call quality is absolutely fantastic. The ANC works well but doesn\u2019t cut everything like headphones. Transparency mode also works well and is a boon when taking calls. I just wish Apple improved the battery life and bass in the next version. Not sure it\u2019s worth \u00a3250.",

They\u2019re way better than normal AirPods and the noise cancellation is really cool and helps make the songs sound better. The transparency mode is also good for if you\u2019re trying to listen to the background noise for example while you\u2019re running you should be able to hear cars and etc. You can also change the size of the buds as Apple supply three different sizes in the box. Wasn\u2019t expecting to be this impressed by these. Good job Apple!",

Not sure about noise cancelling as I can still hear background noise, even with changing the size of the ear buds.",

My only criticism is that Siri can take several seconds to wake up\u2014much slower than Siri on my iPhone. Battery life is decent and even if it runs out on a heavy listening session, five minutes in the charging case gets you an hour of listening time. Definitely recommended.",
