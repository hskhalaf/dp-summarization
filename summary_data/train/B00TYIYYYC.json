When I ordered these I got a 1/2 size larger but that doesn't help with width. The toe box is extremely narrow and even with light socks (You'll never fit heavy winter socks in these things.) my toes hurt at the end of the day.",

The workmanship is high; the stitch quality, leather selection, sole assembly and overall finish of my made-in-Vietnam pair was very well done.

The wide width I purchased is closer to a D width than to an EE. Great boots, but be aware!",
