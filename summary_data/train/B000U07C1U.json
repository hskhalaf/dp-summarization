      "title": "Very happy overall using them for 8 years",
      "text": "Very helpful passive and active noise cancellation for a lower price than Bose and other high end products. Blocks airplane engine noise and similar drone-type noise very effectively. Speaking sounds are not blocked as effectively. In quiet settings, the noise cancellation can be turned off but the base performance isn't as good so I usually turn it on. However, this adds a low level of background hiss so it's a trade-off. The ear cups eventually do wear out and fall apart but you can buy replacements from JVC. Eventually, the attachments to the over-head band split apart and I hold them together with black zip ties. Still happily using these an hour or so per day after 8 years!",

Despite a review I read warning that the same thing might happen with newer versions, I ordered it anyway. I should have heeded the warning. The instant I put the headphones on for the first time, the right earphone snapped completely off in my hand. JVC's quality, at least for this model headset (at $70), has really declined. I returned it the same day and bought Bose. It's worth the extra money.",

The positive: * They block more ambient noise than any other pair I've had (include my Bose Comforts I use at work) * They are on ear which probably helps * They work with or without batteries (but don't cancel much without batteries) (Again, unlike Bose Comfort 15 which require batteries to run) The Constructive: * They can hurt your ears after 4 or 5 hours over your ears (duration varies based on how strong your ears are) Awesome headphones. Love them. Fraction of the cost of so many others.",

On a plane, when you turn on the noise cancelling, it cuts that humming of the engines down by about half. It is an improvement. The overall sound is good for movies and music. Obviously it would be nice if they cut the noise down to almost nothing but, for the price, I'm satisfied with their performance. They come with a hard case and fold up nicely into that case.

Having had them for over a year I had started to feel that, given the cost, I had achieved a ROI on my initial investment. That is, until, a piece of the plastic that holds the metal portion of the head set in place simply snapped off. I have left the headphones at the office for use there and have rarely traveled with them at all, given the lack of wear and tear this set has experienced, I would have thought (or hoped) that the headphones would have lasted somewhat longer.",

Any annoying electrical hums (for people who study in a B&N cafe I'm talking about refrigerators, cappuccino machine, microwave) are instantly gone and it almost feels weird at first. That being said, you can still hear the person talking two tables away, you just might not care as much because the conversation is not nearly as audible, unless you really try to listen. That being said, the batteries last longer than you could want, and assuming you're not an audiophile, music still sounds good with the noise cancelling turned on.",

Most legs of travel are between 3 and 4 hours, and the headset remains comfortable during that time. Having the compact travel case, that easily slips into a briefcase or small carry-on, offers good protection for the head-set. Glad that I tried this brand, at a much more reasonable cost, than some other brands. The JVC HANC250 works just fine!",

Lite, nice tough carrying case that holds plug adapters, soft ear pads, and sonically very good. External noise is reduced with only a slight bit of engine noise, and also reduces the noise of screaming children! Would buy again. Not 5 star because the on/off switch on ear pad is hard to adjust while on your head. Can't comment on battery life as haven't used them enough.",

    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe new JVC HA-NC250 combines outstanding sound quality with advanced noise-canceling and isolation technologies to provide a superior listening experience. The HA-NC250's noise cancellation circuitry includes feedback technology that constantly monitors the noise cancellation process. As a result, the headphones eliminate up to 85 percent of extraneous background noise. To further block noise, the HA-NC250 offers two JVC innovations that help isolate the listener from outside sounds. First, each earpiece employs a double housing structure for an extra sound insulation layer. Second, JVC developed a new technique for attaching the headphone's smooth memory foam cushioned ear pads to the housing that helps isolate background noise. The smooth pads also enhance comfort. These sound isolation features, for which patents have been applied, are especially important since the HA-NC250 can be used with the active noise cancellation switched off. For the best possible sound quality, the new headphone uses a 40mm neodymium driver in each earpiece. For comfort and portability, the HA-NC250 is one of the lightest headphones in its class, weighing just 5.3 ounces. It folds flat, and when folded is slimmer than most competing models. Included with the HA-NC250 are a slim carrying case, a four-foot detachable cord, airline dual plug adapter, and \u00bc-inch plug adapter for use with many home audio and video components. The headphones use a single 1.5-volt AAA battery for powering the noise cancellation circuitry. Battery life is rated at about 50 hours.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\nThe new JVC HA-NC250 combines outstanding sound quality with advanced noise-canceling and isolation technologies, for a superior, uninterrupted listening experience.\n\n\n\nOutstanding sound quality with advanced noise-canceling and isolation technologies. \n\n\n\nDetachable four-foot cable. \n\n\n\nHeadphones fold up to fit in included slim carrying case. \n\n85% NOISE REDUCTION\nThe HA-NC250's noise cancellation circuitry includes feedback technology, which constant monitors extraneous background noise to eliminate up to 85 percent.
