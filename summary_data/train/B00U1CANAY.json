As far as some complaining about it exploding...seriously...it's glass. Rapid temperature changes will affect any glass. I've had glass containers for decades and have NEVER had such problems. Rubbermaid knows their stuff. It's easy to clean; much betterthan cheap plastic, doesn't discolor, food enzymes don't get trapped in pores like the plastics either.

They seem as sturdy as the glass containers, themselves. Perfect shapes for nesting: The tapered shape and rounded edges make it easy to group empty containers without having to be precise. Additional rubber \"bumpers\" on the lids aid stacking: The base of each unit fits neatly into a rubber seal on the lid of the unit below it to prevent sliding. That's it. If there's a better designed collection out there, I haven't seen it.",

Hit or miss I guess. I wanted glass because it's easier to clean. Not worth the hassle of dealing with warranty (seems as this is a more stressful process than it's worth) because customer service is so lacking with this company.
