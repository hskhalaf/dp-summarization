TomTom should switch on and detect memory card automatically and may prompt to format the card. There are two possible options: 1. use it for Maps or 2. use it for Routes If not prompted to format, select Main Menu > Settings > System > Format memory card. To install map on memory card connect TomTom to computer running TomTom MyDrive app. Select update. Maps take about 10 minutes to download and 90 minutes to install, so no different to using the internal (and inadequate) memory included with the device.",

They asked me to try in several devices, but I said that I shouldn't have to. Took a lot of 'tooing and froing' to get a replacement. Same result. After about the third card and many weeks later, I didn't bother sending it back. I was very disappointed, considering SanDisc must be one of, if not The most famous brand. John",

      "text": "I was very wary about buying this product as I have read a lot of worrying reports about counterfeit sd cards on the market so I was relieved to find this appeared to be the genuine article. Of the touted 16gb storage it provided a healthy 14.9gb which, for the price, was highly satisfactory. It works perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S5 with read/write speeds that are adequate on photo's, video's audiobooks and music. Playback on video is flawless. Would definitely buy again.",

Solid state memory prices have been tumbling for years, but right now this one is pretty good value for money. We've had many Kingston products over the years. They are generally keenly priced in the market, work well, and are reliable. We've just never had a problem with Kingston stuff.",
