They are extremely comfortable with arch support. I have very bad, arthritic knees and these sandals help me walk more comfortably. The styles and colors are fun. I love this color. There is a Mephisto outlet/store in Pasadena. I you watch for their sales, you can get good deals. I also recommend Merrell. Less expensive and align the body for comfortable walking. Vionic sandals also have very good arch support and help align the foot/leg.",

I purchased flip flop socks this year to wear during cold weather. A great move. These sandals last a LONG time. (5 to 8 yrs.) The first pair took some getting used too since the thong between the toe needed to soften up and it may take some time for your foot to adapt to the high arch. I highly recommend these shoes!!!!",

So versatile! Nice that they add a little height too. Great arch support and they mold to your feet after a couple wears. I like the toe strap, they prevent the foot from sliding forward with every step (an issue I have with my Birkenstocks). These are a liiiittle bulky but you get used to it pretty easily.",
