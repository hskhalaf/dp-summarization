Another thing they mention is how we are facing our issues with our past childhood- not everyone had a damaging childhood so I don\u2019t know why they talk so much about it. I was really looking forward to this book but I couldn\u2019t get myself to read anymore.",

I don't think you have to be a\" Montessori\" leaning mommy to appreciate this book. Every parent needs to read. The info in this book I have not run across anywhere else. I will most likely change my rating to 5 stars when I do finish and can attest to changes in our house (that are already happening)....",

      "text": "BEST. BOOK. I have ever read on child rearing. I have read so many books, that focus on behavior management and punishment without going to the cause for all the troubled behavior. This book gave me plenty of 'aha!' moments, never once making me feel bad for where I was at in my journey, but encouraging me along the way. My daughter and I are so much better for it. I see through her whining, tears, and demands. I can stop, breathe, and remind myself 'she is acting like a child because she IS a child.' and 'why am I triggered right now?' Cannot say enough good things about this book.",

My newly three year old son yelled at me yesterday morning over breakfast and said, \"I'm sorry I yelled Mom. I'm grouchy. I didn't mean to.\" I was so proud of him. It showed me how important all the work I've done really is. Like so many others, I was parenting the only way I knew how and this book showed me that there are, in fact, other methods that might create a relationship I had hoped for.",

It forces you to reflect on your own actions and make changes so that you can model and guide your children effectively. I started implementing her strategies and I saw improvement in my toddler and preschooler very quickly. This was the first parenting book that really mirrored my own parenting beliefs and wasn't impractical or just plain weird. I highly recommend her aha parenting site and newsletters she is very insightful.",

But I have found that it doesn't take much, is actually enjoyable, and has created a closeness with my son I am so grateful for. A wonderful shift has happened in our family and for that I have Dr. Laura to thank. Shani, mother of 2 1/2 year old.",

Everything we thought we knew about parenting no longer fit. This book put us back on track. Within 2-3 weeks we had a completely different child, because she had completely different parents. SO SO awesome. If you are struggling it is definitely worth a read!",
