Another great feature is the steamer lights up green around tank (to show that it's plugged in) also hot/cold buttons light up when on. This steamer says you can use Essential Oils but directions do not have any info how to use EO with steamer. I have not put any EO in my facial steamer as I am worried about the oils breaking down the plastic. All in all this is a sturdy product with great price. Hope this last me for years.",
