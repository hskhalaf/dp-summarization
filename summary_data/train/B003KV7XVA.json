These chews help calm him down quite a bit. The chews were pretty hard, so I cut one up and he ate it no problem. And the kitty tries to eat everything so getting him to eat it won't be a problem I don't think. So glad we got these!! Thank you! You saved us all! Lol",

Canola oil is not something I would recommend to ingest for the long term, but it this case the benefits are worth it to help save a life.",

Whatever is in these works really well at just chilling him out, no negative effects. I honestly think what they mainly do is make him sleepy.

I can't find an expiration date on them but they are definitely not fresh. Frustrated and sad that they are old and dried up.",

I have tried other brands but I like this the best and eat it without any problem. Thank you helping me with my anxiety;)",

It immediately calms her down and she's just a chill little kitty. I only use half and I notice it right away. She becomes very zen.",
