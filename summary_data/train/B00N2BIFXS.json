The dial is the larger more stylish size that is popular nowadays which I questioned if he'd like or not. The leather is sturdy. The watch is really beautiful and looks tremendous on his wrist. It's easy to read. He's not worn his other watches since receiving this one a couple of weeks ago. I highly recommend this purchase for a good looking men's watch.",
