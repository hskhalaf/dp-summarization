The razor handle is well made and well balanced in my hand. the included Merkur blade was sharp enough to provide me with a nice close shave. I like the little metal brush / razor holder as well as the little soap holder. It takes a little bit of getting used to shaving with these old style razors, but they work very well, and I expect I'll save a lot of money by purchasing the much more economical DE blades available.",

The brush is perfect texture for even application and coverage. I tried using the shave soap it came with initially but switched back to a creme as the soap was not working well with my skin type. Lastly, the razor is fantastic in both form and function. I have been using feather blades and once I was used to the feel of this tool I've had the best shaves of my life.",

The brush is eh when creating a lather and is why I knocked it down a star but that's probably due to my lack of experience. Razor is great and the stand is very convenient. Overall, a very solid product.",
