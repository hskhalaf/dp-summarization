If you intend on walking away even for a moment you're going to want to think twice. For an older child it's not so much of a problem and it is giving us no trouble at all since we are always right there during the feeding process. Well made though and we are happy with the purchase",

My daughter can still sit up and reach all corners of the tray easily. It's nice that she can relax a bit when she starts to get full. Also easy assembly, just screw on the 4 corners for the legs and snap on the footrest and tray.",

I was looking for something cheap, but didn't want to compromise on safety and I am SO happy I found this. Took me 5 minutes to put the leg bases on. Standard phillips screwdriver only. Simple!! Light weight and pull button close. Weighs less than our car seat. Our 6 month old can sit up on her own, so it works great for us. Has plenty of room for baby to grow. Feels both safe and sturdy... For 30$! Unbelievable!",

The harness system is also much easier to use than the graco fasteners, which are impossible with an uncooperative baby. I can't speak to how well these work for a full range of ages, but were perfect for our experience to date: toddlers 20-35 lb.",

The straps dig in, there are tiny fissures in the plastic that get filled with food. The strap is hard to clean. For a high chair company that has been around since the early 19th century, they sure have a sub par product.",
