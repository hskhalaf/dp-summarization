Although the price is better, the built-in casing tends to pop open when not in use in the brief case. I had to download the program (and sync it) three times before it would work consistently. (I.e. after the first download, it worked fine. Then when I put it away for the night, the next day it would not work and I had to repeat the process twice before it did not consistently without a problem.) If you have bigger than average fingers, stay away from this. While the keyboard is convenient, it is still smaller than standard.",

It works just as well as I would expect, and better yet it runs on AAAs so I can always get new batteries for it cheaply (rechargable ones that is)",

I have a Palm TX and they go great together. I love the way the keys respond and how compact it is. Do read the reviews that are technical, they will help you get started with little problem.

But it doesn't quite work as effectively as a normal keyboard, I think because of the infrared connection. I notice that sometimes I'll hit a button, and nothing appears on the screen. I'll hit it several times, then finally it appears, and typing becomes easy. It seems to temporarily loses connection, then regain it. Certainly beats typing on the Treo 650, though!",

The keyboard works well with both. easy set-up, and it detects all letters when I type. The keyboard was designed for the T3 to be in landscape mode. It also works when either PDA is in normal (not landscape) mode, but the PDA is not as secure. If you use it in landscape mode, the PDA is quite secure and could be used on the lap. If you use it in normal mode, it would easily fall off if not used on a table or desk. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.",
