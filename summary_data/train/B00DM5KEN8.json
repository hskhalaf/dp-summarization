Here kidneys were full of sludge and her blood sugar was through the roof (compared to blood work done just 3 weeks earlier). Maybe there's no connection, but I'll always wonder.",

With older dogs that have lost a couple teeth these can have a tendency to get stuck in between their missing teeth.

      "text": "Besides being good for my dog's teeth, these can be used as a treat which is a double win for us. This is handy for those days where we don't have time to brush her teeth which we try to do daily. Unfortunately, I don't think it helps much with her breath. We bought the teenie version since she falls within that weight category but she eats it up pretty quickly. These greenies are expensive so whenever there's a sale, I usually try to stock up on some.",
