At first, I thought the autofocus was still broken it was working so silently, but sure enough, all my pictures are in focus. I just wish I had thought to replace the lens sooner!

On the other hand, it's lightweight and makes a great hiking lens. If you drop it, you're not out the price of a used Toyota Corolla like would be the casse with high-end lenses.",

My previous \"everyday\" lens was an old EF-S 18-55mm kit lens with NO image stabilization, and it has seen a LOT of action over the years...so let's just say this Canon EF-S 18-55mm IS STM lens is a big upgrade for me over that. The new focus system of the STM takes a little getting used to since it's a ring that spins infinitely in either direction - but it was a quick and painless process, and I highly prefer the new focus system over the old. The focus ring is nice and \"creamy\" when you're operating it. It's excellent for shooting video with, too, since the autofocus motor is pretty much totally silent.",

I do have an older Rebel t3 camera and I'm far from any professional photographer, but it is something I notice.

But compared to the 2 lenses that came with my D-40 (28-135mm zoom and 50mm fixed), this thing is more flexible, smaller and lighter than my other zoom, and still gives great shots. You can get a much wider view than you can with the other lenses I mentioned, and still get pretty good zoom. It will probably become your main lens unless your a pro.",

I notice a nice improvement in focus locking in w/o hunting compared to the older version. I ofton find myself using this lens due to being lightweight, compact & less expensive to replace.

The good: It focus pretty quite and fast, but the accuracy is so so with 80D. and not that good with XTi. The bad: There is a lot of dust within/around the lens, which is dirtier than my ten year old lens. Overall, it is NOT recommended. .",

    "description": "Style:8114B002\n\nEF-S 18\u201355MM F/3.5\u20135.6 IS STM\n\nDesigned for high-quality still image and video capture while being compact and lightweight, the new EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens features the optics, AF and image stabilization necessary for shooting in any number of situations. For brilliant image quality it has one high-precision aspheric lens to reduce chromatic aberration throughout the zoom range. It features optimized lens coatings to ensure exceptional color balance while minimizing ghosting and flare and a 7-blade circular aperture to ensure beautiful, soft backgrounds. For outstanding performance, the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens perfectly complements the Movie Servo AF feature found on select EOS Cameras with a compact six-group zoom system and a new stepping motor and focus mechanism to deliver smooth and quiet continuous AF during movie shooting. Still photography benefits from a high-speed CPU and an optimized AF algorithm. Full-time manual focus is available in AF mode and the front element does not rotate during focus, perfect for use with polarizing filters. Handheld photography is enhanced by the lens' Optical Image Stabilizer system, offering the equivalent of four stops of compensation. Compact and highly versatile, it is the ideal lens to carry anywhere.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n * Focal Length & Maximum Aperture: 18\u201355mm 1:3.5\u20135.6\n * Lens Construction: 13 elements in 11 groups\n * Diagonal Angle of View: 74\u00b020' \u2013 27\u00b050'\n * Focus Adjustment: Inner focusing system\n * Closest Focusing Distance: 0.82 ft. / 0.25m\n * Filter Size: 58mm\n * Max Diameter x Length, Weight: 2.7 x 3.0 inches, approx. 7.2 oz. / 69.0 x 75.2mm, approx. 205g\n\nSAMPLE IMAGE\nClick here for larger image MTF CHARTS",
