Very well packaged. Now the 3 of us can go back binge watching :) Update: So far it's been awesome-- except for one thing. You really need to push back hard in order to recline. If you are holding a plate of something- you will need to first put it down since you will need both of your hands to help you recline. Other than that- it's been performing well for us.",

I've been pleasantly surprised. This set is comfortable, electrically adjustable, has a roomy center console (for remotes, snacks, etc.) that acts as a wide armrest. The only downside to it is that if you have a \"fidgeter\" (that annoying person who squirms and tries to \"find the right contortion\") the right chair may come uncoupled from the left. Not really an issue of sturdiness, but I do wish something rather than inertia held the two seats together.",

The center console area is quite large-and deep, as are the two cup holders. The brown color is about what you view in the picture-not light, not real dark. I view this definately worth the price.

      "text": "Easy to put together but it sits funny. Really only has 2 recline positions, opened up with little recline and feet still facing down or reclined all the way back like you're sleeping. Anything in between just causeso your body weight to sling you forward. Overall it's a nice and I don't regret buying it but I was expecting the recline feature to be better.",

Not much setup to these, just slide the back of the seats in and you're done, very easy. 10/10, would order again. Much cheaper than the local furniture stores and great quality.",

      "text": "There were some negative reviews of these but frankly they are awesome. I have a room that i turned into a theatre room and there were alot of chair options. Most were over 1600$ for a set of 3 and had silly lights in the cups as well as electric up and down options. I didnt need any of that and it sounds to me like something that will eventually break and cost alot to fix. I just want comfortable chairs that recline and these are PERFECT. Dont waste your money on the expensive ones, there are easily as good and look great (contrary to the pic they used on the advert).",
