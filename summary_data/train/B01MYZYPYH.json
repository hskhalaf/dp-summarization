Not a cleaning issue, the tray under the keys was immaculate. Nothing was ever spilled on either unit. You will see online that loading new firmware might fix the problem, it did not for me. Tested on multiple PC's with the same problem. Razer would not replace the second unit due to being a few days past warranty. Not only will I never buy another Razer product, I will never pay for another premium gaming keyboard. Enjoy your $200 Razer.",

I do like the USB connectivity spots on the right side of the keyboard, but you would think they might be able to have the power cord be able to move from the right or left side for preference purposes instead of directly out of the front and center. All in all a great keyboard. I have my keyboard set to a white with the WASDF Shift and Space bar glowing red. Pretty simply.",

The only bad thing about the product has nothing to do with product. It's the software. Sometimes it doesn't boot correctly and I'll have different colors or different settings on display. A simple opening of the Razer Synapse fixes that but honestly, this keyboard costs too much to have that kind of problem. Still love it though.",

I missed the feel of a mechanical keyboard. When I found out that Razer was developing their own switches And there were 3 different types, I had to get the yellows. They're so fun. There's a bit of a slight learning curve after using a different keyboard for a long while. But after a few hours of typing, it becomes like second nature.",

The keys are 'quiet' compared to some mechanical keyboards, but don't be expecting anything comparable to a chiclet-keyboard. Mouse/peripheral pass through only works if you plug in a second pass through USB cable from the keyboard, so it only really helps if your mouse has a really short cord.

I use my macro buttons for Spotify as well. I also like the green switch features which are the \" tactile and clicky\" feature. I like the RGB selections and I also like the Community Workshop, I would recommend this keyboard 100% and it's worth it for the price. I also would like to thank razer for the wrist thing it helped me a lot!",

The USB on the side is very helpful, I use it to connect my Astro A50\u2019s and it works perfectly. I got the Razer Green switches, because I love the clicky sound, and they hold up really well, They feel like how a mechanical keyboard should be made. Overall 10/10.",

Another thing about the wrist rest is that it's magnetic, so if you don't like it you can take it off though I don't think anyone in their right mind would because of how soft it is",

    "description": "Color:Green Switch\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is Chroma Lighting and where can I find out more about it? Chroma by Razer represents more than just multicolor, it opens up limitless personalization options. Whether it\u2019s your favorite shade of green or your guild colors, Chroma gives you the freedom to decide. It could be one, three or even thirty-seven colors, with a spectrum of visual effects featuring 16.8 million colors; the possibilities are whatever you can imagine. \n\nIf I have other Chroma enabled devices, can I sync the lighting effects with my Blackwidow Chroma? Yes, you can. All Chroma enabled devices are equipped with inter-device color synchronization. With just one click of a button via Razer Synapse, your Razer Chroma enabled devices\u2019 lighting effects will by synchronized. Note that the lighting effect you would like to sync has to be supported by both Razer Chroma devices individually.\n\nDo I need software drivers to use the Razer BlackWidow Chroma? You may use the standard keyboard functions by simply plugging the Razer BlackWidow Chroma to any available USB port on your computer. However you will need to download the software and drivers in order to enable advanced features such as macro recording and profile settings.\n\nDoes the Razer BlackWidow Chroma have anti-ghosting capability? How about N-key rollover? Yes, the Razer BlackWidow Chroma features a gaming optimized key matrix that allows the recognition of up to six simultaneous key presses. N-key rollover (NKRO) only works with a direct connection to a native PS/2 port on the computer which provides for other limitations that USB overcomes. The Razer BlackWidow Chroma\u2019s gaming optimized key matrix serves a similar purpose while using an ordinary USB port.\n\nWhat are the 5 extra gaming buttons used for? These are dedicated keys on the keyboard specifically designed to bind macros to or to reprogram into specific functions required by the user. Macros enable a user to program one button on a peripheral to perform a string of timed commands, whenever the button is pressed.\n\nWill my Razer USB PC product work on a console (XB1 , PS4, etc)? It has USB ports. Our PC USB products are meant for PC use only and we do not support using them on a PlayStation 4 or XBox One console.",
