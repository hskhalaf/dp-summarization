I loved the original, and it is still a great game, just wish I had purchased a non-updated version.",

The board is smaller, there is no fast track and the questions are updated with lots of questions on recent music, movies & books. The version says that it is for 16+ which is probably pretty accurate. My younger children play but have a hard time knowing a lot of the expressions/people/music that is listed on the cards. Overall it is a good game, just not exactly what we were expecting.",

No timer included in the box which is needed for game play. I just thought for the price it was going to be the normal game board and have all the things included. Other then that it came with the 4 boxes of questions which were a little more current because mine is so old, the clay, player board pieces, and the game board. I must say though this game is a blast to play in teams. Laughs and a lot of fun the whole time.",

Players team up to cruise around the board completing activities in 4 color-coded categories: Creative Cat, Data Head, Star Performer, and Word Worm. One team picks a card from the category that matches their space on the board, and must successfully complete the activity before time runs out. Spelling a word backwards, drawing with their eyes closed, and solving a puzzle are just of few of the activities they might do. The first team to reach the Cranium Central space and complete one last challenge wins! Cranium and all related trademarks of Cranium, Inc. Copyright 2016 Cranium.
