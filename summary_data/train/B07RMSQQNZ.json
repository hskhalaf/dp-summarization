This is my buddy, my pal! Pro: I love that you can grate the whole bowl full and it goes in the fridge with the lid. So quick and easy and very sturdy. Clean up is easy. Cons: I would love something to keep the two graters in for storage. I don't put them in a drawer. I don't want them getting banged up. Still looking for a spot.",

Nothing that indicates even country of manufacture nor company that made it. Is it dishwasher safe? Microwave safe? Safe for hot liquids? Or simply just food safe? It is just a formed piece of plastic. Plastic which, for all you or I know, will leach harmful chemicals into our food.
