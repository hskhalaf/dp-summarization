      "text": "These headphones seem like the go to headphones for Xbox one players because now a days every one I run across online has these. The sound quality is great for $30, the mic quality is great and can pick up the sound around you if you don't turn your mic settings down in the Xbox menu. I bought the black headphones sometime last year at Walmart and they still work. Just wanted white to match my white controller. I recommend this to any gamer who doesn't want to spend big money but want better quality headphones.",

You can hear footsteps of enemy\u2019s (depending on what game your playing obviously) and which direction they are coming from. The only thing about this headset is the microphone can only go on the left side of your head and the ear muffs are a bit slanted at a weird angle so they fit your head a little awkwardly. Other than that they are much lighter in weight than I expected and feel plasticy. They seem to be a great entry level headset for the average gamer",

They don't get too loud so if you're in a room with people doing other things you'll likely hear everything that's going on around you unless you blast the sound. And even then if you're listening to something quieter or monotone it'll be hard to hear. Not bad for the price if you just need whatever works, but I'd suggest waiting and getting something better.",

Well constructed and sound is great. When playing Recoil l, my sons tell me that they can hear whatbdirection the bullets are being fired.",

As most consoles do not offer headphones with purchase, these are great for gamers who don't want to spend a fortune on top tier gaming headsets, while still receiving very similar quality. Outside of gaming, I've even now begun using for music with my laptop when other wireless headsets run out of charge and don't feel as if I'm losing a substantial amount of audiophile-type quality. Would absolutely recommend!",
