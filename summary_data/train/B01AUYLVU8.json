Both my husband and I work full time, so we needed a solution during the day when we weren't home to feed him. This feeder is simple in all the right ways. Easy to use, easy to clean. I set it up to feed him every 2 hours and don't have to worry about him being hungry while we're at work. I might buy another one to use during the night, maybe then I won't have a meowing 5am alarm clock every day!",

Big worry was a cat breaking into the wheel. It appears there were 3 strong attempts judging by morning locations of the feeders. Now, though they do tend to sleep in the room with the feeders.",

The way it works is you can set times that you want it to rotate to a new food slot. So if you just enter one feeding time, say 11 AM it will rotate every day at 11 AM. You can enter multiple feeding times, say 5 AM if your cat wakes you up, and 11 AM for when you are at work. The bowls could be bigger to prevent whisker irritation but overall is a good solution for occasional short vacations or supplemental for pet sitters.",

If you want to feed your cat small amounts throughout the night, this thing is excellent. Programming is a snap too. The cooling pads work for wet food, but for dry food it condenses water underneath which makes it soggy, I put small (don't let them stick out) pieces of paper towel under the dry food and that keeps it dry. Overall, great product, great price, I could not be happier with it.",

We have had the Catmate for about 4 months and have had no problems with how it operates. We are feeding the cats less to help them lose weight and feeding 5 times a day with the same amount as 2 times a day helps them eat less but get fed at 5 intervals instead of 2 so instead of gorging twice a day and then being hungry until the next feeding, they are eating less but at more intervals and seem more satisfied. It works for us!",
