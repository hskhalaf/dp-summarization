So far I'm using those shoes as a slippers at home but can't wait to wear them outside as I love walking bare feet, but unfortunately it's a bit dangerous in the city so hopefully those shoes will protect my feet without taking away the feeling of freedom which I have without shoes:) I was happy with my shoes until I found out how my feet stink! I don't have this problem with another shoes, but those are category of exception. Would not recommend them at all.",

Sadly it's not really socially acceptable to wear the normal ones for a wedding, however these were perfect. Nobody noticed (and I get comments all the time on my full foot version). My feet were super comfy, and I didn't look completely mad. I wouldn't wear them for running or a workout as they don't feel quite as secure as the full foot version.",

Only at that point did I notice that the corresponding EU sizes are actually different, for example 6-6.5 is listed as EU 38 - which is actually size 5. I have now ordered 6.5 - 7, which shows as EU 39 so I am quietly confident. Given that we select by UK size and the EU size (which actually matches the shoe delivered) doesn't appear until it reaches your basket, this isn't much help.",
