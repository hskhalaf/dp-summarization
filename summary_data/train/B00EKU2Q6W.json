      "text": "I used this serum MANY years ago as my go to eye de puffer when I barely had an ageing concerns (just anti-ageing). Now, 20 years later at 49 it still is a great product for me. My eyes aren't so puffy anymore (more water intake then back then, and no more alcohol). I still do get slightly puffy but my main concern now is moisture, anti-age and crepiness in my inner corners. I use all my facial serums and treatments around my eyes and top them off with this (with an occasional application of an oil or cream over top depending on conditions).",

It won't replace a surgical eye lift, but it certainly does improve the overall look of the skin around the eye area. It is light and effective. A little goes a long way. Follow the recommended procedure for applying the product and you really can't go wrong. This isn't a moisturizing serum.
