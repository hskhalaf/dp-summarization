According to WD tech support, this drive (based on s/n) indicates it was part of a MyBook external unit. Since it was sold as a bare internal drive -- WARRANTY VOID. WD further says that to avoid this problem, any time you purchase a 'BLUE' labeled drive, first check the serial number against their website to see if it is a harvested MyBook drive or a true internal drive. My recommendation - avoid the confusion and don't buy 'BLUE' label WD drives.",

One tip if you are installing the OS (Windows 7, 8 or 10) and want a single 6 TB partition is to hit Shift F10 when you boot the Windows media and convert this disk to GPT partitioning from MBR. You use diskpart to do it. If memory servers, it was something like \"select disk 0\" and then \"convert gpt\". Now, don't quote me on the disk 0 in your configuration if you have other hard disks. And, you must have an EFI BIOS that can boot GPT partitions (most modern motherboards are this way).",

I always buy WD, my WD Black that I took out to replace with this and the Samsung 850 EVO is still kicking 4.5 years later, so they make good stuff.",
