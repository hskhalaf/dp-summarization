Additionally, the inner heal on the right shoe wore down and padding shifted resulting in the reinforcing material inside of the back of the heal of the shoe to jab at the back of my heal. The material used in these shoes is not quality. They were true to size.",

Also after a couple runs they started rubbing my achilles tendon, but i tied them a certain way and I haven\u2019t had an issue since, though I only have about 30 miles on the so far.",

However, these shoes had to figure out some ridiculous new way to lace the shoes that was completely tedious and ridiculous! I tried undoing this new lacing system and re-lacing them the way you, me, your parents and grandparents have laced their shoes--but couldn't figure it out. This was so ridiculous that I am simply returning these shoes. I actually found a pair of Swedish running shoes (Salming) that are the most simplistic, and light, that I have recently worn.",

I also own the NB FuelCell Rebel; both the Beacon 2 & Rebels are much lighter and more responsive. The fit is good and the shoes is comfortable, but they just don't have the same snappiness as the Rebel and Beacon2. They are good recovery day shoes. I purchased these here for $35...good price.",
