The installation instructions were simple and we followed them. However, after multiple attempts to connect to our WiFi and failing; we called a computer tech we know. After 2 1/2 hrs.; this Tech helped us overcome the problems with connecting. The NETGEAR Adapter works fine now. Hopefully, if you purchase this Adapter you can either get help installing it, or your a techie pro.",
