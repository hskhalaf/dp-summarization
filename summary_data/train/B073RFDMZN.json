It was also way to big for a smaller woman and certainly will not fit a 80 pounder like it says! It would have to be blown up so full you wouldn't be able to swim/snorkel. The netting is nice, but over-all, this vest will not work for a smaller person. The cinch at the waist will not keep the vest in place once floating. It wants to ride up. This might work great for a 200 pound man, but not a 120 pound thin woman.",

      "text": "After a very scary incident snorkeling in St. John, I decided to invest in a snorkel vest I could take with me on my upcoming trip to Hawaii. I was looking for something that can be folded flat and fit into my travel bag easily. This definitely fit the bill! When I received it, I inflated it very easily and tested it out in the local pool in our community. It works great and is very sturdy. I am not the best swimmer, so this vest will definitely help me feel safe and comfortable in deeper water when I snorkel in Hawaii. Looking forward to using it in open ocean water in a few weeks!",
