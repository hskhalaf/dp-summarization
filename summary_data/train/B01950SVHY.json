Extremely sharp lens with excellent image stabilization which synchronizes with the in body stabilization of the Olympus Omd_Em1_MkII to enable hand held performance under sub optimal lighting . Built like a tank and dust , shock, water proof. The integrated lens hood is a genius addition. Love this lens",

To my hands they were similar in use and weight but Olympus seemed noticeably sharper. I use it with the lens stabilization turned on all the time as my interest is mostly trying to image birds. Certainly costly, but it should last: build quality is excellent.",

I know people get upset by comparing this to a 600 f/4, but I've found the DOF wide open on this lens to be so narrow I often need to stop down, and I can't imagine wanting it to be even more narrow. It's small enough that I can pack it in my bag and run errands or go to work and take pictures walking through the park on my way home. Fun lens to use.",

      "text": "The only lens I can personally compare this to for optical performance is the legendary Questar 3-1/5\" telescope. The 300mm Olympus lens has a 3\" aperture, nearly the same as the Questar. Therefore its theoretical resolution is nearly the same when shooting objects like the moon, and once the images are magnified to be similar size on a monitor or printer, the results in practice are quite close, with perhaps more contrast in the Olympus 300mm. Note the solar flare in the eclipse photo taken with the 300mm. When used for ordinary things like wildlife, it can give amazing results even handheld as can be seen with the prairie dog (cropped) about 35-30 feet away.",
