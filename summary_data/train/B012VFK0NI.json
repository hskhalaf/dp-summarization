      "text": "Disappointing. I had a Lenovo 12 inch laptop which was brilliant, so expected a lot here. It gets 3 stars because it is good value for money and it works for all the basic PC/Internet stuff. But the processor and the graphics chip are miserable. The Wifi chip has bad drivers and the Wifi keeps stopping. The Lenovo supplied stuff is not good. This PC was supplied with the horrific Lenovo rootkit problem. There is permanently a yellow triangle (Microsoft warning) in the device drivers. The UEFI (the new BIOS replacement) is very non-standard. And there are more niggles. -------- One year on and poor experience : this \"All in One\" is a turkey. I reduced the stars to 1.",

Once turned on and the updates were completed, the PC started to freeze and lock up. Only turning the PC off by the mains would get it working again, 5 minutes of it being turned back on it would lock up again. Sometimes it would throw out the odd disc error message or that it couldn't find the operating system! All in all a complete lemon, I wouldn't recommend this PC until someone sorts all of the software/compatibility issues out. I nearly sorted it out with a 4lb club hammer....",
