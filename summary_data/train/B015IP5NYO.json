I'm 6'4\", not sure what my hat size is yet probably normal for a tall 250 lb'er; just know it fits me perfectly (without using the headband drawstring). Between the chin drawstring and the headband drawstring I feel it would fit just about anyone from my size down.",

I have accidentally bent the brim but was able to get it back in shape by placing objects on it to hold it in place overnight.

The crown is thinner material so the top of my head was soaked but the wide stiffer brim kept my face and glasses dry. The hat dried quickly and looks like new.

I use the ipAd to monitor and control a Phantom 4 Pro drone so blocking the sun so I can see the iPad is very important. In my opinion, this hat would like good on men and women and everything in between ;-)",

The only issue I have had was with the stampede strap slipping under the securing clasp one time but it was easy to maneuver back into a locking position. I would by this hat again.",

The price for two hats is less than I have paid for other name brands in the past. This was definitely a good deal. Many thanks to the Friendly Swede Company.",
