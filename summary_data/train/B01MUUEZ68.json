I found my last dustpan in bits in the back yard, which made cleaning up all the dust around the house a bit challenging. As an added bonus, this dustpan also does not melt nor light on fire when I use it to toss the collected dust directly on my fire. In all, I am quite happy with my purchase. Thanks!",
