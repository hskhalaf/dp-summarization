Only thing that bugged me was the tag on them. I know it\u2019s nice to know the brand and all, but it\u2019s a little plastic like tag that kind of takes away from the softeness, but easy to remove so won\u2019t call it a deal breaker. Just seems like they\u2019d know not to add that, but oh well. Will be buying more if washing them goes well.",

    "title": "Chemical Guys MIC35303 Workhorse Professional Grade Microfiber Towel, Black (16 in. x 16 in.) (Pack of 3)",
    "description": "Color:Black| Size:16 in x 16 in| Style:3 PackThe Black Workhorse Towel is a professional grade microfiber towel. It is designed to withstand thousands of washes. This towel is a premium lint-free industrial grade towel. The Workhorse line comes in six colors, making it easy to color-coordinate your towels. Use the same color towels on the same type of jobs. The last thing you want is to use a dressing towel on your windows or a wheel and rim towel to clean your interior leather. Chemical Guys Workhorse Microfiber Towels are color coded for different areas across your car. Cross-contamination is an amateur mistake: using an engine bay towel on interiors could stain and ruin leather surfaces; dressing residue can streak on glass; brake dust stuck in wheel towels can scratch and swirl paint. Use the Chemical Guys/Smart Detailing University Color Coding Scheme for perfect results.",
