Ironically (with my GSD still wearing the collar) it has been helpful in calming my older Belgian Malinois mix. The collar is a great sturdy material, no scent, easy to put on, fits very well around my GSD larger neck and isn't too tight. I do recommend this product, however it may not be effective for every dog. Since the collar worked on my Belgian (even though he isn't wearing it) I will try the diffuser.",

Shes (my german shepherd) has had it on since i got it for her, except one time,-- i took it off just to see if there was a difference in her level of anxiety and hyperactivity--and Boy was there a very noticeable difference, so i put it back on. With it on,-shes as good as gold, not nearly so reactive, anxious or shy, and is relaxed during car rides...!! Ill definitley be buying another one when this one is worn out. Worth the money if you have a tense, hyper/anxious, shy or nervous dog, or are planning to travel and your dog gets stressed during travel--I definitley reccomend this product.",

He used to pant excessively, tear up the carpet, and climb on us to be as close as possible when he was feeling nervous (which was often). The collar hasn't taken it away 100% (he is still a bit nervous when we are away and still sits near us during storms), but it has significantly toned down the extremity of his behavior during an attack of anxiety. Keep in mind they are good for about a month (though that last week of the month we start to notice an slow increase in restlessness).",

We noticed a difference the first time out. Left it off the next time she went to daycamp and was promptly asked to make it a part of her backpack for every visit. LOL Now she wears it every time she goes to camp. She is more relaxed and initiates play with her camp-mates. Will certainly be ordering again in the future. Thank you for this product.",
