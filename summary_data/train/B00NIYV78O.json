I took a shot in the dark with purchasing Puracy Natural All Purpose cleaner and I must say, I'm so happy I did! I've cleaned everything with it! From windows, mirrors, granite countertops, flat stove top, to bookcases, door handles, light switch plates and the walls were people often touch. I've cleaned around my children and family dog without the worry of them inhaling toxic fumes. As advertised, it's all natural and smells great. I'll be sticking to this cleaner from now on!",

It also has a pleasant mild aroma. I didn't have a microfiber cloth to use (which is what they recommend), and just used heavy duty paper towels, which worked fine. I will look for a cloth, tho.",

It doesn\u2019t have an overwhelming smell or cause irritation like many other cleaners do either. There is a slight black pepper smell to it imo. I\u2019m not sure why because that\u2019s not in the ingredients. But it\u2019s not to its detriment, just something I\u2019ve always noticed. I also like the normal spray nozzle as some cleaners come out all funky. It cleans well and doesn\u2019t irritate. This might sound random, but it also kills ants that have found their way into my house.",

Puracy works so well. The smell is pleasant and fresh, and my clients appreciate how clean their homes look, feel, and smell. I haven't tested the streak-free properties on mirrors and such but that's on my list for this week (I normally just use a Norwex cloth with plain water to get mirrors and other glass streak-free clean).",
