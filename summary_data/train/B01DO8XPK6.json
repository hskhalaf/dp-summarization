I did not wash the pajamas before wearing the first time. Then I washed the pajamas twice, and still dye comes off onto the bedsheets. The fit of the top is fine, but the bottoms are slightly snug, but do fit. I ordered the Medium size, and I wear a size 32 waist pants. The reason for two stars is the dye coming off onto the bed sheets and the waist fit is a little snug, but bearable.",

There's no way I can fit a medium or large (according to the chart). Those days are long gone.",

Also, the pants do not have a drawstring (even though the amazon page says they do), so you cannot adjust the waist size. They also do not have pockets in the pants.
