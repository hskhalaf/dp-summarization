      "text": "I bought this for a recent trip to Disney as I did not want to carry my purse. I am so happy with this backpack. I was able to fit everything in the bag I needed such as my wallet, keys, phone, water bottle amongst souvenirs and other various things I decided I needed to have with me. It is a regular Jansport but tiny. Super durable, relatively water resistant (it rained and went through water rides without leaking to the inside). It's very comfortable, I figured since it was small the straps would be problematic but they were not. I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase. I may start using this in lieu of my regular bag.",

Mine did not have a velcro closure in the tiny front pocket, nor did the front zipper pocket come with a key clip. However, I don't really mind as I don't utilize those parts of the bag much. The main compartment is very spacious and easy for me to organize by keeping my items in pouches. I like that I can fit all my necessities in here (wallet, keys, phone, portable charger + wall charger, and a water bottle), and there's still extra room to spare.",

The straps are horribly designed....they get stuck and twist when I'm pulling it on over long sleeves. And the zippers didn't glide smoothly at all. I know this is nit-picky stuff. But I have a few different mini backpacks by other well-known brands, in the same general price range, and none of them have these issues.",

In the pictures, the material looks like uncomfortable scratchy plastic but it\u2019s actually pretty soft in real life. It arrives stiff, but after using it for a day it softens up while still holding its shape really well. The straps are plain thick nylon, I wish they had some padding, but they\u2019re not bad. It\u2019s just a very well made little backpack and I\u2019m glad I got it.",

Although the backpack is simple snd somewhat affordable, I wish the straps were a bit more comfortable. A huge downside is when I have to take off the backpack - it's uncomfortable and the straps would often get tangled. The backpack's straps are adjustable but can quickly get bundled up/scrunched. For those looking for a backpack that would look cute in pictures, this backpack does that job but in terms of comfort, it doesn't fully meet that criteria. Also, a tall hydroflask will not fill comfortable in here.",
