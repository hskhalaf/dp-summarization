Most players these days whether for recreational use or hard core travel ball or college ball play more than one position. Need the the flexibility for variable positions.

It's a hybrid, so only leather on the palm area, the rest is PVC type material, but it's well finished. Overall I gave it a solid 4 stars",

Of course you still have to play with it a bunch to get it broken in like you want it, but the glove isn't stiff at all. We played catch with it and it works just fine! Recommended!",
