It isn't tiny like those designer ladies backpacks but it isn't as large as a Jansport either. I purchased this item for my child, who is starting junior high school in the fall. With all the books children bring home for homework in middle school I am also concerned with how tough the bag is and can it withstand heavy books (if more than three can fit in it). I would suggest posting bag size and dimensions along with comparisons in size to other back packs.",

You cannot put anything in it beside paper/wires/etc that doesn't put pressure on the laptop or get crushed by the laptop Con 1. The arm straps are kind of small, it doesn't fit well with a coat on. It should fit alright without a coat on but still on the tight side. 2. The arm strap may come apart if you tugged on it too much (almost dropped my laptop inside my backpack).",

It has a sleeve for your laptop and a few smaller sleeves for pens. It\u2019s a little difficult to get a water bottle in the side pockets on the outside but with patience it fits nicely. The color is perfect! I\u2019m thinking of purchasing another in the cyan color!",
