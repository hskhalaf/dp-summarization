Such as an industrial facility with nothing but asphalt, concrete, and metal stairs all day long. The sole is too flexible for a rough environment. but they are nice boots, just not heavy duty. I cant talk about how waterproof as I've not tried them in rain or wet conditions yet. They are well made, and fit how they should.",

My podiatrist recommended them, and anymore I just reorder because I've never found anything better. I can get a little better than a year out of a pair where I used to have to dump others after 6-9 months. I'd probably get more time out of them if I bought two pairs and alternated them, but, well, just haven't done that. :-) Great boot!",

(No mud, nor excessive wetness). It\u2019s not easy to find shoes (work/casual) to fit his 10N feet. When he showed me where the seam is coming apart already I couldn\u2019t believe it since I paid $160.08 ($144.95 plus tax). I would like to know if there is any guarantee for these expensive work shoes that are coming apart at the seams. Amazon? Dunham?",
