The glaze is perfect with no defects. The color is a nice bright white unlike the other major brands. It will not match other major brand fixtures. This should fit any vanity. However, the picture is incorrect. The overflow cannot be seen when the sink is installed. The description is correct but the photo is not. I recommend highly!",

The only qualms I have is that there is a 1.5\" x .5\" bubbled American Standard logo fixed onto the sink directly below where the faucet would be (it cannot be removed). This is was not pictured nor mentioned in anyones comment so I figured I would notify others. It was so cheap and I'm happy with the quality of the rest of the sink that I'm just going to live with it and hope there are no issues with install!",
