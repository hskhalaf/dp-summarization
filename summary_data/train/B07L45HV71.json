The X4 has a few of the features that my MotoX 2nd gen had. I loved the driving mode that the 2nd Gen had...while the X4 doesn't work quite as well as the 2nd Gen did, I still like the fact that \"OK Google\" will unlock the screen and listen for my commands. The G5+ didn't do that at all. You had to unlock it with a push of the power button and then swipe up to unlock it before it would listen for \"OK Google\"",

One thing I don't like is the fact there is no WiFi calling option. This would be a very big red flag, except our wireless provider (Consumer Cellular) can't offer WiFi calling to AT&T customers.

The piece that fits into the phone (which is NOT the std android charging connector) doesn't stay plugged in, and last night, even though it was plugged in, the phone wouldn't charge until I restarted it this morning. That's less than 4 weeks in. I have had charging problems with phones before but never this early. That combined with the non-standard plug makes me think there will be more problems if I choose to just have them replace it with the same phone.",

With most of the Moto UNLOCKED phones the unlocked (especially the US version) allows you to pick your own carrier (budget or big name carrier) and switch to a most any new carrier if you need to by simply contacting your new carrier and ordering a new Simm card from your new carrier (normally about $5-$10 for a new carrier's SIMM Card) and popping the new Simm into your phone and now you are in business.
