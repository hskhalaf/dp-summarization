      "text": "It's funny how a little thing like a cloth wrap on the cord can make a product seem so much nicer and higher end. It does slide over itself and across shelf corners where a rubber/plastic cord would get stuck or tangled, so it's practical too. Really, the flat, angled plug on this this is half of what makes it so excellent. I use it behind my turntable/record shelf, and it would probably not fit if it were a standard straight plug. I do really wish that this thing had a master on/off switch like bigger power bars do, but that's a pretty minor gripe. All in all, really nice product.",

I didn\u2019t realize that the cord comes out to the right of the switch, which isn\u2019t a big deal, since you have a lot of room with the cord, but it is something to take not of if you will need all 8 feet for your purposes. Also, it only has 3 outlets, which is fine, but if you are plugging in a bulky laptop cord, you have more like 2 outlets, unless your other 2 plugs are very small.",

      "text": "An extension cord with surge protection, what a terrific idea! No longer do you need to buy a huge surge protector, you can just get this and it gives you three convenient outlets. The low-profile prong is great when you want this plugged flat against the wall, and the braided cord is good at keeping this tangle-free. I think my only question is: how do we know this cord has done its job of protecting your devices from a surge? Does it stop working? It would be great if the manufacturer could clarify. I got two of these and they are very handy around the house. Recommended.",

They're super high quality and look so good that I don't mind at all that you can see them. They are a little stiff and so if you have a very tight turn right next to the outlet they might not be for you. Not incredibly stiff, they bend fine, but the quality of the cloth wrapping does make them less flexible than a purely plastic cord.",

Because it is as described and works well, I gave it 5 stars. My son bought this because it was cheaper than the longer ones that accepted more plugs.

The only downside is the outlets are pretty close together, so you have to be a little choosy when you have larger things to plug in.",
