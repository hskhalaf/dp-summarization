I next bought the 11.5, ignoring the recendation to size up one. I sized up two. I can manage my foot inside this time, with great effort pulling the heal tabs. My foot was crunched as heck. Very uncomfortable. Returning the shoes. I knocked off stars for the unhelpful sizing. The shoes are pretty rigid and will need breaking in.",

I got these for 90 bucks but I feel like I would have been disappointed even if they were free. These just sit in my closet taking up space.",
