It seems a fine blanket but there's no way it will go on a twin bed. I tried and it draped to the floor on all sides and had to be turned down a full third to expose the pillow on the bed.",

The blanket is indeed 100% cotton and feels very nice. It's also a nice weight. Not as light as some might like, I'm sure. Very pleased with it though.",
