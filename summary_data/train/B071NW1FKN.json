Not sue if the next size would work, they might be too large and come off too easily in the water. I kept the medium. Another reviewer mentioned the insert bunches, it does not so much for me.

The big toes and front seams were scratched surfaces ...almost grayish in color. I have worn them twice and this only exaggerated the problem down the side seams now. Something wrong with the material. Also, the insert came out the very first time I wore them...only in one foot. The other one stayed in tact. Don't recommend these.",
