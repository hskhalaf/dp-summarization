Grandpa and I thought we might help motivate him with this purchase. His stepdad is a drum player and willing to teach him. Sure enough, the concentration needed for this has moved over to his school work. Sometimes a child needs to feel good about him/herself and finding 1 thing they are good at helps them improve other areas. My grands love this drum set and their stepdad says it should be fine for them until they are about 11 or 12 years old.",

The hardware is a bit cheap (e.g. the hi-hat stand is a bit loose and the cymbal connection on the bass drum wiggles). If your child is interested in staying with it, it is very easy to upgrade the batter and resonant heads as well as the cymbals. The edging on the drums is a little rough though, so if you go this route they could do with a quick sanding and/or bearing edge conditioner. I'm happy with this purchase.",

As advertised this kit is sized for about 2-8 year olds. A larger player would probably damage the heads, pedals, throne, and cymbals. In half the drums tone is not great, and the cymbals thin and tinny, still a surprising value.",

Do by self, trust me! Other than making sure you are putting the right pieces where, it is amazing quality. It's like m brothers real drumset, but fancier it seems. This is a real drumset, with the real sounds expected and well made. it shouldnt fall apart, even my 3 yr old son has been hammering away at it and its held up the same as Christmas morning!",

The assembled drum set was impressive and sounded very good also.",
