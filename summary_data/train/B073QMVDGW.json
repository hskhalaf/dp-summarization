Haven't had a chance to test it out for that purpose, but judging by its performance in the downpour today, I'm sure it will be great! It's very lightweight, the adjustable hood & neck closure are fantastic, and it kept me and my ballot dry today when I wore it to go VOTE!",

I hesitate to use it as a ground cloth, because it is so thin. It work to keep my torso and head dry. Arms, not so much. Not a problem this time of year. Pros: Lightweight, folds up fairly compactly, waterproof. Cons: Too light for anything sharp on the ground, limited coverage for extremities. I would buy it again for summer use.",
