I am able to store my large wireless Microsoft ergonomic keyboard under the drawer and the calculator in one of the pockets. The other pocket holds my phone. The stand set my monitor (non-adjustable height) to the right height for me. It has cleaned up my desk a lot. I liked this so much that I've ordered one for home as well!",

Now, I can just push the keyboard back underneath and he doesn't lay on it any more. It is also a great height for the monitor; before I had novels underneath to raise it up. The only thing I don't really get/like are the 2 little side pockets. Not sure what they are meant to hold...would have been better is they went down deeper and could actually pens or pencils. As of now, I just have business cards in there.",

      "text": "Bought for my new home office, didn't expect much, frankly. The drawer is a bit loose, but is sturdy enough for me to frequently slide out, lean on and take notes over my keyboard during my workday. Keyboard fits perfectly underneath for storage in the evenings.The rubber feet keep it from scratching my desk, which I hadn't thought about, so that's a definite plus. Well worth the twenty bucks, and matches all the other black mesh office stuff I've picked up a piece at a time, even though the brands are different.",
