      "text": "I'd been shopping for a coffee table for years, seriously. I was prepared to pay for the \"right\" one, but within reason, and was finding nothing at all unique or stylish, and sturdy, for under $800-$1000. Many of them are just too big, the smaller options tended to be cookie cutter, or cheaply made. This one is sturdy, solid, easy to assemble and is really quite beautiful. The bottom shelf adds storage space/functionality, and the slate inlays are really pretty, adding a subtle but stylish element. Did I mention sturdy? This thing is solid wood and heavy!",

I feel it is important to buy America made products when they are available. This furniture line makes smaller pieces of furniture at a reasonable price. I like that there are several colors to choose from in lighter browns. I also like that the table is made out of real wood. It is sturdy and well made. I like the way it looks in my living room. I think I will be buying more furniture from this manufacturer.",

      "text": "Assembeling the table was almost effortless with simple and straightforward instructions. On a hardwood floor the table rocks a bit, not quite level. Where it lost points in the rating was due to the rustic claim. Cheap stained pressboard.was tacked to the inside of the table. The color scratches off easily on the 'rustic' inserts. This also means the table is not solid wood. Can only blame myself for buying a made in China product. It would have been a better product without the faux inserts. The wood was stained nicely and overall construction had no major defects.",

As with all furniture, the unseen side is a bit \"rough\" looking with one edge being significantly rougher than the others but again that is out of sight when the table is in the upright position. Joint cuts are perfectly square and there were EXACTLY enough fastener parts (no extras). It is a VERY sturdy table and has enough weight to suggest it is well built...not flimsy or cheap materials. The slate \"inlays\" are attractive and already mounted so no assemble required for those parts. My wife & I are very happy with this table so far.",

The shelf was intended for a larger piece than this console table. Its worthless! Completely disappointed and will be returning, as it was expensive.

At the very least an option of the exact slate that is going to be in your bedside table should be available.",
