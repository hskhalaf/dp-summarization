Not a ton of test strips or lancets, but can reorder more and they are reasonably priced. Having had a Freestyle before this, I have found no difference in quality. Unbeatable deal, highly recommend this kit.",

      "text": "I am not a diabetic but have been told I was in the pre-diabetic stage with a recommendation to monitor my glucose while fasting for two weeks prior to my next visit. The value of the cost of the strips for a person like me who does not need to read three to five times a day is one of the primary reasons I purchased this product and am very satisfied. An even greater benefit is the 4 microliter drop of blood required and the three second read time. All of this from an economical and easy to use machine. Great job On Call!",
