      "text": "Added to my 17 F250 6.7. When towing my 38ft 5th wheel could only go about 230 miles and could only fuel at truck stops. Stressful...with 60 extra gallons can go over 700ish miles. Well worth the money hands down. I threw the RDS install kit in the trash and bought all the hardware from Lowes. Also improvised the fuel filler adapter install. Hacksawed 8 inches off the fuel filler next and saved dropping the tank for install. BTW can go over 1400 miles between fill ups.",

The cap isn't locked and as you try to turn it off you can see metal shavings falling out as it doesn't properly grab the threads. Over all the tank is good quality but poor quality fuel cap. Thankfully I'm not using and transfer pump and still have a place to fill the tank.",

None of this had come with the unit. RDS was kind enough to ship an install kit to us.",

No-Rust 0.125\" thick heavy-duty aluminum construction. Available tread plate of mill finish Fully welded seams and 100% pressure tested for leaks. Inernal built-in baffles reduce sloshing and weight transfer. DOT Approved rollover safety valve (vent). Includes 3/8\" FTP drain plug and 3/8\" coupling for pick up. A tank that can be used as a diesel aux tank with extra cost gravity feed installation kit. Big Brother is Watching - The DOT has some specific rules about carrying diesel fuel or gasoline. RDS Transfer Tanks are DOT certified for transferring diesel, gasoline, or aviation fuel. However, laws will vary from State to State - so we STRONGLY suggest that local and state level ordinances be reviewed before the purchase of a transfer or auxiliary tank. \n\nIt Pays To Buy The Best - On some things, quality and experience should be your first consideration. RDS has been building aluminum transfer and auxiliary tanks for over 45 years. RDS products' build quality meets DOT's stringent standards and DOT certification is not a one-time thing. Facilities and construction techniques are constantly monitored and must be maintained to keep the certification. Thick 1/8\" aluminum, continuously welded seams, and pressure testing for leaks are all part of the RDS manufacturing process. \n\nA Tank is Not Just a Tank - In the fuel tank world, a \"Transfer Tank\" is one that's used with a pump attached to fuel equipment or vehicles other than the vehicle carrying the tank. However, there's no rule against refueling the truck carrying the tank. The main thing is that the tank is not part of the truck's own fuel system. Tanks that are integrated into the truck",
