Drones are fun and perform well though, except the wiring to the battery I could tell would get torn over time. Just a controller problem really.",

These guys are light! They don't last too long (6-8 minutes) but the batteries also don't take very long to recharge. They are fairly easy to fly once you get used to the controls. The trim buttons work but you will have to readjust each time if/when you crash. All in all not bad for the price. It's definitely the most fun thing I've bought in a while. Probably a good entry point for drones.",

The flip option makes it especially fun to play the \"laser tag\" game. They're also fun to just fly around separately. They work best indoors in a room with high ceilings. Definitely a great purchase if you're looking for something with fun capabilities and have a little more experience operating drones.",

However, the second day the children were having great battles. Evan after many crashes as a result of children learning how to use them, the drones are still working well. There will continue to be crashes, but overall, I think these are pretty amazing little drones. We are now prepared to battle cousins, who also got the same drones for Christmas.",

The best part is when your opponent is hit by the signal it reacts by flipping, shaking and spinning each hit is a different reaction and on the 4th hit it will go down. They are also great just to fly around. Another great product from Holy Stone!",

      "text": "The HS177 RC Battle Drones Are very fun. They handle very well and can be flown indoors I. A large area. The individual controls make it easy to do heads up battle. The simulated altitude hold works good for this price point Drone. The interchangeable shell makes it nice to change the appearance of the drone. The package comes with two USD charging dongles. The battle function is very fun. I would recommend buying these drones for the price point. The Holy Stone customer support is amazing.",
