So if you have a child who enjoys throwing the hammer (like I'm sure most children do) I would recommend also buying a helmet and face mask. I've been smashed in the face multiple times by the handle as it has flown through the air. Additionally, we've been lucky that it has not hit the TV or anything breakable (besides my face) yet but I'm sure it's only a matter of time.",

However, if you are buying it for a kid to play with be warned: the handle on this is not padded and is EXTREMELY painful to get hit with. If you are looking for a combat toy, I would highly recommend passing this one up for a nerf type toy that is padded on ALL parts. This toy WILL be responsible for many tears if your little ones start swinging it. (Probably several of your own tears as well if you venture into battle with them.)",
