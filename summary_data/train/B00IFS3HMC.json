      "title": "Great design",
      "text": "I have poor vision and I've tried in vain to comfortably use laptops. Even the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro was one I reluctantly sold. But this is great since you can bring the screen closer. And the touch screen is actually pretty awesome too. Let's face it: traditional laptops are horribly designed and un-ergonomic. The only thing that would make this perfect would be if you could raise the height of the screen as well as move it forward. I can't believe CNET trashed this thing. Live a little and be open minded. Change is good and I hope this isn't a one-off since laptops definitely need an extreme makeover.",

I thought I would hate windows 8, but after poking around in it for a few minutes and getting used to it, and being able to find what I need on it, I ended up really liking the operating system. It is light enough to carry around with no problem. The display is crisp and clear. It has an HMDI port, and put a very nice picture on my tv as well. It was not bogged down with a lot of bloatware.",

Lighted keyboard is very nice. I also like the fact that the touchpad is located above the keys. When it's below the keys like it is on normal PC's I find I accidentally trigger it while typing and my cursor runs amok.",

Only two real complaints 1) The keyboard feels a little cramped. 2) If you set your fonts real small the touch screen can be hard to hit links properly. I also use a trackball so it's not a huge issue for me Highly recommend it!",

Windows 8.1 looks and acts better than expected. Extremely pleased so far (knock on wood). Even I could afford to buy new, I would purchase this model. It is, hands down, the best design I've come across in a laptop.",
