The sink is really great looking, and it's extra deep, which makes it perfect to bathe our dogs in. It can also be under mounted or over mounted, though we chose over mounted because of the wood counters.",

I love how deep the sink is as I sometimes dabble in winemaking and need a big deep sink to clean that equipment. Attached are some pictures, some of which show a tape measure so you can gauge the dimensions. I would recommend this sink for wet bar use -- it's good for much more than just a laundry/utility sink.",
