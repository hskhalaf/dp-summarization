I use this for bicep curling and overhead shoulder press only (can probably do bent-over rows too, but mostly prefer to use straight bar for that). I like it a lot. The grooves help with the grip and consistent hand placement: For shoulder press, the placement helps with keeping my elbows in check so it doesn't stick outward so much. For Bicep Curls, it is easier on the wrist because the grooves allow you to hold them with hands more supinated.",

The knurling is deep and coarse giving a good grip. I like the hand positions, they are comfortable and not extreme or funky like some other bars. The smooth ends are a blessing when it comes to changing weights. Those bars with the threaded ends waste my time. Smooth bars the collar slides on and a twist locks it in place. Simple and no spinning a locking nut like the other bars. All in all, its a great bar for the price.",
