I was promised a replacement from Black and Decker customer service. And one would not be given unless i cut the electrical cord from my current machine to send it in with a receipt. I told the customer service rep that I'm not going to damage my 250$ investment to maybe get a washer replacement on warranty. The customer service currently is terrible. 1/28/19",
