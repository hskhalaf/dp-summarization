      "text": "Overall very pleased and impressed, was nervous to buy a couch off Amazon! Unpacking and assembling took about 1.5 hours, and don't be surprised when you first open it thinking there are no back cushions only to discover they are zipped inside the bottom of the couch. The back is lower than I expected but the cushions Velcro on nicely. I love that the two sides of the sectional attach, and while the seat cushions are firm the back cushions make up for it. Four stars because there is a two inch slice in the leather on the back left side. Not with repacking and returning though.",

Eventually one of the legs completely fell off. I tried to reattach but noticed the wood under the couch is cheap and not sturdy. The center wood cracked and I cannot place the legs back on because the wood that held them is cracked too. I will have to do some rebuilding work to get the couch repaired. Including purchasing better wood and drilling them into the couch. I am disappointed that the couch didn't event last a year. If you want better quality look somewhere else.",

No replacement or additional parts. No I didn't spend a thousand dollars but the principle is, I had to wait 3 weeks for it, unbox it to get it up 2 flights of stairs just to find the sectional was missing half the parts.",

The seated part should be larger; It is not easy/comfy to lay on the couch. It is okay, but not ideal ***Edit: the wood on the inside is very cheap and thin. It snapped and is unrepairable.",
