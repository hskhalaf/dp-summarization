The little pizza drawer on the bottom does a nice job too, for quesadillas, etc. The problem is that the toasting is so erratic I end up throwing away 1/2 of what I toast. It is either burnt or under toasted. I've tried for months to see if I could somehow figure out how to standardize the toasting setting, but even setting it the same way turns out different doneness of toast. This is frustrating to me and I think I'm going to buy an old fashioned toaster.",

It has a high-end appearance on the counter. I'm well-pleased.",

You don't really need to but we allow it to warm up a bit before putting the pizza in and then follow directions on the box. Comes out just like a normal oven but much more convenient to use. We bought it as we had some problems with our main oven which took several weeks to get the parts and repaired but now use it more than our regular oven.",
