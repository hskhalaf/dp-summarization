I let my hair air dry about 75%, then work one pump of this through my hair with scrunching motions (if you put it on right after towel-drying--when it's wetter--then your hair will end up a bit curlier). This leaves my hair with nice, loose, natural curls that stay looking good sometimes even into a second day. Also really cuts down on frizz, and leaves very little \"crunch\"--just enough to keep a nice natural shape. I repeat, this product is the only thing that works for me and it works amazing.",

This product is amazing because it produces bigger curls not as tight as the previous one I used to purchase. Both products are from the same manufacturer",
