I like that they are stackable and light weight and I really like the all white color option. Only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is bc I feel it was a little over priced. I bought them for $18/each.",

Does the job and is inexpensive so I guess I can\u2019t complain but the no hardware was annoying.",

The shipping cost more than the stool, but Ikea prices are good enough to make this a bargain for me. Stool is beautifully designed, easy to assemble, sturdy and easy to store.",
