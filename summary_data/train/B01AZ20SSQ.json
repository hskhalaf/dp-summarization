I was a little leery because it\u2019s so inexpensive but so far we are very happy with it! As others have said many brands of infant car seats will fit but won\u2019t necessarily click in. But there\u2019s a strap so you can secure it. Our Chico Keyfit fits fine. We recently took this on vacation and it survived being gate checked at the airport twice and frequently being shoved in and out trunks. It\u2019s also really easy to open and close. we are very happy with this purchase!",

The only thing didn't help me alot is the basket has its access between the kids I loaded it with 3 backpacks and 2 kids ... Almost 100 LB It fits my Toyota's Camry trunk with 2 small bags. Looks heavyweight but not heavy while pushing. Moving easily. It folds and opens easily . Five star product and I advice every mom to get it .",

Pros Easy to use and versatile Price under $200 Fairly light Easy to maneuver Cons Solid wheels and odd tread which on smooth surface is wobbly Brakes are really stiff to unlock When folding the front wheels need to be turned so it closes.

I thought for sure we would have to send this back but we got it to fit with just a slight turn adjustment! So check the dimensions of your trunk and specifications of the stroller before purchasing!

Cons: Small child must be in front if older one standing, but the front seat is too big for infant. Best at 3/4+ months. The front seat is probably too small for 2 yo. Does not recline enough for either to sleep. Asked CS why teeth on only one side of mystery zipper in photo. Answer \"the zipper is found on the seat.\" ? Still have no idea.",

Also it will transform as the kids grow, so we will hopefully get years of use. The only con is if a 35lb 2 year old is sitting in the front seat it can be a little difficult to steer.

      "text": "This was bought for a 7th month old and a 3 year old. I checked out many strollers and reviews and I have to say that this is a great buy. A lady in the grocery store had this and said it is the best. I agree! It took me about 20 minutes to assemble. My little one sits up front while my older child sits directly behind. So far I've only set it up as a double stroller. Can't wait to set it up for our 3 year old to ride standing. Pros: attractive, sturdy, lots of room for storage. Only con: heavy to pick up (which would be expected, considering it is a double stroller).",

I don\u2019t have to tell you how inconvient that is but maybe it\u2019s my fault for having a smaller SUV. The other part I hate is you can\u2019t get to the basket easily at all.

Steering this stroller, in general, is difficult due to its weight, especially when it's laden with kiddos and diaper bags! Hardly ever do I consider it worth it to undergo the challenge of toting this stroller to and from when travelling or shopping. Additionally, it does not fold easily. And, unless you have abundant space in your vehicle, it is definitely not the stroller for you. Even folded, the stroller is so large that it dominates the space in my trunk, leaving little/no room for anything else.",

Jogging is absolutely not possible with this as the wheels start rattling and spinning (but that is also not this type of strollers function design).
