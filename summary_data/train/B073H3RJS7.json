For the price I decided on this one, and I must say I'm very pleased with my product. It is very sturdy and works out well as a table or a seat depending on what they need. It also is sturdy enough for me to stand on which is great. The color is true to picture. Overall happy with my purchase.",

This was not a problem for me, but I did feel compelled to toss a throw over the ottoman and keep it there.",
