An umpire commented to him about what a nice bat it is. It has performed well for him, with a run of shots to the fence for easy doubles. It sounds great too, with a very solid crack. Expensive bat, but short of professional caliber bats, this is about as good as it gets.",

However, it felt heavy to me so I weighed it and this one weighs 31.5 oz....so it's actually a drop .5 bat. Thought about returning it, but decided to keep it to use in practice. He's a pretty big, strong kid (5'8\", 125 lbs), but doubtful he could get this thing around against a hard throwing pitcher. His normal bat is a 32/27, so this is a big jump.",
