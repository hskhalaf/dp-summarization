      "text": "I love my Adidas Crestwood Mid Shoes in Black/Gold/Black, 10.5. The gold on the back of the shoe is even prettier in person. I feel these shoes are kind of rare in my own head for the fact that I have never seen anybody wear shoes with a shiny gold back. The fit is just as expected and I do find myself wearing them all day on certain days even when I am not playing basketball. If you want to stand out, than buy these shoes and people will gravitate towards you to ask you where you purchased these beauties.",

Material is great, bottom has grip, however I tied the shoe laces through all the holes and their a little short, so have to tie them a different way to get more slack or buy other laces.but still worth it",
