My biggest complaint though is that from the picture, it looks like it could be a little ball pit, but there is nothing that would hold balls inside of it. But overall, I like it. There's lots of room inside it, and my son absolutely loves it. AND I didn't expect it to come with lights but it did! And the plug into the wall or take batteries.",

Few parts tore during assembly - The plastic tubes are also very cheap. Couple of them cracked when my kids were playing in it - I still haven't figured out a way to put the cloth part of the tent up without twisting it and curling it. It's just not intuitive Pros - Pricing. That's all",

Think of putting together a tent without instructions and with about 30 rods and that's what its like. Getting the lights untangled with how they send it is a nightmare.",

My little girls are very active, so knocking it down won\u2019t take long. Had to reinforce with a throw over blanket at the bottom. And tied the poles together. Overall, it\u2019s cute. Fashionable. And the girls LOVE IT!!",
