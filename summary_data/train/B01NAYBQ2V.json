So I was shocked when this device lost power after only one hour of use........until I called Garmin. The rep said that that was normal for all auto Garmins built from 2016 on. I concluded that that was likely because of all the bells and whistle on newer models, compared to my 9 year old antique. She agreed. I've only used it once so can't give expert opinions, still it was programmed in less than 5 minutes got me where I needed to go without any problems. I shall update the feedback soon",

There\u2019s a feature that notifies you of speed zone changes that will drive you nuts! It changes and beeps almost continually.
