After less the 2 months with fairly regular use, the ear pads shredded making these headphones almost unusable. Yes ... they came with other pairs of ear pads, but I was not a fan of the other sizes. Sadly, it will cost almost more to replace the ear pads than to buy new headphones. This is very disappointing and discouraging. I would not recommend these headphones to anyone!!",

The earpieces are sturdy, fit in and around my ears and I am not afraid of breaking it. The flexible wires that connect the earpieces make it easier to move around than my old headset. The battery life, sound quality and quality of materials of this piece are excellent! Just buy it!",

The battery life is cool and work as expected. The Bluetooth firm is 4.1 and works just fine. I'm not giving the 5 stars review because it has a very nice sound but for the 5 stars you have to go to the next level and high quality sound is not easy to found. For the price is a excellent product.",

I\u2019ve heard that the battery life will die out on these in a year or so, but that\u2019s how batteries work - they die eventually. For what I paid, these are better than expected. Different size ear pieces also make these versatile, I can jump, run, kick ect and these stay in place.",

Still, for working out they stay in my ear great weather I am hitting the weights or going for a run.

Only one small complaint: a bit too basey if and only if you screw the buds a little too far into your ear. Avoid this buy simply just sliding them right on, maybe a bit snuggly and you will get a surprisingly good sound quality...Enjoy",
