Those who are seriously desperate for a mid-top hiking shoe with a true-to-size fit and outstanding water protection may also find it in this gear. Purchasers, however, must take heed of the questionable construction of its lace loops and tongue. Overall, despite its criticisms, the Merrell Moab FST 2 Mid Waterproof has more than enough merits to be deemed worthy of the trail, rain or shine.",

        "Its unwavering waterproofing stunned several wearers",
        "The footgear\u2019s unbelievable lightness floored a couple of reviewers",

These are my 4th pair of Merrell hiking shoes/boots. Merrell has never disappointed, outsole traction, midsole cushion, and insole arch support all work for my feet. Traveled after a rain and water proofing worked like a charm. No blisters no funny smells no out of the ordinary foot fatigue.",
