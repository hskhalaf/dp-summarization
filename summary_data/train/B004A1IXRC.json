It was acceptable due to it's age and I ground down the tear (near the tip) and am still using it today. I figured having a new one would be good, but quickly realized the quality is even lower than the first generation I originally purchased. Within 5 minutes of use I have 2 fold overs on the upper half of the blade that render it useless without grinding and resharpening. I guess this machete is only good for greens and light slashing. I do not recommend this tool.",

I bought a cheaper Corona machete years ago, and have never had blade rolling or chipping, it just kept chewing through piece after piece of wood. Long story short, if you want to look \"cool\" with this Gator Machete strapped to your G.H.B. of B.O.B go ahead. I'll be deep in the woods with a garden machete doing more work and enjoying it, while you play \"operator.\"",

Sheath also has a loop for the belt to wear it around your waist. Blade was not very sharp when arrived. Although it worked when I lopped off some half inch branches. I sharpened it on a whetstone till very sharp and tested it on thicker branches, about an inch, and it easily cut it off. I will recommend this if you are tight on a budget for a machete but if you have a larger budget - skip this.",

I ordered this machete anyway as the price was good (when I ordered it) and the recent reviews are hit and miss. The blade was sharp enough right out of the package. I cut thru many saplings up to 2\" diameter with ease. After use I cleaned and oiled the blade...then hit it a few licks with a sharpener and followed up with passes over a ceramic rod. The blade is SUPER SHARP now. The blade metal is relatively soft steel and is not rigid. This machete will serve my needs just fine.",

      "text": "Item is as shown. Has a slight edge but you will need to sharpen it.sheth is decent and seems to hold together. The saw part of the blade is just metal bent in 2 directions but no actual edge on it, would still work for a saw but unsure how long it would hold out. The blade once sharpened works well for cutting brush, small branches and just about anything else that gets in my way while exploring the woods. The handle is decently comfortable, grips nicely and keeps vibrations to a minimum when in use.",

Really happy that I was able to fish in areas that were previously closed off to me.",

But the blade dents/bends when you pull it out of the harder wood that you may not cut all the way through (water oak and scrub oak are a no go). So if you keep it to cutting soft limbs (pine and sweet gun, and maple) under 3/4\" it will be fine. I sent one back and they sent me another one due to this, now I just keep this one on the 4 wheeler to get the small limbs that might be hanging over the path as I ride along.",

Not the case at all,left me with a broken tool in the middle of the woods. There are other ones out there look at them and skip this one, oh. And it's amazing to me that they recalled these knives because of the handle and the updated one is just as bad.",

I've used mine many times in the backyard, and up in the hills to collect wood for the campfire. It's easy to keep sharpened with a file, and all I have do to keep it rust free is wipe it off now and then with a rag or paper towel (or pant leg).",
