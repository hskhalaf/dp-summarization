My only recommendation is for Keen to keep producing great shoes but line them with an insole that matches the quality of your shoes.",

Although the tall sides are lined, you need to wear tall socks to keep the sides from rubbing. The soles grip without tripping and the rounded toe allows you to roll through your stride.
