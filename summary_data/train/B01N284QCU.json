Really really disappointed......next...Battery life not great when the batteries get down to the 25% the volume will drops really low. Plus you can't just plug the power cord in it and turn the volume up, no it must recharge above 50%....So keep your speaker charged above 25%...Or just don't buy... Now this thing is just a door stop.",

I wanted something that is not too expensive but also had good quality. Therefore, I went to BestBuy to look at the right speaker. In the beginning, I was interested in the JBL 3, but after listening to both speakers, I couldn't choose the JBL over the Sony. Sony\u2019s bass, quality, and overall look were better in every way. Plus it ways cheaper. That\u2019s why I chose Sony.",

I don't feel like going much in detail but like every great thing, it starts going bad after several years... But I have dropped my speaker a lot, so if you probably take care of it a lot, then your speaker should last longer than 2 years.",

The sound isn't great, but it's good when you keep it at low to mid levels of volume. As others have mentioned, the bass is best at low volume levels. I've only had one issue, the speaker developed a tendency to randomly shut off by itself. It's never even been splashed by water, so I don't know what's been causing this issue. We have Bose units that have been going strong for over 5 years, and we expected the same quality from Sony.",

It seems Sony audio processor well calibrate the bass compensation at low volume. The only thing I wish it could improve is to shut off the power when there is no input.

The other day, I used it when we called a friend of my husband's. I called him on our Smart Phone & it amplified through this little speaker. Everyone in the room could hear & talk. Easy to turn up the sound for my husband, who has hearing \"issues\".",

It can get very loud though I prefer a more modest level. It's not quite a Bose Mini Soundlink but it holds it's own at a third of the price. The grey model is very attrractive in design and function. Spend a little more and get something decent. The Sony will fill the bill.",

I like that it is heavy and feels well built, I know that aids in the nice bass it produces. I also own and iHome and another brand. I ordered a Bose before this and sent it back because I was unimpressed, but this one did the trick. By looking at the specs, I don't see where the newer version is worth the extra cost.",
