I can't even imaging using a rangefinder without VR. Clarity is stunning as you would expect from Nikon. Diopter adjustment for you eye(s) works smoothly and holds your setting. Couldn't be happier!",

    "title": "Nikon Arrow ID 7000 VR Bowhunting Laser Rangefinder, Green - 16211",
    "description": "The calling card of a successful bowhunter is confidence. This season, become unshakable with the help of Nikon's ARROW ID 7000 VR laser rangefinder. Separating it from all others is Nikon's groundbreaking optical VR (Vibration Reduction) system, engineered to reduce vibrations of the image in the viewfinder caused by hand movements while simultaneously aligning the viewed image with the activated laser beam. The result is a rock-solid view of your target together with faster, more precise ranging.\n\nOptical VR (Vibration Reduction) Technology\nAt the heart of the new ARROW ID 7000 is Nikon's optical VR (Vibration Reduction) system, designed to reduce vibrations of the image in the viewfinder caused by hand movements (by approx. 80%) and simultaneously align the viewed image with the activated laser beam for faster, more precise ranging. The effect of Vibration Reduction: vibrations of the image in the viewfinder caused by hand movement are reduced by approx. 80% (1/5 or less than without VR function based on Nikon's measurement standards.)\n\nTru-Target Technology\nChoose between two different ranging modes depending on the situation. First target priority mode allows you to range an object as small as a fence post while distant target priority mode displays the range of the farthest target among a group of targets measured.\n\nID (Incline/Decline) Technology\nNikon's advanced ID Technology provides the horizontal distance to the target, even when ranging at various incline or decline shooting angles\u2014up to an incredible +/- 89 degrees (nearly vertical up or down).\n\nFeatures\n\n * Measurement Range: 8 - 1000 yds\n * Increment Reading: .1 yds\n * Magnification: 6 x\n * Units of measurement: meters/yards\n * Eye Relief: 18 mm\n * Power Source: 1 CR2 Lithium Battery\n * Size(Length x Width x Height), in: 3.9x1.9x3.0\n * Weight w/o Batteries: 7.1 oz\n * Objective Di",
