      "text": "I have taken over 15,000 photos with this camera over the past 4-years, dropped it onto concrete from a height of over 4-feet (small dent in corner), and still using the original battery (along with an additional replacement battery). I use it mainly for documentation at work. Shooting is a little slow, but it takes decent photos, with the focus and exposure usually perfect while in fully auto mode. This camera is still going strong, but decided that it can't last forever so I am now replacing with the Elph 340 HS. Considered buying another A3300 because of its reliability but it is a pretty old model now and is the same price as the newer 340.",

I purchased it for commercial footage in a tight spot (small mount in a tree) and ran it for a time lapse sequence that very easily fit in into a full 1080p production (still footage at even 12mp is more than 2k in video). Camera is light, battery lasts 1.25 hours running photos every 5 seconds, does not draw attention like a DSLR or larger camcorder.",
