It's a very small curl, nothing like you would get with a standard eye lash curler. It also takes 6 minutes for me to curl my lashes with this. I've tried both ways, with mascara and without. It's not the easiest to clean so I don't recommend with mascara. The only plus is it doesn't rip out your eye lashes but overall I was not impressed.",

The curler works faster and better than the less expensive brands, too.",
