The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the size of the ice pack itself. I wish the ice pack was larger so that it could cover more of the back/top of the gluts.",

The gel stays cold for about 20 minutes, which is exactly how long you should appy ice. The only thing that could improve this, if your back is hurting all the way across, would be to make one that has a pocket where you put the ice pack and the ice pack itself, long enough to cover the entire width of the back. Other than that, I's fine.",

Comes with one thermal pack, I would recommend buying 2-3 more (see Nexcare Reusable Coldhot pack 4 x 10\") so you can keep the hot or cold working for longer. I have only used them for cold packs, I have not tried microwaving them. I would definitely recommend this.",
