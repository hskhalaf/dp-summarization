When I first lay down, I shouldn\u2019t feel cold spots all throughout the bag. But that\u2019s what happened to me on a backpacking outing. Disappointed to say the least, considering the super low temp rated bag from Teton I have is amazing. Would not suggest this to anyone looking on going somewhere remotely cool. Also the zippers. If idiotsfightingthings were filming me trying to zip this thing up, they\u2019d have a few solid hours of entertainment.",

On the plus side, the bag is compact and fit fine in my backpack with a hammock, small tarp, and other small gear.",

They take awhile to trap the heat and you may be cold the first 30 minutes and may shiver a bit during the night if you're a big chilly kiddo like myself, but these babies keep that warmth in! Have had to unzip these a few times due to the heat when on trips! Definetly worth your money!",

I used it as a blanket since I couldn't zip it up but in 55 deg weather I was cold. Unfortunately I didn't get to try it until after the return period.",
