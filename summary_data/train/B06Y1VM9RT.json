So far, both of us have been pleased. Took it out of the box, rinsed it off, attached the handle, and started crushing ice cubes. I've been crushing 8 trays a day for a week now. Can't vouch for how well it will hold up long term, but for the time I've had it, it's been great.",

We got it to use for a week at an outdoor event in which about a dozen people were camping with no electricity \u2014 we used it to crush store-bought bagged ice for mint juleps and other cocktails. It is surprisingly effortless to crank (I\u2019m a 110-lb woman who was making all the drinks) and crushes a hopperful quickly. I now use it at home because I like the crushed textue it makes better than the texture of the crushed ice from the automatic crusher on my fridge. Seems to be great quality, very pleased with it.",

The recipient reports that she has had no difficulty at all using it, and that she loves the consistency of the crushed ice. (She likes it a little chunky; but I'm confident that one could get a smoother consistency by crushing it again.) She's using it every day and really enjoying it.",

The unit is stable, very easy to use and easily produces enough crushed ice for a party. The only slight downside is that the handle, scoop and lid come shipped in the ice bin and it took a bit of jiggling to get the bin out of the crusher the first time..",

It provides my wife the crushed ice that she love, it hasn't rusted or had any of the other problems that people reported. But today, one of the fins in the internal chamber broke off (see photo). It still functions, but the ice is coming out in much larger chunks due to the missing fin. Is there any way to replace the internal white plastic part of the chamber? Maybe it isn't perfect, but it has performed very well until today. Update 9/20/2020: And as of today, the handle broke. So down to three stars. Executes well, but doesn't really last long.",
