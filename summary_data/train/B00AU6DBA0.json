I'm using a Matthews Monster at 50lbs. My typical broadhead for hogs is a fixed blade given the tough hide that needs to be penetrated. However, these did an incredible job of quickly and humanely taking the animal and putting 200lbs of pork in my freezer. The boar traveled only 10 yards before succumbing. The two blades are now my default broad head on all hunts.",
