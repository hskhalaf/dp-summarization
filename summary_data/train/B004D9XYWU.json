I usually sending her a chocolate gift box tower but I read horrible reviews about it here and after feeling extremely guilty for sending my poor mom crap chocolate for the past few years I looked for the highest rated basket in Amazon and found this. This year I got a chance to have my mom home to open gifts so I got to see the box. It's a beautiful basket of goodies. And she was very excited about it. And all of my children tried their darndest to trick her into opening it so they could eat it. I'm very happy with this purchase!",
