The expensive pan will most likely last the longest but as far as baking goes we made a big batch of yeast bread We baked bread in all the pans at the same time in the same oven There was not enough of a difference in the final product to buy the more expensive pans and we did really like the Wilton pans because of the lip on the pans. Makes it much easier to rotate",

Even cooking, beautiful finish, rolled edges, rigid, good build quality, and just an overall excellent value. I'm back to buy another one.",

In my experience, that makes them work even better, so don't worry about keeping them pristine.

      "text": "The Wilton Recipe Right Medium Loaf Pan is simply put; IDEAL!! As I only have a small toaster type oven for my baking needs, this pan fits nicely into the small counter top oven. Even though it is coated for non-stick baking, I still wipe down the inners with olive oil and the baked loaves simply drop out of the pan. There is essentially no clean up with just a fast wipe down with the dish cloth, a rinse, and a dry. The loaves are evenly baked throughout from top to bottom. This is one great baking pan.",
