There is a lot of wiggle room between the chest and the cart, and the the nuts and bolts keep falling out of the cart. Additionally there is no handle to pull or push the cart so the only way to get this chest around is to shove it with your foot, and hope the bolts on the cart hold up. All that said, if you just want to plop this chest down on the ground and not move it anywhere...ever... the safe seems well built.",
