I even purchased the WiFi bridge and I still end up having to dig through my purse for my phone or keys to unlock the door. When it works, I love it! And I do love being able to check my phone to see if the door is locked. But the inconsistency is extremely frustrating. I don\u2019t recommend this product.",

Very frustrating feeling like the lock is rebellious, and unsafe when the door unlocks after I have walked into my home and I don't notice it.

Only 3 stars because I need the \"Pro\" version to actually use it as a smartlock with Alexa, Google Home, and remote access. The basic lock is simply a mechanical lock with an app. I can only use the lock with the app when I am in close physical proximity to the door.",

I didn't purchase a Connect for this one, so Bluetooth only (bluetooth could be better but works pretty good for the most part). I like being able to open the door with my iphone or apple watch. What's best is no longer worrying about keys for my visitors. I also like the auto-unlock. The only thing I wish August would improve, is to tighten the out of area zone so I can walk my dog and the door locks when I leave my yard and opens when I return.",
