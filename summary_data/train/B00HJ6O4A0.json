I would suggest it for large family gatherings and still like mine just use in shade . Its also easy to carry and has a side pocket to carry things .",

They protect us from the scorching heat of the sand in the summer months and when I roll them up I tap them on the ground before putting in the car and sand falls right off. Love these!!",

I feel like a sheet or towel between you and the mat is necessary for comfort.",
