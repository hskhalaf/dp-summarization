I can see that it takes attention to clean, you don\u2019t just rinse it, you have to get into the nooks and crannies.

In my old one I could sift 4 C flour no issue. With this new one, 1 C was a hassle. Worse, the wires are exposed under the sifter once you take off the removable screen. I sifted my spices and flour together and now there is flour and spice in the crevices by the wires. The entire bowl should be washable! Not just a flimsy Screen. Either purchase as a 1time use item or hunt for a better one elsewhere.",

(If one is good, buy 3 ;-) Nice strong motor for my baking needs. Bottom screen removes so that it can be rinsed off. I gave it 4 stars because the rest of the unit is a little hard to clean, especially after sifting cocoa. This sure beats hand sifting and have been enjoying this addition to my kitchen.",

      "text": "I bought this product and thought it would be the answer to my prayers because I have arthritis in my hands. It is sub-par at best. the flour trickles out of the sifter which takes forever. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you have all day to watch flour trickle through a sifter. This product really sucks.",

Liked it so well just ordered another one. Don't hesitate about ordering. Wonderful product.",
