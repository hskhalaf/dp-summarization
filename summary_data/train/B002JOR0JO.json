I wouldn't know, for instance, if the hanging fixture over the booth at the restaurant, would make me sick until I sat under it for a bit. Now I can just test it. Some bulbs are PUMPING out UV. Compact fluorescents and halogens produce shocking amounts.",

      "text": "Great product, well built. It has two \"scales\" so microwatts/cmsq and milliwatts/cm can be used depending on the intensity of light. Full summer sun in the 12 milliwatt range, while indoor, through curtains, clothing, etc. in 100's of microwatts. One can get a great \"feel\" for the difference in intensity using the two scales. If one keeps in mind that it's uvb sensitivity is only 20-30% of its uva sensitivity, one can still use it to compare the protection various materials provide for sun exposure, just by comparing the *relative* intensity of measurments with/without protection. It cannot \"switch\" between measuring uva, then uvb separately, event though the manual suggests it might be possible.",
