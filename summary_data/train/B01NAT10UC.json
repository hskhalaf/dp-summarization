After spending 3 trips to the animal hospital and $181.00 in antibiotics, anti anxiety, anti fungal, anti microbial and anti itch prescriptions, I tried Vetericyn 2-3 x a day. Within days, the wound began to heal. Within the first week, she stopped licking and chewing and no longer needed a recovery collar. Going on 2 weeks, the granuloma has nearly disappeared.",
