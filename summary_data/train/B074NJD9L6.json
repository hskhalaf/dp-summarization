      "text": "I was nervous getting these boots because I am a petite person with wide calves and since I didn't see any reviews through Amazon or the web on how these boots fit. I decided to take a chance as I already owned a few Nine west boots and order my normal size of 6 (would had purchased a half size if available). When I received the boots, the material is on the thick/minimal stretch side so it fit a little tight but I broke them in and they actually fit comfortably. The heel is just about right for me as shown and listed. Love the classy look and great to wear out for any occasion including work.",

      "text": "Really like these boots. Needed them for a funeral in October and walked around a lot in them. Fit is perfect and they're comfortable. Would recommend. I wear a 6M and the fit is great, even with socks on over my pantyhose inside the boots. (It was COLD up on that mountain)!!! Yep, I really like them and will get a lot of use out of them-hopefully for happier reasons.",

      "text": "This is probably the best boots decision I've made. I'm usually a 5.5 size but when I bought these, the 5.5 cost >200$ but the size 5 was $35! I decided to order the size 5 anyway hoping I could fit. It's a little snug with thick socks but I could definitely wear it! They're comfortable considering the heels and look very classy. The only problem that I have is that the zipper thing is gold. I'd rather it had been brown or black, because the gold sort of stands out a little. But that's just a tiny thing. Overall I'm extremely happy with the purchase!",
