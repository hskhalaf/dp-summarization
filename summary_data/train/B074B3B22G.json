I searched hundreds of products and decided on this. I\u2019m 50 and have a bad lower back. Took a shot. I\u2019m so glad I did. I LOVE this device. So easy to assemble. Different resistances to choose from. The first two days I was SuperWoman. Then the pain hit. Haha. Not my back. My muscles. Took two days off. Got back on. In two months I pulled up on my 10.000 repetition. My core feels stronger which makes my back feel stronger. I\u2019ve lost the love handles and my clothes fit better. I highly recommend this.",

Yes, one could simply do a squat while holding onto a chair, but the advantages of controlling the resistance and/or relying on arm strength are more than worth it.

My counter works so maybe that is hit or miss. I did try out a few pulses just to make sure it would hold me (5\u20195\u201d 205) and it\u2019s solid however, I immediately got off and reduced the tension to one instead of three. I\u2019d highly suggest starting lower until you are sure you will be able to walk the next day. All the pieces are adjustable to its good for all shapes and sizes. The seat is not comfy to me but that\u2019s my only complaint.",
