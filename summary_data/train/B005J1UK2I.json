It's more like a \"hour glass\" shape which would require a wood block or larger base pad of some sort if using on sand or soft grade. Comes with hand crank handle, but order the optional 3/4\" socket for an 18v battery drill ....you'll love it!! Jacks weigh 25 to 30 lbs. each, so consider this when you calculate your CGVW on your trailer. Very satisfied with the quality and this purchase.",

The top has two outward facing \"L\" brackets with three slots on each side for bolting jack to a camper's undercarriage. Again very much like what other jacks have. The jack is held together by bolts, not pins. The jacks are very heavy duty, and will work for my purposes (again.. . Not camper related!).",

The first thing I noticed was that these were much larger than I expected and they protruded from the sides of the trailer a little. That is not a big deal, just something to take into account since they could hit against something. Make sure you measure your trailer well before purchasing and installing these. They are much more robust than the original ones that were on the trailer and I have no doubt that they will last many years of continual use.",

So when I am spinning it, especially with a drill, it's pretty wobbly. It still raises and lowers and seems to hold but I bought new and expected new.... But not returning because it's already bolted on my RV and didn't want to have to remove and send back. Other than that, great product",

These are really over kill for my intended purpose but they work great, installed easily and are easy to operate up or down. I purchased the socket that fits them and can be used with a drill to raise or lower and they work great!",

I haven't camped yet, but they really seemed to tighten up the shake. When I get 2 more it will definitely be solid with most of the sway coming from the tires.",
