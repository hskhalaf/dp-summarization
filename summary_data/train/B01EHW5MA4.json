I was told by my eye doctor that I would need to eventually have eyelid surgery to remove some of the drooping eyelid. It is hereditary, my mom had to have the surgery. So my doctor made a note in my record. I found this product and immediately starting using it. I saw the doctor for my annual exam and he was obviously confused to see the notation in my record that he had made about the eyelid surgery. He comment that he saw no indiction thAt I would need the surgery and removed it from my record.",
