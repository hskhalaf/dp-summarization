The place where you crimp insulated but connectors is to close to the cutting blade. So when you crimp the connector, the insulation gets cut through by the cutting blade. And the crimp notch for the insulated connectors will not go small enough to properly crimp the red connectors to 16 gage wire.",

I was disappointed in the quality of the crimps that the expensive tool was producing. Not only that, but they weren't attractive either. I purchased this tool because I didn't trust the crimps of my expensive tool. I also purchased non-insulated butt connectors to go along with these. Using these with uninsulated butt connectors gives such a satisfying squish every single time. But wait, there's more! The crimps are SUPER solid for both uninsulated and insulated connectors. I will be using these instead of my expensive ratcheting crimp tool.",

They are made in the USA and the quality of them speaks miles. I would highly recommend them especially anyone who deals with electronics and/or wiring and crimping a lot.",
