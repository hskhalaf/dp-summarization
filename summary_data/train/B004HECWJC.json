      "text": "It's true -- American Girl dolls' hair needs a special brush. Now, I'm guessing any wire-bristled brush would do, but since my oldest doll's hair is a disaster because I used a plastic-bristled brush on it all the time, I decided not to take a risk with my new dolls and just get an official AG one. This works well not just for smoothing the hair, but for curling it (the dolls' hair is pliable enough that you can at least sort of get a curl just by twirling it around the brush).",

      "text": "First of all, it's not so much a problem with the brush but with the American Girl doll hair. I mean, can they use worse quality hair? I don't think it's possible. When we paid $125 for a doll with hair to style, we assumed the quality would be at least marginally acceptable. But this hair is stiff as straw and the brush totally buckles under the pressure. After 4 uses, the metal bristles began to bend and pop out. It's very sad they wouldn't offer better quality all around. Buyers beware",
