Excellent Quality via HDMI to an HDTV - full 1920x1080p. Great way to put your pictures on a big flat panel TV. USB port powers portable 2.5\" hard drives. Cons: Several minutes to scan 20GB on a hard drive. Something like 5sec. to change 5Mpixel images - you need to re-size pix to fit the screen. Doesn't promise to and doesn't work with my USB flash drives. Powers the HDMI port when unit is 'off', disabling the auto select function of my HDMI switch.",

Today I did a firmware update (available from the Western Digital website) on it and when re-connecting the hard drive to the old adapter, I thought about using a Thermaltake BlacX ST0005U docking station to hold the hard drive instead the mess of wires and adapter I was using. The docking station works just great, takes up little space, holds any size SATA drive and connects to the Western Digital WD TV HD Media Player using a USB cable. I have just enjoyed almost four hours of very high quality HDTV movies.",

I didn't use it at all to listen to music or to view pictures so I can't comment on these functions it also has. The only flaw is that in HD files (MKV) it doesn't read the DTS sound encoding, so you can see the video but without sound. I hope WD will fix this flaw soon and this will be the perfect media player. In general I am very happy with the device. The 5th start will be given after the firmware upgrade that will allow it to read DTS sound from MKV files.",

At first, it didn't play audio on some of my DVD ripped files until I learned that I have to download a firmware to fix related and other problems that I haven't experienced yet. After updating the player, everything worked fine and even my AVI files played beautifully with my overhead projector on a 120\" screen. The upscaling of the video to HD is excellent. Definitely, I will recommend this unit to all my friends. I just wished I can jump from one chapter to another on a dvd file.",

I have at the moment about 35 disc images for movies and all my pictures on a WD Passport 360GB drive (storage is purchased separately) and the WD Media Player handles them all with ease. The menu is laid out logically and the options are intuitive and simple to invoke. What a fantastic idea!",

There is no search feature, so looking for your favorite music artist can be a drag if you have a midsize to large collection. It only allows you to \"list\" them. Meaning that in order to get to the artists starting with G, you need to browse all you have before that. Same applies to other filters such us Genre or Album.",

Now I dont't have to convert my video files and burn them to a DVD so I can watch them on my TV. The only thing that could really improve on this device is the addition of an ethernet port. But thats just being picky. Sneekernet works just fine. For what it does and for what it cost...You can't go wrong.",

The unit itself gets quite warm, warmer than I would like and so I pull the power plug after each use. Even when not in use, the unit stays warm. 2. The navigation is not great. 3.

      "text": "Quick review: - Took 20 minutes to recognize my external (WD 1Tb), I'm guessing because it was big. So whenever I unplug it to update media files, it takes an additional 20 minutes to load... kind of silly. *note: loads 16gb USB fast... - No power button on console, only on remote (which is small and hides frequently). - Cannot play some of the audio codecs for some files (I don't remember which ones off the top of my head). Plays all my movies well, but some TV episodes lack audio. - On the plus side, the menu organization is intuitive and nice. overall = meh.",

The display is simple and easy to use. I highly recommend this product if most of your media is digital. The only recommendation I would make is that you should buy a dedicated external hard drive as the load time for the Western Digital Media Player is fairly long.",

It does not play Amazon Videos on a Bravia TV that are transferred to an external USB HD after being purchased online and then downloaded to a PC. The same video can be watched on the Bravia but all to often the frequent buffering is intolerable. Someone who purchases a video should be able to view it on any device that he/she owns!! The problem likely lies with Amazon. Until resolved, my purchases of Amazon Videos will be very limited.",
