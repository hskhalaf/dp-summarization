Comfortable when I first put them on after about an hour they started to pinch at the sides, they don't have the arch support I expected. Probably the reason they were so cheap for Keen's, these are bargain basement and not up to scratch.",

For walking sandals they are a good price and I would buy this make, Keen, again. They arrived very promptly and were well packed.",

Added to this a lace capture system which allows for a comfortable and secure fit and you have a sandal that is a must have for any warm day filled with both water and land based activities. For added comfort and support, Keen employ hybrid-ology in the form of a metatomical EVA footbed. This is an anatomically designed internal support mechanism which provides support for the arch and metatarsals and cradles the natural contours of the foot. Metatarsals + anatomical = metatomical. Enhanced traction underfoot is achieved through a multi-directional lug pattern on the outsole which ensures you stay stable over rough terrain or or wet rocks.",
