      "text": "We did a remodel on a little house, and we added a little powder room. We bought this cute little sink. We are just finishing up on the house, and my husband put the sink in. It is leaking internally, even out the back. It looked just like I wanted it to, but now he is removing it after a huge mess. It looks like it was built in 2 pieces, hopefully it is just this one sink. Unfortunately, we just got to open it to mount it, and it is past the time period where we can return it. I hope that the seller can still make this right.",

The only downside is that the faucet filter that comes with the sink allows for too much water to flow out, therefore, causing the water to spill out of the sink. I had to purchase a water-saver filter for lower water flow and that seemed to resolve the issue. Other than that, the instructions and installation was easy.",
