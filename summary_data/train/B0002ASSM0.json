This product helps to minimize these stains. My disappointment is in the packaging. They went cheap. The plastic bottle looks flimsy. Just yesterday, I accidentally knocked it off the counter. I did this with my previous purchase and it was no big deal. However, this time, the spray nozzle broke off and started spilling product all over the floor. I could put the sprayer back on and I had to get another bottle to put the product in. Please use the old bottles and not be so cheap.",

My only complaint is the cost, but we plan on getting the gallon jug to get the most bang for our buck. Long story short, the shampoo works great, smells fantastic, and leaves coats nice and soft (not sticky).",

I just spray, rub, and am done. The scent is more pleasant to me than any Isle of Dogs scents. It does not linger or overpower. I use it several times weekly during the summer. Very fast to use.",

It's still good for a water-less pet shampoo. It's more that this seems to result in fairly superficial clean. Again, for what this is, it's just fine. Not fantastic but definitely good enough.
