Obviously, these aren't intended to be used to drill and tap a 1inch plate there meant for 1/4 inch or less thick plate or sheet metal. I had to drill out some bolts that sheared off in nuts welded to sheet metal and these worked great. You still need to drill a pilot hole that's slightly smaller than the drill and tap but after that, they worked great adding threads back to the holes. Using a wireless impact driver was the way to go as well. Less chance of breaking a tap.",

I used two different bits 10/32 and 10/24, pre-drilled 1/8\" holes and used tap oil on both. In the second try it broke, and the second one broke in just a couple tries also. I pulled out the Milwaukee brand and used the same process without any issues. Same drill, same speed, same oil, same pre-drilled hole. The Milwaukee brand was able to drill thru with no issues. So, I assume it is cheap steel or poor machining, but not worth it at even half the price.",
