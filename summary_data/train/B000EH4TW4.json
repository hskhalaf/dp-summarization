I wish Coleman would have provided instructions on the proper way to fold it. I may need to buy a smaller one that can be folded in half and then rolled so it is easier to fit on the motorcycle. Other than that, it was great. I would recommend it.",

A bit on the heavy side for backpacking, but perfect for horseback camping trips (especially in higher altitudes where even summer nights can dip below freezing).",

I mean it shouldn't be a problem if you just put it in your trunk and travel with it. But if you are planning on going on a camping trip where you need to park your car and walk a few miles, this might not be the best choice for you. After came back from our camping trip, my wife wanted to use it home. That's how warm and comfortable they are :)",

    "description": "Sleep comfortably--even when the temperature dips below freezing--with the Coleman Big Game Big and Tall Adult Sleeping Bag. Long enough for people up to 6 feet 7 inches in height, this adult sleeping bag is designed to keep you warm in temperatures as low as 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The cotton canvas cover and cozy cotton flannel liner retain heat, so you feel warm from head to toe. For additional comfort, a Thermolock draft tube helps prevent heat from escaping through the zipper, and a ComfortCuff surrounds your face in soft, warm fabric. Fiberlock construction keeps the insulation from shifting, reducing cold spots and increasing durability. A two-way patented ZipPlow zipper system plows fabric away from the zipper to prevent snags and frustration. And the Roll Control design and Wrap 'N Roll integrated packing system make this backpacking sleeping bag easy to roll and pack. The Big Game Sleeping Bag is machine washable and comes with a matching flannel pillow.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nStay snugly warm as you slumber on camping and hunting excursions with the Coleman Big Game sleeping bag, which is rated to temperatures as low as -5 degrees Fahrenheit. It's filled with five pounds of Holofill 808 insulation, which offers high-loft, hollow-core fibers that prevent body heat from escaping, thus holding more air inside the bag for good warmth. This super king-sized, rectangular sleeping bag measures 40 by 85 inches, and will fit most sleepers up to 6 foot, 7 inches. Other features include a heavy duty cotton cover material, cotton flannel liner, an included pillow, and Coleman's exclusive set of ComfortSmart sleeping bag technologies, including: \n\n * ZipPlow: Prevents zipper snags by plowing fabric away from zipper \n * FiberLock: Prevents insulation from shifting, increasing durability \n * ThermoLock: Reduces heat loss through the zipper, keeping you warmer \n * Zipper GlideTailoring: Allows smooth zipper operation around the corner \n * Comfort Cuff: Surrounds your face with softness \n * Roll Control: Locks bag in place for easier rolling \n\n About Coleman\nThe Coleman Company has been creating and innovating products for recreational outdoor use since W.C. Coleman started selling gasoline-powered lanterns in 1900. Inventor of the hugely popular fold-up camp stove, Coleman developed a plastic liner for his galvanized steel coolers in 1957--the birth of the modern cooler--and the company has been improving their utility and design ever since. The array of products that bear the Coleman name now includes just about everything you might need to work or play outdoors, from tents and sleeping bags to boats, backpacks, and furniture.",
