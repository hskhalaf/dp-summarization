The removable insole was another positive feature which the purchasers loved. However, there were complaints the soft upper material, the narrow sole, and the quality issues. In the end, the verdict as to whether it is the best footgear to wear for long distances or periods was debatable as many recommended replacing the insole for more underfoot comfort and support.",

These are super light, and so comfy it's like slippers. The uppers are a woven nylon type stuff with a large open weave. I can see how they would easily snag and tear if you wore them for yard work, for instance. The sole is very light and flexible. My usual size 11's were way too big, and even ordering down a size makes for a comfortable not-snug fit. Will be my shoe for life.",
