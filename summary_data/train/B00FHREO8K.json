      "text": "I've just gone though my second one of these. Both of which lasted about two months of use on a daily basis for less than an hour a day. They both just stopped working. Nothing dramatic, just all of a sudden the phone just stopped recognizing that it was there. Other than the short life span, it's a great product for me. I primarily play snes and gba games though an emulator on my 5s, so the d-pad control is great for me. I would probably buy another, however it doesn't look like they're available for Prime anymore. Five stars if I didn't have to buy a new one every two months.",

As such, I don't believe this to be the fault of the manufacturer or this product itself as most games/apps are indeed designed only for the iPhone's touch screen. The saving grace, though, and the reason why I'm giving this a high 4 stars is because of the battery function and the very well-made design and over-all quality of this product. In other words, it's a very nice case-- giving my old iPhone 5 newfound life as a portable gaming-console-like feel and it doubles the iPhone's battery which is a perfect boredom killer for my son.",

The face buttons are bad because they are a little too small to fit me. They work great, it's just that they're too small. If they were any bigger they would be perfect.

Other than that, this controller is amazing. Great battery life, charges your phone, not bulky but very useful and it fits it most guy-pockets. If they gave it a joystick of sorts, I would have rated it 5/5",

      "text": "Not a bad controller overall, battery life seems a bit on the short side, but the controls themselves are good. I primarily bought this to play World of Tanks Blitz because I'm terrible with on-screen touch controls. It works well in that regard, but of course aiming the gun still requires swiping the screen as it doesn't have a right thumbstick. On a pure platformer like Limbo it is excellent. One downside is that I often forget to take out the headphone adapter before removing the phone from the case, which I'm sure is a quick path to breakage; that hasn't happened yet, but it is something to keep in mind.",

The controller feel is nice, I really wish it was worth keeping. The directional pad is garbage though. I saw other comments, but I decided to try it anyway. Ended up returning it.",
