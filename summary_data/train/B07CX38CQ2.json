When I let the right bud lie against my chest, the touch controls turned it off. However if you keep them in your ears no problem. I've found it easiest to adjust volume dramatically, using the entire pad of my finger all the way from under the bud and dragging all the way up to where it starts to curve. After getting the hang of it these are quite nice. If you have sensitive ear canals beware, putting these in is extra suction-cuppy.",
