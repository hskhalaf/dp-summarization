Cork extraction from the screw also works just fine, although you do have to squeeze the handles tightly because the cork is considerably smaller diameter than the neck of the bottle.

The second one worked a few times but other parts began to loosen up (the rod that the lever slides up and down on). I would return it but I am so angry that the effort doesn't seem worth the $24.",

As you can see in the picture the silver metal splined component came unseated from it's position and this renders the device useless.",
