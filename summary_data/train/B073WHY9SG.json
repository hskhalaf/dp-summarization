I have only had the laptop for 2 months and only started using it more heavily recently due to university starting soon. I noticed the connection drops every 5 or so minutes, sometimes even faster. I bought a USB3 to Ethernet cable to actually have a stable connection for the time being, but this requires me to be connected via an ethernet cable. I'd rather they fixed this issue as I don't want to have to buy an external WiFi card and use up a USB port.",

Don't know if mine was just faulty or not which is a shame because it was a great laptop before these issues.",
