We display all 4 of them on our counter next to our oven, and we still have plenty of space for our dishes or whatever else we need to put on the counter in front of them. Highly recommend! I would suggest this size and not go smaller, because I can see the smaller options not being able to hold normal cooking utensils well.",

Very good product. In fact, this is my second order because I love the one I have and when I gifted them my friends loved them too. Got plenty of complements from my cooking friends. All kitchens deserve this spoon rest. Beautiful colors too. Order them. You will not be sorry.",

      "text": "The things I like most about these spoon rests are that they don't slide and they don't scratch the surface of my glass-top stove. I've always relied on the odd saucer to hold my sloppy cooking utensils, but these work much better - the cooking spoons and whatnot are stable and don't slip off onto the counter. They also nest really well so that they're easy to store.",
