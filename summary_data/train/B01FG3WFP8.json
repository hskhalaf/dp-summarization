We use it without the infuser/tea leaf holder and there is no problem. Once a month I run white vinegar through it to clean it out and get rid of the mineral deposits. DO NOT TRY AND SCRUB THE DEPOSITS WITH A BRILLO PAD! Use a white vinegar solution. It will work like magic.",

I do wish that it would beep when the water finished boiling so that I wouldn't need to stay in the kitchen while it's on, but overall it is a good kettle.",

It\u2019s pretty big so for one person you just add a little water but for multiple cups it\u2019s great because it heats up so quickly.",
