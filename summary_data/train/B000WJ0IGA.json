Now, just a month old and the hinge is broken, the dogs got locked out. Great! So I go to Lowe's, get a $78 regular dog door, get it home. Guess what?!

      "text": "We ended up returning this. The \"door\" is very hard plastic and it kept hitting/pinching my dogs tail so he was scared to use it. We also got the smaller door (he is a 12 ld dog) but it still seemed like a tight squeeze for him. We never got around to testing the lock function because he became too afraid to use the door, but the dongle that is supposed to go on his collar looked like it was going to be a bit big for wearing all the time. (PS manufacturer should invent a door that literally opens like a garage door when the dog is near - that would be really cool!)",

They said we needed to adjust the sensor since our dog's favorite spot is so close to the door. (We can hear the door try to click open when he plops down.) That's given us a better understanding of why it drained the batteries While we still have to replace the batteries every few months, it is because the dog likes to sit near the door when he's watching us have dinner. We can take off his collar when there is a large gathering and there is no issue.",

Every time the battery falls out you have to reprogram the product and 50% of the time, it won't reprogram. So, so disappointed especially after I took the time to install this dog door.
