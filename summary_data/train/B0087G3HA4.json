After testing it a few times, I am confident it is highly accurate, which is what I was expecting since it was one of the US NHTSA's approved devices for police use. I think the mid-level pricing was worth the added accuracy and NHTSA's assurance. Very satisfied! Anyone who complains about inaccuracy probably didn't follow directions (i.e. no smoking, eating or drinking 30 minutes prior to use).",
