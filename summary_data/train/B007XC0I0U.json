      "text": "I bought this to speed the demolition of an old, single wide mobile home. It was clear from the start this was NOT the equivalent to big name brands know for their high quality. The lower jaws of the nibbler tended to spread over time, causing poor cuts, forcing you to wrangle the tool at all times to keep it cutting. I would say this is a tool for a couple of big jobs at best, then just give it to Goodwill, and write off your donation. Wish I could have left a better review. :(",

However it doesn't even move on a higher gauge so check the description verify the gauge and know what you're trying to cut. But it is good for the described gauge you have to hold it up a little and it goes it's kind of fun.",
