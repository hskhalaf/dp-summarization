      "text": "Had this ice cream scooper for just over a month and always hand washed it, hand dried it, etc. as I do with more delicate dishes. The scooper became very pitted (small holes all over it) and basically fell apart in tiny chips, making it unusable. After reading more about this scooper on other websites, it seems that this is a known problem! This scooper is a waste of money. Avoid the Zeroll scooper. To replace it, I recently purchased the OXO Good Grips Solid Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scoop and it is a much better product!",

I took a pic of this scoop today (it's been two years, since I've purchased it). Pretty much looks as good as the day I bought it and believe me, it has been through some serious use.

I was under the impression that I\u2019d be able to get a full scoop without having to let my ice cream sit out and thaw, or put it in the microwave. Unfortunately, even using as directions state, I\u2019m only getting tiny slivers. It is sturdy, so that\u2019s a plus.. but I\u2019m disappointed that I paid $20 for a scoop that doesn\u2019t actually do what it\u2019s supposed to. I still have to let my ice cream sit out in order to get a full scoop.",

In order to justify this to myself I compared what I would save if I skipped two ice cream stand trips and instead made perfect beautiful scoops at home. Checkout! The 2 ounce scoop looked just a bit large compared to what I remembered seeing ice cream scooped with as a kid, but the result is near perfect scoops for ice cream cones comparable to our local ice cream stand.",

No arm or lever that tries to scrapes or pushes ice cream out, it uses the heat of your hand to do all that. Easy clean just give it a quick rinse to wash off already melted ice cream and let dry.",

Make sure you only hand wash these though. They have a liquid inside of them that heats up to your body temperature as you hold it and scoop. It makes it so the ice cream comes out of the scooper into the bowl really easily. If you stick them in the dishwasher it gets too hot and then that function won't work any longer. Still a great scooper without that function.",
