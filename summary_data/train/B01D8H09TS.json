Before this my most expensive and used keyboard was the Logitech Mk550. I was content with using that forever but eventually it just stopped working (even with fresh batteries). So I finally decided to try out a mechanical keyboard. God! It feels so good to type on. That and sound makes me feel like I'm doing important work - even when writing a review on Amazon that only 5 people would see.",

Maybe I got a defective product but I don't know. Maybe it the preference differs from person to person.. But for me I did not like it.",

Keys come out relatively easy but not too easy that I do it on accident, you know? The LEDs are nice, the software is easy to use and even comes with macros and such. Has a 3 brightness dim button on the keyboard which is nice. The media controls are super nice and have a premium feel like the rest of the board. The USB passthrough works great althought it makes for a really thick USB cable which is somewhat difficult to cable manage, but not a huge deal. No regrets with the purchase.",

If you're looking for a quieter keyboard this is not for you since you will be hearing that click clack that the mechanical keyboard makes.

      "text": "So I remember picking up this keyboard 3 years ago when I got my first desktop computer. Back in 2017, this keyboard was quite a bit more expensive (almost 200 dollars); however, after doing some researching and reading reviews I decided to take the plunge despite the occasional \"my keyboard light went out\" review. I can happily say that I don't regret making this purchase at all. after all this time, not a single one of my keyboard light has gone out, everything is still very functional. Yes, it might get dusty after some time, but it doesn't bother me personally.",

Sometimes when I boot up the Corsair Utility Engine it doesn't detect that I have a Corsair keyboard connected so I'd ultimately have to restart Windows or disconnect and reconnect the keyboard itself.",

However Corsair is still one of the most known brands so I see why they mark up their prices, also these switches are the real deal. So worth the money IMHO.",

They are also a bit more quiet than the Razer's or MX blues, which I've previously have. It feels really good to type on, let alone game. The color profiles are really awesome, but that's just icing on the cake. No macro buttons are my only hangup, but I don't use them anyway, but I might have. I can always figure out other macros. This keyboard feels and looks like quality. The packaging was amazing. The software isn't as buggy as my Razer Blackwidow Ultimate.",

      "text": "I did not know I needed this keyboard until I bought it. Its the best mechanical keyboard I have owned. Was using a CM quickfire TK and this was sort of an impulse buy as my quickfire functions fine, but I could not go back to it after using the K70 rapidfire. The aesthetics are amazing, the cherry Mx speed switches are amazing, the led and customization of the keyboard is top notch. If you are on the fence about whether or not this keyboard is a worthy upgrade I highly recommend it.",

The best part of the whole thing is how easy it is to be able to read the keys during a late night gaming session and before you ask, yes. There is a HUGE difference between this and the basic keyboards I was using and I don't think I can ever willingly go back to a non-mechanical. Corsair did a great job with this keyboard and Im sure it will last me an eternity considering the thing is heavy and made mostly of aluminum.",

I contacted corsair support to help me with the case and they were unresponsive. But thank god amazon support is letting me return the product.
