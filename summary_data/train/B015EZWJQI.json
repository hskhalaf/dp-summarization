His feet do not stink in these, he doesn\u2019t wear out the toes and heels in these, and they never slouch in him.

What makes them so good? 1. Great fit. 2. The foot padding is very comfortable. As someone with plantar fasciitis, this is very important to me. Its nice padding that absorbs shock with not bulking-up underfoot or feeling weird. 3. Really seems to whisk away foot-sweat, even in the thicker pad part. Could not be more pleased.",
