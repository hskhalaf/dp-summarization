      "text": "This soap is amazing!! We have recently switched over to natural products after reviewing EWG ratings and seeing basically everything we use is terribly unhealthy...i was pretty hesitant about laundry detergent. I was nervous our clothing wouldn't feel clean. I was WRONG!! Molly's suds clean SO well, don't leave any icky buildup on the clothing, and are not harmful to our skin! I love the packaging, nice and little. I empty the bag into a glass jar with a lid so the packaging gets thrown away anyway, and there is barely any of it, no clunky container, meaning much less waste in our trash. I am definitely converted to Molly's suds from now on. Very happy to have found it!!",

Now it is yet another product I have to give away, since it can't be returned after using. It's my problem, not theirs. I just wish these companies sold product in sample sizes.",

I mean they smell CLEAN. My pillow case has gotten softer, and the bargain that you get for this product is outstanding! Plus, the EWG rates this product as one of the best.

The bag packaging, which I think others have mentioned, isn't ideal - a box might be more manageable and those recloseable zippers aren't always user-friendly, especially with a product that will last this long. My only problem was that about the top 1/3 of the bag was full of lumps, many pebble size but a couple near egg size that made it hard to scoop. I ended up breaking them up and crumbling by hand, which was a little more hands-on than I intended to get with this product.",

Brighter than bleached white! The smell was completely gone! I couldn\u2019t have been more ecstatic. If you\u2019re on the fence... get off and get this stuff.
