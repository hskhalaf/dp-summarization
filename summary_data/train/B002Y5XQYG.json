      "text": "I had an iHome speaker dock like this and it just puked one day. Finding 30-Pin options has been getting tougher and tougher but thankfully I found this Philips unit. So far I'm very happy with it. For the size it puts out impressive sound including decent bass. I use it in my office for background/ambiance and it's been excellent so far. A few small issues... The docking connection is a little stiff and the power button is hard to slide. Frankly, these are small issues. Overall I'm very happy with this.",

The sound quality is excellent and my husband is picky about these things.",

I listened to probably 10 different docks before finding this one and then ordering on Amazon. Some of the ones that cost twice as much sounded half as good. This won't fill a room with music, it is just intended to provided a little personal music that you can move about. That said, I think the bass is pretty good for its small size. Not much high end and not audiophile quality but an absolute bargain.",

So I returned it to Philips and received a replacement, same problem, except now the replacement AC adapter doesn't work well (it seems too cheap). So basically the power supply doesn't always work, or will shut off by itself mid-song then come back on maybe ten seconds later, if I can ever get the product to work at all! I generally like Philips, but this product needs some major improvements.",

It also charges your Ipod, Iphone or Itouch while in use. The only difference that I've noticed between my friends and mine is that her speaker can operate on battery only too, almost as if when its plugged in, the speaker is 'charged'....

Turned up high the depth of sound becomes God awful. So if audio quality is a concern then I highly recommend the Logitech S715i Portable which (while more expensive) does everything the Philips Fidelio SBD7500 does but with considerably better sound.",

The app that you can download to use with it works very nicely and has an easy user interface. The design is attractive and sleek.

    "title": "Philips Fidelio SBD7500 30-Pin iPod/iPhone Speaker Dock (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Product Packaging:Frustration-Free PackagingPhilips Sbd7500/37 Ipod/Iphone Portable Speaker Dock (Personal Audio / Stereo Systems & Boomboxes)\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n Designed for music-lovers on the go, the Philips docking speaker is a high-fidelity, highly-portable speaker for your iPod or iPhone. The speaker features a slim, elegant profile that neatly fits into any briefcase or bag. Bass-enhancing technologies ensure a powerful listening experience at home or on the go. The docking speaker also supports Philips' DockStudio app, which unlocks additional features, such as custom alarms and sound settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nPHILIPS DOCKING SPEAKER FOR IPOD & IPHONE\nAT A GLANCE:\n\n * Neodymium speaker provides optimum bass response and pure, balanced audio\n * DBB preserves low tones for deep bass at any volume\n * wOOx technology provides rich, precise bass without distortion\n * Shielding technology blocks mobile phone interference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompact and portable, the docking speaker delivers mind-blowing sound wherever life takes you.\n\n\n\nThe slim, attractive design is combined with a powerful bass that doesn't compromise sound integrity. View larger.\n\nNEODYMIUM CONSTRUCTION FOR RICH, BALANCED SOUND\n The Philips docking speaker has been engineered to deliver crisp, detailed sound that will satisfy even the most attentive listeners. Thanks to its neodymium magnets, the speaker is able to produce pure sound with superior bass response. Highs, mids, and lows are all rendered in exquisite detail, so you can hear your music as it was meant to be heard.\n\nBASS-ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES FOR BOOMING AUDIO\n Unlike some sound systems that swallow up the high and mid ranges when you turn up the bass, the docking speaker delivers powerful bass while still preserving fidelity. The speakers use Philips' proprietary wOOx technology to produce clean, undistorted bass. With wOOx, you can enjoy deep bass while still hearing all the details in your music.\n\n If you prefer your music with even more kick, you can activate Dynamic Bass Boost (DBB) with the touch of a button. DBB helps emphasize the bass content of music, allowing you to feel the 'thump' of the bass even when the volume is low. The result is a richer, more robust sound at all volumes.\n\nDESIGNED TO GO PLACES\n An International Consumer Electronics Show 2010 Innovations honoree, the docking speaker sports a slim design that can comfortably fit into a briefcase or backpack. It can run on either battery or AC power, giving you power options for anywhere you go. And thanks to the included carrying case, you can transport the speaker anywhere without worry.\n\nFREE DOCKSTUDIO APP UNLOCKS ADDITIONAL FEATURES\n If you own an iPod Touch or an iPhone, you can unlock even more features for your speaker using the complementary DockStudio app. This exclusive app allows you to navigate your music collection more easily and control sound settings. It also gives you access to Digital Sound Control, which lets you fine-tune your speaker to suit your acoustic preferences. You can even use the app to set customized music alarms, so you'll wake up to your favorite music every morning.\n\nDOCK ANY IPHONE OR IPOD, EVEN IN ITS CASE\n The speaker's spring-loaded docking port accommodates any iPhone or iPod, without special adaptors. What's more, it works even when most protective cases are on--just dock your iPhone or iPod as is for fuss-free enjoyment of your music.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY AND WARRANTY INFORMATION\n The speaker is compatible with iPod; iPod touch; iPod touch 2nd generation (8/16/32 GB), 3rd gen and 4th gen; iPod nano 1st through 6th generations; iPod 5th generation; iPod classic; iPod mini; iPod with color display; and all iPhone models. \n\n The Philips docking speaker is backed by a limited one-year warranty. \n\nABOUT PHILIPS\n Philips has a brand promise of \"sense and simplicity\" that encapsulates their commitment to understanding and catering to the desires and needs of consumers. By putting end users front and center, Philips creates products designed around people's needs and aspirations that are both comprehensive and easy to use.
