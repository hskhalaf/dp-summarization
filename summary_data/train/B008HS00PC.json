If they could just make the belly section out of the same stuff as the thigh section, it would have been divine.

It does nothing but make me feel slightly more supported. I should have gone with a medium. The legs roll up constantly and the bodice is so long I could put it over my breasts like a tube top. Definitely size down if you want more smoothing out. I feel like this is more for women who are 30+ weeks pregnant.",
