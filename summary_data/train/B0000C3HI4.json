It is also fast and silent, extra silent if you use \"silent\" mode. The only drawback I see to this printer is that the black ink cartridge is a small one. I did notice that when you do fast prints, very fast it tries to save ink so this may or may not be an issue, I am still on my first tanks of ink. If you want to print photos then you really cant go wrong this printer, it is very impressive.",

The much-feared manual alignment amounted to a mouse click. The photos produced are, to my eye at least, stunning.

Yes, the printer does come with five, but after printing out 100 pictures, the ink level has barely moved! Reading all the reviews, the printer was praised for it's use of ink!

      "text": "I just received my printer yesterday as a gift and it's the best one I've owned, hands down. I've printed an array of images from 4x6 to 8x11 and all of them are excellent. I also have a Canon PowerShot camera so I was able to start printing pictures without hooking it up to the PC. The detail is amazing and the colors are very vivid. Definately will be recommending this one.",

Manual is extremely easy to follow.",

It works great if you have a Canon digital camera!!",

Much to my surprise this is twice as slow as the 900 &9000 (which prints 2 color pages in 1 minute). This does 1 color page per minute, for some reason Canon has slowed this new model down if your looking for speed, this is not your baby.",
