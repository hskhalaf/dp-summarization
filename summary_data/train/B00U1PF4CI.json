The tracker pad is almost unusable at times so I always needed a mouse. 13 months after purchase and 1 month after the warranty ended the machine will not start. Suspect that the internal power has blown and potentially take then motherboard with it. I will update if this is not the case.",

Costs a few bob, but I cannot fault it, and for once for a new laptop it is not pre-loaded with unwanted manufacturer software, kudos to Dell. Battery life, compact size and lightness were the main reasons I chose it and all three aspects are great. I never thought that i would actually find the touchscreen useful, proven wrong on that front, it makes complete sense every now and again. Even other little things, like the fact it is not covered in those silly little stickers, just one intel one are delightful. All round great product.",

Intel i7 processor very quick and allied with SSD makes for a user friendly laptop than will handle anything you throw at it. Slimline case with brushed aluminium finish doesn't hurt the feel good factor either but does limit the ports available (only one usb). Only downside was windows 8.1 but have taken free upgrade? to 10 and time will tell if Microsoft stick to their pledge. Display on this laptop is as good if not better than a retina display and for the money you get much better hardware than anything you can get from apple. Well worth the money.",

Performance: five stars as expected with this specification no separate graphic card but average standard for this size . Screen: five stars touch screen I can`t find any problems, I like it. Battery life: three stars average. I can not understand 15 hours from the advertisement by Dell, maybe if you put to the sleep mode. I think 5 hours max. with normal ( for me) performance and usage. This is understandable with so beautiful screen. Value for money: four stars, little bit pricy at the moment. Summary: 4 stars. Very recommended.",

Went through the steps of activating Windows etc and after about 2 hours switched it off. Then when turned on the 2nd time, it did not work! Nothing happened after switching it on for the 2nd time. Not sure what was going on? Was it just a faulty piece? The power cord also was a bit of a hit and miss!! Sent it back promptly. Not sure if I should buy another one or go for something else....",

There were a lot of reports of high fan noise, heat, etc. but with the newest BIOS A03 (as of May 2015) the thermal management seems to have stabilized and the fan does not turn on unless there are heavy tasks, and when these tasks stop the fan will stop. So with this one problem removed, it's all good. Fantastically good screen. Touchscreen works as well as Win 8.1 supports. The very high screen resolution might make some programs unusable, but in that case you just tune to half resolution for those programs. Review based on a machine from work.",
