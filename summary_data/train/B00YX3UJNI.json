Overall, it wasn't that difficult, just the instructions were frustrating at first. The product itself is perfect! It looks great and is very high quality. Oh, one other downfall was the drywall mounts. The bolts provided did not fit the drywall mounts that were included. I ended up just mounting a 2x4 into the studs and then mounted the rail to the 2x4. I felt more secure doing it that way anyhow, as the rail and doors are rather heavy.",

Put doors up to rails and there was barely enough room to get them on maybe a 1/4\" gap. Well they won't fall of at any rate. But I could put a threshold under them like I wanted.

It worked out great and the kit was everything I expected it to be. You do need a few tools, but nothing super difficult to find in the garage or borrow from a friend. I had a friend of mine install the tracks and doors after he built them and he said it was fairly easy, even though the instructions have nothing but pictures. Great buy and I would definitely buy another in the future for other projects.",
