This is a remarkably fine item for the price and I'm sooo glad I took a chance on it! Thank you, Amazon! You came through like gangbusters!",

Maybe overtime the lid will be easier to remove but I\u2019m afraid the handle will become loose over time if not break trying to remove the lid. Not sure if it\u2019s meant to be that way or if this is defective. Little disappointed but need it for a party this weekend. I\u2019ll just leave it open and leave the lid off which just means ice will melt quicker.",

However, I really like that it is so easy to removed and clean if needed, plus the holes in the bottom help drain any water (it stays within the plastic part so it doesn't drip down to the copper part). Mine arrived in flawless condition. It's very pretty as part of my bar set and seems like it will hold up well. Plus the tongs that come with it are super cute! Definitely recommend!",

And the worst part was when you open the lid the whole liner comes with it. I'm not about to put something out for my guests and have them decipher how to make it work. So disappointed!",

I had to scrub it clean and was still kinda nauseated. I was entertaining that weekend and didn\u2019t have the opportunity to return it. I would give it 5 stars if not for that. It still gets me upset whenever I wash it. The outside however. Is very beautiful.",

The liner does not fasten to the container so when you try to lift the lid, the liner (and it\u2019s ice) comes out of the container, leaving you holding the lid and the liner in your hand, I would not recommend the ice bucket to be used as an ice bucket. Maybe as an evensive planter or large too caddy. This ice bucket will not work as an ice bucket.",
