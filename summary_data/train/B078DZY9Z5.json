It ends the constant \"grind, look, repeat\" process we teachers endure. It stops when the pencil is sharp, and boy do I mean SHARP! I have heard quieter sharpeners, but this one is not any louder than the others I've heard. I've been extremely pleased with this purchase. EXPLANATION OF ATTACHED PHOTO: A customer just asked a question about purchasing an adapter replacement for one that was accidentally destroyed. I thought a photo of the adapter's information might be helpful.",

You have to hold on to it while sharpening a pencil because you have to push down very hard on the pencil to get the sharpener to work, and you also have to hold on to the pencil tightly or the pencil just spins. This sharpener does not stop when the pencil is sharpened. It's stops because you have to push down on the pencil so hard that it runs and then it stops. Worst Quality pencil sharpener I've ever used. I only gave 1 star so I could leave a review. DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE!!",

I will attach a photo comparing the factory point of a Dixon Ticonderoga #2, with the JARLINK point. The difference is remarkable.

This one you can plug in and go ( optional battery operation as well). I also like how compact this one is, not bulky like those usually seen in offices. The only tiny thing that could be added is maybe a brush for occasionally clean out the shaving bits that trapped behind those blades? All and all, very happy. Let's see how long it will last.",

I am a school teacher and have had Heavy Duty pencil sharpeners. THIS IS NOT HEAVY DUTY! That being said, it did sharpen my pencil with a fine tip; thus the 3 starts.",

It sharpens all the way around evenly and it shuts off once the pencil is sharp. My only qualm is that the hole isn't very big and i have a hard time sharpening my colored pencils that are shaped like a triangle. It works perfectly for regular sizes pencils though and with a little finagling, I can get the triangular ones sharpened. I have been using it religiously for months and it hasn't let me down yet. Would recommend!!!",

It does that job really well but after using it for a month in a half the plug input on the device got pushed in so when we try to plug the cord into the sharpener it doesn't make a connection which means we are not able to plug the device into the wall and that we have to use batteries to power the sharpener. We're 15 days over the return date so we either have to choose to spend money on batteries forever or buy another device which is pretty disappointing. I wouldn't suggest someone buying this.",

Also, since the hole is on the top, all my kids (ages 3 to 8) can manage using it without the sharpener moving around on the desk (like with a front-load sharpener). It is also easy to empty, which is another bonus.",

Blade is very sharp and pencils/colored pencils are sharpened in seconds, with auto stop so that lead does not break from over sharpening. 3 power sources - battery, USB port or adapter to plug in. Clear top half of unit allows you to see when to empty shavings and is easy to open, portable so it can be used anywhere, quiet, and designed well so that it does not tip over. I even like the blue color. Well worth the money I paid for the unit, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a good, strong sharpener.",
