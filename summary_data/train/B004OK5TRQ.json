      "text": "I wasn't sure what this was going to sound like. I wasn't going for any particular tone, but I wanted something a bit more on the distortion side to compliment the Green River Drive I've been using for OD. Took me a while to mess with the EQ and get that right, but now that I've dialed that in I'm really impressed by this guy. Really musical, somewhat crunchy sounds can be achieved across the gain spectrum, but I'm most impressed by the unusually beautiful tones I can get at lower gain settings. It's also great with a boost in front of it for really, stupidly high-gain (but still more vintage sounding) tone.",

Overall, it's a good value and I keep it on my practice pedal board. I primarily use it with a Gibson Les Paul, but also occasionally with a Fender Strat as well.",

The Dark Matter fits perfectly. It'll do a full on distortion as well, but backing off on the gain and level adds just the right amount of dirt for the country tunes that need it. I'm playing a Strat into a Deluxe Reverb RI, and this is the exact sound I was looking for when a Fender clean just doesn't cut it.",
