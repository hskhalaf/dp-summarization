There was a huge finger scoop in it and the container was 1/3 empty. Also, the lid was scuffed up and had some kind of residue on it. I'm asking for a refund immediately.",

I use this at night before bed and then gloss over it. I've been doing that everyday for about a week now and I've definitely seen a difference in my lips! Throughout the day I don't ever use chapstick anymore, and two months ago I was constantly attached to a tube of chapstick to keep my lips from cracking. Now they're soft and wonderful!!",

Plus if you happen to taste it, it is super yummy. Softens your lips and removes dead skin....reveals a super kissable lip and they stay soft for a good couple of days. I like to use this once a day, but some people only use once or twice a week. Amazon sometimes has this on a lightning deal and sometimes you get three for one price (best deal), so look for that often....it's worth it! This stuff is great, I highly recommend.",

I reiterate, I am not a new user of this product, and I truly feel the ones I have ordered from Amazon are either faulty or old. Disappointingly, these are being returned to Amazon.",

It\u2019s a little gentle so it won\u2019t get rid of all your dead strips on your lips on the first go if your mouth is currently like the Sahara Dessert, but it only took me two to three days of application (once a day, sometimes twice in three days) and some help from regular lip balm (I use Carmex) application to go from totally rough to super smooth!",

I use it once every 2-3 days. My lips show a complete difference and now lipstick goes on like a dream! I will definitely repurchase this product.",

Personally, I use it every day before bedtime but I recommend starting slow and maybe using it 2-3 times per week. I'm pleasantly surprised with this purchase and highly recommend it.",

Also: it tastes kinda nice :) There's a slight residue after you wash the actual exfoliating scrub off your lips that tastes just fine.",

They were rough, peeling (I wasn't helping the cause by pulling the skin off), and chapstick wasnt cutting it. Found this on Amazon and gave it a shot. I swear, it seemed like an overnight miracle. My lips were smoother and no longer chapped. I use this just about every night now. Love this stuff!",
