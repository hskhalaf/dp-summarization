Both sets of parents have shared videos and still photos of the babies watching/playing with this toy.

When the toy talks, it\u2019s toy half sways back and forth. It\u2019s cute, and the baby loves it, but the hum of the motor is pretty loud. Aside from those two issues, it\u2019s a great toy.",

My younger son likes to beat on Rockit and dance along with him. My only concern is that my younger son holds onto Rockit when he's moving (preventing him from moving) and I can hear a grinding noise. I worry the motor might wear out.",
