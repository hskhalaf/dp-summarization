I just purchased a John Boos butcher block kitchen island. It's beautiful, and it's a focal point in my kitchen, so I want to keep it properly maintained. I went online to research different mineral oils, and decided to give Cutting Board's product a try. I am very pleased with their product and will continue to use it in the future.",

This product was perfect for the job. It has protected the wood and in fact looks better with this treatment. Yes it\u2019s an oil you need to apply and I tried paper towel which worked but I felt that by using my bare fingers I could feel and rub the oil in better. Cleaning my hands was simple. So far, I\u2019m very happy with this product and very happy to have it on hand for future treatments. This bottle goes a long way!",

How do you know if your blade needs to be re-mineralize? If you are asking the question, that is a pretty good indication that it needs to be done. Because this oil is just the right weight, it penetrates well and doesn't leave the kind of grease that attracts dirt. You still have to wipe it up/in with a clean rag, but it is really simple and effective. I always have a couple bottles in the closet; it is just that handy.",

      "text": "Attempted to use a food grade mineral oil to load knife strop, and it worked very well. It soaked into the leather very well and has not required a reapplication for quite a long time. I am not a knife strop expert... Not sure if food grade mineral oil is the way to go, or, if it really matters. But, this oil made the leather perfect (in my mind) for sharpening knives. Razor sharp knife gives this oil 5 stars.",

Maybe a bit more expensive than I wanted but it gets the job done without using a bunch of the oil. Would recommend.",

It is the consistency that you'd expect (similar to baby oil) and has almost no detectable odor.

I applied the oil liberally to one side and allowed it to seep in for 24 hours. WOW, what a difference. The board soaked up all the oil and looks brand new. I flipped it over and repeated the process on the opposite side with great success.",

You can usually sink it in a tub of mineral oil overnight and it will usually fix its self. This stuff is great.",

After using this Mineral oil on the refrigerator I have not had to clean prints off of it. That was about 3 weeks ago. AMAZING.",

The sponge dabber for that purpose might be a bit of a pain. But, I could always remove the cover and pour it on the surface ;).",
