The picture is of attic in the dark. Great night vision. You can also record and zoom in. I could even dpeak to my husband while hecwad up there.",

So, when the card gets full, I have to take it out of the camera, put it in my computer and delete all the videos manually before putting it back in and re-initializing it. Also, the app doesn't have any method for deleting videos individually from the micro-sd card, and so the only way to selectively delete videos is, again, to put the card in my computer with the adapter and delete the file.

My only complaint is that the motion detection on all their cameras is soooo incredibly sensitive that even a blowing leaf will set it off. They need to make some updates to their cameras sensitivity levels it goes from level 0(off) to level 6(extra sensitive) however there seems to be no difference between settings 1 through 6. However it works amazingly well and the picture is perfection.",
