      "verdict": "The Merrell All Out Crush Tough Mudder 2 was specifically designed for the Tough Mudder Competition. Users who used it for that purpose said that the shoe performed well, and took on the demands of the trail. Water was even draining well from the shoe. However, one major drawback some reviewers found was that pebbles and debris easily got into the shoe which caused some discomfort.",
      "pros": [
        "Most reviewers commended the grip the outsole provided",
        "They expressed that they did not experience slipping and sliding as much as other Tough Mudder competitors",
        "Another runner said that the grip was also sufficient on uneven terrain",
        "One user said that the laces did not unravel throughout the competition",
        "A good number of testers observed that the shoe was draining well",
        "The weight was light but the midsole still had enough cushioning for long runs on moderate terrain, said one runner",
        "The shoe is reasonably-priced"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Debris easily got into the shoe through the ankle area, based on a good number of reviews",
        "This caused one runner to feel pain while running downhill",
        "One runner said that the collar rubbed on his ankles causing tender spots"

I havent fallen over for 20 years, until today, I put on my 'trail' running shoes and went for a run along a trail, the first slight incline on damp rock and my feet just slid from under me! Knackered my arm, scratched my fit bit and wounded my pride! Perfect for a flat park run on a dry day on grass. Potential death trap on an actual trail! This product is probably responsible for all injuries during a tough mudder. Stick to asics in future.",
