Love how I can take close ups of just about anything from bugs to far away objects like landscapes or even birds sitting in trees. Love the zoom feature. Was able to take pictures of my sons graduation from college even though quite far from the stage. Was able to zoom in and take close ups of him. Also has a very nice video feature and have even taken videos at night. I love this camera!",

This camera takes very nice pictures in decent light, gives you a great telephoto reach, allows ultra close up macro photography and is easy to use. Certainly a great deal for the target audience. If you like to just point and shoot, get nice pictures and want a long zoom, you should consider this camera.",
