However, the fun ended when she discovered that if she just waited a minute or two after it went off, the alarm TURNS OFF. It only took her a week to figure it out, and she just lays in bed for a minute, waits for it to turn off, then goes back to sleep. What kind of alarm does that?!",

I love that this clock is very portable. I usually sleep through my phone alarm, but this little clock almost never fails to wake me up. The settings are also incredibly easy to set up.
