Sadly, I live in an old building with crumbling plaster and no studs in the bump-out where I needed the workspace. So...the whole thing got wrenched out of the wall after a few weeks, damaging the wall, the floor, the worksurface...and ruining the bread I was kneading. Ha! But the brackets themselves don't have a scratch. ;-)",

I used the shelf supports as templates, lining them up on my level lines, an marked the hole location. I then pre-drilled the drywall/studs and installed three 2 1/2 inch screws into the wall to support each bracket. The upper screw holes are close to the shelf support portions of the angle and it is best if you have a screwdriver that is about 12 inches long. My brackets arrived undamaged and are painted black. The are very strong brackets and I m very pleased with the product.",

The other issue, which could happen with any bracket, is that the support bar that connects the 2 sides to make the triangle shape, is right over the inside holes, making it hard to get those screws in straight if using a drill.",
