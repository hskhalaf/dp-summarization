The MH40 has been my favourite headphone for the past 2-3 years, even though its wired; it's just beautiful and the detail in the music just cannot be found elsewhere. In my option the MW65 combines beauty, material, performance and technology just perfectly. Still retaining the same acoustic detail which is hard to do with ANC; normally this becomes very muffled and watered down, not with the MW65 though. I can't put these things down. I cannot recommend the MW65 enough.",
