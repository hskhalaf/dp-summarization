These low-tops are crazy comfy, and they hold up well even after months of almost every day wear. So go ahead and keep these in your shoe rotation\u2014they should last you a long time.",

      "text": "I am usually a 9.5. I had heard that Fila were on the small side with their sizes so I ordered a size 10. The fit is snug but Comfortable. Unfortunately they didn\u2019t last a year. 3 times to the cobbler to be repaired. When the soles started to fall off I decided to throw them. I can\u2019t help thinking that they were not originals and were probably fake. I always remember Fila to be a mark of quality!!",
