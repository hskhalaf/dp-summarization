      "title": "Great Digital Camera For Beginner!!!",
      "text": "This Canon PowerShot A300 3.2MP digital camera is great! For about $109 it is a bargain with 64MB of CF card. There may be no optical zoom lens but the digital zoom of 5.1x does a pretty good job. It may look de-pixilated at the zoom of 5.1x but when the pictures come out it is better looking with a bit blurry. There is a micro feature too that allow you to take picture of small stuff as close as 2 inch away. Overall, I have it for about two weeks and I am pretty happy with it.",

I will be taking most of my photos of people and I do not need the optical zoom. No camera in the $200-$250 comes close to this camera. Even the Sony needs improvement to compete.",

This gets pretty embarrassing and frustrating when you're asking other people to take pictures of you and your friends. I got sick of saying \"You have to hold it down for a long time...even longer...there we go\" I gave up in the end, and bought a different camera.",

Despite its budget price (and what a steal it is) the colors are vivid and the pics sharp as crystal. Occasionally you could get overexposed results, but that's easily sorted out with white-balance settings. The only potential negative is the legend of barrel distortion on small Canon cams, but I still have to see what that looks like (and I take several architecture pics).
