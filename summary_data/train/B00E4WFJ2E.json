Bosch's advertising is VERY deceptive when it says \"advanced digital signal processing.\" A number of positive reviews also include references to this being a \"digital\" radio. But this is an ANALOG radio, complete with poor reception and lots of static. Bosch should be ASHAMED of themselves. I am returning the radio, and reporting this corporate lie to Amazon.",

I bought this radio because of the auxiliary input. I connect my mp3 player to it and I am satisfied with the sound quality. If you already have Bosh power tools and their batteries, or if you want a radio primarily for the auxiliary input, than this radio might make sense. If you don't already have Bosh batteries and are looking for just a shop radio, keep looking. There are better radios available at this price point.",
