The wide was WAY too wide and gave me absolutely no ankle support. I reordered my normal size 7 with normal width and they fit perfectly in the width toebox and ankle, but low and behold i need one size up 7.5. I guess i hit that mark in my 40+ yrs where i have hone ip in shoe size. Finally a sneaker with a wide toe box!!",
