They are the softest most comfortable towel that I use for the gym, for hand towels when I need to dry my hands, or after I wash my face. I dont even care that the colors dont match everything in my house, I use it as my hand towel to dry my hands after I wash them at the kitchen sink. Get the yellow and grey ones. They are like silk and feel so soft to use for anything. And, they have a great absorption ability, which was really what they were designed for, while eliminating streaks after washing ur car.",

Spray lightly with water to pre-moisten for best effectiveness. This is just the right size. The similar but larger Woolly Mammoth is way too large. Two colors allows you to keep track of what you are using where. One color for upper areas of the car, other color for lower areas. Never use on paint if it has been used on wheels. Pressure wash after use if you can, then put it in the washer (with no other fabrics, just other microfiber) and use a citrus microfiber cleaner as detergent.",
