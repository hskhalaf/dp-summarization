I\u2019ve been a drummer my whole life so I\u2019ve seen my fair share of top dollar electric keyboards. This is not one of those, nor should you expect it to be at this price. However, if you are looking for an outstanding value for a beginners keyboard this is right up your alley. The sound quality overall is very good. The keys aren\u2019t weighted but they are pressure sensitive. It looks very sleek and so far it\u2019s been a joy to play. I just wish I could actually play! Overall it\u2019s an awesome beginner keyboard!!!",

      "text": "The keyboard took longer than expected to arrive. My 9-year-old daughter has been anxiously awaiting its arrival. It finally arrived this morning. Unfortunately, the music holder piece was broken. I contacted Amazon support to see if they could just send that piece. They advised that I would have to return the entire package and wait again. My daughter is so excited to have this keyboard, and is already practicing - I can't do that to her. I decided to try super glue and if that doesn't work, buy another one. Very disappointing.",
