The company reached out to me after I posted my review, and made the situation right. They offered me the unscented version (free of charge!). I love the unscented version, and this was probably the best customer service experience ever! Highly recommended! ********* I think this product was an okay moisturizer. I didn\u2019t like the smell. Typically men\u2019s moisturizers have this \u201cwoodsy\u201d scent which I\u2019m not a fan of. I\u2019d prefer something with little to no smell. This one had a similar smell, with a faint fishy smell. I\u2019ll be looking for something with a less offensive smell.",

I use it in the AM (regardless of whether I shave or not) and also use in conjunction with the eye balm and anti-aging cream at night. So far very happy with the products.

The scent is terrific too, not too strong and layers with everything I thrown at it as far as shaving soap, cologne, etc. Most important - it works.

I have the face wash as well, and it has the same dispenser (where you have to squeeze it out). It works with the face wash because it's more watery, but for the moisturizer you really need a better dispenser. I use one of the ones left over from a previous moisturizer.

      "text": "I have been mositurizing my face for years now, but still felt like I would get flaky spots on my forehead and nose. I decided to take the leap and try brickells product, even though it was twice the price of my normal moisturizer. Lesson learned! This lotion works so well that I have now started dabbling with other Brickell products. The charcoal face wash and body lotion have become essential to my routine as well! My sister who has very sensitive skin and only uses cruelty free products has now started using this lotion on a daily basis too. Maybe drop the \"men\" and just make it Brickell? Thanks for these thoughtful products!",

The best part is they have a pretty extensive skin care line so I'm grateful for the one-stop shopping. The moisturizer is particularly good because it is lightweight (I abhor a greasy lotion) and it really provides a nice invigorating feeling for the skin with a pleasant tingle. I also appreciate that it is available unscented, which I prefer.",

In addition, I don't feel like it actually moisturized my face. The packaging is fine, but the bottle invited you to squeeze out way more than you need way too easily. The smell isn't bad, but it also isn't great. Needless to say, I won't be purchasing this moisturizer again.",
