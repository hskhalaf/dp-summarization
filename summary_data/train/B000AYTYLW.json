      "text": "I bought this because I wanted an inexpensive, durable all weather watch. I've had this model before and lost it after having it for years. This is a good watch, and hits all the high points. There are more expensive watches in the Timex Ironman line that have better water resistance or does more laps (100m/30 laps for this watch), but I didn't need those features. I happily spent less money and still got a watch that did everything I need.",

They are so easy to set, have multiple alarms, chrono, indigo light up screen and water resistant to 100m. He loved it. He's very active in sports and swimming so I'm curious to see how it does. I'm sure he will give it a workout like I never gave mine. He's small for his age and it fit just fine. I would recommend a timex ironman watch for anyone who is active and may have their watch in the water. They are also very comfortable and the face is moderate size. Not too big.",

On the oldest one is still running after about 6 years, but the time set button no longer works so I can't set the stop watch or adjust the time. On the second watch, purchased a couple years ago, one of the buttons tends to stick in the depressed state, causing the watch to beep unexpectedly in an annoying way.",
