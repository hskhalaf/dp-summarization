It is built for skate-ready performance; hence, it delivers superb grip and support without compromising comfort and street-ready aesthetic. Although narrow-fitting and requires some break-in period, the Figgy Dose is another great skate shoe model from Emerica.",

    "description": "The figgy dose is Justin figueroa's second pro model for Emerica; designed by big fig himself. The figgy dose features a newly designed rubber compound we're calling formula \"g\", designed and tested to be even grippier and longer lasting than the standard rubber formula. The figgy dose also incorporates a perforated spandex fit system for better breathability, a full length eva midsole built to endure heavy impacts, and a one-piece toe cap for better durability. Our classic triangle tread is back and it's been updated with our new flex channel technology, for superior board feel without sacrificing grip or durability. A shoe you can skate just as hard in concrete pools or jumping on some steep ass steel rails; the figgy dose was built to skate whatever figgy skates: everything.",
