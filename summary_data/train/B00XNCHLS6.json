It is NOT padded like a push up bra. I hate uneven padding. This bras is great.",

I also ordered this for the racerback option, which if it worked would help with this problem, however the hook that is on the back is facing the wrong direction so I cannot use it that way (facing away from the other strap). I am not sure if this is a factory second since it is defective in that manner. Very disappointing since it would be perfect in every other way.",

I usually wear anywhere between a 34D to a 36DD (depending on the bra maker...which is a completely different issue in and of itself). I purchased a 34DD in this bra and the fit was perfect, and more importantly, it is so comfortable. When I get home from work the first thing I want to do is remove my uncomfortable bra...I have actually been forgetting to take my bra off after work because it is just not as uncomfortable as my $55 bras from VS.

You have to experiment when your nursing with size options, but I got it right the second time! Highly recommend for a good, cheap option. I'll update how they wear over time.",

My one complaint about this bra: the metal for that hook rusts over time and the bra doesn't have much padding so if you're cold and wear shirts that are fairly...tight around the breast area, you will see nipples.

Not supportive at all. I cansee why larger chested girls would enjoy this bra because it does have alot of give. The bra is fine in and of itself and a good material, but i was misled by reviews and it was not what I was expecting.",

It's simple and practical. It lifts my chest without pushing up my boobs. I ordered this bra because it was one of the only comfortable looking racerback adjustable bras. I'm going to order more in different colors because I can't get enough of this bra! Excited to have an affordable, comfortable, and flattering bra as a part of my wardrobe. I'm super satisfied with this purchase!",

The straps don't slip or loosen. I am overall pleased with this product, and I even ordered another one. Thank you Hanes.",
