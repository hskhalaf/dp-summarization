We haven't needed to refill the ink yet, but it does indeed perform amazingly well & print borderless photo quality & gorgeous photos. The suite that comes with the printer isn't too useful to us, since the one of us who really uses it is a digital media artist, so he primarily uses Photoshop & other digital media, but it is nice for the other one of us who is a noob and just likes pretty pictures. Definitely recommend springing for it as it is refillable & the ink costs way less than for a standard printer. Besides that, the colors are so precise! Artist recommended.",

There is a lot to learn to effectively use this printer with all the software settings and paper. I plan to use only Canon OEM inks and high quality papers with the PRO-100.

Not to mention, the ink cartridges last a very long time and create beautiful prints. If the printer has issues, the deep cleaning cycles take care of it in a flash. Yes, it is a massive printer, and it takes up a lot of desk space, but it is well worth the purchase. I would recommend this to any artist or hobbyist.",

We do not recommend this printer for this purpose because it takes a long time each time you switch it on until it is ready, cleaning itself excessively. With this kind of use, the printer wastes most of its ink in the cleaning process - we know since almost all cartridges ran out at the same time. Thus, we would be cheaper off, getting our photo prints through a company. Unless you need large format prints or a printer for strong daily use, look for another high quality printer.",

    "description": "Style:PrinterProfessional Wireless Photo Printer with 8 dye based color inks for colorful and vivid prints\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n It\u2019s time to step up to the large format, professional quality printer you\u2019ve been dreaming about. The PIXMA PRO-100 Wireless1 Professional Inkjet Printer possesses the functionality and technology you need to achieve high-quality output so your prints can look as good as the images you capture. The 8-ink dye based ChromaLife100+ system provides you with an amazing color gamut so your prints will look as vivid as you remember. \n\n The PIXMA PRO-100 shares technology with the rest of the PIXMA PRO line utilizing the Optimum Image Generating System to ensure what you envision is exactly what you get. The OIG System analyzes each area of the print and chooses the best ink mixture so you see the colors you expect to see in your print. \n\n The new Print Studio Pro2 plug-in software makes it even easier to get amazing results from your favorite photo applications. Add to that connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Ethernet and USB and you have a professional machine that easily fits into your workflow that you can place anywhere around the studio. \n\n For media support, the PIXMA PRO-100 features two paper trays. A rear tray for a variety of fine art and glossy photo papers, and a manual slot for thicker media to meet your printing needs. \n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFor the 9th year in a row, Canon U.S.A. is proud to have received the 2012 Readers' Choice Award for Service & Reliability from PCMag.com for Printers \nClick here for a larger image PIXMA PRO-100 Wireless Professional Inkjet Printer \n\nProfessional Wireless1 Photo Printer with 8 dye based color inks for vibrant and detailed prints \n\n * 8 Dye based inks for amazing gradients and color, 3 of which are dedicated grayscale inks for beautiful black & white prints.\n * The Optimum Image Generating System reproduces colors as you intend them by logically selecting the optimum ink combination and placement.\n * Print Studio Pro Plug-in software2 offers a seamless and stress free photo printing workflow for professionals.\n * 4800 x 2400 dpi3 with FINE technology for incredible detail.\n\n\nFEATURES & BENEFITS\n\n\n Print your Vision up to 13\" x 19\": \nPrint professional quality photos on various media up to 13\" x 19\". \n\n Professional Quality, Built-in: \nCanon Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) features a patented print head that enables printing with microscopic droplets and high resolution up to 4800 x 2400 dpi.3 \n\n True Monochrome Prints: \nThe 3 monochrome inks which are part of the 8-ink ChromaLife100+ system5 consist of Black, Gray, and Light Gray. These inks deliver enhanced, deep black density to raise your level of professional print quality when creating the dramatic expression of grayscale photography. \n\n Uniform Ink Height: \nThe Chroma Optimizer brings uniform ink height over the printed image and regulates surface reflection. This maintains the natural color and integrity of your printed photos. \n\n Optimum Analysis and Mixture of Color: \nThe Optimum Image Generating (OIG) System utilizes two major technologies that were first introduced in the PIXMA PRO-1. The first is a sophisticated mixing balance of inks determined from numerous ink combinations and advanced analysis. During this analysis, the OIG System carefully calculates the best results for each print mode and paper type used while looking at various image factors including color reproduction, tonal gradations, black density, and low graininess. These critical ink balancing principles are derived from Canon's expertise in imaging technology, as well as the familiar colors of life that people see and remember on a daily basis. The second is the balancing of color reproduction, tonal gradations, and uniform glossiness. The genius and power of the OIG System is truly showcased when your image is printed, exhibited, and is seen exactly as you envisioned it. \n\n Pro Printing: \nThe powerful Print Studio Pro plug-in software2 provides professional photographers effective printing solutions and can directly hand-over image data. Print Studio Pro is compatible with Digital Photo Professional (ver 2.1 or later), Adobe Photoshop CS, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. \n\n Versatile Paper Handling: \nTwo-way paper feeding provides a rear tray for most supported media types and a dedicated manual feed in the back of the printer for easy loading of thicker papers. \n\n Built-in CD and DVD Printing: \nConveniently print onto your printable CD, DVD or Blu-ray Discs and jackets. \n\n Built-in Wi-Fi: \nThe built-in Wi-Fi1 gives you the freedom to place the printer where it\u2019s convenient and allows multiple users to seamlessly print from several computers. \n\n AirPrint: \nEnables you to print photos, email, Web pages and documents from your Apple device directly to your printer - without installing a driver.4 \n\n Computer-free Printing: \nA PictBridge connection lets you print photos directly from your compatible digital camera, DV camcorder, or camera phone. \n\n Computer-free Printing: \nA PictBridge connection lets you print photos directly from your compatible digital camera, DV camcorder, or camera phone. \n\n Hi-Speed USB: \nPlug the cable into your PC for a super-fast connection for your data transfers. \n\n\n \n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\n * Windows 7, Windows 7 SP1, Windows Vista SP1, Vista SP2, Windows XP SP3 32-bit6\n * Mac OS X v10.5.8, 10.6, 10.76\n\n\n\n \n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n\n * PIXMA PRO-100 Wireless Professional Inkjet Printer\n * CD/DVD Disc Printing Tray\n * Manuals and other documents\n * Setup CD-ROM\n * Setup Ink Tanks\n * Power Cord\n * Print Head\n * USB Cable\n\n\n\nCOMPARE\n\nPIXMA PRO-100\nWireless Professional Inkjet Printer PIXMA PRO-10 Wireless Professional Inkjet Printer PIXMA PRO-1 Professional Inkjet Printer CURRENTLY VIEWING\nSpeed & Quality Ink Tanks Ink System Photo Print Speed (approx.)7 OIG System Print Resolution (up to)3 Ease of Use Professional Printing Plug-ins2 Easy-PhotoPrint Pro CD/DVD Printing Borderless Printing8 Connectivity Built-In Networking1 AirPrint4 - Direct Photo Printing9 USB Connectivity \nGENUINE CANON INKS & PAPERS\n\nPGI-42 Black Ink Tank PGI-42 Gray Ink Tank PGI-42 Light Gray Ink Tank PGI-42 Cyan Ink Tank PGI-42 Photo Cyan Ink Tank PGI-42 Magenta Ink Tank PGI-42 Photo Magenta Ink Tank PGI-42 Yellow Ink Tank Click Here for Genuine Canon Papers \n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nDISCLAIMERS\n 1.
