Before this, I must have gone through 4 or 5 different single-cup machines ... as one expensive machine broke down, I would buy another.

I typically use a Chemex, but the Aeropress gives a completely different flavor. The Aeropress is also very quick at making coffee and is easy to throw in a bag and take out on the go. The biggest downside is it doesn't make a lot of coffee. You can fill up a mug, but that's it. So, if you're making coffee for multiple people, or you need to fill a 20 oz thermos then this isn't for you.",

Besides, it is super quick to brew and easy to clean, you can prepare your coffee just under 2 mins, including boiling water, brewing coffee, and cleaning. As a side note, I reuse the paper filter by washing it after every use (reused 5-10 times) and had no problem so far. I'm very happy with the purchase.",
