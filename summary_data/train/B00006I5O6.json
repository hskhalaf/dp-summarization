Amazon has a combo purchase of these with the center speaker and two rear/ceiling speakers, which I was happy to have taken advantage of. I finished off the setup with Polk's 12\" subwoofer as well. I had read that some customers noticed that there was some rattling from the mesh covers - I have not experienced this at all after some loud movies. Even during installation, the mesh covers fit very snug and don't give me any reason to believe that they will be an issue in the future.",

If you are not careful screwing the self-closing clamps of the housing to the drywall during installation, you will crack the plastic and it will no longer hold the wall. Be careful and gentle and you will not have any issues. If you rush or force this, you will have one or two corners broken and not snug to the wall.",

Measure your spot; check for wall studs; tape up and trace the supplied template; cut out drywall, connect wires and lock it down. They sound amazing (I am watching JAWS right now) and these speakers are making the shark even scarier!!! I opted for the 8 inch woofer model and I am happy I did. Combined with my Earthquake subwoofer, there is plenty down low and up top. I will strongly consider the smaller Polk audio speakers for the rear channels now that this was so easy.",

An extra drywall screw or two would have also been nice. As for the speakers, they sound awesome.

      "text": "These speakers are great for a number of reasons: first of all they provide a great sound quality for an affordable price. They're ridiculously easy to install: all you'll need is a pencil, a dry-wall saw and a screwdriver. They also look great and the outer part can be painted to match your room. The only downside is you'll need to add a subwoofer if you want to hear the lower frequencies. If you do that, you'll get excellent sound",
