The previous version of this game was really good so I had high expectations for the 2015 version. Unfortunately it did not meet the same standards. The younger kids really enjoyed it as they really don't know what they are doing and just like playing a video game. The older kids; however, were a bit disappointed with the play in this games. They did love the graphics as they were outstanding but besides that this game was just a medicore game. If you can get it cheap then I would buy it but I wouldn't pay full price.",

At the beginning of the match you do some sort of rock paper scissors type game when you grapple that i really wish you could turn off. You can't create Divas, and there are no generic intro music, moves or anything. You have to use some other superstars motions and intro moves/music. I'm pretty disappointed with this game honestly. but its the only wrestling game on the current gen system.",

I pre-ordered this game to get Sting and well now I regret it. Even the 2K showcase mode is disappointing. You can relive the rivalries that CM Punk had with John Cena and such but I would've like to relive better rivalries. Just watch this game on twitch.tv or rent it somehow. Not worth the $60.",

Gone, and now customizing your CAW's appearance is more challenging now, as there are way less options than in previous games. The only improvement I noticed are the graphics, but some wrestlers still look really weird (just look at The Rock)",
