We used it a few times and my kids (and I too) wee so frustrated having to pur it back together every other launch... i literally boxed it up to return it within minutes of opening it.",

A 5 year old can probably operate it independently, while our grandson requires some adult assistance (and supervision :) ). The stand for the rocket is easily assembled. Take note - it also falls apart easily, so either some duct tape, or - better yet - some cable ties come in handy, to help it stay together.",

It literally falls apart every time you stomp on the air cushion. Also it is nearly impossible to bend the hose so that the rocket. Straight up. Because of this the toy is nearly on usable without somebody sitting and holding the rocket launch pad. I cannot recommend purchasing it.",

Not very good quality i would send them back but my granddaughter got the duck tape out and the kids duct tape the stands together.

So, one star off because I had to employ duct tape liberally to strengthen the base connections and make sure the launch pipe stays vertical at all times.I wish they'd ship a more substantially weighted base.",

We turned it into a game to see who could launch it the farthest! Encourages exercise running to pick up darts and could be a great science discussion too when they are a bit older! Highly recommended!",

They had a ball stomping these rockets, chasing after them and bringing them back for another go. These Ultras are bigger than some sets and they really fly. In fact, for bigger kids or adults you need a good amount of space or they will end up in the neighbors' yards etc. We managed to tree one of the rockets and are waiting for a storm to blow it out of the tree. I recommend these for anyone trying to get the kids into some high-energy, outdoor activity.",

I've tried using other stomp rockets made from other companies, but their tubing was made of faulty material and either broke easily or did not provide the right kind of spacing needed to allow forceful air to flow through it. Once the tubing is broken, the stomp rocket is essentially useless. For it's price, you get a fun product that has wonderful replay value. As long as the child can depress the stomp pump hard and fast enough, the rocket will blast off.",
