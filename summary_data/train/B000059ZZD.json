The menus aren't intuitive, the hardware doesn't work properly and is not solidly built, the software doesn't work properly... even the 'uninstaller' didn't work. And that was all on a brand-new Dell computer which had ZERO problems before I added this item. Pay more and be happy. I'll be returning mine tomorrow.",

      "text": "Since the day I've bought this device I was not able to make a single CD. I've been in contact with Iomega technical support first via email (took weeks) and then on the phone (available weekdays only from 9 to 5!). I've received numerous (sometimes conflicting) advises from Iomega technical support personal. None of the solutions led to a satisfactory outcome. The device ruined dozens of blank CDs. If you have a Toshiba laptop DO NOT buy this device. It took 6 months to find out that this device is not compatible with Toshiba laptops (the problem is the USB driver made by NEC used on some Toshiba computers). However, Iomega CD-RWs work well with Mac computers.",

Everything worked fine the first try. I love it. It is sooooo... much easier to get files backed up this way -- rather than using the 100 meg Zip disks. Only drawbacks are it's big, ugly, and slow (compared to the internal drives) -- but it is easy to install. And I needed something simple and reliable.",

It certainly has my recommendation! I'm going to purchase two more as Christmas gifts!",
