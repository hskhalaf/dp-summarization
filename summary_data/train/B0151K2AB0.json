I tested my drivers first as well as plugging audio into different devices, no sound comes from the speakers but if headphones are plugged into the volume controller sound blares out despite whatever level the controller knob is on. Very sad to see these go, I'm hoping I can get a factory replacement on these considering they didn't even last the year.",

I find the bass level is adequate for most of what I listen to, but if you're looking for speakers that will rattle the furniture, these aren't them. However, the trade-off for that is a cleaner sound overall, compared to most of the computer speakers I've heard. However, there is one design failure with this system that I cannot overlook: The control knob cannot be disconnected from the subwoofer/amp module, and because of that, you may find it impossible (as I have) to route the control knob through the cord pass-through at the back of my desk. Seriously, what were Logitech thinking of?",

Since it's on our primary entertainment system, we wanted something with more power without distorting, and this does nicely. The variable bass is great for you to decide just how much you want things to shake. The volume control knob is bulky, so you need fairly large holes if you need to pass it through.",

All the other ones I used in the same price range were horrible nothing but issues. These have been great. Sound quality, Bass, being user friendly is why I love them. I know for more money I can buy better speakers but for the price I not one bad thing to say about theses. I do love the turn dial volume control that\u2019s a big plus. I would definitely recommend these.",

The sound is pretty crisp too. You can hook these speakers up to a tv, stereo, computer, cell phone, tablet...anything you want as long as it has the regular headphone jack! I LOVE that feature. I'd like to get a second set of speakers just for the tv in the living room. I use this for my personal computer in my room/office to stream live videos of my art. My viewers say that the sound is really good!",

There's an aux input on your volume control dial though, which is a last resort. Today, like 5 minutes ago, my subwoofer stopped working. I'm no party animal. I don't play bassy music at max volume. In fact I probably only put 3 hours total of play time into it at medium/low volume. It's just poor quality. I regret buying it. Donating it to GoodWill thrift shop.",
