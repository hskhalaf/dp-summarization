The last thing I want to do is walk in to a hotel with some crazy colored gamer bag that screams I'll be out trying to catch pokemons later in the lobby. The bag outside edges are not heavily padded so be aware you aren't going to want to be abusive or check this luggage with the airlines. The compartments are customizeable with velcro dividers which is nice and it is thick enough to hold my accessories like the Sony headset. I cannot comment on if it will hold the VR.",

      "text": "I purchased this because I was going on a business trip and didn't want to put my PS4 Pro in my suitcase. I read quite a few reviews, especially the negative ones, and will admit that I was a little wary...mostly because a few of them said that the PS4 Pro didn't fit. Well, I own the PlayStation 4 Pro 1TB Limited Edition Console and, as you can see by the pictures, it fits perfectly. It was easy to carry, kept everything protected, didn't smell funny. Overall, a very solid purchase.",

With all the traveling his headset usually ends up breaking. With his he can put his controller, Playstation 4, headset, cords, and even his games, along with any other small things he needs to pack. This is built very nicely and does not feel cheap. He was very excited to get this and im very happy i went with this item. He can now travel without the worry of his belongings being broken.",

It's been on at least 4 trips with me and totally more reliable than hotel wifi. The shouder strap makes it easy to carry with a backpack.",

      "text": "This case is amazing. It has a very low profile without any logos or obvious lettering giving away to the public that it holds my PS4. What I'm mostly happy about is that it carries much more than intended. It additionally carries my extra dual shock controller, dual shock controller charger with battery packs, Nintendo Switch inside a carrying case (including all cables, grips, the dock, and additional joycon silicone cases), and 2 Nintendo 3DS handheld systems with their respective chargers inside a carrying case. I can't find anything else that beats this.",
