Online customers can only rely on product specifications to decide on the purchase, but what was written is not genuine. I am very disappointed and felt deceived with this purchase. Please advise solution. Thank you.\"",

But althought the mid and highs were clear, the bass was very disappointingly thin that it hardly gave justice to full range material. I've had $20 Sony earphones that sounded much better, even Philipps ones. I should have stuck to them. They're simply unused today as I keep enjoying my old Sonys.",

Pros: -Sound quality is great -In line controls -3 different rubber ear cups for custom fit -Sale price :-) Cons: -Buttons take time to get used to -At very loud volumes they may be distorted. (And I mean REALLY loud volumes, I listen to my metal as loud as I can take w/o it hurting) -Controls don't work with my Galaxy s3.",

Secondly, they sound fuzzy, and they are not accurate, nor neutral to me.There is little mid range and the the highs....well..... I am sure that there are people whom like highs, but these sound like finger nails scratching on a chalk board. I am sure AKG makes better sounding earphones, but based on this purchase, I am going to think twice about spending money on this brand again.",
