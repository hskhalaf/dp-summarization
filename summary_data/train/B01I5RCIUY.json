Given the short length of the arms - it is hard to get enough torque to loosen wheel lugs especially if they were tightened by a pro shop using impact wrenches. I would strongly recommend testing out the tool before packing it away for use when you get a flat tire. Machining is ok - I was able to grip on the lugs but it is not very precise and the alloy is medium soft so I suspect will strip over time. Not a pro tool by any measure.",
