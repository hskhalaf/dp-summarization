While there are a couple features I personally won't use (fish hook) there are a multitude of features that I will use while camping/hiking/backpacking. The qualify is exactly what you expect from a reputable brand. The knife comes in a small box and that's pretty much it. No complaints whatsoever.",

I used the 2 most useless tools at work! - The fish descaler to pry a door open because I didn't want to scratch any of the other tools - The hook to grab a sharp cable stuck in a machine.

While the Leatherman products may have some better design features, the Swiss products were usually sturdier, especially when I used the scissors. Since Wenger is now owned by Victorinox, I'll have to see if the scissors improve. So far, not so encouraging. The pliers on the Leatherman are better, but it's bigger. If you are a building superintendent, probably buy the Leatherman. If you futz around the house and have a pair of pliers, you'll probably like the Swiss products better",

      "text": "I am so pleased with this multi tool Swiss Champ. I originally purchased a red handled one. But I was sent a counterfeit one which I promptly sent back when I realized what a piece of garbage it was. It was sold by someone else but arranged by Amazon. I ordered this one even though it cost $39.00 more. It was sold By Amazon so i figured it wouldn't be a counterfeit. The Swiss Champ is such an awesome tool. I love the wood shields. The quality is first rate.There is no comparison to that \"thing\" that I was sent last week.",

This one for me has just the right number of tools and so I have it with me all over. My advice to my daughter, and novices, was - do spend a little time to learn various functions from their site.",

Sturdy well made suitable for anyone who is a tinkerer or outdoors man. Blade reads at base officer suisse on one side and the other side it reads victorianocox swiss made stainless. Reason I mention that is because I've seen posts about this swiss army knife being fake...this is not a fake knife it is very well made and very useful. A store full of tools and uses for them.

It should be stamped Victorinox on the main blade. Many sites show you how to tell if it is real and there is definitely a big quality difference between this on and the cheap look alike.",

    "description": "\"ULTIMATE COMPANION \nFrom housework to camping adventures, the 3.6\"\" SwissChamp comes prepared for any situation. Featuring 33 tools, stainless steel construction, and Swiss-Made precision, the SwissChamp is the essential handy helper for anyone, anywhere. \n\nFEATURES 33 FUNCTIONS: \nLarge blade; small blade; corkscrew; can opener with a small screwdriver (also for Phillips screws); bottle opener with a large screwdriver and wire stripper; reamer; key ring; tweezers; toothpick; scissors; multipurpose hook; wood saw; fish scaler with a hook disgorger and ruler (in/cm); nail file with a nail cleaner, metal file, and metal saw; fine screwdriver (2.5mm); chisel/scraper; pliers with a wire cutter and wire crimper; Phillips screwdriver; magnifying lens; pressurized ballpoint pen; straight pin; patented mini-screwdriver; and sewing eye. \n\nCARE TIPS FOR YOUR SWISS ARMY KNIFE \nThe steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion. \n\nSHARPENING \nTo re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15\u00b0\u2013 20\u00b0. This will result in a cutting angle of 30\u00b0\u2013 40\u00b0. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur. \n\nCLEANING \nIf the blades of knife begin to stick together, open and close the blades in warm water several times - this will allow the tools to move easily again. Once dry, apply a drop of Swiss Army Knife Oil between each tool and its spring. Do not put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher. \n\nHISTORY & HERITAGE \nIn 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and his cutlers\u2019 union produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professionals and home cooks. Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier\u2019s Knife and Officer\u2019s Knife. After the death of his mother, and with the advent of stainless steel, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born. Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.\"",
