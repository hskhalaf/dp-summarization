      "text": "I have been searching for a good stool for my daughter to use for potty training, but I wanted something that wasn't an eyesore and could also be used as a step stool by me (120lbs.) This one is great! The cool grey color is much less jarring than the black or red versions, which I have seen in big box retail stores. The rubberized feet really keep it from slipping, and the top surface area has a nice sticky rubber feel and is larger than most of the kids' step stools on the market. It's also a bit taller than most competitors, which is what I was looking for. We purchased two and are very happy.",

Do I get the bottom model, the cheapest one, or do I get a folding stool that can even withstand adult weight? Folding stands are an absolute no because little fingers can get caught and pinched! So scratch that one off your list. The bottom tier stool doesnt have enough of the rubbery grip like this one does, and the last thing you want is a fall! This one is very secure, have never had a fall, always stays upright, and looks great. I got the super happy magenta color. Love it!",

She is now turning 8 and it is still in perfect shape and is still being used to brush teeth, etc in the bathroom. What I like the best is that when you put it down, it doesn't budge. It grips the floor, no matter what the surface is and it is very stable. It's perfectly shaped to fit one foot on each side. Even my son has used it on occasion and he is 250 lbs. Any lastly, it still looks pretty darn good considering that it is used by 2 kids for all these years. SUPER good buy.",

      "text": "Great shape for fitting at the base of a toilet. Light weight with handles that make it easy for my 2 year old daughter to move into place when she needs to go. The grip on the floor and top are make for a very secure step. Easy to clean after accidents or in-between. So pleased with the first, we bought a 2nd of these after 6 months of use. Unfortunately, after about 12 months the rubber grip has begun to separate from the base of the stool. For the price and amount of use, still a good deal.",

They are light and very easy for my toddler to move, and have a wide, grippy step that prevents slippage when reaching. However, it has been less than half a year of light use and the trim between the 'toes' is loose, and one of the stools has a cracked top. These are not sturdy, and offer no structural bracing underneath which makes them extremely vulnerable to cracking under pressure or pushing from a determined toddler. A traditional wood step will replace these.",

I'm in the 110-115lb range and I stepped on it and it still felt very sturdy under my weight. Our daughter also seems to really like the design, even though it isn't that fancy.",

Of course it worked at first, but I should have gone w/my instinct to return it and repurchase another BabyBjorn stool for the 2nd bathroom.",

The gripped feet on the bottom truly keep it from sliding around, and the same material covers the top of the stool making it safe even if it accidentally gets wet. Really happy with this!",
