      "text": "First of all, be sure to lube this before you use it because that will probably be the last time you think about it until it rusts... The binder works well. The ratchet mechanism is smooth but switching directions is a little clumsy. I would not hesitate to use these for consumer applications. For professional use I would probably spend more money on name brand product. These are DOT approved so no concerns if you are stopped for inspection.",
