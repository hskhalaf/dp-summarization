There is no such issue with these hangers and they superbly do the job for which they were purchased. They clamp tightly and the rubberized coating helps to hold them as well.",

Luckily I was able to bend it into workable shape without breaking it. That said, these work as expected. The cloth lining inside the wooden bars provides enough grip for secure hanging. The clip is secure. Excellent way to hang slacks without getting any wrinkles. Even the best standard hangers will leave a horizontal line if hung long enough. These won't. The slacks hang straight down. You'll need enough vertical clearance for them to hang freely.",

Another benefit I've noticed is that wrinkles tend to smooth out better on these than standard hangars. Gonna buy some more for family members.",

I have been using these for about 3 weeks now to hang my skirts & husband's pants and so far we haven't had any problems with them. If you are in the market for wooden hangers which are not bulky then I think these hangers are the best option. You can't beat the price too.",

As suspected the plastic fulcrum that opens and closes the hangars are too flimsy and break easily. At least a quarter of the otherwise nice hangars are worthless because of a small cheap part. Very disappointed.",

I ordered these as a replacement for similar hangers that had the plastic piece break away after about 2 years of use. The pressure points of where these clamp down do cause some wrinkling and lines in your slacks. I haven't quite figured out how to position my slacks without causing some kind of indentation.",
