I went for the \"Premium\" version/Black as I wanted to avoid any movement as the wind blows, which can happen in strong wind gusts and then ice builds up and freezes all to the glass. Well worth +$10 to raise odds that won't happen. As advertised, fast delivery, sturdy item, assembly almost nothing. Went on quick, folded up clean and quick back into the included storage bag. A few times putting on and then taking off and storing again was very convenient-think dressed for work and \"let's make this fast\" kinda thing. Happy buyer - thanks to seller!",
