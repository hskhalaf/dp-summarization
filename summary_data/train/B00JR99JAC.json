After about a month, he had no more ear infections, no special maintenance ear washes. No ear issues! Have used venison and fish varieties of Natural Balance and now trying beef. Venison was our fav or 5 years but cost has gone up beyond our budget. He only gets 2 cups per day and minimal treats (Natural Balance Limited ingredient of course) and he has maintained a health weight for his size. Even his poop is prize worthy. Per past experience. I think Natural Balance Limited Ingredient dog food is a winner.",

      "text": "My little doggie has allergies to wheat and other unknown things. My veterinarian recommended this as a last try before putting him on prescription dog food. It has worked wonders. He is a rescue and had lost all the fur on his underside. He was itching constantly on a dog food that I got at a chain pet store that was also supposed to be grain free. My little pug has not only re grown all the fur that was lost he has been able to stop taking prednisone for itching. If I drop a wheat cracker and he gets it he itches for days kicks at his ears. Im so happy with this food.",

She used to eat Ultra Nutro, but had developed a constant itchy rash all over that had her chewing and licking herself constantly. After a few vet visits, we narrowed it down to a diet issue, so I switched her to this formula which contained all different ingredients than her former food. Within a few weeks her rash went away and she is back to normal! Her coat is shiny and she is back to normal. Will continue this brand!",
