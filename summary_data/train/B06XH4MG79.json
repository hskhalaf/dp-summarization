The foam in this pad squished down to nothing. The shims made no real difference and the foam is certainly not memory foam. It would be cheaper to buy a foam mattress and slice off enough shims for 4 barns full of horses. Does have have a pretty blue color.",

The cons- the foam material has to be removed when they are laundered and it is a bit of a pain to put it back in. I also think that they are a tad expensive for what they are.",

What I don\u2019t like about it: the placement of the girth holding strap is awful. It needs to be slid forward quite a bit. I can place one of the girth straps through it but not both as it causes to pad to move out of place on the horse. Also for a high withered horse, it isn\u2019t the best. It could use a either relief piece of material near the pommel area to better hold the pad in place because otherwise it slips back behind the withers.",

This saddle pad is made of thick but flexible material and the pockets concealing the support pads stay closed but are easily accessible if you need to build the pad up more. I like it because I can add more padding or take out padding depending on which horse I'm riding. Seriously, if you're a broke college student and/or equestrian like me and you need something that looks nice and is functional, buy this.",
