Why buy an umbrella that doesn't really keep the rain off but let's a drip through down the back of your neck, ice cold rain? Returned it immediately. Buy a golf umbrella and paint it camo instead.",

I sit up on a high bluff, so the wind often comes up the bluff hill - i need to orient the shade with a pretty significant canting to it (screw it into the tree as a significant downward angle) as a result - otherwise the updraft coming up the hill inverts the umbrella. Easy learning. Once that was out of the way it kept me nice and dry.",
