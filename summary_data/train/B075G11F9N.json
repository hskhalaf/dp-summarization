      "text": "I was on my second Capresso Infinity grinder and it was starting to become inconsistent with its grinds. I don't do espresso, just grinding for a Moccamaster drip coffee maker. The Baratza is a very high quality piece. The Technivorm likes a fairly coarse grind and this delivers perfectly. I especially like the fall through grinding action where nothing is wasted. It's a bit on the loud side but no worse than several other kitchen appliances we use. I waited over six months of use to write a review to ensure it was dependable and it's been perfect. Highly recommended.",

If using for filter or pour over, purchase the BG burr from Baratza (~$30) to go coarser and more consistent, which should be included IMO. If your goal is to use standard espresso baskets, this model won't cut it - go for the 270 models. Overall, still the best grinder at this price point.",

I used two three-second grinds to fill my portafilter. Grind for three seconds, tamp, grind for three seconds, tamp. Then lock into place and extract that freshly-ground goodness.",

      "text": "Really wanted to like this grinder. Gave it a very fair shake and tried dialing it in over a few lbs of various coffees. If using it for espresso only it can work if you stick w a pressurized basket or get the dose close enough w the double spouted portafilter. In the end it produces way too many fines for a naked basket or pour overs. A bummer for sure for what I needed. It does look nice though. Guess I\u2019m back to hand grinding.",

You must by a different BURR set to do French press. It will not grind coarse enough for Cold Brewed, so has limited use. Great for Espresso. Set at 21 for 4.4 secs was perfect.",

I do Aeropress with the BG burr from Baratza, which for my fairly fast brew, I'm at around setting 11. I didn't try using the AP burr that comes by default yet, so I can't comment on how coarse that goes. It is a little loud, but not outrageously so, and it grinds quickly. (~7s total, for me) The grinds cup works perfectly for me.",
