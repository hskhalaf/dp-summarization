I almost sent these back thinking they were just junk until I decided that all the positive reviews couldn't be so far off, and I worked to tweak the sound (certain websites giving info on their frequency response helped also.) After that, I'd say good headphones for the price. [Edit] I have attached a screenshot of the equalizer settings I use on the Pi Music Player as a reference.",

The sound quality hasn\u2019t diminished either; I have a go-to song to see if the quality of speakers pass the test for bass and depth (goth trad- sunbeam), and the headphones don\u2019t disappoint. The foldable mechanism is convenient for carrying in your bag and they provide a nifty little drawstring bag to put headphones in when you\u2019re not using them (which is also larger than the previous bag sold, might I add). Overall, I can\u2019t deny these headphones and I\u2019ll keep coming back to them, and I\u2019d also like to be sponsored but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude47\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "text": "I purchased these headphones when they were $35 and honestly, that's the most I would pay for them. While the sound quality and style are quite good, they're very uncomfortable on the ears. The clasp that's meant to hold the ear parts together while in compact mode sticks out and irritates the ear constantly. Also if you have short hair the headband will pinch your hairs and rip them out if you're not careful. Not quite what I would expect from a $50 price tag but $30-35 is fair.",

The ONLY gripe I have is the wiring, which stiffens and kinks over time. These exact same headphones but with more of a strong, cloth-like coting for wiring are available in the PortaPro 25th Anniversary Edition. They are $20 more but the cable holds up so much better. They are also a little sleeker without any blue color and being mostly black. Can't go wrong with either model in regard to sound quality, but for build quality the Anniversary Edition is worth every extra penny.",

Not only the price to quality ratio, but I actually believe that this is my preferred sound, which I can recommend for people who like their headphones to sound a bit more muddy and not as clean as for example all bose headphones. The sound is great for electronic music as well as R and B/Hip Hop, and the base is impressive for these. Also, it comes with unlimited warranty. What is not to like! Highly, highly recommend!",
