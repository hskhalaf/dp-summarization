I am sure you can find 12 inch powered subs that are cheaper, but I bet they have a much weaker amplifier (this one has a very healthy 300 watts RMS, go on and compare the wattage to other woofers in this price range) I cant really hear the port noise that a few people complain about, its probably an issue with their woofer placement or turning the woofer up extremely high.",

Heavier and the sub itself was definitely sturdier and felt heavy duty. After i plugged it in....wow. i put on transformers and damn! Bass was clear, room thumping without it being muddy or sounding distorted. You could only feel the bass not hear the sub itself. Awesome. Highly recommend.",

I had to dial the volume back a little to keep it from overpowering the rest of my speakers. Once dialed in, the sub blends in great for music or movies and it performs beautifully, not overly boomy but with very pleasant lows staying out of the way until called upon and then delivering in spades. Very pleased with the sub and considering purchasing another to go dual subs.",

The line in can be used for LFE input too by cranking the frequency override all the way clockwise. At 50% volume the subwoofer is already quite loud, so it's probably overkill for most setups, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

      "text": "I use this on a home stereo that's primarily used for movies. 5.1 surround paired with a projector throwing a 130\" picture on the wall. It's plenty loud at a medium volume. If I turned it up any further then the sub would overpower the speakers and muddy the overall experience. I read some complaints online about the sound quality and other nitpicky details. Those probably come from audiophiles who are spending huge sums of money to eek out that last bit of quality. Assuming you've got a \"normal\" home stereo, you'll be perfectly happy with this.",

I've seen it happen one time. One time. Where a single sub filled the room without me being able to point right at it. Two subs makes for clean, omni directional bass. And don't spend more than 200 on a single 505, because they are a budget sub. I've seen Amazon list them for 589 and that's rip off.",

      "text": "Bought in November 2014. Worked great until February 2017, when it started periodically exhibiting static and low bass humming. Initially I could cycle the power and unplug it to fix the issue. Come late May 2017, that solution no longer worked. Now the sub is making a 4-5 second static sound punctuated by three-second periods of silence. As if it is on a phase-repeat cycle. Called Polk customer service, who diagnosed the problem as the amplifier, offered to send a new one for me to install. Hope it fixes the issue. Judging by other reports and reviews I've found, should do the trick. It's a nice sub otherwise.",

    "title": "Polk Audio PSW505 12\" Powered Subwoofer - Deep Bass Impact & Distortion-Free Sound | Up to 460 Watts | Easy Integration with Home Theater Systems",
    "description": "Style:PSW505PSW505 features a sturdy Slot Load Vent that minimizes distortion, and a 300-Watt amplifier that powers a high-quality 12\" long-throw woofer to deliver accurate, room-filling deep bass you crave for home theatre. A rotary volume control adjusts the volume of the subwoofer relative to the other speakers in the system and the unit offers a continuously variable low-pass filter, adjustable from 60-120 Hz. Accessible, professional-grade line- and speaker-level inputs, and speaker level outputs allow easy connection to any system for an instant sound upgrade. The subwoofer\u2019s cool styling, with silver details and a real wood veneer adds a classic touch & blends in seamlessly with your room decor.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nHave a big room? Have the need for BIG, life-like bass impact? Then the PSW505 is the subwoofer for you. More than a mere brute, the PSW505 is equally at home reproducing all the subtle nuance of a plucked string bass as it is belting out a rocket's roar. Full-featured and over-powered, the PSW505 will rock your world.\n\nKey Features\n\n * Slot Load Venting improves bass response. The wide, long slotted vent dramatically lessens turbulence, noise and distortion, creating precise, thunderous bass!\n * Polk subs sound better because they're built better. Rock-solid MDF construction (including a 1 inch thick front baffle) suppresses enclosure panel resonance for distortion-free, accurate response.\n * Big 12-inch Long Throw Driver for longer excursion and better linearity.\n * Adjustable low pass crossover, phase switch and volume control allows perfect blending with any main speaker.\n\nWhy you should consider this product\n\nBig subwoofer performance pure and simple. If you\u2019re ready for room filling, chest-thumping high impact high performance bass, the PSW505 is the perfect choice.\n\nTake a look inside this product\n\n * Huge Hi-Roll Surrounds that support a true long throw driver. \n * Most powered subwoofers are good for just gut-rumble and boom. Polk understands that you listen to music too so our subs are tight, precise and accurate. \n * High current 300 Watt Continuous (460 Watt Dynamic) power amplifier. \n * Adjustable low pass crossover, phase switch and volume control allows perfect blending with any main speaker. \n\n * Auto on/off circuit that automatically turns your subwoofer on when it senses a program signal. When no signal is present, the amplifier turns off within 15 minutes.\n * Unfiltered LFE input for use with low pass filtered subwoofer output jacks.\n * Pro-grade 5-way binding posts speaker inputs and outputs.\n * Magnetically shielded for safe, flexible placement next to a TV or video monitor.\n\nTechnology\n\nDynamic Balance\u00ae Woofer Design Polk perfected the method of analyzing a speaker's microscopic behavior with laser Interferometry. With that information in hand, Polk engineers select the ideal combination of materials, geometry and construction techniques to literally \u201ctune out\u201d unwanted resonance. The result is a subwoofer that delivers pure, distortion free deep bass.\n\nKlippel Optimized Long Throw Woofer Using a state-of-the-art Klippel Distortion Analyzer, Polk engineers optimized the woofer's motor structure, voice coil alignment and suspension for longer excursion and greater linearity bringing you the best possible performance even at the most extreme listening levels. \n\nSlot Load Venting improves bass response. The wide, long slotted vent dramatically lessens turbulence, noise and distortion, pouring out a tidal wave of precise, thunderous bass! \n\nRock-solid MDF construction (including a 1 inch thick front baffle) suppresses enclosure panel resonance for distortion-free, accurate response. Polk subs sound better because they're built better.\n\nIn the Box\n\n * PSW505 subwoofer\n * Owner's Manual\n * Online Registration Card\n\nUse with these products\n\nPolk Audio RTi A Series of freestanding loudspeakers\n\nPolk Audio TSi Series of freestanding loudspeakers\n\nDownloads\n\nDownload the Manual\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nDriver Complements Subwoofer 1 - 12\" Diameter (30.48cm) \nHigh excursion polymer composite cone with hi roll surround, shielded Electrical Overall Frequency Response 23Hz - 160Hz Lower -3dB Limit 28Hz Upper -3dB Limit 125Hz Crossover Variable low pass 60 - 125Hz, 4th order Inputs Speaker level 5-way binding posts, line level (filtered) and LFE (unfiltered) Outputs Speaker level Dimensions Cabinet Size 16-1/8\" H x 15-1/8\" W x 18-3/16\" D \n(40.96cm H x 38.42cm W x 46.20cm D) Enclosure Type Vented via slot loaded port Subwoofer Amplifier Specs Power Output 300 watts Continuous Average Output Dynamic Power Output 460 watts Shipping/Other Shipping Unit Each Shipping Weight 48.00 lbs.

(If you're not sure a dealer is \"authorized,\" call Polk Audio at 1-800-377-7655, and ask us.) The warranty is not transferrable, that means it applies only to the original purchaser. If you purchase your speakers from a private individual, that product is considered \"used\" and has NO factory warranty, no matter what the seller implies. The warranty is VOID if the serial number of the speaker has been removed or defaced. If you have any questions about your warranty coverage, or you think you need service, call Polk Customer Service at 1-800-377-7655. We're here to help you get the most from your new speakers!",
