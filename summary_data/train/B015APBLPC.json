They shipped very quickly and as soon as I opened the envelope I actually ran around showing everyone how beautiful they are! The names are beautifully large and centered on the front, and the 2 lines on the back are easy to read and nicely aligned. Couldn't recommend them more - amazing! Thanks so much for functional yet beautiful pet tags!",
