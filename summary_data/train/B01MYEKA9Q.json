Obviously these are designed more for exercise and running for which they are perfect and ensure your heels don't tire as you have this cushioning which is not too common with the average pair of sneakers. Obviously would highly recommend. I paid Peanuts for them, less then 40 Pounds My budget was \u00a32500 and I generally like high end luxury designer shoes however these were great and the rest can go to support British Nationalist Organisation who I support Like EDL and BNP",
