      "text": "You can see from the video, the Stanley has a more focused beam - concentrating all the light into one spot, which actually makes it seem a bit brighter than the NoCry (not nearly 2.2x as bright as claimed though), but considering the differences in runtime and the waterproof, tough, well balanced, lightweight design of the NoCry model for me the NoCry offers better value. Runtime: Max setting for Stanley 2 hours, for NoCry 6 hours. 2nd setting for Stanley 7 hours, for NoCry 12 hours. 3rd setting for NoCry 20 hours, which is perfect for in-tent use for example. Charging time 4 hours for NoCry and 6 hours for Stanlely.",

Since China has taken over most of the manufacturing (DUH!), a lot of their \"American brand products\" (a clone of a Leatherman knife fell apart in less than a year of normal use) have not helped keep their reputation unsullied! A year hasn't even passed yet on this item so I'll update the rating if necessary. One thing for sure. The charge definitely doesn't last long.!",

I have used it to light up mysterious cars parked around my house with great success. It's bright enough to even let me see thru the tinted rear windows from 50 feet away. This spotlight (and my home defense weapon) is the first thing I grab when something goes \"bump\" in the night. Highly recommended.",

I also bought a similar product from a competitor, at the same time that I bought the Stanley Fatmax, and it has been incredibly disappointing in terms of holding a charge and running time. The Stanley light has been a far better product in my opinion and I would buy it again.",
