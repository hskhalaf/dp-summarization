I was afraid I was going to crack the whole egg but did not. Because you pierced the egg, some of the egg whites come out of the top (you place the egg with the piercing hole up). I chose hard-boiled for my first try. Worked great!! perfect HB eggs. It comes with a couple of little trays for poaching and omelet. Aside from being afraid I will crack the egg piercing it - I like this little egg cooker.",

However, after switching to smaller eggs, the issues for poached and omelettes has resolved. Personally, I just make soft boiled eggs, and they're perfect! My trick is grab some tongs and immediately grab the eggs when the buzzer dings and place them into a bowl of cold water, otherwise they will continue to cook. Its pretty fool-proof, honestly. Also, I use a kitchen timer, not the machine.",

I'm giving it 4 stars because there's a bit of a learning curve with the other egg dishes. I haven't been able to figure out poached eggs yet, even when following the directions exactly. So you might have to do some experimenting before you find out exactly how much water you need to get your eggs the way you want them. No matter though, it's still way easier than using a whole pot just for two poached eggs.",

The only downside was the loud noise the gadget emitted to tell you the eggs were done cooking, which would send our young g'children scattering - sounded like a smoke detector going off. BUT we recently bought another for our second home; it appears they have now changed that timer noise to a lovely musical chime. Highly recommend for every kitchen.",
