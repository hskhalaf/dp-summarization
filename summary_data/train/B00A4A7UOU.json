After having had it about a month, it still gets regular play from 3-4 of our cats. What's nice is that it isn't something you have to start - they tend to self-play. I often hear the ball rolling around the track at various times of day. We purchased an additional ball and have 2 of them on the track. We also added the cat grass addition recently. (It's also been well received.) I think if you have energetic cats who like to play - this will work well for you!",

Though, both my 17 year old and 2 year old played with this toy, but I am thinking that if it's not going to blink easily, may as well use lighter balls so it can go faster. I think tried to buy Twinkler cat balls to switch out, as those blink a lot easier to the touch and those were to fat :(. So if you try to get a better blinking ball, make sure you check the size... even slightly bigger and this ball is going nowhere.",

However, he had absolutely NO interest in this toy. He wouldn't even try it, he just looked at it like it was in the way of his play area where he throws around those dang twist ties that he prefers over every other toy I have ever bought him. AND when I went to return it, the shipping was gonna cost almost as much as the actual cost of the toy, so I just ended up giving it to another friend who has cats.

      "text": "Our kittens LOVE this so much, I purchased a 2nd unit that configures into different shapes, as that unit has \"end caps\" rather than requiring it circle back to itself to close off. I highly recommended purchasing the extra balls - two to a package - as those light up when rolled and the additional balls allows multiple cats to play at the same time. The pieces snap on easily but securely, with all top pieces fitting any / all bottom pieces. Well done!!!",

I definitely recommend it if you have a playful kitty. My 2 year old siamese looks at it and walks away. He is an indoor outdoor cat so he gets his stimuli elsewhere. I do wish the light on the ball stayed on a little longer when sitting still, but still is a wonderful toy. Seems sturdy also!",

It's not their first toy of choice (they like the handheld laser better) but it's been amazing to me that they still play with it even after two months.

They seem to like the combination of the balls flashing lights and the noise of the balls hitting each other. I would say the only improvement you need is to supply more than one ball.
