      "text": "This wood splitter is easy to use and works great, the only problem is that I wish I would have gone with a more powerful model. To clarify, it works great for smaller pieces, 10\" to 14\" round or so. The issue then becomes when I do cut down a larger tree. I recently learned this splitter's limits and have about three trees worth of wood it can't handle. Don't get me wrong, if your working with smaller sizes this splitter will handle it well. But 25-30 inch around pieces are just too much for this little guy!",

This made a huge pile of work that would have been days off chopping and splitting with a wedge in to a few hours of work. The only limit was on dealing with the length of wood. It only adjusts smaller not longer. So we had to chainsaw some stuff, but it worked like a champ. It pushed through some wood that we had struggled with before. Very easy to operate and comes with very little assembly (basically just putting wheels on).",

It's not really an all-day production tool, but for a couple hours or an afternoon it sure beats a splitting maul! It's compact size makes it easy to store, but also makes it a bit tippy--make sure to set it up on flat, level ground for maximum stability.",
