      "text": "I purchased my Avalon water cooler in November of 2016. It has worked great since then and the bottom loading feature is very convenient. A part that dispenses cold water broke inside the cooler a month ago. I contacted Avalon and after a few emails and me sending some pictures, they determined that the part was not something they could send me to replace. So they sent me an entirely brand new cooler. Their customer service is top notch, and this experience shows me that they stand behind their product.",

The motor runs but it will not draw the water up into the unit for me to dispense. So now i have a $149.00 piece if junk sitting in my kitchen. I wanted to give no stars but you know the deal with that. What a waste.",

It takes 30 seconds to fill a 12-ounce bottle. Its second failure is the top-mounted buttons are ridiculously hard to push down\u2014and then HOLD DOWN down while you wait for its dribbling streamlet to fill your cup. If you\u2019re a female or over 60, these mash-down dispensing buttons may render the unit unusable. Go with bottle-top gravity-fed and let physics, not a whining little pump, do the work.",

There is not enough pressure when the water comes out; it's more of a trickle than anything else and that is with pushing the button as hard as I can - however, not too hard because otherwise it gets stuck down and I have to hit the top of the machine to release it after my floor is a massive puddle. The water is also not cold even though the cold button is being pressed and the water cooler has been plugged in since I got it (and yes I remembered to turn the cold water switch on in the back).

However, my \"room temperature\" water dispenser is just as cold as my \"cold\" dispenser. This concerns me as I think the unit is erroneously and unnecessarily chilling water that should not be chilled or heated at all...",

It's a red button on top of unit you slide on and off. But the bottons for water are also ontop. So little hands wondering my figure out the switch. Loading the water is simple. So glad won't have to buy jugs of water constantly now",

It has features I like e.g. the ease of connecting a new bottle, the red light indicating an empty bottle, enough room to fill a larger water bottle, and the ease of emptying the overfill tray. I want to add now that customer service is also very helpful. For no apparent reason the room temperature nozzle quit working. We called customer service, who emailed video instructions. When we still had a problem. customer service (Tyler) stuck with me as we emailed back and forth to get the problem fixed. It has been working fine since then.",
