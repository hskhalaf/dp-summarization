I finally decided to get this machine, and it has opened up endless possibilities! We already made ravioli, fettuccine, tortellini and all of it with easy and perfectly without the slightest difficulty. I am so glad we chose the machine with motor, because you have both hands free that way and can really run the pasta sheets through all settings with ease! We are thrilled about this machine!",

Considering the most part of the price is for the motor itself, I won't recommend people to buy it unless you always make very soft rough.",

Maybe this machine works great for some others if it doesn't break, and maybe mine was an anomaly. However if that was the case it would be great to be able to return it for a new one.",
