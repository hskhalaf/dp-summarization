Replacements are not replacements, they are the same screens with the software on the boards wiped, even after confirming its a hardware issue (and it almost always is the capacitors). tl:dr - buy this if you're looking for a holdover.

Keep in mind for such a big monitor at 1080P and no G/Vsync it's not going to be crystal clear like you would get on a 24\"/27\" but if you're on a budget and not a complete graphic snob it is a great gaming monitor.

Honestly my only qualm with it is the bleeding which is very noticeable when playing games or watching shows with darker backgrounds. For the sake of transparency, the speakers are not the best but at the price point its a premium and I use a soundbar regardless. Im giving it 3 stars though because the color of the monitor really is pretty vibrant if you can fix some settings and the curvature is actually pretty immersive.

When I get a new desk I fully expect the wobbling to go away. 4 stars is too low for this product - specially given the amazing price. Due to the wobbling I would prefer to do 4.5 stars but that's not an option. I would purchase these again without hesitation.",

The settings are are easyly done and the best user settings are Brightness at 48, Contrst at 50. As you see foron the picrures the resolution can be set pretty high and fall picture is beautiful.",

Disappointing since these two monitors are next to each other, it's pretty obvious. Maybe if I purchased one I wouldn't be able to tell.",
