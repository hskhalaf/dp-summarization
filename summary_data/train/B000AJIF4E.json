They do not fit over the ears unless you have very small ears, they are also not deep enough for an over-ear headphone. I found them to be stiff and uncomfortable. The heaviest part of the headphones are the cord. I'd shop around for something better if you're interested in comfort. I regret purchasing these headphones and have requested a refund.",

Only problem is the bass, that's not as good as m50x. The second pros is the weight and clamps strength, while m50x always cause my pinna a pain, this one does not. The third pros is the price, nearly half of m50x. Happy purchase!",

There's a long coiled cord but it's weight is manageable. The earpieces are comfortable and I've found that these headphones can be worn for hours without discomfort.

I just bought a new pair to go along with the 8 sets in the studio. You can't beet these for realistic representation of what is recorded. They also are very quiet while recording so you don't get bleed noise from the headphones making racket while musicians are tracking vocals, which is a common problem with some headphones. These are comfortable and quiet...and very affordable for a professional product.",
