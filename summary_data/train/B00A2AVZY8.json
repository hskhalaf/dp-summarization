My low rating is a warning for those who intend to use it in their kitchen. The table is big, heavy and ships by UPS. The UPS guy didn't seemed thrilled about carrying it. The table top had a marble size dent in the top surface. I can't imaging returning the thing after unboxing it. But as a desk in my garage, not a problem.",

Not sure if we got a dud or if the finish they use is extremely thin. I\u2019m talking a plastic cup slid across it and it left a nice long surface level scratch. We use place mats now to combat it, but after only a week of use it looked like it had been used for a year with the amount of scratches.",

I wanted to change this review to 4 stars. The table is great, and the only reason I gave 3 initially was the surprise of it not being what was ordered. That being said, it is a super study and pretty table. So really only one star off for being different than what was ordered. I will be keeping it though. :)",
