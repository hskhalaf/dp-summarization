I have attached pictures. I really can't even see too many youth players who would be able to wear these. In addition they are so rounded you would have to have legs like 2\" pipes in order for them to come close to fitting correctly. I'm usually a huge adidas fan but really disappointed.",

They are perfect sized. I read a ton of reviews where people were complaining about the size of these. Addias website recommends going by height and not age. I found this to be perfectly true. Size up if you're on the border and you'll be fine. Love that I can wash the sleeves and that the backs of the guards are a \"pleather\" like material. They don't absorb the sweat and stink!

So we wanted to try a whole new style. Pros: Style, height, colors available. Cons: Fit-too narrow. I would love to give these a five star but my 50 lb, 4'-3\" 8 year old found these shin guards too narrow. After wearing them for two minutes they left a nasty red indentation. While the height is the perfect fit, they are no where close to fitting around his (super skinny) shins and have no flex or give to them to make them fit. This is a real bummer!",
