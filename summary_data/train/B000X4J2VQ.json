With some practice I get the feeling these can be open/closed with one hand.",

The guys love it, but comparatively to what job I\u2019m doing, my \u201clocks\u201d still do the best and don\u2019t damage my work. The \u201cNippits\u201d are amazing for biting ahold of your material your using, but if it\u2019s too soft,,,,,,,,,then you will get teeth marks. Love the adjustable locking mechanisms. Great tool. Will purchase more products from this brand in the future, because I love tools. With that said , I do find myself grabbing for my \u201clocks\u201d in most instances.",

He tried my Cobras for a few days but was not sold on the push button style. He was just used to the channel lock style so I bought him this pair as they are more similar to the channel lock style. He fell in love. He likes the handles feel and lack of pinching and has even admitted a better grip on pipe/fasteners with less hand strain. Needless to say our shop is a full Knipex loving crew again.",

I have never liked the Cobra pliers, mainly because I'm used to how channellocks operate, so the alligators seemed a better fit. After breaking them in after a couple weeks, I am very impressed with their quality and in my opinion better grip and ease of use. They have a smaller profile and fit into tighter areas, grip better and seem to mark conduit less than any other plier I have used. I recommend the alligators to all my coworkers.",

They are also very durable while maintains a lightweight feel. I can honestly put them in a back pocket and forget about them. The teeth are machined well and very sharp.
