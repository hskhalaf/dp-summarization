Of course this product came from china would expect nothing less from these scammers...",

The frame is really beautiful but it's a shame that the bands are way too small and weak. I decided that only one band should be used instead of multiple bands due to unequal torque. I replaced this with a Barnett Cobra which works very nicely.",

Lastly the paint on it has bubbles in it. Overall, it looks cheap and shoddy. All this didn't instill confidence to shoot it. However, it did shoot it and it's pretty accurate. Frankly, it don't trust it with the tension of three bands per side so I reduced it to one band per side and use it on only targets.",

Past experience with amazon tells me it is not worth the hassle of try to return. Probably easier to just suck it up and buy a wrench and some ammo.",
