Like other Ecco golf shoes I have had, they are not quite as waterproof as say, Dry Joys, so I do not tend to wear these when I am expecting to slug though a soaked course.

I've got to say these shoes are so comfortable on the golf course. No more soft cleats for me. These shoes you could use everyday even if you don't golf. Great support yet they feel like you're wearing slippers. These shoes are actually more comfortable than tennis shoes yet they have better traction on the ground IMHO. A little spendy, but you get what you pay for. Awesome sellers, 5+ in every way. I'm going to get another pair just for casual wear too. They are that comfortable.",
