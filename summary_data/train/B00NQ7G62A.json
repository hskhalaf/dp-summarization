I have no idea what the difference was between the trial size and the full size, perhaps the trial had a higher concentration of charcoal. However, I bought the full size and instantly broke out after one wash. This did not happen during the trial size bottle. As other reviewers have noted this stuff is also super watery and half of what you pour out will run through your fingers and down the drain so even though the bottle comes in a decent size, most of it will never end up on your face.",

By the end of the day my face feels in need of a wash. This does the job without leaving a tacky residue like some face soaps I have used in the past. They make another Cleansing Face Wash for oily skin and I enjoyed the sample from the sampler pack, but did not notice a difference between the two in performance. Sticker shock can be an issue, but it works well and is used sparingly so I feel it's not too bad.",

Not sure what the scent actually is as it doesnt say, but to me, I get a fresh peeled orange kinda scent . If you are interested in what Brickell has to offer, I highly recommend the Sample kit.

The moisturizer is almost a necessity, if I use the daily scrub and not the moisturizer then my skin tends to overproduce oil. Don't think that using this alone is going to solve your problems.

      "text": "I've been using men's facial wash and moisturizers for a few years now, and have tried a few brands (L'Ore\u0301al Men Expert, Clarins, Harry's, John Masters Organics). My preference is for a semi-foamy wash that rinses cleanly (without the slick feeling that most gel washes leave), and without a heavy scent. This wash works perfectly for those objectives. The charcoal grey liquid looks a bit weird at first, but I got used to it and it's the results that matter anyway. Great product, I plan to continue to use.",

If I had one slightly negative thing to say it would be that product is a little runny so it is easy for it to spill out or more come out than you wanted. Other than that this is a great face wash.",
