I did like them a lot and decided to buy another pair in October 18. I am having to report that sadly, the latest pair, though only being 7 months old, are taking in water!! and it is both the left and the right! walking the dog with wet feet is not fun! I'm really disappointed as the shoe is a really good fit and looks good too. I think I will have to consider buying another brand. Any ideas would be very welcome. \ud83d\ude41",

First time I've bought this model after 2 pairs of XA Pro 3Ds - last pair the sole came away from the upper after about 700 miles, which is fair enough for a shoe like this. Just lurrrrve the speedy laces and wouldn't go back to normal laces now. Ace!",

The quick-fastening feature (instead of normal laces) was a little strange at first but once I got used to it I realise that it's way better than normal laces. Much quicker to get on and off, plus easier to adjust to be just right. It's not obvious, but there's a little pocket for the tie-adjuster mechanism - if you don't use it then the ties flap about a bit. It's only after a week of use that I found it.",

It would appear that either I was unlucky with this pair or attention to detail has taken a nose dive at Salomon. Nowhere near as comfortable as I was expecting from past experience and definitely not worth spending that amount of money on them. I can't stress this enough. Avoid at all costs",
