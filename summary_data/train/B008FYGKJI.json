The printer works quick, gets the job done, and I have had absolutely no problems with printing from my laptops, computer, iPhone or iPad using the wireless feature.",

The laser printer is the best option if you're just printing concert tickets, travel information, basic hiking maps, etc. -- it is far cheaper (~1000 pages per cartridge), generally has a reputation for being more reliable, and prints much faster. My Canon got replaced when it began constantly printing blank pages when turned on. Engineering-wise, I expect a printer to last many years. Look into something else -- if you think laser is best, have a look at the entry level Brother printer. Perfect form factor to cram in a nook (no paper tray sticking out) for usage ~2x/mo",

This particular printer has paper jams about 50% of the time I print/copy and the print head cannot ever get aligned, so bar codes or other graphical elements get completely distorted and each new line is shifted to the right or left a bit, making the document unusable/unreadable. I've run through all of the troubleshooting utilities but none of them work. So frustrated... :(",

So if you are looking for easy printing wirelessly get a different printer. Overall this printer for the money sucks and I would tell anyone and everyone to get a different printer. Spend an extra $50 dollars and you could actually be saving $1,000 a year on printer ink cost.",

Now that it's set up, it works fine, though.",

It recognizes that you are in charge, that you have a wallet that isn't bottomless, and prints things accordingly. If you want black and white, you'll get black and white. If you want it fast... you get the idea. We've used it for 1.5 semesters now and have only had to change the black ink once!",
