      "text": "Just when I needed a good dead blow hammer, USPS pulled up and handed me the package. Set the 3lb. to use removing 2 rusted brake drums, which was fairly easy using this hammer. Sure I will put all 3 hammers to good use. I recommend them for those like me that not only can't afford the pro tools, but can't justify the expense if we could (I'm a DIY, not a pro).",

I find that a dead blow hammer and a screw driver are more useful to have in my home maintenance kit most of the time, except when I'm putting on a new roof! These hammers are well balanced, provide good grip and come in a variety of sizes to handle different situations. I used to use just one larger hammer, but with this group, I've found them even more useful.",
