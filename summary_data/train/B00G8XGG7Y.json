This morning, before school -- my daughter was using them for some basketball dribbling drills and the ball hit one of the legs and this happened. (See photo) I understand that these are inexpensive -- but they should be able to withstand a basketball or a foot landing on them.",

Of course the skills training has to be there, but these tools really put the spring in her step. I would recommend these to everyone, and they are MUCH BETTER built than the Skilz equivalent. We use them for skills training while soccer is on hold due to Covid-19. Our kids use these in a myriad of ways! Great tools for players and coaches alike. These are must have!",

They are all in one piece, but when stood on a flat surface they are wobbly as the legs are not even. As these are purely for a toddler obstacle course, high performance is not necessary, but I am a little concerned that the wobble will be a hazard. Will debate on returning.",
