My personal favorite option is turning off the \"Beep\" when button are pressed. On the negative side, someone should have thought about the excessively loud feedback when the two units are too close together which happened almost instantly upon power-up.",

I love that you can use them with the voice activated speaker. The range has been unbelievable as they have been over a mile away and still sound like they're standing next to you. Plenty of channels to choose from in case there is interference and even an LED flashlight on the top! The kids take them to bed and then talk until they fall asleep. You can also use them with earbuds which is great when they're going non stop! Great design and great quality. Definitely recommend.",
