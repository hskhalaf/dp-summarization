My room instantly smells like lavender lemon. Also, the candle burns for a reallllllly long time. I\u2019ve definitely burned it for over 90 hours, and it still has a ways to go before it\u2019s finished. I probably have another 15+ hours left, which is why I just repurchased another candle! I usually don\u2019t ever spend $20 on candles- but with Yankee Candle Lemon Lavender I\u2019ll make an exception. It\u2019s a really clean, fresh, yummy smell. Intoxicating, and appropriate for any time of the year.",

It really, uncannily smells like the classic cherry popsicle when unlit. When lit, it starts to smell a bit more like cherry cough drops. It is a pretty good scent, though not as \"cozy\" as certain other candle scents, possibly because the cough-drop scent evokes less pleasant memories.",
