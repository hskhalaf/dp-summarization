I can actually get the tangles out SO much quicker and easier, with far less breakage. Love it!",

Since I have gotten it colored though, blow drying has become a necessity so I checked out a couple of different brushes. The one I have been using works great for getting knots out first and then I continue to brush and blow dry my hair with this great brush. I was worried that it would pull too hard on my hair while combing through, but it's surprisingly very gentle and does a great job of grabbing the hair and brushing through it. It came with a wooden comb which my boyfriend uses. Would definitely recommend this brush!",

The only problem is that there is shedding from the boar bristles, but that may just be temporary because the brush is new.

      "text": "My hair is ridiculously thick, long, and fragile. It tangles at the crook of an eyebrow. God forbid I forget to brush it before bed because I'll be ripping out knots and tangles for 15 minutes the next morning. This brush was totally worth the $12. My hair is looking GREAT after I use it too! Gets tangles out soo much easier and gentler and it's sparing me major split end action. Plus it actually feels GOOD to brush with it. Do your hair a favor and throw your crappy old brush away (it's also SUPER EASY to clean!)",

You know those little short hairs on the top of your head that stick straight up? Well, those have lessened quite a bit as well. I honestly don't know why a brush can make so much difference, but it truly does. The strong wood handle is comfortable to hold. It really is an awesome brush!",

Plus it came with an awesome satin scrunchie and a bristle brush to clean it out. BUY IT",
