      "text": "I had a previous pair of Polk headphones and while they were comfortable, functionality was limited. Why I tried these. While comfortable, the buttons on the right earpiece don't work at all on my LG V10 or any other device I have. Only upside is that they fit my large head and that's rare. But Polk has sold me their last headset. My previous pair lasted less than 6 months before shorting out. The fact that the hardware buttons didn't work out of the box is downright sad. I'm done dealing with Polk.",

The on-ear controls for the Polk headphones are better still. However, long ago I found that Sony's behind-the-head band design can interfere with a raised collar in cold weather. I bought a replacement design that connects the ear pieces with wires, without the rigid neck band. The Polk neck band isn't as long or as intrusive as the Sony, but I think replacing the hard band with just flexible wires would be the ultimate improvement. Until then, these Polk headphones are the best design I have found!",

In car driving situations I have to default back to earbuds because passengers can hear the noise of my music too loud coming from these earphones, but I do use them for working out at the gym and they never fall off and stay put when I run hard on the stair master and other training equipment.",

The Polk stay in place a little better than the PX 100 too. My biggest caveat is that the Polk is aesthetically a little bulky, although they don't feel heavy.",

My one major complaint are the rubber ear pieces that loop around the ear to hold the headphones in place. Invariably, one side or the other pops out, typically when stored in the much-too-tight case. These pieces slide into a grove on the head band, and it just appears to be a lousy design methodology.",

I never had trouble with the sound (good for price) or fit (i have a skinny head - so everything fits), but after 3 weeks and 5 uses, the right earphone cuts out when i'm running. It would cost me $25 to return it, so i can't even do that. I'll never buy electronic online again. What a nightmare and a waste of 50 bucks.",

    "description": "Polk Audio's new UltraFit Sports Headphone Series is a rethinking from the ground up of performance, comfort and durability the three characteristics serious athletes need most in a pair of headphones. Serious music lovers too will value the UltraFit Series because of its undeniably impressive sonic performance. The UltraFit 2000 is an on ear design for anyone uncomfortable with ear buds or in ear headphones. The headphones' SecureFit support ensures a snug yet comfortable fit.

This headphone also affords light noise suppression, so you're more aware of your surroundings. The headphones' SecureFit\u2122 support ensures a snug yet comfortable fit.

UltraFit headphones deliver a richer, more natural sound that makes whatever you're doing more enjoyable. Their fit and comfort will practically make you forget you're even wearing them. UltraFit headphones were designed to stand up to professional athlete's demanding workouts, so you know they'll go the distance with you. It's one of the reasons the UltraFit Series will be the last headphone you ever need to buy. The UltraFit 2000 is an on-ear design for anyone uncomfortable with ear buds or in-ear headphones. The headphones' SecureFit\u2122 support ensures a snug yet comfortable fit. The headphones also afford light noise suppression, so you're more aware of your surroundings. An on-ear 3-button control and in-line microphone enable you to use your iPod\u00ae or iPhone\u00ae. \n\nTake a look inside this product\n\n 1. Dynamic Balance\u00ae Polymer Drivers. UltraFit Sport Headphones employ dynamic drivers much like those in our full size speakers. To meet our pre-determined performance parameters, our engineers took the same care designing the drivers, even adding a discrete crossover filter to each driver to naturalize the high frequencies.\n 2. Ported Enclosures. UltraFit Sports Headphones are ported. There is the port (ear piece) you put in your ear. But the big deal is the very small channels in the back of the driver enclosure, beneath the Polk logo. These are crucial to tuning the driver's frequency response peaks. And that means a better sounding pair of headphones.\n 3. Ultra Flexible Tangle-free Planar Audio Cable. Round cables, coiling up and twisting are a constant source of annoyance because they get in the way of your workout. Eventually constant twisting means the cable will break or pull out at the end. The UltraFit's planar design (with oxygen-free wire for better conductivity) completely eliminates coiling, so the headphone cables won't tangle up during a workout, or when stored away. The planar design also eliminates micro-phonics, the tendency of an electronic device to turn a mechanical vibration into \"noise,\" which you hear in other headphones. \n 4. Moisture Shield. No headphone works well in a sweat bath of moisture. So we added Moisture Shield, a filter that provides two benefits. A thin scrim on UltraFit 2000 driver screen, the filter material resists moisture that could get to the driver; the headphones keep performing through strenuous activity. Moisture Shield also provides an acoustic barrier to help smooth frequency response.\n 5. SecureFit\u2122 Support. You're ready for your workout. You put on your headphones and get to work. The last thing you want is for an earpiece to fall out, instantly breaking your rhythm. SecureFit Support includes an ergonomically designed flexible ear hook that wraps around your ear, so the headphone stays in place, even during strenuous exercise. With SecureFit Support, you'll experience a snug yet comfortable fit.\n 6. StrainGuard\u2122. UltraFit Sports Headphones have been designed with this in mind. Strainguard\u2122 is a protective system that addresses the areas where sports headphones fail most often. A Kevlar core that houses the speaker wire provides extra tensile strength to prevent the wire from being pulled apart at common failure points - the transitions between cable and the connectors and at the headphones. In the UltraFit Series, all transitional connections are computer designed to strengthen the points where they fail most.\n 7. Environmental Awareness. Being aware of your surroundings is always important when you use a pair of headphones. In the gym, on the track or walking through the neighborhood, you want to be able to have a sense of what's going on around you. The UltraFit 2000 offers light noise reduction.\n    \n    \n\nIn the Box\n\n * Headphones\n * Protective Case\n * 1 Pair Silicone Ear Pads\n * 2 Pairs Foam Ear Pads\n * 1 Pair Cold Weather Shearling Ear Pads\n * Nokia\u00ae Connection Adaptor\n * Shirt Clip\n * Warranty: One Year Limited parts and labor\n\nTo setup and operate this product\n\nDownload the Quick Fit Guide\n\nDownload the Manual\n\nWatch the Video\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nUltraFit 2000 Sensitivity 105db Impedance 32 ohms Aprox Weight 2.5oz (71gm) Frequency Response 20Hz-23Khz Style On Ear Behind the Neck Band Transducer Type Dynamic Balance\u00ae Transducer Diameter 30mm Push To Hear Yes Built-in Microphone Yes, In-Line Input Connections 3.5mm Finishes Black & Red, White & Orange Parts Warranty 1 Year Labor Warranty 1 Year Included Cables 46\" Flat Included Ear Pads MicroFoam, Silicon, Shearling Included Accessories Nokia\u00ae Adapter, Moisture Resistant Soft Case, Shirt Clip, Quick Start Guide and Manual 1To ensure a valid warranty, Polk loudspeakers must be purchased at an Authorized Polk Audio home or car loudspeaker Dealer such as Amazon.com. (If you're not sure a dealer is \"authorized,\" call Polk Audio at 1-800-377-7655, and ask us.) The warranty is not transferrable, that means it applies only to the original purchaser. If you purchase your speakers from a private individual, that product is considered \"used\" and has NO factory warranty, no matter what the seller implies. The warranty is VOID if the serial number of the speaker has been removed or defaced. If you have any questions about your warranty coverage, or you think you need service, call Polk Customer Service at 1-800-377-7655. We're here to help you get the most from your new speakers!",
