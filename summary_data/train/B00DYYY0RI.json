This bag completely eliminates the smell of them, and holds a few packs worth of butts. My friends and I were able to enjoy ourselves, guilt-free, thanks to this little bag.",

There's a charcoal lining inside, that's how it fights against unpleasant odors. As long as it's fully zipped and the top panel is folded over, I can't detect any unwanted smells. The only issue is that it can be a little difficult to fully close the zipper, but even if it hangs slightly open, I would say 90% of the odor is still gone so it is still highly effective. I plan on repurchasing once my current bag can no longer fight odors (I've been using it for about 3-4 months and still going strong).",
