Standard counters are 36\" from the floor, standard counter tops are 1.5\" thick, and most every manufactured cabinet is therefore 34.5 tall. If anyone (like me) wants to put this can under the counter or under the counter top overhang, the lid will bang into the bottom of the standard counter top and possibly get stuck and refuse to close without manual intervention (or worse). Why cannot all the smart engineers at Simple Human come up with a can that reaches no higher than 34 3/8\" when the lid is open? Nice looking, nice features, but think hard before you propose marriage.",

I READ SOME NEGATIVE REVIEWS FROM OTHER READERS AND DECIDED WHAT I ALREADY KNEW WAS RIGHT. THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEONE SOMEWHERE THAT WILL COMPLAIN ABOUT EVERYTHING. I AM HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE.",

It did come with a sample pack of same brand garbage bags that fit very well. Though I never bought more of them.

She had a hard time tipping it over but after a couple of weeks she finally did, and trash was all over the place :( Good thing is, even when she pushed it around, it didn't break! not even a scratch. I love that I can get the inner receptacle and wash it as needed instead of getting my whole head in there to scrub it like with the one I had before!",

I've noticed there are several negative comments about this kettle, such as white flecks in the water, to a filmy discoloration on the interior of the kettle.  After daily use, my interior is as shiny as when I first bought it.  One thing though, I use bottled water.  I find that I don't get like scale on my pots, this kettle, my clothes iron or my drip coffeemaker.  I'm thinking that the reported white flecks in poured water could be that scale flaking off the inside surface. Distilled white vinegar can help eliminate limescale buildup.  As for residue on the outside, I remove my kettle from the stove before frying/sauteeing to avoid free radicals from settling on my kettle. Just a thought. ",
