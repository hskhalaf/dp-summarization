It's a great trimmer/weed eater and hasn't failed me all summer long Starting my 2nd summer with this trimmer and cranked it up no issues and still working as it should. Highly recommend",

I 2 times ordered new heads from Amazon and both times was returned, coz new heads fit 90% trimmers in America, but not rioby. Finally I ordered third time assembly head and pieces for holding blades. Now everything is work properly. Another problem - carburetor. Starting good but when I return chock back to normal run engine dropped RPM to 0. check everything what recommend U-Tube, - nothing. Tomorrow arrived new carburetor will see what happen after replacement this part.",

I called Ryobi service, and they told me that is a common problem. The big problem is that all moving parts are warrantied for only 90 days. The cost of shipping the broken trimmer to a service center is very expensive. I would not buy this product again.",

I was so mad that I let them out of time go by where it was not free to get replaced. Ended up paying to get it fixed. Now the motor is dead again and I have no idea why.

(There are two models, straight and curved.) Also, the weight balance is such that you have to prop it up on something in order to pull the start cord. I have never had that issue before. I have only had my trimmer one season and only used it four times and I can't see it lasting through two seasons of use without at least re-straightening and reinforcing the metal shaft.",
