      "text": "As a border collie owner I quickly realized the importance of the frisbee. Disc golf frisbees while being able to travel far, are made of a harder plastic. This can be problematic for a dog who loves to catch them in her mouth (teeth, mouth issues). Luckily I found this frisbee which travels well in the air, is soft, but most importantly is durable when we like to turn the frisbee in a tug of war match. Also this thing is easy to wash and dry, having exposed it to all different types of weather climates and terrains. Overall I would suggest this frisbee to other frisbee loving dog owners.",

It's when he refuses to let it go and I have picked him up off the floor with it still in his mouth that it finally shows signs of wear. That's definitely not a rip on the product quality! We keep getting him a new one because the rubber frisbees, however more durable, are just not as fun or easy to throw and catch than this one!",

I know that doesn't sound like much, but we count frisbee life in hours, sometimes minutes--never before in days with our super zealous Rottweiller/Shepherd/etc mix. Even professional-grade, fairly expensive frisbees have never made it a second day. The thing is, she absolutely loves catching frisbees and we love her acrobatics. I've just ordered three more of these. Besides being durable, this is just a great toy. It flies well, folds and packs easily and is soft in our hands and her mouth. Chomped up plastic toys are not great on your fingers.",

Next would be ones like Nerf for dogs that have a bit of a harder outer ring. The problem with those is that he bites through them almost instantly. The softer ring on this Chuckit disc is definitely more durable. I'm estimating it should last about a month with fairly heavy play.",

She has adjusted to it - even anticipates it but I wish the carton it came in was flat and not curved.

It has fallen apart. The Orange trim is fraying around the edge. You can see the tubing inside. We throw it she brings it back that's it. Shakes it a bit. We throw 25 times in the morning and again in the afternoon. Very disappointed in this. Surely not worth the money. After only 11 different throwing sessions. It's crap. Pardon the language. And she is a medium size dog about 50 pounds.",

It's not a disc we can use for tug-of-war, as that is my dog's favorite activity with a frisbee, but it has the advantage of being throwable in the house without marking the walls or breaking anything. Sadly, it does not have typical flying disc flight charactistics and resultantly is less than graceful when thrown. When we go outside and I throw it moderately hard, it flies no better than a paint bucket lid.",

Also a great frisbee for a smallish yard because of its speed.",
