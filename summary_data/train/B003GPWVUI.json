With a little bit of patience & learning how to angle and maneuver the attachments, this vacuum has cleaned the bottom of my pond beautifully. No more chemicals needed and my OCD can be put to rest. I highly recommend this item!!",

      "text": "I bought this for a large backyard koi pond. It is a waste of money for this application. The ground needs to be level or suction is reduced. I have areas where the pond bank is raised 3-4 feet for a waterfall and it can not create enough suction to efficiently vacuum the areas below. Also, you realistically need to have multiple areas for the waste tube to drain all the muck if your pond is large otherwise it just gets drained into your yard, walk ways, patio etc.. Bottom line is this is too expensive and really isn\u2019t a great solution for cleaning a large pond.",

They will also suck smaller rocks and clog the vacuum. if you have a flat floors without any rocky surfaces this should work Ok.",

I have a 18' by 15' pond that is about 3' deep in the channel from the waterfall to the skimmer.",
