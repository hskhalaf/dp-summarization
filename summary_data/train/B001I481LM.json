But after using it and seeing how much time I saved by doing a big batch instead of individual bottles, I\u2019m sold! I definitely recommend to parents that are wanting a simpler and faster way to make formula. Every time I purchase something online, I always check the reviews. I count on others to help me choose the best option. My reviews are always my honest opinion and I try to include photos if possible.

As I pump throughout the day, I just add all extra milk that doesn't go to his next bottle into the pitcher. The next morning, I bag all the milk in the pitcher to be frozen and fill it back up with the current days breastmilk. This has cut down on my morning bottle washing so much! It's also very easy to prep bottles for the day right out of the pitcher. The mixer portion mixes the fat layer back into the milk very nicely.",

It doesn\u2019t lock, but moves pretty freely and is worthless. I just watch to make sure I keep it below the liquid. When making a full pitcher, I get some leakage out of the lock-on lid.

I would dread making individual bottles every night for the next day or accidently run out of bottles and have to scoop and get things every where uggg..those days are over. Please invest in one of these. Makes about 4 to 5 bottles. Ive washed and used it everyday and it's seriously amazing.",

It is easy and quick, keeps the bubbles out of the formula, eliminates powder spillage since I don't have to mix in a small mouth bottle, and allows me to pour an odd number of ounces. No more guessing at a half scoop, or wasting an ounce of expensive formula because I had to make an extra ounce. Couple this with a bottle warmer or an electric kettle (I have the latter) and the stress reduction is palpable. Highly recommend.",

I like to make sure there are no powder chunks left as it can irritate babies stomach so when making 20oz I put half the powder in; mix it well(count to approximately 60). Put the other half in mix again. Then I mix it a third time(I know quirky...whatever). Over all happy with product.",
