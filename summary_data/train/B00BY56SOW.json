I don't like heavy foundations, so this was perfect, and it also gives SPF protection. It's not too thick, so it applies thin enough to where I'm not looking like a \"cake face.\" It's also buildable, so once it dries, you can just apply a little more in areas that need more coverage, and you're good to go.",

It does a great job with coverage being that it goes on with medium coverage. However, it is a bit on the dry side and does require moisturizer applied underneath. The moisturizer has to be compatible with the formula and applied as a thin layer or else it beads up and off your face. Ew. Does not do a thing for discoloration.",
