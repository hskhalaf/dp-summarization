They're full of runs top to bottom and the stiching is pulled out in some areas at the top. What was almost comical is I noticed something didn't look right about the center rings. As you can see in my picture, the center rings on the right are super close together, and the on the left they're spaced evenly. Is it that noticable when hung, not exactly, but it's ridiculous that they would even be packaged and sent out like that.",

I included pictures to show how light does come through but it\u2019s not a blinding stream of light that used to wake me early every morning. If you are a perfectionist these may not be for you.

I ended up ordering another one because this turned out to be a good deal.",

We ended up doubling up the grayish white ones in our daughters room so she can easily take naps during the day. That did the trick....completely dark in there during the day now and still make affordable curtains. Also, I love how these feel...velvety soft to the touch. Look expensive, but aren't!",
