It's not too long/wide to be a hassle getting through doors, and I can't say enough good things about all the cupholders. I use cupholders for drinks, toys, fries...kids and cupholders. It was easy to assemble. And it's not too heavy. Great product. Great purchase.",

He also hates the seat in the back. It\u2019s just not spaced out well. And my last complaint is the awful wheels. They are hard and small and it makes it not only hard to push and steer but very bumpy for the kids",

Seemed cheap and poorly made. Would not recommend for infant carseats of different brands. We ended up buying a similar Graco double stroller, locks easily and was $50 cheaper.",

      "text": "Just what I was expecting. I would definitely recommend to others. I own other products from this manufacturer and have been satisfied with all of them. This model, while not light, seems light compared to its size. Also light compared to other similar products. The plastic parts \"feel\" a little cheap compared to other manufacturers, but I haven't had any issues with bending or breaking parts. Absolutely no malfunctions. Opening and collapsing the stroller is simple, even compared to other single strollers I've used. My older son enjoys the multiple options he has when his brother's car seat is in this stroller. That makes it much easier to get him into it, and keep him in it when we're moving.",
