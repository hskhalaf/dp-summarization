I seriously want to use foul language here, but for the sake of the review I will refrain. This Otoscope is laughable at best! The quality is no better than a child's toy and the light that is supposed in improve your vision in the ear canal is directly in front of your line of sight. It impeded 30% of the magnifier's view. Instead of seeing ear canal and drum, I see plastic light. Very poor design and very poor quality. What a disappointment.",
