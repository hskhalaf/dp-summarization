I'm disappointed that it really didn't make it a year, but it would appear that I may be partially to blame. The yellow area of the screen appears to come from the hottest spot on the watch while it's charging and I had a habit of leaving it on the charger over night. Out of all my smart watches it remains the sleekest. I'll continue to use it off and on but mostly it'll just decorate my shelf now.",

Then after the last \"update\" it continuously reminds me to \"download the motobody app for the full experience.\" I downloaded the \"motobody\" app (it's awful by the way). The watch STILL reminds me to download the app. I have to keep clearing the stupid reminder. Really annoying. It certainly changed the \"full experience.\" The watch is now in the drawer and the Timex is back on the wrist.",

I have another watch that is not a smart watch that I paid 50 bucks for that I wore for 3 years and the band is still in tact.

      "text": "Great watch. My only issue is more with Android Wear and the use of notifications. If you use notifications (which I do), Android Wear provides not mechanism to dismiss all of them at one time. So if your notifications pile up, you end up wiping over and over again to dismiss each one. That should be fixable in an update to the OS. But the physical watch itself is very nice.",

      "text": "I wasn't sure if i was going to like having a smart watch. Well, I do. I love this thing. It not only looks nice, it works well too. I pretty much use it to preview and clear notifications and phone calls without getting my phone out, to navigate through music and podcasts, for quick GPS on the golf course (Hole 19 app), and to tell time. If you turn ambient screen mode off, the watch will easily last 24 hours. Can't vouch for how well the pedometer and heart rate monitor work. Basically, if you are on the fence about this purchase, as i was, buy it.",
