The listing was for a bird bath SET, comments were about top and bottom, but only the pedestal arrived. Who buys only a pedestal anyway? Packaging on the pedestal consisted of layers and layers of bubble wrap and cardboard, Nothing broken as other reported, just quite a lot of packaging, and NOT something I wish to recreate to send back. The pedestal looks nice, kind of short, but maybe the top would add height? Guess I will never know! To date the box, loads of packaging layers and pedestal sit in the foyer waiting for reassembly. Happy Anniversary gift. NOT!",
