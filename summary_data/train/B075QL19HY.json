We also like the bright yellow. The bright color comes in handy just in case your bag falls over board. Leave a little air in the bag is helpful too so that it will float. My husband rolled his kayak in the rapids. The bag was securely tethered down and remained secured on the kayak. His keys were in the side pocket. Everything remained very dry. The quality of the bag is great.",

The bag itself feels of quality construction, i.e., the buckles, fastening, and stitching. The bag appears to be entirely waterproof when you place items in the main bag section.

The zipper front pocket does get water inside, so be sure to enclose anything that could ruin in a plastic baggie. I also purchased a large DrySac which has plenty of room for additional items you may want to keep dry. Quality is great, thick material, and easily carried or attached to kayak with the strap. Definitely a much needed item for all of my water sports (even getting caught in the rain)!!!",
