Shrimp was crunchy and golden and the fries were perfect brown. Taste was great. If your on the fence about purchasing this don't hesitate you will not be disappointed. Food was awesome and cleanup is a breeze. Fryer has some weight to it. that I like, it feels solid and well made. Cut the cooking time from a toaster oven that I'm use to using in about half the time and turned out much better. The grease from the picture was off the Shrimp.",

Maybe I missed this detail in the description, but if I had known this, I would have opted for a different model. Too expensive in my mind to be this limiting.",

The rest like homemade falafel and spring rolls get a spritz of spray oil and they're good to go. It also cooks quickly and evenly. The turbo feature of this air fryer is what makes it great and worth a little extra money over cheaper brands. I can't live without it! It's a dream to clean but, I also use the parchment paper liners with holes to help keep it clean. I found them here on Amazon. I heartily recommend this Philips Air Fryer.",

However, a quick search online will reveal many, many recipes that ask for temperatures over 400 degrees Farenheit. That is the upper limit on the Philips TurboStar. So, while fries generally do come out crispy, some things like tempuras and wontons don't come out as thoroughly crispy as with other, hotter friers. Also, you can only adjust by 25 degrees at a time so you will compromise for some of those exacting recipes. I can live with that, but if you are a scientific food person, that will annoy you.",
