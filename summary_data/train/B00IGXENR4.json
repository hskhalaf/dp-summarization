She's been wanting a radio for her bedroom and I ordered this for her and she paid me back. She wanted me to open this radio and make sure it was in good shape so I did and the sound was incredible, I couldn't believe it. So she thought if its this good, maybe I would like to have one for Christmas and that's how I ended up getting one of my own. Great Radio and it doesn't take up a lot of space, sound is wonderful. I can't wait until Christmas.",

We have a station that doesn't come in great (but comes in) on my clock radio so I figured this expensive fancy radio would pick it up fine, but it actually doesn't pick it up all. Disappointed. I tried an external antenna, still nothing. Seems like my $10 clock radio has better a tuner, I don't know. For the stations that come in it really sounds great, I wish I could keep it but it won't work for me.",

Since this is an analog unit, the location of the frequency pointer is a bit off, but once located, reception is very good. The radio has too much bass for my taste - something like a 1960s tuner.

Sangean sound is at least 2 extra stars better, the wood cabinet is sturdier/better looking, and the tuning dial is silky and stays exactly on station. The receiving hardware/software pulls in radio stations clearer - by two stars more. Bottom line: Tivoli was average (3.0), at best; Sangean is a 4.7 out of 5.0, at least.",

Upon opening out of the box to my dissapointment it was the other model with the lighter colored wood. The box and back of the unit however said WR-11SE. It appears that the wrong color wood was put on my unit. Not sure if this was an honest mistake or they were out of the darker color because when I placed my order the light wood model was available immediately but the dark wood model had a 2 to 3 week wait however I received mine much earlier than that.",

I intentionally bought a mono radio to avoid the irritating on-and-off hiss that seems to be endemic to FM stereo in this \"fringe\" area, but was surprised by clean stereo reception while using headphones as well. My only gripe is that the \"dynamic bass compensation\" used to get the most out of the small built-in speaker seems to boost the low mids excessively when using quality headphones (Grados). But that really isn't it's purpose. I needed a presentable, simple tabletop radio with excellent reception and decent sound, and I found it. Best I ever had.",

I brought a Tivoli One when they first came out and were reasonably priced ($99). I have enjoyed my Tivoli but in a side-by-side comparison listening to a classical FM station the difference was not noticeable, although the One could get slightly louder. They had very similar sensitivity to distant stations also. The Sangean has a little less \"buzzing\" on the AM (MW) band. Based on my experience, I would recommend saving a great deal of money and choosing the Sangean--but that is only the opinion of one set of 63 year old ears.",

Digitally synthesized radios almost always don't come back on once AC power is switched back on, so today's choices are slim if you also want pleasant and robust audio. This analog Sangean model fills the bill nicely, although we'll have to wait until this winter to see whether its analog tuning capacitor results in temperature-related tuning drift. Audio is similar to that of its pricier WR-2 digital sibling, as well as the digital Tivoli Model One. FM sensitivity to weak signals is superior, as well, even using just the dinky little wire antenna that comes with the WR-11.",
