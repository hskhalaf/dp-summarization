      "text": "Pleasantly surprised by this pump! I used it last night for the first time. I yielded 8.5oz AFTER a full day of full nursing. That is more than I get with my Spectra S2. There are like 42 million parts so it takes some time to clean and I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to carry the pump it\u2019s self so that I will actually be hands free, otherwise I can\u2019t think of any downsides. The suction is good. It\u2019s pretty quiet. The machine it\u2019s self is very compact and lightweight. While there are a ton of pieces, it\u2019s easy to assemble. Overall pretty happy so far. I\u2019ll update again in a few weeks.",

This is pretty quiet, very compact and easy to use. The silicone insert is comfortable and helps with quick letdowns. I do have to charge it every day, but the battery lasts me all day and I do two long sessions (25 mins) and one short session of 5-10 mins. I would buy again if I needed another one.",

My only complaint is after pumping, maybe a swallow of milk is held up inside the pump, so you need to unscrew the pump/bottle lid and dump the pump before attempting to dump the bottle for storage, otherwise you will lose some of that precious gold and kick yourself every time you waste a sip like I do. Overall is a great pump. Thx",

If you\u2019re on a budget, if you don\u2019t want a giant pump, or you need something that\u2019s light weight to carry around with you I highly recommend this pump!!!",
