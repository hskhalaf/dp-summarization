The moisture lasts and I can tell a difference when I use it. I just bought this as a gift for a friend as it is not overpriced as some creams are and it comes in nice package. The box is pretty and I love the metal tube it comes in as well. It kind of has an old fashioned flair but is so modern with it's natural ingredients.",

I wash my hands a ton all day every day and was looking for something that stuck around but wasn't heavy or greasy. This does the job ! I am in the restaurant business so probably wash my hands 30 plus times during the day at work alone so between cold weather and constant washing I needed a good cream. This provides a nice softening and keeps my hands from cracking. Will be purchasing again.Pleasant light fragrance that so subtle it just smells fresh herbs.",

      "text": "Ordered this cream because it sounded very similar to the L'Ocittane 20% shea lotion that I use and love but came in a bigger size (2.5oz vs 1oz) and was cheaper. Bad decision. Used it once and my hands started itching. I'm still a little itchy, 3 days later. The verbena scent was a little bit overwhelming too, not mild as mentioned in other reviews.",
