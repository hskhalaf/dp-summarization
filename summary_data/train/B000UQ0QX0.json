The design is about right for heavier work, though the blade could fill a bit more of the space between the handles. For lighter or more accurate work, you will need to spend a ton of time bringing the edge up to spec.",

It was sharp when I unpacked it, and used it to strip bark from a large oak limb that I planned to carve. Once I got into the right angle and rhythm, it worked amazingly well. As for any knife, I found that honing it now and then restores the edge. If you haven't done it before, I strongly recommend viewing some YouTube videos about honing a draw knife or similar tool. It isn't very hard and will give you pleasure to maintain your tool. I would definitely recommend this to anyone shopping for a draw-knife.",
