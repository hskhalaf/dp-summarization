      "text": "I have used all 4 of the v series compounds on a new black bc/cc paint job. I was having problems with swirls after using the V38 compound. So I ordered some of the VSS hoping to solve the swirl issue. I believe the swirls were worse. I tried every pad, different pressures, different amounts of polish and different durations. So I purchased some 3M ultrafine ex #3 polish, and the 8\" pad. After about 15 minutes working on a panel the swirl marks are gone. The 3M number I used is 06068. So if you are having issues with this product line and swirls, try the 3M/ product. You wont be disappointed.",
