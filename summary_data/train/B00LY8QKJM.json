The Krushr is 100% more quiet than the GE monogram it replaced. It\u2019s so quiet my wife has a hard time knowing when it is running. I\u2019d give it 5 stars but the Blue LED stopped working within 2 days of installation. The Stainless Steel door was super easy to install. The included toe-kick was more difficult and never quite fit properly.",

It is overpriced and the trash bags are not standard size that can be purchased at our local store, such as Costco. We were limited on selection for a 12 inch trash compactor as these appliances are not as popular as they once were. Also, there was a large opening as the base after installation that we had to cover with leftover cabinet paneling.",

Since I needed a 12\" wide compactor it was my only choice. It is nice looking very quiet & very expensive. Other than less compaction the only other problem I have had is the bag catching on the compaction ram and tearing. I am only on my second bag so I think I will find a resolution to solve this.",
