All the time you are with them your mind is there , no chance of relax and comfort. -Three days after the purchase, left earbud stop working. For that price tag I really expected much more.

This may be down to my ear shape, Pressing the buttons on the sides of the headphones requires force which pushes them further into your ears, Resulting further pain and discomfort from the shape and increasing suction from the in ear making it extremely uncomfortable and rendering the sound inaudible. The equaliser provided in the app makes it sound super tinny regardless of your EQ, I have a pair of Jlab jbuds for bluetooth wired headphones that perform better than these, They are far more comfortable and the sound quality is FAR superior.

After about two weeks however, I started having serious connectivity issues followed shortly by an inability to charge the pods, rendering them pretty much useless.

Easy pairing and intuitive control on the earbuds themselves which is nice. Haven\u2019t used them for a call yet. Charging case is neat and clever and quite compact.

Although they are designed to fit in the ear they were not a good fit in my ears the ear buds stuck out a lot. I expected better from a well known make from the music industry, so I was really disappointed.",

Apart from that, they were easy to pair and software seemed easy to use. Sound was ok but nowhere near as good as Airpods Pro or Bose QC, both of which I also own.",

      "text": "Excellent fit and decent enough sound, although if you are in a noisy environment on call, your caller will struggle to hear you. I've played with all the settings in the rather limited app and it doesn't help. Unlike my previous wired wireless bluetooth headphones, these ones badly suffer from interference. Anything can trip them up: switching lights on and off, stray wi-fi signal... Finally, after some 9 months of use suddenly the battery life went sharply down; I now have to charge them twice as often as before.",
