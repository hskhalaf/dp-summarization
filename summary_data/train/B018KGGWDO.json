I wish there was a less obvious color than the turquoise, but it only shows occasionally. They are comfortable and wear very well. I enjoy them because we have a policy that requires us to leave our shoes at work, the easy pull on is a big benefit. One small drawback, as the sole wears down, I slip occasionally on our kitchen floor....which is already very slick and often wet. But I use this as an indicator to upgrade to a new pair of boots.",

The stitching is also a much bigger threading, and that is obvious. Her right boot was so much tighter than the left it was almost painful for her to wear for the first month.

I am a city person, so no horses, barns, farms and such. Just daily wear, including snow and rain. A tag of some sort explaining how to maintain these would have been nice.

      "text": "These are my 2nd pair of Justin Gypsy boots. I purchased my 1st pair at our local Tractor Supply and absolutely love them. I wanted a black pair, and looked there again. Only Tractor Supply wanted $90.00, where Amazon had them for $70.00. My foot is small, so I have to insert an additional insole, but totally worth it. I am 5'9\", and do not want a high heel. I like these not just because they look good, but they have a rounded toe, and are very comfortable. Definitely recommend. Thanks Amazon!",

December, in Minnesota is not the time to be walking around in wet boots :) I'll update and let everyone know how it goes when I do get around to shrinking them.",

Unfortunately, they were too small and I had to return them! BUT.... I'm going to order another pair ... just larger! I really do like these boots and am going to give them another try with a larger size.",

I bought the waterproof boots for trail rides (including short walks in rough terrain) and working at the barn. They're perfect for temparatures between 40\u00b0F up to 65\u00b0F and rainy (muddy) days. Depending on your saddle and the length of your legs the low boot leg may cause a bit of a problem as you may get stuck on the fender when moving your calfs on the horse.",
