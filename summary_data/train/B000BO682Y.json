This is barely long enough, but leather usually stretches over time so I didn't want it longer. So these shoes run small. I suggest ordering a half size up for length and wider width than you normally wear. Once you find the right fit, these sandals are exceptionally comfortable. I had inserts in my Brook's Addiction tie shoes, but don't need them in these sandals. Very comfortable and definitely worth the money. Highly recommend.",

They are super comfy, this praise comes from someone who cannot wear any shoe over 2\" high, wears and orthopedic arch support in all her shoes, and suffers from restless leg syndrome, occasional bouts of planters fasciitis, and flat feet. And very wide feet 4E or WW. If you experience such problems give these a try . I can only imagine with these being so comfy with all of my foot problems that for someone without foot problems would find these shoes like walking on a cloud.",

I just don't understand why more manufacturers, including Propet, don't make more sandal styles with the ability to remove the insole. There must be millions of people who would love to wear sandals but can't because they wear orthotics. That said, give these a try if you have problem feet. They work for me. I'm buying more of these in case they stop making them.",
