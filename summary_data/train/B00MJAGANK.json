You do hear them roar but that is to be expected with a M/T tire. My brother even commented on the wear the other day, he said the were holding up very well they hardly looked used at all. Much better grip off road than stock Goodyear. To early to tell life of tire but from first 5000 miles looks like very long life for M/T.",

    "description": "The Firestone Destination M/T tire is an aggressive mud and all-terrain tire that is best suited for off-roading or work trucks that need durability, mud traction, traction in loose gravel and sand. You will not get stuck with the Firestone Destination M/T tire thanks to the large tread blocks and wide open spaces to evacuate the loose material. In rock and on gravel, added protection comes from Firestone's \"long-link\" rubber formulations that are treadwear and cracking resistant. This same rubber is in the sidewall of the tire to protect against curbing or damage from off-road hazards.\n\nAll Firestone Destination M/T tires feature O-bead technology. This improves uniformity and ride comfort through the use of a single continuous strand of cable in the bead construction. The tire also has a large rim guard to protect the wheels, and is even pinned for studs for extra grip on snow and ice.",
