I want my money back $1100+ they don't back their defective products read all the mishaps with the drones above.",

I turned it off to let it cool down and have a break but same issues when I turned it back on later. After 2 days of me trying multiple times decided to return it and it cost me $58 in shipping. Very disappointed had high hopes for this drone.",

Distance, speed and video quality is just amazing. I did not want to spend this much myself and only got it to confirm they all the same (maybe a bit better) but let me tell you - I was wrong!

Even though the 4k may have a slight advantage in picture quality, the 2.7 drone has a much stronger transmitter. This is very important as you fly the drone farther distances. They do not make this clear in the promotions. Anyway, If I had to do it over, I would buy the slightly more expensive 2.7k drone. Good luck flying",

If it wouldn't have been for my friend in Ottowa who already has one, I would have been lost. Especially that this.drone creates it's own wifi network. Totally an awesome unit.",

No firmware install happens and now I just sit here with IMU calibration errors and no way to actually run it since the IMU calibration button is greyed OUT! AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID, not sure but I want to return this thing IMMEDIATELY....",
