I expected something would go bad, and as I expected it did. After of regular use for a while I started to noticed a small blue stuck pixel on the bottom left corner, it was fine because it didn\u2019t bother with the canvas or the art program itself. But as time passed it became much more worst than before. After that this happened, a straight line appeared. I fully not recommend buying this product, as for my experience buying it twice and getting the exact same problem already is a bad sign.",

Yes, they have a dock-like thing that enables just one cable coming off the tablet, it works, it's just super clumsy and adds a rats nest of cables to my desk.
