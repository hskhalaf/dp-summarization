The order ended up getting cancelled by the seller for no apparent reason. I was less than pleased when I had to begin my search again, but this TV stand and fireplace transaction was a breeze! I was happy with the quality of it, shelving and room to store, functionality, and quality. It was extremely easy to assemble, too. The directions were clear and concise and did not frustrate me. Good purchase and I'm glad the other fireplace didn't work out honestly!",

There was 1 step during assembly that was impossible to do with the tools they listed, but otherwise pretty easy although time consuming to put it together. Fireplace has two switches for the visual and heat. Storage space fits my game consoles and controllers with ease. 42\" TV is a pretty good fit, but I am planning to buy a swiveling foot for the TV.",

      "text": "My husband assembled it when it came. He was actually quite impressed at how clear the directions were written (considering other furniture items we've boughten on Amazon) and it did go together smoothy. The only issue we had is if you leave just the fireplace on (not the fan) then you can hear a click noise from the rotation of the light after awhile. It's not noticeable if the heater is on or if you have music/tv playing. Thats the only reason I doc it a star as it happened the second time we turned on the fireplace. Perfect for a small living room apartment but I'm not sure it would look right in a large open living room.",

It must have like the thinnest layer of paint on it because if I even breathe too hard on the wood, the paint chips off. It's also super expensive to run. My electric bill the first month we had it was terrifying. I'd say spend a little more and get something of quality.",
