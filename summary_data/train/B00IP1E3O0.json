First, I am personally convinced that Krill oil is better regular fish oil in supplying omega 3 fatty acids. Second, the Sports Research Krill oil had no aftertaste which makes it, at least for me more desirable.The fact that it is certifiably sustainably sourced is another positive. Finally, a fairly minor point is it comes packaged with a flip top cap, which for my aging hands is a nice touch.",

Krill oil is a better alternative to salmon and cod, at least for now, and these have been an easy choice for me to make. I don\u2019t get any after taste or smells from this product and have taken it with food and in between meals without issues at all. I am doing an Amazon monthly subscription for this so I don\u2019t have to be without. I\u2019m excited to see where my numbers will be when I test again next month!",

This supplement is much more effective than traditional omega 3 products and the benefits are noticeable after only a few weeks! My joints became less painful, I recovered faster after workouts and my acne subsided dramatically. Sports Research is a wonderful brand that has gained my trust as a long term customer.",

I\u2019ve been taking these for a little over a month now and have to say I felt better when taking fish oil (same brand). I don\u2019t suffer from blood pressure problems, but it has been a bit higher then my normal when taking fish oil. Also I felt like fish oil helped with my mood and ADHD more. Not a bad product, just might not be what my body prefers.",
