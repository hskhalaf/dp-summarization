      "text": "It works perfectly for the xbox one x. I move back and forth daily from house to house to apartment and I don't know how I did it before this honestly. More than enough room for cords and controllers and a few gadgets. Headset did not fit (Mine is very large, a smaller one would probably depending on what else is inside) but I was not expecting it to anyway because of its awkward shape and clunkyness. Hard outer shell protects everything so there are no worries. Highly highly recommended for anyone who moves an xbox one x around.",

This is a very cheap bag for what you pay for it. The console is also kind of loose in the bag. I kept it just because I wanted something small to carry my Xbox One X with me on the road.",

After the size of the box the Xbox originally came in, I was worried about having to fly home with it. But this fit nicely in the overhead bin, but still felt secure for carrying the console. Held the accessories that came with it without problem. Strap felt strong, which had been another concern, since we had to carry this for a while. Now the case is convenient for storing the console at home. A good purchase.",

So everything I need fits in one container, but I don\u2019t expect my stuff to stay safe in a fall. I put this in a secure place in the car when I travel, so it does what I need. Doesn\u2019t take up a lot of room either.",

Just basic protection and a slim, low profile case. The console fits snuggly on one side of the case. On the other side I was able to fit a conroller, game case, power cord and HDMI cord. This case does exactly what I need it to do at a resonable price.",
