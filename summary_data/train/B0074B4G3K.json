I don't have to feel like I'm sending my kid to school and he's starving until lunch, and they satisfy his sweet tooth and keep him from asking when's dinner every five minutes. And I don't feel like I'm feeding him garbage. Win for him and win for Mom.",

As mentioned, this is a 10 bar box, and it is packaged 2 bars to the pouch, meaning you only get 5 pouches in the box.
