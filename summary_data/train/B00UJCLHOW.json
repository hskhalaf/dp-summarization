I ran FULL SPEED uphill in the snow and did not slip once - I did this to test the boots. I have a coco fiber mat on the porch to scrub my boots off before walking inside to take them off. When I'm wearing these boots it's infinitely more difficult to scrub my boots. That's the only downside of this boot's design...you will have difficulties trying to loose traction and scrub mud off the soles. Super comfortable, only took two weeks to break in and super grippy.",

I used to buy Danner, but as they have more and more of their products made in China the quality has continued to decline. I paid less for these than comparable boot from Danner and they are far superior in quality and comfort, and they last longer. They are not intended for mountaineering, but hiking with light packs, camping, day-hikes, they are great. Would recommend to anyone.",
