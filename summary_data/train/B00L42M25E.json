Make sure your regulator is set to 90 PSI and then PULSE the trigger - don't hold it down. Squeeze the trigger fast and in short bursts, allowing your line to recharge with 90 PSI in between pulses. Using this method I was able to take off lug nuts on my F-350 which were torqued to 150 ft lbs as well as rusty frame and brake caliper bolts that I'm sure would have taken more torque than that.

Struts, control arm bolts and stubborn brake brackets were removed easily. Please note that a 3/8 hose must be used for effective functionality. I will purchase more products from this company.
