The only problem I've had with it is that the velcro strip that holds the mop pad started to come off when I removed the pad. Be careful to take off the pad slowly. You might have to hold the black strip on the mop in place while removing the pad.",

Cons: Doesn't seem to get the floors as clean as a steam mop (which can't be used on this floor type) or traditional mop and bucket, and the solution appears to leave a haze on the floor. Overall, the mop is really nice, but I'm not 100% sold on the cleaning solution that comes with it.",

The BONA solution is awesome, the mop is poorly designed and I DO NOT recommend it.",

It swivels so you can easily get under and around furniture. Hoping it holds up BUT it seems pretty solid.

The older version of the Bona mop had an issue with the spray bottle sucking in and collapsing, therefore holding very little cleaner in it. The newer version has a much harder exterior to the spray bottle, but now I am having issues with all the cleaning liquid running out of the bottle. I have loved the mop, but it has been a continuous problem with the spray bottle. Would like to see this completely resolved before Bona loses many customers over this issue.",
