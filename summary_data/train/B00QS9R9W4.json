Turning awl wheel from size to size requires some effort but that is necessary so that it does not move while you are using it, not the arrow showing the direction of travel. Also when you are done, turn the wheel so that it is in between awls so that you can close and secure the handles properly. No regrets on this one.",

Punching holes with this one was easy and it did not require much force at all. It's a nice tool to have and I can think of many other uses for it. This one is of very good quality and sturdy construction and I am extremely happy with my purchase.",

I make botanical lampshades, and may need to punch as many as 80 holes, through three layers of materials (fabric, acetate and styrene) in order to lace each lampshade around the top and bottom rings. With this punch, I can make beautifully clean holes through all three layers with one hand! Because it is so easy to use, I can work faster, and get a lot more done without tiring my hands. I highly recommend it.",
