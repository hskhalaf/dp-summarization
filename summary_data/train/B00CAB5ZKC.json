      "title": "Warning: Not 100% compatible with Android",
      "text": "These arrived much earlier than expected. It was clearly marked on the box that these are made for i Phone, not Android (see image). So I wasn't that surprised to discover that the cables volume controls didn't work. In my opinion this was not made clear in the Amazon product description, so be warned. Other than that, there was a bit of crackling at first that then stopped and the sound quality is pretty good on the whole. They came nicely packaged so no complaints there, although it would have been nice to include a small clip. I'll update this review if I notice any quality issues.",

      "text": "I bought this brand because I already knew it. The sound is fantastic, and they are really durable. I use the all the time, even for jogging out, which accelerates the wear of the phones. My ears are very tiny, and most of the in-ear phones are to big for my ears, to the point of hurting and not staying there for a long. These are just the perfect fit for small ears. And I reiterate the quality of sound, I don't know all the characteristics and definition of sounds, but I've tried different 'big brands' and definitely this one competes with the biggest one.",

      "text": "I have had these for almost 2 weeks now and have loved them, delivery was very quick. The earphones are well built and do not feel cheap at all. They have a very good cable that prevents them from getting tangled and is very effective. I would recommend these highly to anyone who listens to any music with bass in it such as dance, house, electro or dubstep because they produce a great amount of bass for earphones. They would also be great for any other type of music.",

The buds aren't as good as they could be, and if you listen for music several hours at a time I'd recommend looking elsewhere, but if you're like me and listen <2hr at a time you shouldn't experience any problems. The only super frustrating thing is the buttons, they're designed for Apple products and will not work properly in any other device (Nexus 4/Zune HD here) which is annoying. But overall, for the price they're well worth a buy.",

This does depend on the type of music you like of course and personal preference. I like the style the colour is nice and the flat cables seem to make it harder to get tangled which I really liked.",

      "text": "Thisset of in-ear headphones by SOL Republic are OK, but to me, at an Amazon price of \u00a330 plus, not great value for money. They work fine, the sound is good, and I like the rubberised cables which, as they say, are tangle resistant. However, there is an overall flimsiness to them which makes feel that they'd be very easily damaged. They supply spare rubber in-ear pieces, which is a nice touch, and they certainly stay in my ears fine. The mic button / interruptor mechanism works fine too. Like I said, my one big doubt about them is the feeling of flimsiness.",

The earbuds provided fitted my ears well, and were comfortable, and there are other sizes included.

The ear plugs are comfortable and the come with replacements and different sizes and the flex is thick and sturdy but very flexible and strong, these will not tangle up easily.
