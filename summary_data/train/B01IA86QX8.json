Its a KING which is actually verrry difficult to find! Love the cover, makes me feel more secure, since 3 of our cats are always in bed with us! Nice colour, i cant stand basic beige anything! No smell, fast and easy from box to blown up bed. Its been up for about 2 weeks and its just now starting to feel like we might need to top it off with a bit more air. Overall, fantastic from purchase to performance. Finally something thats not great at either seller or item. This has high quality on both! 100 stars!",

So, two days later another arrived and it's perfect. If you're looking for an air bed... You need to look no further (Likely should have left the defective first one out of this review but wanted to show customer service is also great).",

My girlfriend decided to add an extra pillow top mattress pad and that was a good idea since we need to have it blown kinda hard so I wouldn\u2019t feel like I was going to roll off in the middle of the night. We can\u2019t seem to get it back in the bag properly, and the drawstring from the bag broke already too. All in all it\u2019s really good quality air mattress, and we\u2019ll see how it holds up for a lot more camping trips.",

I was hoping it would have and automatic shutoff when it got too full. If it does, I haven't seen any mention of it in the literature with it.

      "\u2705 NO MORE BACK PAIN - Read the reviews of the Best Choice Air Mattress. You'll find that people are thrilled with the firmness of this air bed. Other inflatable beds will collapse or stretch, which offers no support for your joints. With the laminated material of the Best Choice, we have solved that problem. It not only offers a firm sleeping surface, but it also makes for a very sturdy air mattress on the edges as well.",
      "\u2705 BEST LOOKING AIR MATTRESS - No one will argue, The Best Choice is in fact, the best-looking air mattress out there. The stylish bed skirt and fitted top sheet is much more than a fashion statement; it provides a critical layer between you and the bed. This will keep you much warmer and keep you sleeping much deeper.",
      "\u2705 GETTING GOOD SLEEP IS ALL ABOUT BACK SUPPORT - This is the firmest raised inflatable bed out there, offering second to none back support. So many positive feedback letting us know how it has helped their back from hurting. We've even had customers suggest putting a simple pillow topper on top, \"making it the most comfortable bed in the world\". Or, our favorite quote, \"My hip doesn't hurt anymore like when I sleep on my $1500.00 mattress\".",
      "\u2705 IF IT LEAKS, IT'S WORTHLESS - We understand this very well. That is why we spend extra on the material. Laminated vinyl prevents the air bed from stretching too much. It is the seams of an air mattress that will break down and start to leak. Preventing the seams from over stretching will prolong the life of your air mattress. So much so, you can expect your bed to last twice as long as a regular vinyl product. You can also put over 300 lbs. on a raised air mattress twin."
