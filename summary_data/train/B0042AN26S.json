Comfortable right out of the box, which is a new experience for me. No blisters or hot spots at all. Update on June 22, 2016: Just did a four day, 35 mile Olympic National Park trek with these boots, carrying a heavy pack, ice axe, crampons, etc, and am thoroughly impressed. No hotspots, no blisters. Crossed lots of streams, snowfields and wet areas and my feet stayed dry and comfortable. Excellent craftsmanship. These are solid, well-made boots and my new favorite gear item. Extremely happy with this purchase.",

Overall, it is a well made heavy boot. If you have wide feet and have purchased other Lowa's in wide.this boot will probably not fit. I did notice that though the box it came in has a \"Wide\" sticker, the inside tongue of the shoe did not indicate \"wide\" as the Renegade does. Oh well - it was returned on my penny. Stuff happens. Still a fan of Lowa.",

This was the first time wearing them with thick hiking socks (Smart Wool) and they were supportive, very comfortable, and grippy. This hike had a pretty steep ascent for the first 1.5 miles and wound into down hill switchbacks beyond that. So far so good; next step will be to wear them with a weighted pack. I am planning a Nepal Trek with these and now I am in the break-in stage with the new boots.",
