From the very beginning this is simply astoundingly good. All the old game is here, yet better, smoother, faster. Some of the original cut scenes have been cut out, and replaced with better scenes. Images are sharp. Colours are subdued and used well. All in all much better than anticipated.",

I know it's an old game, but I clearly forgot the gist of it. Another thing that bothered me were the headshots that no effect on the zombies walking about the police station. Oh, sorry, you get an extended mag in the police station. Great for classic gamers. Not for me.",

I am not far into Claire's scenario but the only thing letting it down is how easy the puzzles are. I recall them making you think a bit harder in the 90s version. If you buy the standard copy, you can upgrade it to delux by downloading the bundle from PSN or Xbox Live. That way you get a physical copy of the game and the extras like costumes and orginal soundtrack which sounds great.",

However, it can get frustrating at times, when trying 15 times to defeat a monster, with long load times each attempt and no further help or bonuses. I almost gave up on the game a few times. Even on the lowest difficulty level, this game is too hard for the average player. We seem to be constantly short of ammonition or health kits... Shame because it could have been perfect.",

Only downside, is there is no point / coin system to spend on upgrades like all other resis bar 7. However, as a long time resi fan, this instalment is no let down. Resi 4 will always remain my favourite, but this one has jumped straight into that number 2 spot",
