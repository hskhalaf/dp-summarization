I bought the size for trailers up to 20'. It fit good. A little too much material in the front but that is probably because my trailer is sloping in the front instead just a flat front. Fit over the roof air conditioner and tv antenna just fine. The straps really pull it tight around the front, back, and underneath the trailer. Overall, great product. I hope it holds up to the Florida sun and summer thunderstorms.",

After installing the cover, we experienced 2 days of 20-30 mph winds with gust to 45-50 mph. We did put 2 extra ropes across the top of the trailer for support, but were very pleased with how well the cover held up. No rips or tears. We are very pleased with this cover's durability. Considering how large the trailer is, it was reasonably easy to install. Good instructions. We had questions about the use of some of the straps and contacted the company's customer service dept. who answered our questions promptly and helped us. I would recommend this cover.",

Haven't gone in the trailer to check the known leaking areas yet. The zippers on the sides are cool and will make it much easier to get in and out of the trailer in the winter months. Overall, it seems like a good buy. I'm not sure how many seasons it will last, though. The material is pretty thin.",

The side zippers are a nice touch but don't expect it to be directly over your trailer door. Before I installed the cover, I slit some tennis balls and pushed them onto the rain gutters and the top ladder tips. If this is not done, it is highly possible the pointy areas will cause a hole in the cover. It has held up well through 2 southern California desert windstorms. I'm hoping that it last 4-5 years.",

The front end is aerodynamic and curved, and the cover does have quite a bit of extra fabric up front, which needs to be cinched up. Hopefully high winds won't cause everything to flap too much. I believe it's designed for a boxier trailer. There's an extra cover that comes with this, that has velcro on it. I'm not exactly sure what it's for, as it's way too big for the power tongue jack control unit. Any thoughts?",
