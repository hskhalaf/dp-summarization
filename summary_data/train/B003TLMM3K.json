This is a good thing seeing she only wants to eat the chicken part most of the time, but won't eat plain jerky, lol... I guess she likes it served on a stick! She's an older dog with digestive issues and does just fine with these, and the chicken comes off fairly easily so it's not too hard on her teeth. When she does eat the rawhide, it keeps her busy for a good 15-20 minutes, but a large dog would get through it faster.",
