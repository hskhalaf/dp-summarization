Cons: they are cheaper bags and therefore not the best shoulder strap for long term holding/carrying. It is lacking padding and digs into the shoulder a bit (over 45min) depending on weight you place inside. I and partner traveled with the bags. In one bag I fit small purse inside (clutch style) folders, planner, headphones, snack food, change of clothes (light shirt/shorts).

The bag does hold quite a bit, zippers seem reasonably good, and it fits perfectly under the seat, even in the confines of a small commuter aircraft. The shoulder strap is not removable, relatively thin, and riveted to the bag - not a good option for heavy items or as a checked bag.

      "text": "I love everything about this bag! Very roomy, durable yet not heavy. I took it for the first time on our trip to Texas. It fits great on the floor by me on the airplane and I carried it with ease through the airports etc. on my shoulder. And I am not a tall/big person, yet it was very easy for traveling. I used it to carry my purse in it and all of our documents to get on our cruise etc. Great bag for me!",

Unable to sew it because of the amount of fray and location where it came off. Be careful of what you pack- bring large safety pins in case. The small ones don\u2019t work either. It was kind of embarrassing traveling with a bo bo carryon bag during several small flights between Tahiti, Bora Bora, then back through several US airports.",

Well worth the $16 for this bag to save $35 each way that Frontier charges for normal sized carryon bags and even normal sized backpacks.",

By the time I reached my destination after first use of an eight-hour international flight, the bag's strap was ripped so that I could no longer wear it on my shoulder, but instead had to hold onto the straps. Of course, this was not ideal as I had a large suitcase + carry-on, too. My items inside the bag included a few toiletries, headphones, and a monthly planner, so the bag should have held up longer. I wish I would have saved my money.",
