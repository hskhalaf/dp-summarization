I\u2019ve had these for less than three months, and just putting them ON causes the support to break. Keep in mind since I\u2019ve had another pair break I\u2019ve been super careful with these. I wasn\u2019t power fisting my head into them, just placing them on and they broke. And the cheap plastic can\u2019t be glued by gorilla glue either. So now I have to get another pair of headphones, and I can tell you they won\u2019t be these.",

The connection point for the earpiece on one side cracked, and the headset no longer sat on on my head comfortably. I thought I must have sat on them or something, and after several unsuccessful attempts to use tape or glue to hold it together, I ended up buying a second headset. ... which fell apart on me this morning. No mistake, I definitely did not sit on them this time. The connection point for one of the earpieces just fell apart after 4 months. So yes, nice sound, but quite breakable, and I will not be buying these again.",

I usually don't like on ear headphones but I have the 950bt and these and I honestly prefer the 650s. The sound is MUCH more balanced in my opinion but still on the bass heavy side obviously. If you want to rattle whatever you've got going on between your ears get the 950bt. If you want super light weight headphones that sound great and have very long battery life then the 650s are better. They're more compact so it's not a chore to carry around but still incredibly comfortable.",

      "text": "The headphones were nice - while they lasted. After a little over one year of moderate use the bearing which connects the main earpiece to the headband snapped off. This appears to be a VERY common issue with these headphones. After opening up the headphones I found the culprit (see photo). Sony has actually cut a smooth notch into the plastic(!!!) bearing that supports the earpiece. It's incredible that this critical piece would be made of plastic (and purposefully notched) in such an expensive product. This seems to be a case of planned obsolescence, and I can not recommend buying these headphones for even light to moderate use.",

They perform well even as I swear. But the band and ear pads collect sweat and cleaning is very difficult. Add on: I bought these in March. It is now Sept. These headphones are still great. One additional problem. The seam on inner edge of ear pad split. I wish I had a way to repair it.",

You have to be careful with the plastic around the ear cups because they can break. But that's the only reason these aren't five stars. They have superb connectivity, battery life, and sound quality. The colors are attractive without being gaudy and I personally enjoy the emphasis on bass. Not appropriate for exercise but if I'm grocery shopping or cleaning around the house, I've got these on.",

At that point the quality goes up, but you wind up asking if it is worth it. If you don't need noise canceling, these are the sweet spot. Decent sound, good battery life, nice fit and finish.",

They have good battery life, they have amazing sound quality, etc. The only problem arises after a long time of use. They don't charge or turn on anymore. Both pairs of headphones have been heavily used but taken care of well. It is a common problem with Sony wireless headphones, according to the internet. If they figure out a way to fix the problem, I'd recommend these. But for now, since both my headphones died that way, I can't recommend these to anyone.",

However, all three pairs that we owned have broken in the same place. They are just barely out of the one-year warranty and Sony will not do anything to fix or replace them. I called their customer service and they said there is nothing they can do to replace or repair these headphones. I\u2019ve spent over $300 on Sony headphones and cannot use any of them now. I will never buy them again. Look for a better brand with better customer service and quality. I am extremely disappointed with Sony.",
