It kept my oatmeal so hot until lunch time that it burnt my mouth. However, I would recommend checking out this blue one by the same brand. This one is 29.95, the blue one is 33.40. And this one holds 1 1/2 cups of water, the blue holds 3 cups. It is on amazon too.",

No paint peeling or chipping from its exterior wall. Cleaning is easy along with disassembling/reassembling all attachment pieces; only hand wash it with soft sponge and drying with paper towel to prevent water droplet stains/potential rusting.

There is a twist-off, removable top portion that opens so that you can let steam out before opening the actual lid. Cleans up very easily and ready for the next day!

It does have one neat feature, especially for those with small hands or who lack the strength to break a vacuum seal. If you only partially fill the jar with very hot food, the air inside the container will contract as it cools, thus creating a vacuum that is hard to overcome. With this model, the lid has an additional twist-off top lid that reveals a tiny vacuum release button. This means you have another lid to track/remove when you wash it, but might be useful for some.",

It definitely keeps hot food warm 6 hours of you heat it up properly. I leave for duty at 6:30 and eat lunch at 11:30-11:45 most days and my lunch when I used it to see if it kept it warm, was still very nice and hot. Very recommend.",

    "description": "Size:16.9-Ounce| Color:Black/StainlessZojirushi began in Japan in 1918 as a manufacturer of hand-blown vacuum bottles. They are still known today for their high quality vacuum insulated products. This stainless steel food jar is vacuum insulated so it keeps foods (or beverages) hot or cold for hours. Durable and sanitary 18/8 stainless steel construction will not rust, tarnish or stain, and will not leak harmful chemicals. The interior is polished stainless steel with a nonstick coating and is neutral to taste and smell. Tight -fitted lid has a gasket that seals lid to minimize leaks and maximize heat retention. It has a unique lid designed with a vent that allows users to release the pressure inside to make the lid easier to open when the food jar contains hot foods or beverages. A wide opening of 2 and one half inches makes it easy to fill and clean and allows user to eat directly out of the jar. Compact design takes minimal space while maximizing capacity.",
