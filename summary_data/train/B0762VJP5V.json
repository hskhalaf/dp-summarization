      "title": "Great for custom makeup palette",
      "text": "I bought these to use for assembling custom makeup (eyeshadow, blush) palettes; specifically, I was using the empty MAC palettes. These magnets worked great because you can cut them as small as 1/4 size with regular scissors, so they fit products from all different brands, and they provided the perfect amount of adherence onto the palette - not too weak or too strong. They added a little height but if you have the room in the palette you\u2019re using, I think it\u2019s actually helpful because it makes the pan of product easier to pry off to move. The adhesive backing works very well too. These were a nice, less costly alternative to the magnets that are made for this purpose.",

      "text": "Not quite as magnetic as I would like them to be but they're alright. I had to use a lot of them, but they did the job. The big thing is they only really magnetized well one way so it's important to find it before sticking the items to the surface. I had to use about 4-5 for an eyeshadow pallet, if that helps with assessing how many you may need. If I open the door slowly it's fine, but if I'm even a but fast the makeup falls, so be aware these magnets can only do so much.
