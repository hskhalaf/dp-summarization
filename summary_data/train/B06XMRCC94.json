I bought a second one for our other child but she really doesn\u2019t get the concept yet but I am hoping to train her on it earlier to keep her in bed also.

As LO is falling asleep, having volume slowly decrease thru the programs is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. The only issue I have is the sound selection for lullabies. There are only three options and they are all high pitched. For anyone with sensory overloaded toddlers, this is not the ideal music for falling asleep. Wish there were a couple low pitched lullabies better for falling asleep.",

After I explained my issues with the machine I\u2019d purchased, the company very quickly sent a replacement machine, which we have been using for about a month without any issues. I don\u2019t ever expect every single product to be perfect coming out of production, but I *always* appreciate a company that goes out of their way to make a customer feel like each and every consumer matters, and Hatch did just that. Thank you for your stellar customer service Hatch!! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- This machine worked great for about two weeks and out of the blue, the sound became intermittent making the device unusable.",

The app could be improved; sometimes is doesn't sync and can't be controlled by the app. However, it doesn't impact the machine itself as you can still change it all from the base. We chose this one because it also serves as a \"time to wake\" clock for toddlers and you can establish routine times with it. We haven't gotten that far but it seems like this product is something that can be used at many stages so it's worth the money.",

We believe that modern design and thoughtful function can come together to create solutions for the toughest job out there: parenting. Our suite of products, Rest, Grow, and Listen, help give parents the peace of mind they need that their babies are growing into happy, healthy kids.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nModern. Simple. Personalized.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nAt Hatch Baby, we\u2019re parents of kids of all ages, and we know how hard it can be to help our children fall asleep and stay asleep. After trying just about everything to help get our kids to sleep, we built Hatch Baby Rest, rolling all the functions we know help little ones sleep best into one modern, functional and beautifully designed device. More than just a night light, sound machine, or OK-to-wake alarm, Rest is the smart, fully customizable and remotely controlled solution designed for babies and kids that grows with their changing sleep needs.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nRest is the all-in-one sleep solution that parents have been wishing existed for years. We know from personal experience how frustrating it is to have a sound machine that can only be controlled from the device itself, or a nightlight that shuts off after a set period of time, only to require sneaking into a sleeping toddler\u2019s room to turn it back on. There had to be a better way than needing multiple gadgets to help create just the right atmosphere to encourage babies and kids to sleep through the night. We knew there was a better way, and that\u2019s why we created Rest. By combining all the functions of a night light, sound machine, and ok-to-wake alert into one beautiful and simple design, and better yet, making it totally controllable from a smartphone, we knew we had the product that so many parents have been asking for.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nHearing from parents who use and love our product has been, hands down, the most inspiring and exciting part of this start-up experience. We knew that we had a great product when our beta testers asked if they could keep their Rests because they had become an integral part of their child\u2019s sleep routine. It\u2019s so rewarding to be building the products that make life a little easier for parents.",
