Plus packaging is very annoying; they are all jumbled in one big bag taking up much more space than a usual pkg where they are all stacked neatly. This is a large jumbled mass and the bag, unlike usual bags of these sponges, must be cut open and doesn't reclose. Cheap, stiff, big heavy plastic jumbled bag of sponges, each with its own imperfection. Spend more for the readily available 32 pack and avoid this cheaper, deceptively described and unwieldy pkg of seconds. Yuk. I got taken.",
