      "verdict": "The Nike KD Trey 5 V is considered one of the lightest basketball shoe models by most reviewers. It is a solid performer with amazing ventilation, good traction, and is true to size. The shoe is fit for guard positions because of the Zoom technology in the forefoot.If you are a guard and you want a budget-friendly pair that can provide lightness, speed and a awesome court feel, the KD Trey 5 V is the one for you.",
      "pros": [
        "The wavy herringbone traction of the Nike KD Trey 5 V may have worked because a good number of reviewers say that the shoe has a great court grip",
        "This type of pattern has proven its grip time and time again, even on 2018 basketball models like the tenth Hyperdunk from Nike",
        "A good number of buyers say that the shoe is true to size just like the 12th KD from Nike",
        "The mesh upper of the shoe model is liked by a huge number of wearers because it is comfortable and breathable",
        "Wearers have a similar experience with the UA HOVR Havoc",
        "A lot of users appreciate the thick laces on the lateral side of the shoe because it provides more lockdown",
        "Many purchasers thank the ample amount of comfort provided by the thick padding in the collar of the shoe",
        "A huge number of users appreciate the outrigger on the midsole because it helps them prevent ankle injuries",
        "A good number of reviewers say that the internal heel counter of the shoe prevents foot slippage well",
        "According to most testers, the combination of Phylon and minimal Zoom technology in the midsole great for guard positions"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "There are a few users who mention that the shoe runs long",
        "Some purchasers comment that the shoe does not deliver impact protection because their legs have become sore after playing",
        "A couple of wearers comment that the upper of the shoe rips after just a few months of use",
        "According to a small number of buyers, the shoe takes a lot of time to break in"

      "text": "I've only played in these once, but I have to say I was really pleased with them out of the box. They're light, have great grip, a nice tight fit and solid impact cushioning. They do run a bit narrow, and I have a pretty wide foot. They aren't too narrow, fit snug. They are also maybe 1/8\" longer in the toe. They locked the heel in so well, that I didn't experience any sliding so a little extra room in the toe was actually nice, but might take a little getting used to. So far, very please with the purchase.",
