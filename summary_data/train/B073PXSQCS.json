The Granton edge was to be a welcome bonus. Long story short, I didn\u2019t expect much.....but damn. My blade had both a curve and a twist, evident by initial inspection... Even at the bottom tier of price, I still expect a straight blade.",

The knife I received is comparable to many knives I've purchased in the $70 range. If your standard is a $150-$170 knife no the finish and materials don't reach that level but then your purchasing a $25 knife so get real. HOWEVER this is an EXCELLENT knife for $25 easily comparing to many in the $65-$70 range. I would definitely recommend it and don't have any plans to replace it. If you want a nice slicing knife but don't want to spend above the $70 range then this is a win.",
