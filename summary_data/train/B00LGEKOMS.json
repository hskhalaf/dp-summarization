And I really tried to make it work. The positives are it's made of good quality filter as grounds remain in the pod and doesn't spill onto the cup. It feels durable and closes properly (though I've only used them for 2 weeks). It's easy to clean -- just dump the grounds, rinse, dry and refill again.",

These work very well - they do not drop grounds in coffee (as some reviewers have stated) if you fill them just right (to the black plastic at the top) and the coffee is strong! I use either the 8oz or bigger on my Keurig and they are both delicious cups of coffee, though each to their own. It definitely makes it stronger than k-cups! The only negative (& it's a small one) is that there is a little excess water/coffee once it's finished brewing, so a little paper towel is necessary to dab out the k-cup holder on the machine.

With regards to cleaning: let them dry for a few days, then just open them up and pour the used grounds right out. If you can't wait, open the cup and turn it upside down over your trash can, and then whack the bottom (which is now facing up) with a tablespoon. That will knock the grounds right out. Either way, then a quick rinse under the faucet and you are good to go!",

This is stupid because the k cups cost $11, and shipping the defective, un-usable cups back to the seller will waste half that money on shipping. I encourage other buyers to use caution with these, maybe consider a different brand rather than throw your money away.",
