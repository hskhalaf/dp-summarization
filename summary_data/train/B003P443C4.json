I was inside when I heard him screaming, and the screaming continued longer then usual. When I ran outside, my dog was in the garage still crying. I removed the collar quickly and that thing kept buzzing in my hand. What a horrific incident. I can't stop thinking about the pain and shock my dog felt. Now I don't even know if I can trust another product like this. We'll try to contact the company and hold them responsible for this. Don't buy this if you love your pet!!!!",

Which means you are relying on the training after that, or removing and replacing the collar every day. That's not a workable solution for us, so I just returned it and replaced it with a full time Fi Shock hot wire. From previous experience, this requires no training of your dog. They touch it once, get zapped, and never go near it again. Sometimes simpler is better.",

      "text": "I was originally really happy with this system. We had it installed and trained our dog and she responded well. Until... the bulky collar snagged on the deck and caused her to break her toe. $600 in vet bills later, we called the company hoping they would at least replace the collar and we were told since it wasn't a manufacturer's defect, it wasn't covered. I get that it was a weird accident, but still thought we would get a better response from the company or, at a minimum, a discount on another collar that caused the broken toe.",

We had to buy extra wire (fenced about 2 acres) and did not bury it yet but it seems fine laying on the ground. Our dog chewed the plastic collar when it was off but the device can be attached to a regular collar if you drill a few holes in it. Fantastic product, a total lifesaver for us.",

I'm not sure what this tool is actually called, but that is what I requested and the kid working there knew what I wanted. I've had the fence for over a year and have had no problems. I have not even had to replace the battery in the collar. Happy Black Lab and happy dad.",

We followed the instructions for training the dog and after being shocked twice, she knew where the boundaries were and absolutely would not cross them. I should say this works well for us because we have a fence around the yard and the dog cannot get a running start at the boundary. It has however worked miraculously well at keeping our dog from breaking through the fence.",
