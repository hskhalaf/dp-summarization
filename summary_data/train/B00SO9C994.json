Plenty of pockets but they should more on the inside. Otherwise plenty of room. Love the shoulder strap which has rubber to keep it from moving. Hard bottom to keep stuff from getting damaged when set on the floor. Love the brand and will continue to buy from them again.",

I honestly think it this bag could fit more than my large suitcase.",

One star taken off for the shoe pocket being tiny (I wear men's 11 and can barely cram one pair of running shoes into it, I don't even try to get my Powerlifts into it, I just put my shoes in the main pocket and put everything else on top of them) and the fact that the shoulder strap is sewn in instead of detachable. Otherwise good bag. If you really like using a shoe pocket I'd get the bigger one or a different bag unless you have small feet.",

The only complaint I have is that the joints of the shoulder strap are ridiculously squeaky. When walking while using the shoulder strap, they squeak super loudly. Also, the hand strap on one side is a bit too close to the side pocket, making me have to push it out of the way every time I want to unzip it. Overall, a great bag. Word of caution: if you get the high visibility yellow like I did, prepare to have people ask you if you work for CalTrans.",
