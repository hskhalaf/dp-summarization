      "text": "We have been using this brand of wipes since baby was born. This was the first time I bought them off Amazon and my baby got a terrible rash. After almost 3 weeks I finally decided to change wipes and it cleared up within days! I wish I could send these back but I\u2019ve already used almost all of them. The remainder will be going in the trash! I don\u2019t know if maybe the wipes were not stored correctly they did not appear to have mold on them but something was definitely up with this batch. I will not be buying wipes off amazon again and don\u2019t recommend it for others.",

Finally the stickem label covering the extraction hole is not very sticky and does not seal well to keep remaining wipes moist. I\u2019ve already added water to one pack of wipes to remoisten them.

I have tried a lot of different brands and they made my baby red but not these ones.:) Pampera please don't change these like your diapers. These wipes rock. I was nervous about order ing this 9 pack of refills because I read the reviews after I purchased them and saw about having to use scissors to rip them open but I recieved the ones that have the pull tab that can re-seal. Thank goodness:) I am set for a while on wipes now\ud83d\ude00",

Also, the packaging still shows the sticker top in the directions and is virtually indistinguishable from the old sticker too, which is confusing and misleading.",
