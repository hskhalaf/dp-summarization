That\u2019s what happened to me (didn\u2019t appear on chin until 4 months after taking 1 pill daily) I couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on. I even took antibiotics to see if my cystic acne would clear up\u2014 but that didn\u2019t work. The only thing that worked was when I stopped taking so much biotin. My advice is to you guys is to take the recommended daily dose which DEFINITELY isn\u2019t 10,000mcg\u2014 it\u2019s 2,500mcg. More is definitely NOT good in this case.",

My hairdresser suggested Biotin and dashed to the store to buy some. Being unsure of the proper dosage, I started with 1,000 mg - then, after seeing some improvement, increased it to 5,000 mg. After several more weeks of improvement, I decided 10,000 mg would work even better - IT HAS! My hair hasn't been this thick and strong in decades - I even decided to let it grow to a new hairstyle and I'm loving it!",

My hair has grown about a centimeter. That's not much compared to other women's results but that's a lot to me! I also noticed that my hair seemed thicker. The only thing I don't like about this product is that it breaks me out sooooo bad. I drink plenty of water and have also tried taking a vitamin with it but it still breaks me out. But honestly ill take a few pimples if that means longer healthier hair. lol (Real Review)",

I'm not sure if I have purchased from this particular vendor before or not .... as I can't see my past order but I love the Natrol Biotin ..1) it's one of the hightest strengths, having 10,000 mcg. whereas most that you get in the stores are between 1,000 and 5,000. It's also a tiny, tiny pill to swallow unlike some of them who look like elongated kidney beans and you have to literally choke it down to get it down. I will continue to buy these as long as Amazon carries them....",
