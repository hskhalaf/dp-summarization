The sensors do not work, the hud continues to go offline and the alarm goes off randomly scaring everyone in the house. Worst of all is the customer service. I called Samsung and they refused to let me speak to a manager and would not replace my hub/sensors that were under warranty. Do yourself a favor and don\u2019t buy this or any Samsung product.",

With just a single GE switch paired I get extreme delays in turning the switch on and off. about 1/3 of the time it's instant. The other 2/3 of the time it takes several minutes to respond. The user interface is so confusing. I'm a software developer that usually can make sense of confusing things. This one took about four hours to figure out how to install custom smart apps (scripts). As far as adding or deleting devices that's easy enough but that's not terribly useful by itself. They way they handle triggering events could be so much better.",

Those that disconnect with any regularity are all from Aeotec, so I'm feeling confident that is not the Hub's fault. Every other product I have stays connected. Otherwise, this is simple to set up and administer, and runs cool and quietly without issue.",

In terms of what is out there now, Smarrtthings is the tops and best in my opinion. None are perfect, they all still seem to be evolving. The zigbee and zwave are becoming more standardized which will help quite a bit. In my opinion, there isn't a home automation hub on the market today that is without quirks, Smartthings makes it more livable and functional though.",
