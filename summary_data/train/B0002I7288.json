I had to put a lamp timer on one to reboot it every morning because it locked up so often. Even their own QuickVPN client will not connect.

So I ended up configuring to use the second connection as a backup. Interestingly you can assign certain ports to use a single connection but we're using a wireless router behind this unit. If you have flaky internet where you live and a choice of providers, it's worth looking at using both. Cheers, Sam",

      "text": "This unit was purchased for connecting to a Sonicwall VPN system at a location where two remote users shared the same internet service. It was determined that a hardware device would be necessary as the pure internet connection would not work with two users connected simultaneously (one user at a time worked fine). The less expensive Linksys BEFVP41 did not work in that application after the Sonicwall system was installed. This Cisco unit did work when configured correctly to match the Sonicwall hardware, and permits two users to work with no dropouts. It seems to be a high quality piece of equipment and is much less expensive than the other brands considered.",
