The biggest issue is that the entire machine shuts off whenever she uses the forward/backward lever essentially making the product useless. She was able to find a workaround and manually moves the claw forward or back with her hand from the top of the machine where you load toys. But of course she should not have to do this. Additionally the toy is WAY TO LOUD and you are not able to turn the volume down or off. The ability to turn the sound off would be ideal!!",

Poof ball novelties were too squishy to pick up. Timed so you get multiple tries before your turn ends. Good for my 8 year old. Definitely not for really young kids.",
