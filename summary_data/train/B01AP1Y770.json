Assembly is easy, handle bars one nut, pedals screw right on, front wheel two nuts, adjusting the hand brake (because it's cheap) was a little time consuming, but on a kids bike I like them to use the coaster brake anyhow. Training wheels and seat then its done. Both of the girls love it and can ride it with the training wheels very easily. I just might have to buy another one.",

Cost was moderate to low end, so I wasn\u2019t expecting bells and whistles, but woulda been nice for the trainer wheels to touch the ground and placed at an appropriate angle. This bike is also considerably more difficult to pedal from a standstill...not sure if it is drag or resistance, but I reason that it builds strength for longer rides. My girl did like the decals and basket.",

The sevond ride after that was fixed, one of the bike petals kept falling off and could not be tightened. Also stripped or faulty crank and screws.

But what was I thinking? With 4 children, I've never purchased a bike with white wheels before as I just loved the look for granddaughters. DUH! What was I thinking? The cute little white wheels don't stay white after one riding.....Personally I'll now stick to those black tires...but wouldn't trade it because it is awfully cute....dirty looking but still cute!",

The fenders were not mentioned or pictured anywhere in the manual. Also, the seat arrived with a small puncture to the front part. I registered the bike this am and requested a replacement seat, so I am hopeful we can get a new one for her. If they get back to us, I will probably edit and improve the review.",

My daughter was just riding on the sidewalk when the chain suddenly went loose and was not fixable by my dad who used to work in a bike shop.

The back brakes are activated by reversing the peddles (a must for first time riders), but it also has a hand brake for the front tires which enable her to learn hand brakes. The training wheels are adjustable so you can shorten them as the child gets better at balancing on 2 wheels. Overall, great bike for the money.",
