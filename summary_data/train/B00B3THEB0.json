You will also need a well made hammer. Once the product is filled with water it becomes heavy. It requires good support. It is a beautiful picturesque fountain. It gives a very Tranquill relaxing sound. The motor has a very soft sound. The motor has a very relaxing hum that is not over powering. The motor sounds like a small fish tank filter maybe either softer. The fountain itself overall is beautiful and will add beauty to any room and can transform a room into a relaxing oasis.",

The hole in the smallest pot was not big enough and it was not draining water. I had to drill it larger. Its my fault i didnt pay more attention to the size posted. Its a pretty small fountain",

I got at a discount \"used, like new condition\" from Amazon Fulfillment Services (is that the warehouse, a return from a previous customer?). The price is too good to send back only to be told I have to pay full price to get one with a pump. I will purchase a pump and install myself. The fountain is quite attractive and will go very nicely in my garden with my other fountains. Prime customer for YEARS, first disappointment.",

We do not hang it on the wall but we have it sitting on a table in our patio and it works fine there. It also works sitting on the concrete. So glad I purchased it! Our dogs love to lay in front of it and nap.",
