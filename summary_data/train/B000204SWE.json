      "text": "Philips DVP642 DivX-Certified Progressive-Scan DVD Player - Wow, I originally purchased this over 10 years ago! Unfortunetly I don't still own it or even know what happened to it. However, I do know that I bought it because it played multiple formats I that I used it extensively for many years. I read some of the other reviews and it did bring back some memories of having to update the firmware because the zoom feature did not work correctly. Despite that fact, I suppose I stopped using this because media steaming became much more efficient that playing CD/DVDs. Anyway, if you have just purchased this item I can tell you that mine lasted for many years and never failed.",

      "text": "Great machine, plays all my dvds, mpeg4, divx... nice picture (especially with progressive scan). Excellent form factor. This is one of the best - I tried many and they all had flaws in MPEG4/Divx. This is the first one which stands up to the claim of \"dvd/mp3/mpeg4/vcd/divx\" player. Yes, I have all these formats. On the dark side - remote is cheap and badly designed. Does not have \"open\" button. On-screen menus are ugly, and obvious things (like switch between progressive scan and non-progressive scan for watching widescreen/standard frame movies) requires 4-5 clicks - instead of a button on the remote. Real bad. But I am willing to live with this, since the player itself is so good.",

When I first bought this earlier this year, I also was very pleased with it -- it can easily be programmed to play all region DVDs and played most divx discs I tried to play. BUT... 6 months after purchasing, it's dead. When plugged in, the power button flashes red. Cannot be turned on -- will have to dismantle it to remove the DVD inside it. Philips has refused any support or service on this, because it only has a 90 day warranty. This unit was not mistreated and was used very lightly in that time. I will not be buying another piece of Philips electronics.",

One must then restart the DVD and jump to just before the freeze point and then continue to play. Sometimes to the end, sometimes for ten seconds. This is a throwaway item.",

Going to the menu and turning it off and on again solved the problem but it needs to be reset every time the machine is turned back off. After quite a run around from Philips, they now say this is normal and part of the design. Right, just like a car that only starts every 3rd try. So unless you want to reset this \"feature\" every time you use it, don't bother with this player for HD TV. Sorry Philips, you can't avoid support just because you say a design flaw is \"normal\".",

The progressive scan image quality with component connections on an HDTV is quite good but not great. However, my first player lasted 5 months before it failed to read discs. After a month the second DVP642 player I purchased is now making clicking noises and takes its time recognizing commercial DVDs. Philips offers only a 90-day free exchange warranty and a 91-day to a year \"reduced cost exchange\" - this seems to indicate they expect more than a few of these units to be short-lived. At $10, an extended service plan may not be a bad idea if you buy this DVD player.",

It reads all types of media (i.e. DVD+R, DVD-R, DVD+RW, DVD-RW). I have used it with both wide-screen and normal TVs. With a three-cable RGB connection to a wide-screen TV monitor the picture quality is just perfect. The sound quality is perfect in all cases, whether I use analog or digital sound output.",

The dimensions were the immediate draw as the thin profile enabled us to place the unit right below the VCR and still have room above for the Bose wave radio on top of the VCR in the bottom section of our entertainment cabinet. The unit powers up fine and plays great. I would note that if you like to slow down the action (to study golf swings, etc.) the unit only goes down to 8x. The cheap Cyberhome went down to 32x! The only other option to run slower than 8x is to frame by frame it manually with the remote. Otherwise- good unit for the price.",

My only problem with it is that I haven't been able to get my cable TV remote to control it, but that's probably user error. The included remote works fine, it's just one more of many lying around.

I ordered this player after reading the reviews that \"it'll take anything you throw at it.\" And indeed it does. I've taken DVDs that my laptop couldn't play, popped them in here and they immediately loaded with no problems. So easy to use that this is also the model I chose when my 84 year old, non-tech-savvy Mother wanted a DVD player for Christmas.",

When burning a disc, burn it as a cd rom (iso) or a DVD rom (UDF) and it will play almost any format (Xvid, Divx, VCD, SVCD) This is a perfect player for someone that downloads (legally, of course) different formats, and does not want to convert these formats into something that will play in your DVD player. The Remote is pretty lame, but that is the only complaint. Highly recommeded. Get them while they are still available.",

It was constanty shifting between normal color tones and colors that heavily emphasized the red tones. It was no fun watching a movie. We tried the player with several TVs and several DVDs. To no avail. The DVDs played fine on my old player. I like to complement Amazon for its extended return period over the holiday season. The box was not opened until x-mas, and I would not have been able to return the player under Amazon's standard return policy. Thank you, Amazon",

While the system works as advertised with Divx files, other flaws hurt this device. There is a noticable clicking noise whenever a disc is playing. This comes from the drive tray itself, not the audio output. The remote lacks discrete on/off buttons which makes it harder to integrate into a home theatre environment. To switch from progressive mode to regular output, you have to go through a series of menus. Finally, the picture from the system is not very good, comparable to $30-40 units. In all, unless you MUST have Divx, give the Philips DVP642 a pass.",

The remote comes with batteries, but it does NOT have an eject/load disc button on the remote, and does NOT come with an s-video cable. This is perfectly resonable as a second DVD player on a secondary TV, perhaps for the bedroom or guest room.",

    "description": "Philips DVP642 DVD Player - Dreaming of a player that plays practically any disc format while enjoying flawless, true-to-life picture quality? Now you can! With Philips DVD players, indulge in great movie and music entertainment experience delivered right to your home. Smart Picture for personalized image settings Component Video Input Dolby Digital outputs.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAmazon.com Product Description Tap into multimedia fun with Philips' broad-format, high-style, and ultra-slim DVP642 DVD player. The DVP642 is not only a high-end progressive-scan DVD player equipped to offer scintillating images on high-definition and HD-ready TVs, it's a tech-savvy player that spins your MP3- and JPEG-encoded recordable CDs (as well as Kodak's and Fuji's variants of the same) and CDs loaded with MPEG-4 and DivX video (3.11, 4.x, and 5.x files), perfect for viewing Internet-sourced content in your home theater. Want more? The player also converts Region 1/All Region PAL-formatted discs (the video standard in Europe) for viewing on standard NTSC televisions (and vice-versa, if only for video CDs).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DVP642's progressive-scan functionality allows compatible TVs to display the even and odd numbered lines of an image in a single pass. This minimizes screen flicker, which is easier on your eyes.\nWhether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of \"someday,\" the DVP642 stands ready to deliver the full potential of your DVDs. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.\n\n Playback options include five-disc resume, which lets you pick up where you left off on your five most recently viewed DVDs (not applicable for MP3 or JPEG CDs), disc-lock parental controls, and picture zoom for magnification of select images.\n\n\n\nThe player will play JPEG images one by one automatically, letting you zoom in, rotate, or flip the picture vertically or horizontally. For MP3 playback, the player offers track time display, album and track selection, and repeat (disc/album/track). The DivX media format is MPEG-4 based video compression that lets you save large files like films, movie trailers, and music videos on recordable media. Philips' 4x video upsampling offers smoother images even when viewing interlaced (nonprogressive) signals through the player's component-video, S-video, or standard composite-video outputs. SmartPicture provides optimum picture settings for color, brightness, saturation, contrast, sharpness, etc., to enhance your overall viewing experience at all times. \n\nThe player will play JPEG images one by one automatically, letting you zoom in, rotate, or flip the picture vertically or horizontally. For MP3 playback, the player offers track time display, album and track selection, and repeat (disc/album/track). The DivX media format is MPEG-4 based video compression that lets you save large files like films, movie trailers, and music videos on recordable media.\n\nA set of left/right analog-audio outputs channel audio to Dolby Pro Logic receivers and stereo televisions. Dolby Digital 5.1-channel surround-sound signals can be routed through the player's digital-audio outputs (one each of RCA coaxial and Toslink optical) for direct connection to a full-featured audio/video receiver.\n\n\n\nWhat's in the Box\nDVD-Video player, remote control with batteries, a user's manual, and an analog audio/composite-video interconnect.",
