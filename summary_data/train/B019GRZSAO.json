I love it! The internet cut out still happens though much less frequently but I love the interface, control and data it provides. Awesome router if you have the $. Even moved it next to my TV (biggest user of bandwidth in the house) because it looks sleek. Had it a month now and no issues at all. Easy setup too.",
