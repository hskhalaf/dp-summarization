Although Amazon was very accommodating with a speedy refund and pickup, the price does not match the quality. Now I'm left with the mode a useless A38 mod kit. Astro makes such good quality products but with these the sound being subpar at best and the build quality as poor as can possibly be, I would recommend you bypass this headset.",

      "text": "I say \"wireless headphones\" because as soon as you enable the microphone, the sound quality goes way down. I don't mean there's some static or sounds tinny or like the other people are muffled, I mean all of the above and then some. A $10 pair of headphones has better sound quality than this when the microphone is enabled, albeit that $10 pair would be wired. The sound quality when the microphone is off, however, is amazing for a wireless headset. As a pair of headphones this would've gotten 5 stars. If you're really going to buy this headset, I suggest keeping the microphone off and using an external attachment like ModMic or a desktop microphone.",

The sound can get very high, and there is a little bit of sound leak (i.e. people can hear sound outside of headphones, very faintly) at highest volume settings. On the bumpy parts of a bus ride, you can feel them shake around a little. I had an issue using these with my MacBook pro. I experienced a lot of sound cutting in and out but someone else's review fixed that for me. The steps to fix it were 1) Turn off wifi 2) connect headset 3) turn wifi back on. I haven't had any more problems.",
