I just returned it and they sent me another of the black one and it is working GREAT! Would definitely recommend!",

It lets you take selfies like a pro and share with your circle of fans, friends or embarrassing family members. It lets you text things you may or may not later regret with the greatest of ease.

PopSockets grips are repositionable and stick to most devices and cases but may not stick to silicone or waterproof materials. The product includes a special 3M adhesive disc for attaching your grip directly to a glass-backed phone. You may also buy a separate \u201cmount\u201d to attach your phone to your dashboard, mirror, refrigerator, air conditioning vent or wherever you snack on content. Mmm\u2026content. And now, a little something for all you specification geeks: Diameter: 1.56 inches, Height: .9 inches when expanded, .25 inches when collapsed.
