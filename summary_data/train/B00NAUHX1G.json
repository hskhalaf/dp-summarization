For something to use for practicing at night, or in a setting where I cannot play through a live Amp, this really fits the bill. When run through a pair of headphones, I can get tones reminiscent of my old Fender amps with shimmering reverb. It really is VERY clean. If you are looking for overdrive or distortion, check out the other Amplugs. If you want an ultra clean tone with either reverb, delay, or chorus, this is for you.",

The effects are nice and provide different tone options. There is no hum, or any other unwanted noise. The dials are for gain, tone, and master volume. It may be asking a bit much, but I wish there was a dial for effect intensity. The reverb in particular is just too much for most playing, maybe one or two songs would sound good. I highly recommend, and I am certain I will be purchasing another one. Maybe phaser or flanger, more metal.",

You are paying top dollar for the VOX brand name and that's it. The quality of manufacture is on par with a toy out of one of those gumball machines that they have at the mall. No, I'm not exaggerating. This is hands down the most poorly constructed, cheapest plastic thing I've ever paid more than a dollar for. Luckily it sounds good, but the quality vs. price is downright insulting. - Don't sneeze near this thing or it'll probably disintegrate.",

Keep posted I hope to end this with happy news. Good News! Thanks VOX. One month beyond warranty they issued me a replacement. Most reviews are positive, so maybe I had the rare defect. I did an autopsy and discovered a broken wire inside where the 1/4\" audio plug pivots. Broken at the solder joint. So I updated my rating to 3 stars. I'm still afraid the wire in the new one will break on me. That part of the design might rate a rethink.",

Leaving in the bass, I would hit it on things and it would twist around and the cable would yank on it. Now I leave it on my desk and run a cable to it. Yes, I have wires all over the place, but its better than breaking the thing again.",

Besides that, the quality of the circuitry seems poor as there is a constant audible hiss which only attenuates setting the tone fully towards the bass end. Furthermore, the feel in the hand is kind of cheap and definitely not as what you guess from the pictures. Overall, it does what it is supposed to do, but I found it a bit pricey just for being a VOX branded product.",

      "text": "Just plugged it in to my Studio Les Paul and gave it a first go 'round the block. Found it a little glitchy just on the connection into the guitar - perhaps it MUST be rotated somewhat in order to close the circuit. I really like the effects included. The sound is good. The volume is great. Operation is pretty straightforward. I know I will get a lot of use out of this. I'd definitely buy it as a gift for anyone learning the instrument because it will not only give others peace-ishness, it will encourage a learner to play.",

      "text": "The tremolo, reverb and delay effects make this a big improvement over the first generation which I also loved. This is a very handy and practical practice tool. With the auxiliary input you can jam right along with the song you are learning, and sound right in the mix, very useful. It also surprisingly fun to be cord-free, walking around outside or wherever strikes your fancy. Run the headphone out to an MP3 boombox or stereo input and you have an amp. Run it into a recording device and you are instantly recording without a mic and room dynamics. This is lots of fun, a great value given how much I use it.",

I don't usually have to wear my reading glasses when I play my guitar, but had to when using the Clean to see its tiny markings on the Gain, Tone,and Volume controls. My Clean also freely spins around on its guitar phone jack making seeing and adjusting its controls sometimes awkward. I personally found it kind of a hassle to use and for that reason gave it 3 stars.",
