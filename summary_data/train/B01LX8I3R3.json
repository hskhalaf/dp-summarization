Today, after putting the top on and taking the top off and putting the top on over and over again, I took it and threw it in the garbage. There are other brands that are much easier to work with (that I\u2019ve owned before. Sorry but I\u2019m not gonna be buying any more KitchenAid products .",

My family loves how it chops and blends without getting out out the large food processor. I also use it to make butter. Just fill it half way with heavy cream and blend continuously for 4-5 minutes. At end drain the buttermilk off, wash the butter with water and drain. Add salt and blend. If you want to make honey butter just add some honey and blend. It may reduce the lifetime of the chopper, but the butter is great.",

I was constantly scraping down the sides (I mean with every.single.spin.) with a spatula in what little space I had to keep the blades from damaging it to keep the food from sticking to the sides. Given how loud the machine is, I expected it to have more power. Save your money and time and keep looking. I sure wish I would have done more research before my purchase.",

The BEST part is the cord wraps up under the bottom of the unit. I wish my larger KitchenAid processor did the same thing.",

I use this machine much more day to day than I ever used my regular size machine, since it's perfect for chopping small quantities of onions, carrots, etc. for use in soups, salads or braised main dishes.
