I have definitely put it through it\u2019s paces and it still works as well as the day I bought it. If it breaks, however, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy another.",

Expensive with the charger/batteries. Now that I see how great it is... I'd probably pay double if I had to. It's well worth the $.",

Amazon is sending a replacement and I hope to be able to report back that this was just a defective item because I've never had an issue with my many other Makita tools. Amazon quickly sent a replacement and I'm happy to say, the drill appears to work fine after drilling some substantial holes in granite boulders. Changed by review from 1 to four stars after replacement.",
