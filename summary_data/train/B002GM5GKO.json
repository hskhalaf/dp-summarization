      "text": "I have bought 3 of theses systems since late 2015. Every one has had the monitor fail a few months after the warranty expires. I have just ordered another monitor from another brand I hope will be more reliable- because my system is installed in a passenger van with a headiner replacing it all and going completely to a different brand system is a huge labor intensive operation. I've also had 1 of the cameras become fogged- this required me disassembling the camera (out of warranty) drying it out and resealing it myself. While this system has worked great when it works it is just not reliable. I do not recommend buying any of this company's products.",

I mounted the screen just above the rear view mirror in my class C and it is very effective at seeing what is right behind me as well as the hitch area. Works good at night and the wired solution means no noise or wavy lines. Only issue would be that when you turn up the volume loud enough to hear someone guiding you backwards... You have to remember to turn it back down or you hear road noise when you're driving. I haven't added another camera yet, but hope to some day. A great unit for the price point!!!",

Owning an RV that didn't come with a backup camera, this was a necessary upgrade. I also use it as a full-time rear-view camera and it works marvelously! The picture is excellent, and I really appreciate the mic/speaker feature when backing into tight spots. The installation was easy and relatively quick, and the quality-to-price factor was fantastic!

I researched backup cameras and settled on this new camera with color LCD display. The installation instructions were poor, but I figured it out with the help of a couple of neighbors. The display is far superior to the original equipment (very heavy) black and white display. Overall, we are quite happy with it.",

      "text": "Excellent rear view video camera installed at the rear on my motorhome. This rear view camera is so valuable as far as safety while backing up a large motorhome. I can see if anything is at my rear. The distance grid lines on the monitor really helps how far the rear is to the wall. The grid line also helps me determine if I'm perfectly in the middle of the road between the road yellow line markers and the sides of the road. The infra-red is great in total darkness, you can see everything as if there are lights shining at the rear. The monitor is perfect size and very clear. This is a excellent buy, I highly recommend it.",
