      "text": "I have been wearing New Balance for 15 years, over 40 pairs, 3 recent purchases in the last month, and this is my first BAD review. I have been hiking mountain trails and walking trails for decades. This shoe should never be on on trail, maybe in a Tiki bar with tropical shirt, as the shoe is fashionable. I just took a 2 mile flat terrain walk, shoes lack support, cushioning, rub against the ankles and hurt the top of one foot. I got this at a steep discount so I will hold onto them for the summer Tiki bar crowd, but NO ONE should purchase these as trail or running shoes.",

One, just one, of the heels isn't quite as padded as the other, so I have one heel that is rubbed raw while the other is fine. I cannot return because after my first walk with these shoes I accumulated quite a bit of blood on the left heel. You can look at my past reviews; I don't write bad reviews. However, I feel everyone should be aware who is considering buying these shoes. I've had new balance in the past that worked just fine, so this one pair may have been a lemon.",

I was a bit disappointed in the amount of cushioning, but I suppose it\u2019s to be expected with a trail shoe. I\u2019m not going to be using them for any road runs, and may have issues with just running the mile on roads to get to the trails.

Toe protect works well as I stubbed my toe on a rock that would have been painful in my street running shoes. Nice for walks but was encouraged by the light weight and traction of the shoes to incorporate sprints on the trail. A solid buy if you can find it on sale for a little over $40. Others compliment the shoes ability to cater to a wide foot - but the regular size 10 fit like a regular size 10 - not too wide and I have a LV foot. Enjoy",

I noticed that these were a little tight width wise when I first put them on; taking the strings out and re-stringing them helped greatly. The shoes are very comfortable and feel durable enough for me to start walking and working out in. I highly recommend them and think that I may get another pair in a different color and with a wide width.",
