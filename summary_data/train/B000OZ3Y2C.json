It doesn't have the stability of a real ladder, and does twist and move as you climb, however, this is to be expected. This is yet another reason why we practice fire safety so we can be aware of these things, and not panic should the time come to use it. I'm 180# and I felt safe and secure using it. I actually climbed all the way up to my window, and besides being a bit scared of the height, I didn't feel unsafe. Highly recommended for piece of mind and safety!",

      "text": "We tried this ladder several times today as we practiced 2nd story fire safety escape with my 8 year old. He would attach it just fine, throw it out window just fine and unlatch it just fine but it would tangle every time after he unlatched it. No one has time to untangle the ladder in an emergency! What's worse is that after you unlatch it the first time to practice it is a nightmare trying to untangle it to put it all back together to reattach. I never could reattach it as well as it was originally assembled. Not only would I not recommend this, I have already ordered something else to replace it.",

Practice will be critical for them to make it. All and all much greater peace of mind having them in the two bedrooms upstairs.
