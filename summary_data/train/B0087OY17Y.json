Character designs are not at the level I like, after playing a lot of NIS games (Disgaea, Makai Kingdom, Phantom Brave). Despite the \"3D\" graphics, the characters lack a certain \"Pop-Out\" quality that the sprites of other NIS titles have. The central character being a combination of personality disorders that have an over-arching memory feels like a cheap way of introducing archetypes without adding more characters. I got into the game for all of five days before calling it quits...",

If you love extreme character customization, infinite dungeons, crazy characters/stories, and an in-depth battle system (so much more than the standard attack/block/heal crap that is found in most modern RPG's), then purchase this game. It has provided over a hundred hours of entertainment for me and counting.",

Once it finishes loading the response time in the game can be measured in seconds. It's slow, sluggish, unresponsive enough that it's impossible to play. Even people who like the game can't recommend it, just avoid this, watch Let's Play videos for the story if you must,",

I don't know why professional reviewers hated it so much. I found it to have some very funny writing.",

The gameplay is a variation of Hyperdimension Neptunia's with a twist (go around an area, encounter monsters you see along the way, turn based fights-but you can move around in the fight). Usual NIS America comedy and twists are frequent. So if you're a NIS fan or anime/rpg fan, you might enjoy this game. The only downside I see is the grinding method. Feels like a chore.",

I'm guessing 19 years old, you're going to feel like a bit of a creep playing it. I'm not sure if the age of the girls you're playing as in the game is defined, but they look pretty young to be so sexualized. Other than that, I've not had any issue. The dialog is full of innuendo and humor, the art is very nice, I even enjoy the music. Mugen Souls is fun to play, if a bit complicated.",
