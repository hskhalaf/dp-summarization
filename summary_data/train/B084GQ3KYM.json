Fingerprint is the same one used in s10 and is very slow and placed in a awkward situation. at this point I think any flagship phones from the last two years (can be sourced now for less than \u00a3300) will do as good a job as any of these new overpriced junks.",

Whether I use bluetooth, USB connection or just straight out it's own speakers it routinely glitches repeatedly throughout the playing music. I suspect this is due to Samsung ripping off the European market by giving the S20 a blatantly inferior CPU, which is known to cause the accelerated battery depletion and I suspect the sound issues too. **DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT**",

The smart switch made it very easy to copy over all apps, photos, music etc from old S8. Cons: . Getting big now. I'll have to get used to this but it feels slightly uncomfortable at this size. .
