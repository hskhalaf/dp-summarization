They only deliver whatever notifications you have, it doesn't matter if it's an ambient notification, like an alarm or timer, or if it's an active text message. It treats all of them the exact same.

Provides heart rate, resting heart rate & it keeps track of Calories expended so you can keep track of your food intake.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that accurate but since I went from no info to all the info, it feels impressive. Battery life is not as good as the Spark 3 but since there are so many more features, it\u2019s not a surprise. I often accidentally \u201cstart\u201d exercise because of where the buttons are but hopefully I will get used to it.",

Came across this watch as my friend was using it. Got sold on its sleek design as well as its use. Even though I am wearing a watch after this long, the watch has been very comfortable, even while working out! There are obviously a lot more apps that I believe Garmin can add but I am still maintaining a 5 star rating as of now since it serves my purpose of tracking activities. DO NOT purchase this if you want it to be like an all functional smart watch.",

Also, regardless of for how many seconds I set the \u201ctimeout \u201c, the backlight turns off after about seven seconds.
