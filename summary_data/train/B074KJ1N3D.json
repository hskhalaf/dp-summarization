It actually gives you more bass too with the foam wind thingamajig. In the video I placed the lavalier on my shirt between my mouth and guitar. I could have moved it closer to my mouth to make the make vocals louder but my voice aint that great. :)",

Not the best noise cancellation, but it'll probably achieve the (presumably minor) things you need granted you know how to use it. The wire itself is terribly sensitive, and causes a lot of unwanted feedback. If you tape it to your chest and pray that the wire doesn't create annoying feedback, the quality is great for capturing your voice. Otherwise, buy a shotgun microphone, or boom mic. If you're recording something and need the microphone on your body, just beware of the wire movement.",

I bet I could get an extension if I needed longer. And it comes with a little pouch which is convenient. I tested it with a friend and their remark was that it sounded like I was \"RIGHT there\". Good clarity and doesn't pick up very much background noise. Overall great for the price and makes a very noticable difference in the audio quality.",

The only thing I would say is I wish it came with an adaptor to plug into my computer so my voice would come across as clear as it does on my phone videos, but I will just have to find an adaptor for that. Connecting it to my phone is perfect, it is not a loose fit and stays plugged in and I would recommend the Ultimate Lavalier Microphone for an android phone because it works great for me.",
