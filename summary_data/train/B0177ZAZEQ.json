It's also very easy to use and has multiple settings to fit your winding preference. Unfortunately the unit developed a small issue with it's function. JQueen was extremely helpful in resolving my issue. Their customer service is responsive, prompt, and highly professional. It was quite clear they wanted to make sure I was pleased with my purchase. I can say with assurance that JQueen stands behind their products. And I would not hesitate to purchase my next watch winder from them. 5 star service all around.",

As others have noted though, a very important caution: by their own notes in the package, these wind about 2500-3000 TPD (turns per day) which is 3-4x more than needed for most brands (650-1000) like Rolex or Breitling. By my own test, the motors are initially spinning about 20% faster than that (~10 tps vs the 6-8tps specified in the packaging sheet). Just put this on an external timer for only 6-10 hours.",
