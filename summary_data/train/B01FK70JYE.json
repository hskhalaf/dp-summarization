Our dishwasher left detergent residue and never drained properly, this one is performing perfectly. No more second guessing!! We also wanted to support Danby because of the charitable nature of the CEO. He does in extremely good deeds like helping refugees find work at his wharehouse and provides for them in Their greatest time of need. 5 stars for a great product, and feels good Everytime I run a load, I think of all the good Danby does!!! :) :) :) :)",

It's not whisper quiet, but certainly not objectionable. Oh almost forgot. The dishes come out clean and dry! If a portable dryer fits your needs, this one is hard to beat.",
