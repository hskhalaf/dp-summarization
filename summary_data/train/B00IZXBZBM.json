Not an issue now, but this was a great learning tool. The wheels are the best part, cause they never need to be inflated. They are hard and durable polymer/rubber combo. This bike is best used on FLAT concrete or asphalt. There are NO BREAKS, so be careful on hills. I take my son to a small local skate park with plenty of flat land for him to ride on and it's very smooth.",
