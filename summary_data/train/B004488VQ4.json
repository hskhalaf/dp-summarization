This product worked wonderful and I loved it but after about a year and half it stopped working consistently and would only work about 10 feet away. It needs to be charged constantly and when you can\u2019t count on the collar to work it\u2019s useless. I thought after spending $140 for the product it should have worked longer. Don\u2019t recommend unless your willing to purchase a new every year or so.",

The replacement is bumming out after a few days. Unacceptable. Much too expensive for continuing issues. Works sometimes. The buttons don't match the actions.... The beep button will shock and the shock button beeps.... when it works. I'll keep returning until I get a unit that actually works like it's supposed to!",

We tried it yesterday at the park and it worked great. I can just follow behind him and correct him as soon as I see him attempting to do a bad habit.

We use the \"beep\" feature to call the dog when she's outside and we don't know where. Make sure the contacts are screwed on tight. We lost one and had to order a replacement.",

The reason for replacing it is that the rechargeable battery stopped working after 6 months. Emails to PetSafe customer service went unanswered. I am giving this four stars for its performance before battery issues, and the reliability of other PetSafe products I continue to use.",
