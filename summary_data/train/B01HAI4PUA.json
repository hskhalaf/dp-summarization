      "text": "This is my first powerwasher hose for my new (used) high-pressure power washer. The unit I bought did not come with one, so after some quick research I decided on this one. Here's a couple of things that surprised me: 1) the hose material is flat/matte material, not glossy. This doesn't matter, but it just seemed unique/unexpected 2) the hose is super light weight. I mean that in a good way as having do drag/roll a heavy hose would be awful 3) the hose is easy to handle/wind/wrap. I'm a bit of a freak, and I like to \"over/under\" wrap things...works great All in all, amazon reviews didn't steer me wrong!",

      "text": "I didn't actually need a hose, but my old black one left so many black scuffs on my boat I had to do something. This one fit my application perfectly and appears very durable, and it doesn't leave scuff marks. It's heavy and like any hose stiffens when charged, but flexibility always involves a trade-off with reliability. Do you want a light pliable hose that may not last or heavier hose that has a long service life? At these prices, I want one to last. I awarded 5 stars on durability from the look, feel, and quality of construction, but the only real test is \"will it last\"? If it doesn't, I will update my rating",
