The toe is a bit roomier than he would like, but it does not impede their use. They are lightweight for work boots, so if you want super heavy ones, these are not for you. Despite being lighter than his last pair, the soles have a huge amount of traction and there is great arch support. It's really important for him to replace his boots in a timely manner since he is on his feet for 10-12 hours shifts, so we will see how these hold up",

The sad part is my current work site is easier than any prior, meaning less wear & tear. I either got lucky with the first pair or extremely unlucky with my second.

Also, from past experience, metal toed boots tend to be very cold when working outside in the winter.

They were fairly comfy from the start and even after driving for 12+ hours they are still ok, breaking them in has not been as bad as I would have expected, my wolverine boots were horrid for a good 2 weeks, these have been good from day 1. I have no problem at all wearing them and I hope they last for awhile. Happy with the purchase so far.",

Within 2 days my heels stopped aching, Don't buy these unless you plan on buying arch supports to go in them, its not worth the pain.",
