It was still sticking out 2-3\" and couldn't move it anymore by hand. Ended up getting a pole to insert in the top to get additional leverage, and finally sunk it fully into the ground. Seems great once you get it installed.",

It\u2019s also rather large where you put the clip so a regular size dog leash doesn\u2019t just hook on, I have to run the clip through the guide and clip it back to the metal leash.
