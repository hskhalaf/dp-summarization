I always buy the same style. So if you like to play games like Dungeons and Dragons online, or any other mmo rpg, for hours on end like I do, This headset is for you. This headset will keep your ears from hurting like crazy from being smashed against the sides of your head like other styles of headsets do. I like the sound quality too and the inline volume control as well. Great product.",

The sound was passable, but nothing near what I expected with the \"Gaming Headset\" moniker attached liberally to the packaging. Sadly, the only decent thing about it was how easy the return process was. Avoid at all costs if you wear glasses, and try to stay away even if you don't. Your ears will thank you.",

Well, as of today, the second set is going out in the very same way. The left ear doesn't wok unless you apply pressure to the wire. I will never buy another set of Logitech headphones. Both lasted approximately 6 months. Now I am in search of a good set of gaming phones.",

Talking through it is crystal from what people tell me. But listening through it blows by far. 1 the headset is one size. With it being 1 size its shaped horribly. Pretty much. If you need a headset buy it... but if you don't need it right now I would suggest spending an extra 10 bucks for a better one.",

After 5 hours of straight game play my ears were a little sore but I didn't see this as a big problem.",
