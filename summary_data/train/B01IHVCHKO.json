The bowls are NOT chip resistant and I have three teens who often do dishes and stack them and twice now they have chipped one of my Mason Cash bowls. I plan on taking care of this one myself, because I want to keep it around for a long time!",

I see these are now made in Portugal instead of England, but there seems to be no difference in quality.",

Lighter weight than I was expecting so maybe a little fragile but my wife especially likes lighter weight for ease in handling, washing, etc. outstanding quality overall and great price - I had been looking for a large mixing bowl for a couple years now but resisted due to higher price of other brands/deals and as it was for our lake cabin. I would definitely recommend this bowl. Just love it and hope to pass on to my kids (who also make bread) as it is heirloom worthy.",
