Unfortunately, he only had the item a few months and it broke. However, in all fairness, my son is hard on gadgets. He tends to ride his bike with headphones on, or while talking on his cell phone and the items end up getting damaged. So if you treat this Headband with care and respect, it will probably last a lot longer. Meanwhile, enjoy your tunes!",

But not as bad as the mids on the Monoprice DJ Headphone. I'll take the JVC anytime over the Monoprice. But I still prefer the Koss SportaPro in the under $30 category. By the way, the JVC has a built-in microphone so you can use it on your smart phone. Big results for little money. Not bad!",

I can't wear these headphone longer than 45 to 60 minutes long because they hurt my ears for some reason. I'm not sure why. When my ears hurt I have to remove these headphones and put in earbuds. Rubbing my ears helps alleviate the pain. I'd rate comfort 2/5 but everything else is a perfect 5/5. Overall: 3/5",

Let them play 6+ hours , at a reasonably loud level, and they'll compete well against much more expensive headphones.
