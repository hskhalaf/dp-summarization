Food overcooks along the heating element, and is undercooked everywhere else. Even bacon doesn\u2019t cook evenly. I had a broil king previously and it was far superior and worth the cost.

I've taken to propping up the back end just a bit to give gravity a hand and allow the grease to flow in to the catcher. An extra step I didn't have to take with my previous griddle.",
