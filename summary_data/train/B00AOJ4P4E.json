      "text": "Superior turn radius. Easy hitch placement. Easy to attach/detach Travoy trailer without sacrificing security. The docking arm on the trailer which attaches to hitch bolt is made of very sturdy rubber which allows unexpected twists resulting from falls or turnovers but also gives flexibility when getting over bumps and uneven terrain. Can be used as a handcart (e.g. at airports when tranporting your deconstructed bikes) can collaspe to a size that fits most standard airline overhead bins without removing wheels. Only downside found thus far is the very handy standing position peg leg is difficult to move from standing to folded position. I would highly recommenf this item for short and long commutes.",

This trolley is the perfect size and light enough for him to safely pull behind his bike. I was concerned it might not work with a 24\" kids bike, but it works just fine. I also ordered the rain fly, and my son had no problems using it the last time it rained.",

It has an added bonus of also serving as a hand truck, for those situations where I have to park at a distance from put in/take-out. It folds nicely. The only negligible negative is that one has to be careful when loading to make sure the cargo does not rub against the wheels.",

I was looking for something a little more modern then a pull-behind trailer(which stick so far out) yet a folding design that I could pack away into a small space when not in use. The upright characteristics of this unit give it potentials that I need for my utilization purposes. I went with the yellow design because it gives a more sporting look then the black \"cargo\" color and is more noticeable when on the road. There's a few reviews on Youtube that helped me make my final decision on the purchase.",
