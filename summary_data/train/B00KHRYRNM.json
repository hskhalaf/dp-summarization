Once the data was transferred I was able to install the drive and it booted right up. Performance for my laptop has improved dramatically. After running benchmark tests between the HDD and SSD, the SSD read and write speeds are over 6 times faster than the HDD.

When I tried to set up ready-boost with a USB 3.0 thumb drive on Windows 7 Ultimate, I received a message stating that this hard drive is so fast, ready boost would actually slow the system down. No noise, no moving parts. Great buy!",
