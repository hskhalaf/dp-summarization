I have 2 of these and I use them together for a great stereo experience. I use Spotify and my own music collection. Great deal and great music quality",

That means no cords and outlet required, so it's wonderful to keep on the outdoor patio table.

Contacted their support site and received responses quickly and when they could not resolve it they replaced it promptly it no question. This item was almost 2 years old. The new one works and sounds amazing for its size. Defiantly buy from this company again",

Just install the apps from app store, pair your speaker to your network and you are good to go. You could control it through Alexa or you could simply control it using the apps directly. You could press the button and talk to it for instruction. You could also just pair it through bluetooth to use it as a bluetooth speaker. However you want to use it, it's capable.",

Just wish they had Google music and Pandora half a star reduction for somewhat limited choices. Use a 1amp 5v USB for wall plug (doesn't come with). I bought 6 so far for around the house sound.",
