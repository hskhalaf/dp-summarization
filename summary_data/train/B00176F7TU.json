      "text": "Yesterday I bought this dog house for my 16 year old cat (she only weighs about 8 Ibs), and she absolutely loves it! I put it in my garage to provide her extra warmth whenever she wants to go outside during the cold winter months (we live in Georgia). This little dog house is very durable, well insulated, easy to put together, and super easy to clean. Best of all, it is the perfect size for my cat! She immediately went right in the second I put it in my garage, and she hasn\u2019t left it ever since! She even prefers sleeping in her new dog house over sleeping indoors with us. WOW! A++++",

To remedy that, I inserted the entire house into a 30-gallon trash bag and cinched the handle-tie so the opening was the same size as the door opening. To keep rain out of the door, I set the house under the eaves of our house and angle it toward the house. PS. I found a swinging door at our local pet store, that fits this house exactly--and is VERY easily inserted into the opening--but the cat didn't care for it and would no longer enter! (Oh, well.)",

So, this is highly durable for outdoor kitties, including strays. I like that they can sit upright inside it, and that it fits multiple cats for sleeping as well. I face the opening towards a wall, with enough room for them to comfortably go in and out. Worth the cost.",

After opening the shipping box and pulling the parts out, I was worried when I did not see any fasteners or instructions. Looking for a place to set the top half of the doghouse down, I put it on the bottom half of the doghouse. Hearing a \"click\", I realized the top and bottom simply snap together. These connections seem very secure. Easy assembly.",

I haven't actually snapped it together yet because we're using it to cover an outdoor generator for protection when it rains and will probably just keep the sections separate for ease in moving. It has vents out the back and I especially like the little roof type affect in the front to prevent light rain from entering the box.",

The pom will hide in it occasionally but that's about it. It is very nice though. It is just also very dark and I don't think they like that. It would be great outside but we don't leave our dogs outside.",

It is a bit thicker than a kitty litter box, but in really cold climate you might want to put a tarp over it for added protection.",

I will get it set up with his smells for him to feel comfortable. I will have to drill 2 holes to secure the top to the base. Doesnt snap together as I would hope, but 2 bolts and lock nuts and washers should do the trick. Seems nicely built.",

Cons: - The bottom of the entrance is a bit low so rain was able to splash up into the house. We've only had this outside for a few weeks and it' been pretty warm.
