It is better than using nothing meaning that the butter will not get cold as fast but its not enough heat or the heat/flame is too far from the bottom of the dish to keep butter warm. Wanted to love this product but it didn't get the job done.",

At first glance, I thought the ramekin wasn't going to hold enough butter, but it holds plenty enough for two people to share one dish. The tea-light candles were just enough to keep butter warm, and did not leave any black soot marks on the cups. For an outdoor event, I take a little tin foil and wrap it around the base to keep the wind from blowing the candle out. These are great!",

So now we know they work we have to get enough for the dinner set. I hope you and your family will enjoy these as much as we have.",

The ramekins are small, hold very little butter, and do not fit in the stands properly. Terrible purchase! DO NOT BUY!",
