She reports that everything went well with the delivery and un-packing - no issues whatsoever (no reports of fumes or being misshapened). She has had this for two months so far. Will try to check back after a longer time to report how it is working out long-term, and may adjust \"stars\" accordingly - since I think it is still too early to tell, I am reluctant to give it five stars.",
