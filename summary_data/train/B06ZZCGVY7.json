To fix this: - system preferences > keyboard > shortcuts > display - click the f14 key assigned to decrease brightness, i set my new one to f9 - click the f15 key assigned to increase brightness, set it to f10 - now you can control brightness with f9 and f10 The keyboard shipped quickly and came with a brush and a tool to remove the keys. It can flash RGB in and out or stay solid. The brightness of the backlight can also be adjusted. The LEDs are stationary as displayed in the picture. It seems to be responsive.",

After using it for a few days now I can say that I like it. The keyboard is fairly heavy so it doesn't move around much and seems solid. Thankfully I haven't had to test out the waterproof feature. Overall it's a good solid keyboard and unbeatable at the price point.",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is sometimes if you don't push the spacebar hard enough it puts 2 spaces in instead of just 1, which doesn't really make sense to me. It was easy for me to adjust how hard I push the spacebar though so that it only puts 1 space in so it's not really a big deal. You have to have the rainbow lights on in order to see the keys though so if you don't like static rainbow lights then get something else, but if you don't mind then this works just fine.",
