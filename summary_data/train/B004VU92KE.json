Just pushing the brush gives it strong pressure to scrub the walls. pulling it back, the fin flips back and makes the brush return to you. The amount of pressure can be adjusted by moving the adjuster. I have mine on strongest, and it is great. The brush is good too. I was worried that it would be a junk brush, but it is actually a nice metal body brush with the whale fin bolted to it. Seems to be very high quality. It frees up my other hand for a refreshing beverage.",

It's much better at cleaning than my old brush because of the downward force that's applied. You can even adjust how much you want. I highly recommend this brush. After using this brush I have found one caveat. After a few months the metal portion of the brush started to corrode badly. It looks like some kind of pot metal and should have been made in plastic. Even when I clean the corrosion off it quickly gets covered in crystals again. Otherwise, it's an excellent brush and still going strong after a year.",

The angle of the fin is determined by a plastic spacer attached to the fin in one of 5 or 6 positions; at the angle I tried (somewhere in the middle) it created an incredible force towards the wall, letting me concentrate just on the up/down motion. Pushing down is obviously made quite a bit harder than without the fin, but the simple fact that no extra effort is now required to push against the wall with awkward angling & pulling makes this very efficient.",

But I give 2 stars for the bristles, they are very soft so only remove very new mold or mild debris on pool wall. If it is a more rooted problem the soft bristles do not help to lift the mold or debris. So considering these two factors my overall review is a 3 star.",
