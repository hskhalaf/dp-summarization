Battery life was okay - but who wants to shift through ads all day - not me. So I read about the Surface Pro 6 - my son-in-law has a Pro 4 I think and he loved his so I decided - why not. I ordered it and have totally been satisfied with every aspect of the machine.",

I know that it seems like a lot of money for a product you can only hope will be everything you need, but its worth it! I am a medical student and spend nearly 10 hours a day using a computer for classes/homework and this computer has held its battery life and not had any glitches/malfunctions for the 2.5 months that I have had it! I recommend this product!",

The Surface Pro 6 fit the criterion of price and operating systems (and hence support for my usual programs), but would it meet my work needs? Actually, it has exceeded needs and expectations - everything loaded easily, synced across platforms. has a wonderful detachable keyboard, and compared to my other laptop it has amazing (!) battery life. Screen image is vivid and clear - touchscreen responsive - unit feels solid but not overly big. Couldn't be happier.",

Cons: The screen is a little smaller then what I\u2019m used to and there isn\u2019t a 10 key. One USB port, no HDMI port",
