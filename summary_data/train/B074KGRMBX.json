If you need the fancy add ons like vibration... consider buying a separate vibrator off amazon that is $15 (which is what I did) but then never used it. The see-through hole is nice too because the child can see you through it. Perfect item for the nursery!",

The material looks plush and nice, not as modern as Venice baby but in terms of solidity - not bad. Aluminum legs on top of wood rocker base legs. BUT when you go to rock it\u2019s a traditional, soft, real rocking movement. I know it\u2019ll come in handy when baby is awoken post feeding and diaper changes to rock him gently back to sleep",

This is my second baby, and neither one of them have liked being completely flat for sleeping. Sadly, as of right now (baby is five weeks) this is a waste of money and just sitting in the corner of the nursery unused. I wish I could return, but I bought a month prior to baby\u2019s arrival.",

Trying to find mattress covers/waterproof mattress covers has been fruitless and a complete waste of money. The fitted covers either make the mattress buckle so gaps are left between the crib and the mattress or flat covers can't properly be wrapped to prevent the sheet from bunching up and being (again) a safety hazard. Today we are going out and buying a new bassinet. To date I've wasted approximately $130 on this bassinet when I thought it was a great deal on sale at $89. Lesson here?
