I've had it for around 2 years now and still haven't had to change the toner cartridge. It does a great job with letters, papers, and graphics. It warms up fast and prints quickly. Advanced power options save electricity and it has an easy to follow LCD menu screen. I have no complaints with the machine. I did have a bit of confusion downloading the latest driver for it from OKI's website. Once I was sure it was the right one the printer is pretty much flawless. Great basic laser printer.",

We found the oki B 431ND.. This is great printer. It is very fast, responsive , and clean. I couldn't ask for more. Maybe, I could ask for a wifi connection. That would make things much easier than using your USB connection. I love the double side print, it makes me save even more. Well I hope this helps for the next buyer. Thanks",
