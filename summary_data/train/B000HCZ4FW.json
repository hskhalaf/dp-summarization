The key to getting a great cut is matching the drill rpm with the size hole that you are drilling. I've always been a fan of dewalt and these live up to the reputation. When I purchase off amazon, I do a fair amount of research to make sure I'm buying the best product at the best price. This product met those requirements. Would definitely purchase again!",

I generally drill 3/4s of the way through the wood, flip the piece over and finish the hole from the opposite side to prevent tear out and to prevent the loose piece from jamming inside the hole saw. But even when the loose piece jammed, it was easy to remove. Seem sharp, stayed sharp, perfectly happy with the set.",

Lastly, the no-tool bit removal tool makes changing bits fast and easy, adding connivence to the projects on your to-do list. Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend this to any friend with around the house projects.",

I expected, at least, a response of \"return it to Amazon and have them replace it\" which would cost me more in shipping then to just buy a saw blade that size. I mainly resent not getting even a response from DeWalt. That is not customer service and with no customer service, I won't deal with their products anymore.",
