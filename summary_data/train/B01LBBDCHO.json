I had hoped to find the same darts that came with board but couldn't find them.i got a few different sets and the MAXMAU 18 pcs soft tip darts 10g slim for electronic dart boards worked best for us...it was well worth the money for this dart board.",

The sound is so low you need a hearing aid to hear it. The darts don't stick. The plastic is very flimsy. Not to mention, the scoring is off. All in all, this is a very bad investment. I will be returning this a.s.a.p.!",
