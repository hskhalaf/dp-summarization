No hiking or camping.....just sitting on our porch. At this price point I did not expect $300 optics. In fact, the optics were pretty good. Then one day it became hard to focus and within a week I couldn't see anything through it. I could here something rattling around when I handled it. The optic prism had come loose. I can't recommend this spotting scope. seems cheaply made, to me.",

Scope feels rugged and if dropped I\u2019m not worried about it being easily broken due to the rubber armor coating. Comes with an all metal tripod and metal screw. Not a plastic rig which is a plus. Very light weight and goes easily in my range bag. Thus far very pleased with the Blackbird and it didn\u2019t break the bank.",

As participants in a study of the American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) in our area, we needed a small, highly portable spotting scope. The Roxant Blackbird is perfect for the job. The Blackbird is lightweight, easy to use, and reasonably priced. Magnification, focus and zoom are very good for a scope of this size. The attached lens caps are a great touch and are extremely convenient. The included tabletop tripod is a nice addition and would be useful when shooting from a bench at the rifle range but we prefer using a full-sized tripod in the field.",

I can't use this for objects past 50 yards because of this. I already have a hand-held monocular that can acquire the target real quick at 50 yards and see the bullet holes as well.

Lightweight and portable for use at home or outdoors. 3. Price. The price is extraordinary for the value. 4. Ease of use.

At 50m, the Roxant just isn't strong enough (36x vs 45x) to resolve the target. In addition, the lens is significantly smaller in diameter (50mm vs 60mm, so lets in less light, so it is darker. On the positive side, it is VERY light and compact and seems to be rugged.",

The casing provides a protective feel to the scope, and the focus ring is quite smooth. The tripod is incredibly sturdy and I sincerely appreciate that it is metal.

I have already used it for birding in my backyard and it\u2019s so light and compact and easy to grip with the rubber coating.

I like the size and weight of the unit it fits in my range bag nice and neat and it comes with its on stand. I just wish the stand was a little adjustable in height but for the cost you really can't beat this spotting scope. Thanks Scott",

The size of this scope is compact and easy to carry around with you for your adventures. As an added bonus this scope is made by a company in the U.S.A. that obviously values its customers.

    "description": "UNDERSTANDING OPTICS 101: Most newbies figure more powerful is better. When it comes to spotting scopes, more power is not necessarily better. Why? The larger the magnification, the more jitter, color distortion and loss of definition you will have. Better optics are the key. FACT: Although you may find similar scopes that advertise much higher magnifications, many of these claims are pointless. Magnification without definition is useless. Look for the best quality prisms and fully multi-coated lenses. Look for: retractable eyepiece (not fold down): for use with and without glasses, expandable sunshade for reducing sun glare, it\u2019s not a common feature, but something you\u2019ll wish you had. Some brands may LOOK similar, (you\u2019ll find several copies online) but you\u2019ll also find that these less expensive scopes use plastic connectors instead of metal. This becomes important when attaching your scope to a tripod. Plastic becomes stripped over time. Metal will last.The Blackbird features precision, premium military grade optics in a compact, very usable weatherproof scope.
