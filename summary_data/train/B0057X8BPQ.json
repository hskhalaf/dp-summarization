      "text": "Iam a big guy 300+ lbs, My only prob is like in another review the safety reflective sown in tape does not flex, which in turn holds tight to my gut. Sure I already know what you thinking (lose weight you fat bastard). LOL Other than that, the shirts I bought 4x are very long ++, and are very breathable (air flows through them very well). My company likes them and wants to buy more for our employees. The only reason for the 4 stars is the reflective tape does not stretch. Price point is spot on, even with my delema I would buy these again.",

I decided to order again so he has enough to last through the week. He is 6'3\" and 280. The 3xl tall fit him well. They're long enough and a little baggy- the way he likes. We live in south Texas where the temps are easily 1000F daily and these protect him from the sun while keeping him cool. It's hard to find safety shirts that are light weight and offer sizes for tall men. These shirts perform well and check off all the boxes on our list.",
