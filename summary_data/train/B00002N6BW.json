Word of caution: only use one type of spray in it - for instance, if you use this for Round-up weed killer in your garden, only use it for that. Buy a separate sprayer for other germicides/pesticides. Even if you rinse it out really well, some residue is always left behind and it's very dangerous to mix things.",
