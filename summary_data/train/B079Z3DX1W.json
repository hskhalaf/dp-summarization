Either or, the phone is great for the price. Even with the preinstalled apps, they're not invasive like the moto g4 was.

Right now, the only thing the phone can do is manually take screen shots, turn up or down the volume and do hard/soft resets. Both the touchscreen and the fingerprint scanner are non-responsive.

The signal is terrible for some reason. There are times when his phone has no signal at all, when my Moto series phone, placed right next to his, has a good signal. The phone itself is a bit glitchy also, random things it would be hard to describe here. Pick a different model, we've had good luck with all the other Moto phones in the past.",

The prime version was only $150 when the T-Mobile version was almost $400. It is fairly snappy with 3gb of ram and has a decent amount of storage. The camera is perfect for her but nowhere near the standard of a Galaxy s9 or new model Iphone. She loves that she can get all her apps and play her casino games. Its fairly large, the screen I believe is at least 6in, but I definitely recommend getting a case. All in all its a great budget smartphone.",

Honestly can't notice a performance difference between this and my old s7. One thing is camera is pretty sub par but that doesn't bother me. So for 240 it's a no brainer even if it does poop out in a couple years, because so do the $1000 flagships.",

Get a case and never take it out unless you like the look of broken glass. Second, the speaker has gone bad. When I play from the speaker it is much quieter and sounds blown out.

I prefer this than a product with 48 megapixels producing mediocre pictures. Price is excellent",

They've lost a loyal customer forever... I can not emphasize this enough. DO NOT BUY",

I regularly clean storage space and delete various apps, just in hopes of speeding up performance, even if just by a little bit. But it never make a difference at all.
