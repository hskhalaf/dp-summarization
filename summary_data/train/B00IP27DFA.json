Description notes the battery and voltage, etc. so I assumed that was included. Buried in the specifications, it says \"bare-tool\" which apparently means just the saw, not the components to make it work. You'll pay another $60 or more for the battery and charger separately... or you can spend $35 and get a Cordless 20v Drill/Driver with battery and charger included, which is what I would recommend. I hope it's a solid tool, but won't know for a few days until my new drill with battery and charger arrives. FML.",

I contemplated buying one of those pole saws that convert to chain saws, but most people I know who have one say they leak oil badly. Plus, I didn't really have room in the garage for an 8 ft tool. Since I already have two black and decker 20 volt batteries from my string trimmer, I decided to give this a chance. I purchased blades specifically for cutting branches of wood. I can honestly say that this is one of the two best purchases I have ever made on Amazon or anywhere. I love using it. Powerful, portable, convenient, just plain gets the job done!",

Like, when I have to cut through a nail in order to extract an electrical box I'm replacing, or making quick cuts to the new gate they installed (poorly) on my wood fence. When you need it, it's great to have. This one is small and cheap and I already have a bunch of these Black and Decker batteries from their other products. I recommend it (or something like it)",
