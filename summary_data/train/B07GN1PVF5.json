It's frustrating, because you have \"visual indications\" telling you that the \"zapping\" should be working, yet you directly hit a bug and...nothing. Obviously, if there's not enough battery charge to power the \"zapper\", it would be logical to have the indicator LED go out.

Stupid flies has really landed directly onto metal grate, I had slowly flipped little red switch on. Then I had pressed the button -then- within millitet of second. Instant loud snap with so sudden death to pesky flies. Reason I had choose the largest one -vs- smaller mallet because of it's harder for flies maneuver around larger fast swinging with fewer misses.",

I'm sure they'll think its a gag gift at first, but these guys have been super useful during the summers.",

Flies (and larger bodied bugs) get stunned on the first zap, and require a longer contact to kill. All in all it's effective because while they're stunned you can get a follow up final blow. Smaller bugs get fried instantly. I'd definitely buy these again.",

Especially, the activate button on many brands/models is very flimsy but people often press that button fairly firmly because of the excitement of trying to get the mosquito before it has a chance to escape. No such problem here. Also, I have bought a few of these and the one time I did have a problem the company did respond with prompt, friendly, courteous service.",

We have pond gnats which are a nuisance, this definitely helps clear them out of the way. Used it on a housefly and had to zap it twice though because of the size of the fly. The first time it immobilized the fly and/or injured it... so I had to swat it again and it was dead. Highly recommend this.",
