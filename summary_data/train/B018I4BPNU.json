Left in sun light for roughly 8-10 hours and it would die in 3 min of radio use. This was what I was hoping to use for the main charging but guess not.

What we didn't expect was that when we lost power, the cell towers would go down too. This radio was our only connection to the world during the storm and for the 15 hours after where we still didn't have power. It lasted at least 12 hours on a single charge with a few hand cranks every now and then just in case. This is a permanent addition to my hurricane kit!",

There is an indicator bulb to let you know you've got the station. The flashlight would be OK for walking a dark pathway or to find something. Overall, for the price, I think it is a good deal and worthwhile having about the house. The bright color makes it fairly easy to spot, too.",

      "text": "This radio is great! its small and compact and the charge lasts forever it seems! I had it blasting all day today in my pocket while I was hiking, never had to crank it once! The only negative thing I could possibly say about it is the lack of headphone jack which super sucks and that the volume dial is really touchy but otherwise its a life saving device if your bored on the trail! Way worth the 20 bucks. Im so glad I bought this",

This is a case of the company being above board and good customer service. I was pleased with the volume produced by such a small radio! One year later: We put the radio outside in the sun, and it played all afternoon the first day of use. After charging in the sun the next day, it played a few minutes. Now it plays if cranked but the solar charger isn't working. Sound is good if hand cranked, so that's what we do!",

It was handy when I lost power for a few days during Tropical Storm Isaias - I could hear news and information about what was happening in the outside world. The fact that it has a flashlight on the side is good. I haven't tried out the cell phone recharger. But it's probably something good to have.",
