It took me longer to yell at my husband to find the tools that he didnt put away then it did for me to put this wagon together. Less than 2 mins to put everything on, and 10 mins to find two wrenches. While it is not the heaviest duty wagon, it'll be fine for my use. It's worth the price. If you need a wagon for frequent heavy loads- spend the money on a real one.",

Side panels do not fit on square and are too short for flip pins to catch in corner receptacles. Mine was delivered with simple missing parts, ie, handle nut and washer. Overall bad design.

Seems pretty well made, good enough for around the homestead anyway. Those big (stinky) tires roll over EVERYTHING with ease. I like that the sides & ends can drop down to load/unload stuff.

I was concerned about getting a return, but the vendor immediately sent out a replacement even though it had been just short of 60 days. Kudos. The second one was perfect. It took about 10 minutes to assemble alone. It is sturdy and works great. I have lent it to neighbors to use and all have been impressed.

The metal is pretty flimsy, and just assembling/disassembling the cart has lead to bends in the attachment points. It's also disappointing that you can't lay the \"walls\" flat to give yourself an extended flatbed cart (there are competing designs on Amazon that allow this, and they seem like a way better choice). The way the walls lock into each other on this cart, you're kind of limited to all walls up or no walls at all. That said, it rolls like a dream and maneuvers very well. I just wish more thought was put into the design of the cage itself.",

They don't seem to fit together well and the bolts at the top holding the sides together will require a wrench to loosen before a side can be let down to hang beside the cart. Other than that - its well worth ~$65 to me. Wagon rolls nicely and seem solid otherwise.",

      "text": "This is a GREAT yard wagon! It's larger and sturdier that I expected, very easy to pull and bigger tires than I expected! It took me about 45 minutes to put together, but I took my time and triple checked everything. The directions are well written with great diagrams. Some reviewers said the directions were too small. Perhaps that has been remedied, since I'm a 72 year-old woman and had no problem with the print size.",

    "title": "Sandusky Lee CW3418 Muscle Carts Steel Utility Garden Wagon, 400 lb. Load Capacity, 21-3/4\" Height x 34\" Length x 18\" Width",
    "description": "This Muscle Carts garden wagon has a 400 lb. load capacity, is made of steel, and comes with folding, removable sides for flatbed use. The utility wagon is designed for transporting up to 400 lb. of supplies, equipment, or materials. The crate's steel mesh construction provides increased rust resistance over iron, and has a powder-coated finish for durability. To facilitate loading and unloading of heavy items from the wagon, the sides of the crate fold down, and can be removed entirely for flatbed wagon applications, such as transporting oversized articles. The wagon comes with a steel handle with a D-style grip, and four 10\" pneumatic rubber tires to resist abrasion and absorb shock while rolling on assorted indoor and outdoor terrain. The wagon is 21-3/4 x 34 x 18 inches (H x L x W). (H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; L is length, the horizontal distance from front to back; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right.) With the sides removed, the utility wagon's height is 13-1/2\". This wagon requires some assembly (tools sold separately), and it is suitable for material handling applications in gardens, warehouses, construction sites, and stores, among others. Utility wagons, also known as service carts, are used for securely storing, organizing, and transporting equipment, supplies, refuse, and materials. They are suitable for use in industrial, manufacturing, and maintenance applications, as well as in the home. Sandusky Lee manufactures steel storage products for office, commercial, industrial, and educational applications.",
