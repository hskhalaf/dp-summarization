I refused the refund and accepted the other oil. Happily the oil they suggested and sent really does work! For customer service alone Leven Rose gets 5 stars. They went above and beyond!",

You can truly smell the rose and it comes in a decent size. I feel like some of my scars from popped pimples have disappeared. I've also noticed my lashes getting longer. I'll be ordering again.",

I've been using it alone for my acne to see if it clears it and I've noticed that it is clearing my acne slowly and moisturizing my face at the same time. I like that it doesn't have a nutty smell but instead has a subtle sweet scent. Will continue to use it and probably will order another bottle once I finish my first bottle. Highly recommend.",

The jojoba oil absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave me with a greasy feel at all. Overall, I highly recommend this product and will repurchase again.",
