So I am returning the 42mm and just received the 38mm and am much happier with the size. I wanted to really share the size difference. I love this watch so far... will review in the future.",

It's good with notifications and being able to respond, but my cellphone is always with me.

I actually ended up being quite sick and ended up being hospitalized the next day with tachycardia symptoms due to septic shock. My watch in fact picked this up when it started happening.",

Takes forever to charge (runs out of battery in no time) 4.disconnects from the app by itself! 5.takes forever to turn it back on after it\u2019s been sitting on the logo screen for 10-15 minute usually! I wouldn\u2019t buy it unless you buy the newer one might be faster and work better!",

      "text": "I like color and the modern style of the watch, it fits great, and it is very comfortable. Only dislike is how breakable it is, when you drop it it will scratch pretty easily, maybe if your looking for a apple watch hat will not scratch as easily get a 5 or a 6. The four might work I have not done to much research but i know that the five and the six are great if you want it to not get scratched as easily. Over all a great product, but I would not recommend if you plan on wearing it a lot.",

But now with the latest Watch OS 6.1.1, this Series 3 is Fantastic! i love responding to texts, even rejecting call right from my wrist. I love the simple controls as well, when listening to iHeartRadio, Pandora or any Streaming service from my iPhone. At this price, it's the Perfect Choice! I do recommend!",

I can use way more features of my phone from my watch than I expected and there are even some fun features that I didn\u2019t know about like the walk-in talkie. Definitely worth the buy",
