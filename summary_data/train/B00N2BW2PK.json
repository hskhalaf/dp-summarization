After 45 minutes redoing everything I had done before, the tech support person, who was very nice and helpful, admitted that this is a known problem with the Fitbit Charge HR. In other words, it doesn't work, and the only way to get it to work is to do a software update if they ever figure out the problem, BUT, it won't do a software update. Without the sync, you can't keep any record of stats. So, it's just an uncomfortable and unsightly bracelet. Choose wisely Grasshopper. #REFUNDSFORCHARGEHR",

I did not use it in challenging environment in any sense... no scuba diving, no hang gliding. Just house choirs and driving to supermarkets. Fitbit has very high reputation but now I am VERY skeptical about their product quality. Much cheaper Lintelek has been doing well nearly two years. I would buy Lintelek and not Fitbit.",

I expect technological devices to fail, but not right after a year. It's okay overall. The charge HR keeps track of average heart rate. If you dig deep, it will tell you your cardio level for the day. RECOMMENDATION: Don't buy unless you're to lazy to keep a timer when you're doing cardio, or don't feel like spending $130/yr.",

I would be on a treadmill with a HR of 145, and my Fitbit would say 110-115... if it recorded anything at all (apparently sweat makes it malfunction).

Pros: Measures my steps accurately when compared to other pedometers Can't vouch for accuracy of heart rate but it matches the treadmill's rate Integrates really well with MyFitnessPal and Rally as well as a lot of other fitness apps out there Cons: Watch function can't be on all the time Not waterproof Compared to UA Band the HR: is much much easier to read. has a more accurate step count measures heart rate all the time, not just at certain points. I also prefer the Fitbit app. The UA app is flashier but not as useful.",

      "text": "This is much more interesting that I thought it would be. Over time the dashboard shows trends and improvements in activity. The interactive challenges are quite motivating. I use a lot of power tools; reciprocating saws, sanders, oscillating tools. I would have thought these would really throw the steps off but this seems to be able to tell the difference and just count 'steps'. The only upgrade I would like to see is a better charging connection. With my poor eyesight I cannot really tell which way to insert the charging connector. I am sure I have dinged this up as a result.",

    "title": "Fitbit Charge HR Wireless Activity Wristband (Black, Large (6.2 - 7.6 in))",
    "description": "Color:Black| Size:LargeMake every beat count with Charge HR\u2014an advanced activity wristband that gives you automatic, continuous heart rate tracking right on your wrist\u2014all day, during workouts and beyond. Check heart rate 24/7 to maximize training, maintain exercise intensity and measure calorie burn. Automatically track your all-day activity, exercise and sleep, and stay connected with call notifications on display. By wirelessly syncing stats and trends to your smartphone and computer, Charge HR gives you the motivation you need to push yourself further\u2014every step, every beat, every day.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\u2022 Certain features like Auto Sleep Tracking and SmartTrack may be disabled when using this accessory. Classic accessory bands are the recommended accessory for high intensity workouts and sleep tracking. \u2022 Do not wear the Flex 2 Pendant accessory while sleeping or during high intensity activity, as doing so could create a choking hazard. \u2022 Flex 2 Pendant accessories contain magnets. Magnets may interfere with pacemakers, defibrillators, or other medical devices. Consult your physician and the manufacturer of your medical device before using to determine if these accessories are safe for you. If the accessories may be interfering with your pacemaker, defibrillator, or other medical device, do not wear the accessories.\n\nBUYING GUIDE\nMove it up: Since blood increases further up your arm, wear your tracker higher on your wrist to improve the heart rate signal during workouts. Start by moving the device up to three finger widths above your wrist bone, then experiment with slightly lower placement. Keep it secure: The less your tracker moves during exercise, the more chance you have of maintaining a heart rate signal throughout the activity. Do not wear the band too tightly, as this can restrict blood flow and goes against our wear and care guidelines. Hold steady for ten seconds: High intensity exercises or activities that cause you to keep your wrist bent (like push-ups) or move your arms vigorously (like dance) may interfere with heart rate signals. If you stop seeing a signal during these types of activities, hold your wrist steady for ten seconds during breaks to get your reading.\n\nMANUFACTURER CONTACT INFORMATION\nCustomers contact: support@fitbit.com\n\nSee more",
