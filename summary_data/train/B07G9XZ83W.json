And the picture quality is fine and the price was really excellent. Also, it's very small and light - something that was an advantage for me. Only possible complaint: there are absolutely no controls on the TV itself. You can't do anything without the remote. You might want to have a spare around just in case.",

But I can't sleep with the TV on, otherwise the bright white light at the bottom of the TV (when it's turned off) wouldn't bother me. This light also doubles as a sensor so you can't block it. I have temporarily placed my girl scout cookie box in the way of the brightness.. which makes me hungry for cookies, pretty sure that's a win for me. I'm going to go make some ice cream coffee now. :) Cheers",

I would prefer the picture be a little darker, but you are limited by the controls. Still, overall I am very happy with this set. It is super light weight and the picture is large.

When it happened again in week 3, I called to return it. I was convinced to accept a partial refund and instructed on how to reset the TV if this continued. Now I'm not sure if the \"Turkey\" is the TV or me. . Keep shopping for another brand!",
