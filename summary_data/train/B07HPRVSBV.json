It works very well and my clients even commented on how great it all sounds. Super easy to connect - plug and play - simply plug in the USB into your computer, turn on the mic box which you attach somewhere on your body and it automatically pairs instantly out of the box. The sound is professional and would suit any type of use including commercial in my opinion. I highly recommend this product and I would buy again in a heart beat.",

It\u2019s very lightweight, easy to set up, and the sound quality is great. Just plug it into the USB port on my computer, and it immediately appears as a sound source. Two suggestions to ensure great sound quality: 1) Be careful to place the USB receiver in a location that has a clear, unobstructed path from wherever you\u2019ll be broadcasting to avoid interference from other electronic devices. 2) Change the batteries often (I use rechargables) to ensure the transmitter has full power.",

I got this mic, was able to plug into computer - then just send the audio out to a small external speaker and viola!!! a perfect little portable PA system that sounds Much Better that a separate PA system with mic built it. So I can play audio from powerpoint, and have lapel mic working at the same time - using only my computer. Sound was amazing - this little mic picks up very well and feeds back very little - AWESOME!!",

It also did not cut out when I was facing away from it. This product could work fine for stationary setups - like giving a lecture while seated, where you are consistently in range and can keep the box in direct sight of the USB, but for getting up and walking around in any way, it is not ideal.",

Also, it is very disconcerting to have the microphone literally leaning against your cheek -- but that's the way it's supposed to be, and it does have a great quality sound!",
