For games like Battlefield or CoD where you need that 3D sound element (to hear people all around you.... creeping up on you, bullets flying around you, etc...) this really struggled. So much so that it made playing games like that a lot harder than it should have been. In the end, I went with a set of Astro A50s and I haven't looked back since - these, I kept for general VOIP.",

Unfortunately the USB part cannot be used with the PS4 meaning yes these can be used when PS4 gaming but you lose the option to mute and adjust volumes etc. Friends say my voice is clearest in the party, they all have turtle beach headsets. If you want PS4 compatibility and adjustability (silly Saw-like voices, mic volume up & down past that of the PS4 menus ability etc), go for turtle beach. If, like me, you want PC gaming/music headset that can be used for PS4, Go Hyper X.",

It may even be fraud. I thought I was buying a USB soundcard that took 7.1 input audio channels, remixed them to stereo taking account of ear position vs. channel position, and presented the surround directly to your ears with high fidelity. What I got instead was a two-channel audio device with a button that adds some cheap spatializer effects. Windows 10 will do that for you for FREE with ANY stereo headphones :/",

Not sure that this is something everyone would be comfortable/able to do. This is a big disappointment considering the price paid for what otherwise seems a pretty robust product.",

The only issue with them is that the Dolby 7.1 only works with the PC because of the way it plugs into the console controllers. Can't help thinking that could have been solved somehow. Overall, Happy Customer. Also they have lasted 6 months now and still look box fresh; not bad!",

They also send you 2 different types of ear cups so you can choose to fit either material or leather ones depending on your taste and the mic can either be fitted to the headset or set up as a desk type mic. After all my problems with my Razor headset in the first 4 weeks of purchase, this headset has been a absolute godsend, despite being cheaper.",

The noise cancelling is passive, but it's better than run-of-the-mill headphones. The detachable mic is nice for when I need it. Both the headphones and mic offer good sound quality. The design is fairly sturdy but also padded for comfort. I'm fairly small and was pleased that the smallest setting fit me well, something that can be difficult for finding a good headset. The main connector isn't too long, but it's good for sitting with a laptop. With the full cord length, it's plenty long enough for reaching the computer for gaming and offers immersive surround sound.",

I'd say the other style of headsets with the elastic type of headband are better for less head fatigue but this one barely any weight so it will be fine for many hours on end i am sure.",

Vey comfortable to wear too and you can change the cushion pads for different types of material. The microphone is detachable and has good sound quality. The only slight downside of it (for me), is that the treble is quite high. Thus is usually helpful in gaming but if you're listening to music it can hurt your ears a bit so I had to adjudt the equaliser for a bit. Other than that, a solid gaming headset.",

She loves them, wears then all the time to game and chat to her friends on discord. I wore mine for 30 minutes and I had to take them off due to the discomfort they caused me. They were very tight on my head and I felt the cans were not encompassing my whole ear and this made my ear quite sore. So 4 stars is the score and would have been 5 if Kingston catered for the market with a larger head",

They sound great, they are incredibly soft and comfortable, they come with velour pads and faux pig skin, so he will have velour in summer and the leather type in the winter. His voice is very clear through discord, but, one thing they could do is improve the pop filter on the boom mic, it lets through too much 'pop' it needs to be thicker or of a better more acoustically tuned absorbent material.",

      "text": "Extremely pleased with this product. Using the headset with my ps4 for a couple of months now and never had an issue with it. Really comfortable too even for long gaming sessions. The only thing I could come up with against it is the mic quality. It's not great but it's pretty average. Anyway for casual gaming this mic is perfect too and if You're serious about recording/broadcasting Your voice You should go with a standalone mic anyway.. Feels well put together as well and I like the aluminium frame too. Dropped / stepped on it plenty of times whitout causing any damage. Best headset in this pricerange by far.",

Well designed, nice touches like the controls for mike/earphones and 7.1 surround sound button are on the usb cable not the headset cable. Also like the way the microphone detaches so you can use it as a normal headphones without the mike getting in the way or damaged. Nice quality feel from the woven cable sleeve to the headband and even the packaging, a good buy.",

Cons: The noise isolation is not amazing. I was lead to believe it was. Still decent though so thats why 4 stars. The surround sound is a joke.",

However the band has somehow caused quite severe irritation of my scalp (I shave my head so the material was in contact) which is very disappointing, my Senns do not do this, so I've had to return them.
