You may also want to buy a water-pressure regulator, and set it at no more than 20 PSI (pounds per square inch).

Want it to water at 5am? Get up at 5am and program it.... Other than that, it's a reliable unit that forgoes the digital screen which ultimately fails (aka Orbit).",

Hose fittings started to leak. I have had other timer products last much longer. Works as advertised but would be a better product if the user could set time rather than time being determined relative to whenever the unit is configured. Directions and online description need to make this clearer. Yes setup is easy, and the directions cover that. But addition of a clear statement that the user cannot set time, time is determined relative to startup would have avoided disappointment.",

Very simple to use, a 3 year old could use it, literally.
