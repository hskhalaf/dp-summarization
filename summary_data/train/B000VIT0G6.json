I have one computer (Windows XP) connected with a cable, one (Windows XP) connecting wirelessly, a Wii, Playstation3, and blu-ray player all using the router. For my internet connection, I have a cable modem. The reason I bought this model was because I needed to VPN to work from my wired computer while the other one was still connected to the internet; my previous router, the Linksys WRT54G2, wouldn't do that. This router supports multiple tunnels which solved my problem. The main setup up was easy and I was online in no time; using the multiple tunnels required using some advanced settings.",

It's been a while since I was this happy with any product, which is even more remarkable considering how troublesome wireless routers evidently can be. I was surprised and delighted. I'd recommend this router without hesitation even to tech-challenged friends.",
