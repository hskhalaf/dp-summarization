I like the unique match between the remote and receiver because it avoids conflicting with my other Hampton Bay fans that use dip settings. It is a little thicker than the Hampton Bay receiver, so it may pose a problem if the cover around the motor is small. I taped the receiver on the ceiling as mine has plenty of space in the cover. As other reviews pointed out, the receiver beeps when you click the remote. It might bother some people but I do not mind the sound as it is installed in a basement room, away from other bedrooms upstairs.",

I only wanted convenience. None of the ceiling fans in my house have a big enough ceiling canopy to house the receiver, so I cut a notch in the canopy big enough to allow the wires to exit the canopy and taped the receiver to the down rod. I really like the fact that you can set the timer for 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours. I hove only used the 1 hour timer so far and it works perfectly.",

Beep - It's brief but loud - like a chirping smoke alarm with a bad battery Battery - readily available, but not in your battery stash Mounting screws - Takes 2 screws with a small head to mount the remote holder (off to the hardware store) Connectors included - Never seen them before.

I eventually replaced my dimmer wall switch with a standard light switch and enough voltage was available to power the controller (receiver) and it works fine.

After upgrading the Bond firmware to V2.10.8, I was able to manually set up the light and three fan speeds. The controller the Bond app first suggested didn't work. So the key is update firmware and set up each button manually. Hopefully a future Bond firmware update will recognize Fnado controllers.",
