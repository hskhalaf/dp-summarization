It might even make you say a few curse words putting it together but keep in mind it's for someone special so safety first!

The toddler bed frame is also light and easy to move around in the room which is a plus. The colors definitely make it at an attractive bed for kids to want to sleep in and there are a lot of different styled beds that you can select from although the pricing can be quite different one from another.",

The red rails in the picture do not lock into the bed - they don't even sit on the bed, so our toddler is supposed to sleep in a bed with no rails? What's the point of the rails if they don't connect to the bed in anyway? I would assume the rails are meant to be as picture, so my only logical explanation is we received a broken product.

I would suggest the sellers put a few extra backs to the nails because I had to do a lot of improvising towards the end. Still a great bed. My two year old can drag it, so it\u2019s a slight weight although sturdy",
