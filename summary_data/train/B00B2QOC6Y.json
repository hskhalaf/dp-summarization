Some parts you definitely can't do alone without clamps. The packages did come pretty beat up in the mail. One box had been partially torn open but thankfully the bag with all of the screws etc. didnt fall out. Very very heavy boxes. Recommend just cutting it open and carrying it inside in pieces or if you own a dolly use that. I kind of want two for myself, they are nice dressers. Note: There were no extra pieces or spare parts in the box.",

I am a mechanic whos life is tech manuals, and even I chose to overlook some details while looking at the photos, which resulted in rework. Luckily I was not alone putting this together. Ha.

For example, the back is the same kind of heavy engineered wood as the rest of it--other furniture often has heavy paperboard backs. The storage bin at the bottom is clever in that it makes the base bigger and the dresser less likely to tip when the drawers are open. A cordless drill/screwdriver is handy when putting this together. Sometimes you need to use a low-torque setting to avoid over-screwing--you don't want to chew-up the engineered wood. This was easy to put together, even with a kid \"helping.\"",

      "text": "I bought two of these at the time time. One came pretty much dent free. The other came with many dents, chips and scrapes. Two of the knobs cracked right in half. The stickers to label the parts are places on the outside instead of hidden on the inside of the dresser. The drawers are a little uneven. The wood is particleboard. I didn't expect much for the price it's great I just wish it didn't arrive with dings. One of them is on the top piece and very visible. I'm not sure I will but the matching bookshelf I was thinking about now after seeing the quality of these dressers",

      "text": "It is what you can expect for the price. Pretty easy to assemble, but the book could have had more detailed instructions. I also didn't like all the screws, nuts and other bits just being in a bag instead of separated. Also shorted me one of those cam nut things, but I had extras from another project. The back is a bit wonky with two seperate boards not actually attaching to each other.",

The rails for the drawers were pretty as Saunder chose not to lable or sort any of the screws. It was a fishing game trying to determine which screw should be used at each stage of the assembly. Overall, this pain point with the assembly was not enough to deter my rating. Excellent buy!",
