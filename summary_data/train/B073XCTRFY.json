I found Go Dog Go and seen they quality ingredients in it so bought his and bought these for me! I love that its made whole whole foods and nothing synthetic. This is my first bottle and will update if we finally get pregnant. Hoping these help! ***Update*** In June we found out we are finally pregnant! It is now October and since I found out I was pregnant i have been taking Best Nests Prenatal Mama Bird. It is the best i have found! I recommend this company and irs products to everyone!!!",
