Their main menu sent me to a voicemail where i left my name and number and reason for call. A week + later and no email or phone call. I also called back 2 addtional times and was sent to the same voice mail. Theese companies take the time to read everybodies reviews and respond to negative reviews claiming to be only a phone call away. All there trying to do is erase the negative review in the eyes of potential customers reading reviews before they make there purchase. Thats just shady in my eyes.",

It still seems to work so I haven't bothered to report it or replace it. The instructions were very easy to understand as well. Be sure to read them because inserting the battery packs is sightly different than you'd be used to. :)",

      "text": "While the battery is a tight fit that gives you a slight trouble, it is well worth it, a single charge lasts over half a week with quite a bit of use every day. The charging cradle doesn't grip the controllers, instead it relies on the curves holding it in place so you're better off placing the stand on the console. Charging takes quite a few hours but using a wall charger cuts that time significantly. Overall the appearance doesn't inspire much confidence until you use it, which blows away much of its competition. The batteries are superb, getting 2 sweetens the deal. This is the go to charging station at the moment.",

It's super easy to just grab, play, then throw it back on the dock. I recommend it heavily.",

A little disappointed considering the cost to run vs just replacing with AA batteries. Color match options would be nice. Longer battery life would be even better. Probably won't be replacing them and reverting back to AA batteries.",

They made sure I would be satisfied with the new product which I am. It is a nice little charger, the controlled rear in it easily and definately makes life easier. I've had this charger for a bit over 3 months and am only a very casual user- mostly netflix - after about 2 months I noticed the life span of the charge dwindling. Now the charge only lasts about an hour before dying- not worth it.",

If it comes out a fraction of a centimeter mid game controller disco, shouldn't have to tape it to make it work.
