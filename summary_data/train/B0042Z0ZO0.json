With that being said, this device has multiple ways it can help you to improve your golf swing. It takes a little practice and repetition to get quick results. If you invest time into learning the right lessons, you\u2019ll take 5 strokes off your game or more. It\u2019s a must have for me and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone like me who self teaches and any golf instructors. This is a great device! Love it!!",

Golfer must turn 180 degrees to use in the hip position instead of the head position, which requires a lot more room if you are using this indoors. \"Hat\" was a joke.",

Granted, it's pricey - I actually picked it up on eBay and saved a little - but well worth it even for the price on Amazon. Highly recommend.",
