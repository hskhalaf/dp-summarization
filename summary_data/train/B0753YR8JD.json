My biggest beef, these are NOT leather. Leather needs to be removed from the description. You can always smell leather, and you can always smell vinyl. Or the lack thereof of any smell. I bought these because they're listed as leather, and in the questions, it's asked if these are leather. These aren't leather. My husband kept them because he wears them for work and his others blew out. These won't last because of the vinyl.",
