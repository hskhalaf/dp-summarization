I thought the rubber covered handles were a cute waste of effort on Makita's part. I was pleasantly surprised. After 2-3 hours, you really are able to feel the difference. As far as the performance, you can tell it is a Makita. They have not compromised their reputation yet. Still a wonderful product. The pads that come with it are all you need to do a complete job. Several complete jobs. No need in buying one the extra pad kits.",

I'm getting older, and holding the machine at chest level for minutes on end is a workout, but perhaps you younger folks are in better shape.",
