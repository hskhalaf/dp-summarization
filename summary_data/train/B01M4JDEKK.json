Their genius also led to the Street as being one of the most comfortable bouldering kicks out there.That said, they could have looked for ways to make the shoe in question stink-proof. Nonetheless, the Street is an incredible piece in both function and form.",

      "text": "Had to exchange shoes twice because of sizing issues. I wear a Women's 6.5 and finally ended with a 5.5, but the shoe tag says 4.5? While the toe box is very tight, the heel seems to rub quite a bit. And after climbing in them for two weeks, the rubber on the toe box is already detached itself from the fabric and I haven't climbed hard in them at all. While very aesthetically pleasing, I wish I would have gone with something else. Disappointed with my first So iLL purchase.",

      "text": "Initially painful but they broke in quickly. The Street is comfortable for a climbing shoe. The shoe being all black and synthetic caught my eye. I've worn them indoors and outdoors. In both environments they work amazingly. The rubber is super sticky and gives you the confidence to smear as you please. I feel way more confident while in these shoes. Maybe it's a placebo effect, but I've been sending problems I couldn't before. I'm by no means a professional climber, but I really like them. My only complaint is that they do stink after a bit. It is my understanding that this is very common with synthetic shoes though.",

I ordered a 10 since my street shoe size is a 10 and I currently wear a 9.5 evolv climbing shoe. So iLL's sizing was spot on. The 10 was far too tight so I ordered a 10.5 and found that the fit was much better.",

It\u2019s unfortunate because the shape and fit was great, but I expected more use out of this before it gave out. I climb about twice a week, and this pair was used purely for indoor bouldering in intermediate routes (V5 and under). My last pair of shoes (Scarpa) lasted for 3 years including several outdoor climbs.",

I also sprained one of my ankles with these shoes on from the lack of support that they have. While they are good for cracked climbing in general they are so painful and uncomfortable. I'm over also disappointed in these shoes and really just feel like I wasted my money.",

An ultra thin midsole provides a softer more sensitive fit, creating an extremely lightweight aggressive climbing shoe.
