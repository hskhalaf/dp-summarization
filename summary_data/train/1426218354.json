      "text": "OK Naysayers. Stop the gossip about which field guide is better between NGS and Sibley. They are BOTH superb, and they each have their strengths. Personally, for the field, I prefer NGS for the size and information provided. I keep Sibley in the car for a backup. The NGS guide is just so much better overall for fieldwork and birding (not to slight Sibley, which is wonderful). I find that identification keys, illustrations, behavior, and ease of use in the field is just better with NGS. The 7th edition has done its homework, and has come out with a winning product. You won't be sorry with the purchase. Dave Krueper Corrales, NM",

Also, the quality of the printing is not optimal. Images tend to be darker than they appear in the field. For example, the Prothonotary Warbler does not appear as dark in the field (even in the shadow) as it is painted in this guide. The text and the maps are extraordinary.",

Even better, inside those flaps, where they fold out from the covers, are spreads of visual guides to the general appearance of bird families.

This has proven to be especially true in identifying new and previously unknown birds (i.e. Boreal Owls in Boise, ID).

The illustrations are larger than those in other bird books I've used in the past, and the range maps have been both updated and enlarged. There are 80 more North American species in this edition -- 967 in all -- illustrated beautifully in color and accurately described by field marks, behavior, habitat, range, and vocalization. I especially like the handy thumbtabs -- very convenient for quick reference -- and this NatGeo 5th edition has a practical, weather-resistant cover and informative flaps that can be used as placeholders. There are other bird field guides, but this is the best I've seen.",

This book looked New! If it didn't have the first owner name in it, I would've thought it was. We are so pleased with the delivery of the book and the quality in the shape it was in, thank you very much THRIFTBOOKS.",
