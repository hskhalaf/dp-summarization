Since the basket can be detached with ease, a second smaller basket- to allow better maneuvering among denser branches, and with somewhat longer claws- for harvesting smaller fruits like apricots, figs and small plums would be good.

The weight of the pole is heavier than I expected, but is needed to avoid snapping in half when fully extended.
