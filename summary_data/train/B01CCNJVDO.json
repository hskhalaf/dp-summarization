Also, it's way too tall (I'm 5'5'') for me, so it's been used mostly by my husband. All the negative reviews are accurate-don't buy this rocker!",

I have spent many nights sleeping (both sitting up and reclining all the way back) in this chair and it is super comfortable. I threw my back out a couple of times over the past year and am in less pain sitting in this chair than I am in any other chair in the house. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "This chair has been in my son's room for about two years now. The chair was fine at first, but after about a year of using it lightly on a daily basis, it started to squeak horribly. There's no way to position myself so that this chair doesn't make some kind of irritating, monotonous sound. I'm not a large person either and my son is just two yrs old. Luckily, the squeaking doesn't bother my child, it drives me mad though and it's going out on the curb soon. This chair isn't worth the money. Furniture, good furniture, should last some time, especially with gentle use. I do not recommend purchasing this chair.",

I would buy this chair 100 times over. Totally worth it and also pleasing to the eye. It is currently parked in my living room and I don't ever sit anywhere else",

As many people have stated it is hard to close the foot rest when returning from the reclining position. What we found to be a bigger problem is that the chair will actually tip over backwards when it is fully reclined. We found this to be a big concern especially if you are reclined with your new born baby! If you aren't careful and lean backwards to much it literally just falls over. Other than that, it is a solid buy.",

The only \u2018down fall\u2019 and this is very minor, is the depth of the chair. I\u2019m 5\u20195 and rock it with my tip toes...a small pillow at the back that boosts you forward does the trick-other wise i\u2019d Highly recommend for a nursery.",
