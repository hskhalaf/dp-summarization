      "text": "This was exactly what I was looking for. A makeup case that is not too large to pack when I travel, but large enough for what makeup I take with me. Aside from being the perfect size, the sides are hard and sturdy. I do not like sides that collapse unless the case is crammed full of products. This case means less sliding around during travel and protection for my makeup. There are two pockets for brushes and such but even without those I would still give this five stars.",

It starts coming unglued in places and my zipper came undone with this one. That's after months of use though.",

I wish it came in multiple colors, but most importantly, it does its job and does it well!",

My only complaint is the top doesn't stay up very well when opened, I had to push it waaay back to stretch the fabric so that it stays open. Still nice though, it will get a lot of use!",
