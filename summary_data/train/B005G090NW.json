If you are really wanting to see if they are real just take your sunglasses to sunglass hut to see if they are real. Sunglass hut is owned by ray ban (luxottica). Make sure you buy directly from amazon and not by an amazon seller. Anyways i am extremely satisfied with my purchase!!!",

      "text": "I don't know if the ones I got are counterfeit or if Ray-Ban's process has gotten sloppy but I bought a pair and exchanged with amazon for another and both had this sharp line, almost like they cast it but didn't bother finishing the edges, running all along the top and bottom of the frames and arms. It's super noticeable on my ears and nose and especially at the hinge, and looks pretty sloppy. I have a pair of RB2132s from about 10 years ago and they don't have this.",

      "text": "Ordered a pair with the polarized lenses and they were great for a few weeks. Loved them. But then the tint on the lenses started to blister up around the edges, so you'd get pockets of light/silver peaking through the glasses. I sent them back and thought it was just a bad draw of luck. Got the second pair and around week 4, same deal. Sent back for a refund. They turn to a waste of $100 within a months time.",

The coloring in the picture is spot on and you will get exactly what you order. The glasses themselves have a very classic look and sort of a Katherine Hepburn feel. Unfortunately she got a new dog and they got to them... -__-, the lenses are fine though, just the sides have bite marks. All in all, it's a win of a buy if it's what you are looking for. She has gotten numerous compliments and some girls have even walked up to her and told her that they ordered some just like hers.",

All of my other Ray-Bans had been polarized, which is great around water and on very sunny days. Unfortunately, the way my iPhone's screen was made, polarized sunglasses obscure the screen when the phone is at certain angles. Also, with these sunglasses you can read the instructions on the gas pump without taking them off.",

If you have a small face, definitely go with the 52mm. -Expect to see some light from the top or bottom of these glasses - these aren't made to completely block all light. -If you have light colored eyes, I highly suggest getting the polarized version of these glasses. -Also, if you have a narrow face, expect these to fall off if you look down.

The glasses themselves are typical Ray Ban quality, which is quite good and they are not too heavy and don't really cause me too much fatigue wearing them for long periods of time. They fit quite comfortably actually. I would definitely recommend them for a good daily use pair of sunglasses.",
