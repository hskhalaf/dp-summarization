Put it back on my grill for the second time today, it just barely caught the corner of the grill and ripped wide open with little to no effort. So, to recap, I only got 1 use out of it. Looks like I\u2019ll just go to lowes instead of taking a risk on a different one from Amazon. Cant speak for the water resistance part of it since it wasnt on long enough to get wet.",

Customer service for Homitt is EXCELLENT. The make sure that everything is right with your order. There is no risk in trying this product out as they have a really good return policy.",

We have not had any issues with it tearing. We live in Northern Virginia and it rains a lot here, but we have not had any moisture issues either. The only reason I removed a star was because of the fading of the material. However, our last cover was also black and faded significantly. I think that if you want less fade, it is a better idea to go with a lighter color.",

Hence you cannot move the grill without getting it caught on the wheel and when it rains, the water piddles up at the excess fabric that lays on the ground. I would assume if your grill is taller, it should be fine. But if its a WEBER....AVOID!",

Even some stainless parts developed rust. What a cheat of a product. Edit: The company reached out to me and set things right. I really appreciate what they did.
