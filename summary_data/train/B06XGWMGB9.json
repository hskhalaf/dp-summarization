The flask/case thingy that comes with the Crank Bros tool is a PIA to open, you need a tool just to open your tool case. This comes with a simple little pouch and it also includes a little tin filled with tire patches that you can slide ride into the loop on the back of the pouch. It's exactly what I wanted and otherwise identical to the Crank Bros tool. Don't pay more for less, get this one.",
