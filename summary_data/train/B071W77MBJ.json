I received my set today and am very happy. The instruction manual has a little biography on each featured woman in the set which is great for those who may not know why these women are such pioneers. An unexpected but appreciated design perk is that each minifig's face is double sided; you get to choose between big smile vs pleasant at rest face.",

I got this for my daughter whom I homeschool and we did a space unit with this which included the book. Just be aware that the space shuttle that comes with this is really tiny, I feel some of the pictures are using a bit of forced perspective to make it seem a little bigger, but it's about two mini-figures plus a head tall. Great set to subtly reinforce some positive motivation in young children that they can do whatever they want.",

The rest of the set, however, is a dud. Most of your time will be spent building the 3 bases that are almost all identical. One of the three is supposed to literally be a pile of books. A pile of books! \"Oh great woman of space history, you will be forever remembered for your...pile of books.\" Ridiculous! The third is a satellite that is okay, but pretty weak as well. Not work the price. I do not recommend.",

It's not a \"trash\" satellite, but as we've gotten used to from LEGO, creative re-use of bricks. The shuttle is my second favorite, as it's a pretty remarkable bit of brick engineering to get something that's essentially a fully featured toy out of so few pieces. Anyway, it's fun, it's easy, and it's super nerdy. Love it!",
