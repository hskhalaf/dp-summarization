Saved me so much money because I thought I would have to replace the flooring. You place the suction cups on the board next to the gap, parallel with the long side of the board and hit the device with a rubber mallet to move the planks back into place. My flooring is over cement subfloor and when the weather changes they shift just a little bit and of course the gap is in the most noticeable spot, never under the rug. This did the trick!!!",

Well these worked so well that I wanted my money buying the second unit one was all that was needed.

The construction is very solid and they fit very comfortably in your hands. The only concern I might have is that the levers are plastic, but they are very heavy duty, so I doubt they will break.
