I've gone through about 3 different e-collrs including cheap ones on Amazon and a used Dogtra. All have failed. I held off on buying this because of the price but now that I have purchased this and use it every day I can tell you its so we'll worth it. The functionality of it and all the different modes is so helpful. I have the ET-300 and it's everything I'll ever need. My dog wears this all day long and I only have to charge it every three days or so.",
