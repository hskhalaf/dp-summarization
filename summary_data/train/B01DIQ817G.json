Convection ovens are meant to lay everything out on a flat surface for even cooking and you can not do that with small air fryers like this. Everything you cook just sticks together even if you shake it half way through like the instructions say. Your much better off just frying your items in veggie oil (who said frying in veggie oil or olive oil is bad anyway?) and grill your other items in a George Foreman grill or BBQ if worried about fat.",

Big enough - Good enough for a 2-4 people family. Size could be a disadvantage too, but bigger the size nicer it fries! Cons- Takes too much space to keep - it is bigger than it appears to be. However, I think this is an issue for all air fryers out there, except you buy a small one intentionally.",

The control buttons for the temperature are so small I can't read them so I just use the 400 degree. Also timer numbers fade away so I used a marker. This produce is not worth buying and I was disappointed at the workmanship. Thought Black and Decker was a good brand, NOT SO ON THIS PRODUCT. Buyer Beware!!",
