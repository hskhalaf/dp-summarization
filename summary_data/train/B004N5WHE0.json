This commonly found big box store soap outperforms other brands that make fancy youtube videos (Ch_m_cal G_ys), by a country mile. I need a sponsorship from the makers of this product.

This product does leave more water stains and it is not as sudsy as the Meguiar's G17748 Wash and Wax. It actually is not a bad product, just not a great wash and wax. The reason why I tried it was because my product that I normally use (Meguiar's G17748 Wash and Wax - 48 oz.) doubled in price here on Amazon with the shipping cost. So after trying this product I just Googled the Meguiar's and found it for 8.39 online at the Wal_ _ _ _ store.",

I also really like the added protection and scratch filling properties of the carnauba wax that is added to the formula. Overall a very good car wash for the price. Just make sure you use it liberally or else you wont see the magic. The directions on the back of the bottle are too conservative of ratios in my opinion, so you might wanna add some extra for good measure and use a powerful stream to create the suds.",
