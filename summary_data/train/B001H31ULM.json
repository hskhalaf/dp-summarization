The kids can easily unfold them by themselves but it takes me a minute to remember the direction to twist to fold them up (it\u2019s still really easy, just takes a moment of concentration) I haven\u2019t compared these with less expensive ones but I think quality is probably worth the price.",

      "text": "Our soccer organization uses these Pug goals for short sided practice games. I liked them so much that I purchased them for my home. We can use them in the yard and they easily fold (twist motion, stands are tent-like) into the provided pouch so that we can place them into a trunk and take them to the park with us. In hind-sight I wish I had purchased the 4 footers instead of the 6 footers as they would be easier to travel with and be a smaller goal to aim for. There is nothing wrong with the 6 footers. They fit fine in my trunk.",
