If you want to buy a PS2 especially the slim these days, buy them from reliable sellers and ask them first if its fully functional (asking them if the disc drive works properly is especially important, if the sellers don't reply, don't buy it) Oh and a tip of advice: DO NOT BUY from the seller chrisny, trust me.",

With the removal of backwards compatibility from Playstation 3, those who want to experience the diverse catalog of PS2 games will need to buy this system. Best to buy it soon as they're no longer being manufactured and prices will sky rocket. Addendum Feb 23, 2013: With the official announcement of the Playstation 4, reliable backwards compatibility may be a thing of the past. While Sony promises PS2 games via a streaming service for the PS4, those who want to play it safe have even more reason to get a classic PS2.",

It also left a ring around the disc which ultimately turned out to be cosmetic only, the game plays fine in other PS2 consoles.",

I have a PS2 memory card in the first slot, and a PS1 memory card in the second slot. Works out nicely. PS1 games won't save to a PS2 memory card. Sony brand PS1 memory cards have to be bought secondhand nowadays, or you'll have to mess with off-brand versions, if you want to be able to save your PS1 games. Good luck. Have fun.",
