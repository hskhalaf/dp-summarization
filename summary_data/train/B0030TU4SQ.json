Had to take her to the vet for emergency treatment. Her gums had turned white, she was lethargic and wouldn't eat. I about lost my baby!! So, this year I found these garlic pills and started giving them to her because she was getting fleas again. Let me tell you, once these babies get into her system, they started making their way to the end of her hair and eventually jumped off of her. She is flea free!!",
