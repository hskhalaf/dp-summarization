If you're not worried about linking your other JBL speakers, then the speaker itself has great sound.",

They're not Bose speakers, but they're pretty good! These things can shake up your room at full volume without any distortion, as far as I can tell! The speakers feel sturdy and have great weight to them, they feel like they're worth the price holding them. Highly recommend!",

Pretty good for the price and I was able to play from an iPad that was inside the other side of the house while out on my front porch. Unit is small and portable. Play/pause, skip song, volume and bluetooth buttons all are clearly marked and work as expected. No real need for a manual.",

The advice was, when the speaker does this, to turn it off and then turn it on... Did that, and it worked without that glitch.... For awhile. Then it would start again. My internet connection is good, no problems. So, I think it is the speaker. Very annoying.",

While standing a few feet away from the speaker, I could feel the base in my diaphragm and half volume. I kid you not, the bass kicks ass and sounds like a live concert.
