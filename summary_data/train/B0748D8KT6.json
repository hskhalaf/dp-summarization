I've a ZTE 981 Pro phone, and this have the capability of fully charging my phone 5-6 time (super fast) before recharging, and only need 5 hrs to fully recharge. I really don't need jumper cable's for my electric bicycle, but it's good to know I have the capability for that if the need should arrive. I almost can't wait for someone needing a jump, and when that day comes, I;ll be glad to write another review.",

I loved it so much, I bought one recently for my wife (the one I bought for her looks like the one in the description -- the specs are the same for the earlier one I bought for myself). You definitely want this product. I can't tell you how handy this is, compared to a pair of ordinary jumper cables!",

My only complaint is the blue led light (batter level indicator) is pretty bright and there's no way to turn it off (you have to wait until it times out). It comes with a nice carrying case that fits all the wires, perfect to just throw in trunk.",

I've used it quite a few times on my own car which is a compact sedan, and it does the job every time. I've even used it on my bf's car, and he has a full sized sedan.
