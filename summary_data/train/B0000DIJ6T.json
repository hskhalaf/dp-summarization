It's extremely durable and after a year of extensive use, it still looks brand new and taste remains perfect. I feel bad for the reviewer who got a defective one. So far, we haven't experienced any rust and I've even torched the thing by accident a few times (putting the pot on high heat with no water inside... I am an idiot). The product not only survived but looks no worse for the wear. It really seems well-built. We just purchased another one for my sister, an avid tea drinker, and she is a believer as well.",

I DO wish it had some kind of whistle, but that's not a huge drawback. The only thing that can be improved on is the fit of the top. The handle does not heat up, but I have to wear a silicone mitt anyway, because if you tip it too far, the top comes off, and steam escapes, of course. A bit awkward, therefore, to pour. Still, I can deal with it because I love the heat up time and the appearance.",

      "text": "Had the kettle now for a few months and really like it. The size is perfect for our standard size stove. The kettle does look better in person than in the photos. It boils fairly quickly. It's easy to keep clean with the wide top opening and articulating handle. The lid does fit loosely, but is easy to keep on by pressing a finger to the top of the black handle when pouring. This kettle looks like it will last a long time.",

Unfortunately, it drips bigly when I pour the hot water into the insulated pitcher or other vessel Sorry but I can get a drippy stove water kettle for less than ten dollars at WalMart. Screw the looks. Do not waste your money on this product.",

The old Revere pot went in the camper. The two best surprises have been how much faster it heats water, and how much I realized the old whistle was irksome. Love the gentle rattle of this kettle. Update: Months later of daily use, I'm continually impressed with this pot. Again, surprisingly fast boil, pleasant rattle when done, solid heft. Plenty of volume for the largest Bodum Fr press.",
