Only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that we noticed right away that the chaise lounges' feet were digging into the mat and starting to tear/unravel it. We put broader, softer feet protectors under them so hopefully that damage will cease. Be aware if you plan to place furniture on it.",

These look nice, are soft to walk on, but yet....super easy to keep clean. The vac can easily pull stuff through from beneath and they can be taken outside and hosed off. They dry in a jiffy. The colors look great and so far I have not noticed any fading (mine is inside the house). Update: Have had the rug for almost a year now. It gets a lot of wear and still looks like new. Would buy again and recommend to others!",

The colors actually matched what's in the picture but in the sun it looks more vivid because of the plastic materials it was juuuust a bit too much for me. It felt well made and I think that, with an outdoor rug pad to resist slipping, it would make a lovely addition to a porch or patio. Seems fairly hefty and it arrived in a roll rather than folded so it didn't have the annoying creases that many less expensive woven outdoor rugs do. I'd love to see this in more colors.",

I bought on from a local big box hardware etc store that never faded but wore out after 3 years of outside use. This rug was expensive enough that it should not have faded in 3 months. Lovely rug colors wish they weren't going away",

I will not be purchasing anything from this company again, for my indoor OR outdoor living spaces, as beautiful as it was when it arrived. So sad. \ud83d\ude1e \ud83d\ude22",

Pretty useless now after less than two years. And it doesn't get a lot of traffic -- it's a seating area and most people are off their feet after stepping on it to get the chairs. The break in the weave doesn't appear to correlate with where the chair feet are, either -- it's in random places that don't have the weight of the furniture on them. I will look for a different product to replace this rather than order again.",

      "text": "Absolutely love this rug! We bought it for an outdoor patio and the colors are really nice! We love that we can just sweep it or leaf blow it to clean it. You'd think it might be uncomfortable to walk on because it's plastic, but instead it's very comfortable to walk and sit on. Even our dogs like to lay on it. It's perfect for our space. Very happy with the purchase!",
