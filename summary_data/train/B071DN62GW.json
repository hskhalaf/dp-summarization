Unfortunately this does not support HDMI 2.0 or HDR. This is important if you have a device that utilizes HDMI 2.0 or your tv's HDR technology. It will still playback 4K content, but with limitations--I found this out after buying the Xbox One X. The only solution is to purchase a different HDMI switch that supports HDMI 2.0 and HDR in order to utilize the full capabilities of certain devices.",

When ever i click to start a game it shuts down so the company sent me out anymore. Customer service is great but the one they sent out did the same thing. If u are trying to run games in 4k or 1080 this is not the product",
