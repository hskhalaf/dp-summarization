For the price it does what it is designed to do, but I suppose without brushes on the carpet attachment it has a difficult time picking up the larger pieces of debris on my area rugs. One annoyance though is the filter can be tough to remove when emptying, which resulted in all the dust particles it sucked up t be released inside. Best to remove the filter outside a window or in a room where the dust won't be an issue.",

It easily goes under the lip of kitchen cupboards, over rugs and grabs anything in front or to the sides.
