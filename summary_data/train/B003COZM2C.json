That puts this into \"toy\" classification in my book. The quality of the device itself is excellent; it just has VERY limited use.",

It does how ever lack two things that I expect to be supplied in the near future (I Hope) (1) is useability with AudibleBooks and (2) an upgrade to the OS for using flash for viewing. For less than $200.00 with these minor faults is one great buy. J&R Music and Computer World provides fast and excellent service - I highly recommend them as they have the best price on the net. I will always give them a try when making a purchase........Regards",

Suddenly audio stops, need to restart the device. 5. No way to play any of the videos from web. 6. Very slow response. This came with a price tag of $199, which I paid, one can get this for $80 now a days. if you really wanted to waste your money one can buy this..",

You cannot download hardly any apps for it at all and definatley none of the \"fun\" ones...Android is a great system but this apparently has the cheapest version of it. I bought it as a gift for my Husband and luckily I took it out of the box to try it out first...I returned it immediately!!! Save your money and time!",

But the screen was not particularly sensitive, the battery seemed to deplete faster than one might expect and, most importantly, we kept losing wireless connection cutting us off from the internet. We returned the Archos 7 to the vendor, along with the accompanying scan disc (never used) that we had purchased, but have received a refund only for the Archos. We went out and bought an Acer netbook for about $100 more and it has met all our expectations. Not once has it lost wireless connection with the same router we had used with the Archos 7.",
