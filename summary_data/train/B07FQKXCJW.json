I'm thrilled to have found this more natural solution that works BETTER than the Apoquel ever did. My boy's allergies are non-existent after starting these Aller-Immune Bites w/Hemp along with local raw honey! His eyes have cleared up and even his fur looks and feels fabulous now.

We wish we could set up on subscriptions so we never risk running out. Thank you for a quality supplement that really works!",
