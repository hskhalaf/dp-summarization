      "text": "My first e-reader ever purchased. Amazing light weight and perfect screen size for reading. Response time is quite slow which makes highlighting difficult to control. I hope Kobo will add more built in Chinese input method in later OS release like pinyin or cangjie for looking up Chinese book from the store. The current zhuyin CN input method is not common in region outside Taiwan. But these has little to impact reading experience so I still find it a good product for reading. Quite a lot of people like to read comic books because of the big monitor, true but I just find the saturation is too low to make a good contrast in the lines and shades.",

I was very disappointed when the kobo screen simply froze. It would not charge, turn off...there was nothing that I could do to unfreeze it. It happened during the 30 day return period so I sent it back. I was reluctant to try another as I was disappointed in the overall quality. I just bought a refurbished kindle oasis. I receive it in a few days. I am hoping this will work better.",

Cons / suggestions: * I'm not sure if it's only my device, but there is a bit of fairly noticeable unevenness in the lighting, on the edge where the handle/buttons are. * If you disable showing your current book on the \"sleeping\" screen, it would be great to have some \"stock\" images (as on Kindle). * Sleeves are little hard to find so far (and the slightly unusual dimension ratio makes standard tablet sleeves not a good fit).",

It\u2019s orientation sensor is very inconsistent and any small movement while reading can cause it to change orientation. Even after locking orientation in portrait mode, any slight tilt while reading can cause it to flip the screen upside down. So I either have to hold it PERFECTLY still the entire time or get interrupted every few minutes with a bout of frantic waving to get the screen back to its correct orientation. It\u2019s such a simple software patch. Just disable screen rotation completely. I\u2019d stay away from this product.",

After a week of remaining frozen I am returning the Forma to Walmart and ordering the Aura One Limited Edition from Kobo. I also don't like that it won't fit in the back pocket of my jeans.
