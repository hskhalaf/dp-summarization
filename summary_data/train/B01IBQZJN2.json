So I chose pretty much at random, these egg-shaped squeezy balls that come in a set of three. Upon opening the box I detected each egg had a progressive resistance (soft, medium and firm). I began using them immediately to restore flexibility to my finger joints. The egg shape I found was perfect because I can change the contour to a curve that best fits the finger joint that needs work. I guess it was dumb luck, but I found the perfect hand therapy device!

The medium and hardest eggs have significant steps up in stiffness. They are all solid gel or gel-like rubber. They do bounce. They are lightly textured. Between the texture and the almost sticky-like nature of the material, you will not have to worry about them slipping around. They are great for idle hand exercises while in a meeting, on the phone, reading, computing, etc.",

I do recommend ordering the middle size however. I have large hands and the biggest size is too large to fit between your fingers and palm comfortably. I ordered a set of the middle size and kept the big size as a back up.",

I had an open heart surgery 4 weeks ago and they nicked a nerve on my right hand putting the artery catheter in and so I have 2 numb fingers on my right hand. The feelings will return after a while but my surgeon recommends an exercise ball to strengthen the fingers. It comes in 3 with different strengths each. I am using the softest one which is the yellow about 4-5 times a day. I\u2019m very pleased with them and hope to slowly graduate to the strongest egg in time. I highly recommend this.",

      "text": "I keep the stress relieving balls on the dining table and inevitably someone in our family will reach and grab one to start squeezing while carrying on conversation. The dinner table is an ideal place because everyone enjoys getting together for a meal, and during the sometimes excitable conversations, one or two members will reach for a ball to relieve good and bad anxiety or anxiousness. Good product. The balls are not only an interesting conversation item, but also relieve tensions",

They feel very nice in your hands so work just as well for stress relief as they do for hand and finger exercises. Only one minor issue which doesn't really bother me (see five stars above). They are a little tacky, as in texture, so if you drop them they'll likely pick up some dirt/hair/lint. They're easy to wash off though so like I said not really a bother.",
