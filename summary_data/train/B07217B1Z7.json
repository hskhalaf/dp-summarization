PROS: - Cheap - Desired length - The leash itself is similar quality to a cheaper leash you'd buy (expected quality for LEASH - not clasp) - Could be used on a small dog. CONS: - Cheap clasp. (No, REALLY cheap clasp. Almost like weak aluminum feeling) - The leash material is the basic quality of most low-cost leashes. (expected but still not great)",

We've used it about 10 times and it's already fraying. I would NOT use it as an everyday tie-out, as I think it would fray and snap pretty quickly.

So far works just fine for us, and the one day shipping was fantastic.",

She refuses to potty on a leash for some weird reason. I got the 30ft one hoping she would actually go to the bathroom while keeping her safe and so far its been working great. The 30ft allows my dog to reach the middle of the yard without having to walk past my driveway. I can't say much for the durability/sturdiness because I haven't had it long, but I fear my dog will break it since it's thin.",

A week later, late at night, we took him out and a coyote was on the other side of the pool, without much effort he tugged and it broke again. We lost site of him. Again, luckily, he returned.
