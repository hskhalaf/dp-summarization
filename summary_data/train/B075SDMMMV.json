If you are that sort of person, you won't be disappointed in it. Thing is massive. The instructions actually have images to show you how to properly lift it and move it around. I clocked roughly 21 hrs total build time. I'm not sure if that's fast or slow. Make sure you not only have somewhere spacious to build it but also somewhere in mind to put it before starting. One look at the manual (see pic) when you take it out of the box and you'll get an idea of what you're in for.",

It might go without saying, but this set it NOT for little kids; this is a finely crafted, detail oriented display piece. If you have the inclination, and the cash to blow, pick up the largest production Lego set made thus far. You won't regret it!",

Say an official LEGO Death Star loading bay or Mos Eisley, making the falcon the center piece of something truly epic.",
