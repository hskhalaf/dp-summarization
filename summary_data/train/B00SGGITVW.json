I also like that is came with 2 doorbell notification boxes so if I want to add one to my upstairs I can and it's so simple to set up.",

The symbol on the front doorbell does not appear constant blue -- it is always black until you press it. Having it always black does not make the person at the front door easily understand what it is so they end up knocking anyway. Solved this by taking a white-out pen and coloring in the bell icon so they can better understand it's a doorbell.",

Would be even better if this device had extra channels to select a different frequency. By adding dip switches in the transmitter & receiver this would allow changing the signal if interference from other devices are causing the receiver to sound off. Other than that this is a very high quality Digital wireless doorbell unit. We use it as a doggy doorbell. Because the doorbell (transmitter is touch sensitive type, (doesn't need to be fully depressed) it's easy to train your dog to use it. Sound quality is top notch. Distance between receiver & transmitter is excellent.",
