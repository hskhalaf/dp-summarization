Regarding hardware, the keyboard is good, it clicks nicely into the touchscreen, and generally, the device feel's well manufactured, solid, reliable. It's let down by the hardware specification. I've also struggled to use it as a tablet. It doen't feel responsive to finger touch, often takes several taps to close a window. I agree the reply to this review.
