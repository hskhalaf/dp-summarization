This is just one solid piece of plastic in the shape of bath tub, making it quite easy to clean. The ergonomics of it are also ideal as it positions the baby not too upright, not too flat, but just right. If you're on the fence, I think it's safe to jump off.

His length is near the upper percentiles for his age, however this tub's specs specifically state that it is for up to 18 months. My son can not yet sit up on his own, and the only way he would fit in the tub was to remove the support, which causes him to awkwardly slide down. Had he fit properly in the tub, it would have been perfect, and my review would have been 5 stars.",

It fits easily inside our small second bathtub, and as he's gotten bigger, he loves sitting upright in the tub and splashing. And I love that the non-skid surface and raised seat keep him in place!

Our baby does not slide around and it can be easily used by 1 person to give a baby a bath. I also like that fact that it will grow with our child and we can use it in the bath tub later on. The only down side is that it is not compact, but smaller than some other bathtubs we looked at. We have a small bathroom so we need to store in a closet.",
