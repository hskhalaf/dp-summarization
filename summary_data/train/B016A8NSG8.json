An added feature I like is the headphone jack is on the front, not the back. Highly recommended.",

The controls on the main receiver unit are great: simple and easy to see and operate. That was a main reason for my purchase. But the receiver deserves better speakers than what Yamaha decided to add on. I believe it is time to update and upgrade this little system, Yamaha, if you plan to compete in this audio category.",
