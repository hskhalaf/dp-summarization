Net underneath is coming away from the seams and parachute has holes in chute so I can no longer use. I don't know what has happened to the quality of these parachutes but they do not last. They work great prior defaults. If anyone have some other options of parachutes to purchase that will last the test of time please let me know. I don't want to have to purchase chutes every season. SKLZ may need to look at developing a better parachute",

It says 15-30 pounds of resistance but I find that you don\u2019t feel much of anything, especially in terms of speed inducing resistance. The quality of the product seems fine, in terms of durability. It doesn\u2019t seem too cheaply pieced together. The overall rating should be lower than the reviews suggest however.",

This is a really good way to work on form as it slows the motion and helps you get into a natural lean. The belt is snug and comfortable and the set up allows you to wear it in the way that is most comfortable for your body.",

It gives good mild resistance, I think better than a weighted vest, because the vest really only makes you top heavy. Best of all it is fun, you want to do it again and again.",

The package was opened immediately, the parachute was strapped to his waist and he was off. 10 minutes later he came back in the house covered with sweat, out of breath and beaming with excitement. First impressions: it looks relatively sturdy and my kid was happy on Christmas morning (which gets sigmificantly harder, and more ecpensive, as they get older). Today is only 12/26/12 so let's just hope it withstands his training program for at least a few months. Based on other reviews, if it lasts until june I will be happy with my purchase.",
