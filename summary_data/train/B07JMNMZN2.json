They performed like they were suppose to and I actually liked the lids a bit better with these because they are more transparent then my solid black ones. I do wish the pumps they send with all these kits were of a better quality though. Pumps in both kits are very cheap and perform cheaply too. I'm always afraid I'm going to break them. Still they got my peppers fermented and made me a could sauce that'll keep for awhile.",
