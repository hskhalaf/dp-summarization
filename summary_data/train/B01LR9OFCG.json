We have tried 6 different batteries and the vaseline trick that garmin recommended...... after unscrewing and rescrewing 4 TINY screws about 10 times I have given up. While my son loves the app, and loved the device while it worked, this is a rip off. If it was an apple refurbished, there would be ne problem. But as it is, this is a total rip off.",

The chores aren't hugely motivating, but she does appreciate hearing the ding as coins are added to her account. I especially like the fact that the vivofit doesn't need to be charged routinely, that's just not likely to happen regularly unless I intervene. I would definitely recommend this tracker.

      "text": "Got this for my son for his 6th birthday - he was begging for a watch that counted his steps, and this does everything for him! The band size is perfect for a normal-size 6 year old (he's in the 75th percentile, so a little bigger) - and he still has room to grow into it. The interface/app are well-designed for children and I like other features - chores, sleep monitoring, etc.",

      "text": "This could be a great device. My kids were excited about getting this activity tracker. They were competing with each other on the first few days about how many steps and how much activity minutes they could accumulate. However, everyday is like day one. It never seems to sync with my phone in a timely fashion, some days not ever. I have to reset their profile pics everyday. I also can't view a cumulative weekly total of their activities, so it's not really just an expensive pedometer and watch. As far as pedometers go, however, it is a really good one. The kids have tried to cheat it by swinging their arms and it only tracks actual steps.",

So much for a one year battery. Making me think I should return this and find him a rechargable watch so I don't have to deal with running for battery's every month.",

      "text": "I was so excited to get this watch for my 5 year old son, who is big on getting tasks finished. We imagined the watch giving symbols throughout the day when chores were set up to be completed. We understood that the phone app was to organize these chores and thought the watch would then give a symbols to remind the wearer to do them. This is not so. The watch is basically a fitness tracking device. The chore charts, and completion all happen within the app, not on the watch itself. The other let down we had was the watch face. It got scratched the very first day my son wore the watch. Not great quality. We are disappointed.",
