I will always have them now. So glad I got them!",

You only need one to remove all of your make-up. Plus, they don't sting your eyes like others I've tried. Nice soft fragrance too. I ordered two boxes so I could get the free shipping.

Since they are individually wrapped, they do not dry out as the larger packets of wipes sometimes do. They are the perfect size for removing all traces of makeup and are gentle on the skin. I highly recommend these!",
