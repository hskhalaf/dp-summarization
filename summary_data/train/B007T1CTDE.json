I returned for a refund, after talking with Logitech, after I found out that I needed a 'combo' keyboard/mouse. The mouse worked with IT'S antenna and my old Logitech keyboard worked with IT'S antenna. Good sales gimmick but poor way to keep customers. Five stars for the mouse, zero stars for compatibility with my keyboard so it averages out to three stars (not 2.5. Minus half a star for frustration.)",

      "text": "I've had dozens of Logitech mouse devices over the years and one reason for so many is that the scroll wheels usually wear out. That is, it reaches the point where rotating the wheel results in much less actual scrolling on screen. The deterioration is usually gradual but eventually I need to replace the mouse. When it came time to buy some more, I checked around and noticed that the model M325 seemed to keep going while the others had all started to fail. So this time, I purchased three M325's (for three different computers). Hopefully I won't be writing mouse device reviews again for a few years.",

      "text": "My old wireless mouse just died after 8 years of service and I was desperate for a replacement. This filled the void at a reasonable price. Smaller USB edge sticking out from my laptop is a plus. Mouse fits nicely in my hand and is almost as good as my old one from HP. I have always had good luck with Logitech products. The only issue I have is that the wheel is a bit too loose in scrolling around. I was used to a firmer wheel.",

It is NOT worth about $50. A few months ago, I contacted Logitech and got a replacement for the last broken one. Meanwhile this new one failed too. I tried to get in touch with Logitech again. All known e-mail addresses do NOT work. The support form does NOT work either. Which is quite irritating for people who canNOT or do NOT want to call. A disappointment! I will have to find a different brand.",

My PC runs Windows 10 and it works very smooth with it, no issues whatsoever thus far. If I had to pick one thing to improve about it however, I would say the scroll wheel feels a little shaky as if it would break if accidentally impacted or whatnot. Other than that,definitely a great buy.",

Any sort of pattern in the surface is picked up by the M325 and makes the pointer go all over the place. Wood pattern on a desktop, or the fabric pattern of a neoprene mouse pad are two examples. Too bad. I really liked the form of this mouse otherwise.",
