I am thinking about going with a vegetable protein instead because a 75% markup is too much to pay for the supposed \"bioavailability\" of egg. 8/5/2012: $33.98 8/15/2012: $34.75 11/15/2012: $25.15 11/27/2012: $33.95 2/1/2014: $35.69 4/10/2014: $36.58 8/6/2014: $44.89 8/31/2015: $77.49",

If you have no problem with highly concentrated egg protein, I recommend this, because it mixes fairly easily and doesn't leave useless grains behind like Body Fortress. It does taste odd, though. If you do have problems with whey, egg, or even vegan protein, try Muscle Meds' Carnivor Beef protein isolate. They have smoothie compatible flavors (vanilla, chocolate) and fruit drink flavors (if you're tired of the smoothie flavors).",

    "description": "Many nutrition experts consider eggs to be the Gold Standard for protein quality. Eggs are a complete protein containing all of the Essential Amino Acids that play an important role in muscle recovery. Eggs are also naturally free of lactose, making them an attractive alternative to dairy-based proteins. Each 120 to 130 calorie serving (depending on flavor) of GOLD STANDARD 100% Egg contains as much protein as 7 egg whites with no saturated fat and just 15 mg of cholesterol.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nNutritionists commonly refer to eggs as the \"gold standard\" for protein quality because they're very easily digested and contain generous amounts of all eight essential amino acids. Eggs are naturally free of lactose, so they're also much more \"forgiving\" to athletes who have trouble with dairy foods or milk-based protein powders. Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard 100% Egg takes the benefits a step further by virtually eliminating the fat and cholesterol found in whole eggs. Each scoop of Gold Standard 100% Egg packs as much protein as seven egg whites and only 2 grams of carbs. By also making this formula instantized to mix easily, Optimum Nutrition may have elevated the egg to a higher status.\n\nQuality Counts: GMP Certified Products\nOptimum Nutrition's commitment to quality is evident throughout the entire product development process. As a continued measure of quality, all vendors must provide a Certificate of Analysis for each raw material supplied.
