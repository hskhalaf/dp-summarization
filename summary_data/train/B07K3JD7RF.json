If you are on the fence but would also like to reclaim your phone, I recommend. It is a great little size, and if you hate it more than me, the batteries are indeed removable. \ud83d\ude02",

It plays baby shark, mommy shark, daddy Sharm, and let's go hunt then ends. Its loud enough for a little one to enjoy it without being to loud to annoy me. I would definitely buy again.",
