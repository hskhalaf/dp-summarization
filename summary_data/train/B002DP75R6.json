Primed and Poreless creates the perfect canvas to allow powders, bronzers and foundations to airbrush onto the skin seamlessly and perfectly blended. Skin appears brighter, fresher and younger. Color stays true and in place all day. Customized formula: provides an airbrushed canvas as it preps skin for bronzers, powder products and foundations.
