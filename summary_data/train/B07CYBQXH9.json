      "text": "I was so happy to order this omelette maker, however reading the description it says \"non stick\"... It it far from non stick. You can't really put much veggies in it if you want 2 eggs or it will overflow. Literally 1-1.5 spinach leaf, 1 SMALL slice tomato, and 3 small cube ham and 2 eggs... It overflowed EVERYWHERE... And it stuck bad. It doesn't fully cook through the whole omelette, if you leave it in there alittle longer it burns the egg. I'm very disappointed in this product and wish I wouldnt have spent the money on this one.",

I only use 2 eggs and it did not completely fill us the compartments - so you have to open it and make sure it does not overcook.
