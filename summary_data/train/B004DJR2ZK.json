We have had a variety of different sizes people sit on it: 125lbs teen, 220lbs adult, 350lbs adult, and 400lbs adult. When two 220lb adults sit on this together, it does start to bow in the middle. They can feel comfortable if weight is shifted right on top of the legs. This also matched our old oak table relatively well. If your family is composed of individuals weighing less than 200lbs, you can fit two people on this. Or it can be a one person bench, where the person do not sit in the middle.",

Relatively easy to assemble, the bench is sturdy, functional and quite nice to look at. The bench is currently placed in front of one of our bedroom windows, and serves as a sometime window bench. We've never bought such furniture online (Amazon) before, and much prefer to go to a furniture showroom. Obviously, with the ongoing pandemic, it's tough to make such shopping journeys to our local Macy's. We prefer actual human interactions, but we're also happy with this online purchase of this lovely sitting bench, too. Enjoy!!!\"",

If we need more seating at the table, we can move it to use it there also. It is well built, and I love that the fabric matches our Bolanburg chairs, bringing together the look from dining to living room. I definitely would purchase again.

Pieces of the wood don't line up correctly and therefore we can't put 1 leg on. We will probably need to sand-down the wood to make the leg fit. We can't be bothered to send it back--too much work.

Very pretty, heavy, substantial, sturdy, Nicely stained and finished and easily assembled (10 minutes - 2 bolts per leg need Allen wrenched into place/ wrench supplied ) I bought it when the price was $40 and am thrilled with this purchase. I concur with another reviewer who said it was their best Amazon purchase.",

I also needed one that could support more weight, as there are a fewer stockier people who'd be using it. We liked it so much and it fit our needs so well that we immediately bought a 2nd bench! Great price. Met all of our needs. We've tossed a sheepskin rug on it for softness, and it's perfectly comfy!",
