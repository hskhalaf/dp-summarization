I didn't want to use the green scrubbies available in the store, for fear they would be too rough on our glass top stove. My mom recommended this product and I went on Amazon to order it. I love that it comes with the yellow scrubbies and they're not too abrasive, they're just right. This did a good job in buffing the stove to where the scratches aren't as visible. It did require some elbow grease but that's not a big deal for me. I will be purchasing this again when it runs out. Better than the ones I've purchased at the store!",
