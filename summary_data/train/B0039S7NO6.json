Ex. \"Do you have a red heart?\" I love that it comes with a few different ways to play, but there are so many ways you can modify it for younger kids or even larger groups. You can make it super challenging (memory style), or super simple. I love that it's small enough to be taken anywhere. This would be perfect while waiting at a restaurant!",

The cards are thick and won't rip easily and they come packaged in a cute tin, I believe it would be ideal for travel. I definately recommend this game, it's very versatile because it has many different mini games/modes so the monotony that comes with so many other games is not likely with Spot It.",

My 5 year old begs to play it now with us frequently. It's really enjoyable to have games which he can play independently against us, be competetive and win so this was a huge winner in our book. Gameplay really never gets old, easy to pack up when you're done playing, super easy to throw into a bag and take camping ect. Can't wait to purchase the other versions!",

It's a perfect waiting game at a restaurant or at the doctor's office.",

The first time I sent it, I saw photo's of them playing it online.....I asked their mom if they were really able to play, she said yes, they really do....and her godchild had a birthday coming up, she was going to send them the same game. I considered that a good endorsement",

Another plus is that adults don't really have a distinct advantage. When I play this with my 6 year old, games are usually very close and competitive without me going easy on him. This is not because the game is luck based, as is the case with other kids games that I don't like to play.",
