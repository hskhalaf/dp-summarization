Add in the fact that even after like 57 or so years of existence that they just look cool as hell and you have a winner!",

They were more like an entire size too big and so narrow that once he put them on had to take them right back off because they hurt so bad and we're squishing his feet. Not really sure why these indoor soccer shoes are so different in fit than any others adidias makes. Very disappointing. Had to buy a pair of nikes this season instead.",
