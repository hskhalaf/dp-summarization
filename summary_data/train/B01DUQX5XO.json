      "text": "I ordered this dust pan after getting burned on another dustpan I purchased from Impact Products. Janico Inc. had pictures on Amazon that made it clear that it was designed correctly. This device has a locking tray that releases when the handle is pushed down. That way the tray can be filled and dumped without the pan releasing prematurely. The release is simply to allow for storage flat against the wall if hung on a hook or a nail. The Impact Products dustpan has a latch which barely holds the pan in place which causes it to release prematurely. It is so cheaply made that the latching system will simply stop working after a few months use.",

Not that exciting in my mind though except that I have grown to depend on it and often use it instead of a grabber tool to pick up things.
