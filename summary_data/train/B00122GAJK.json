First of all, do not show your customers a \"Made in America\" hype video when it's clearly marked Made In China. That alone is false advertising. I'm not sure why this table is more expensive than the other Earthlite tables? I expected the padding to be plush, but it feels like a normal table and the plastic head rest holder is cheaply made. The Hammacher Schlemmer table I had for 15 years was sturdier than this one. I'd really like to hear back from the manufacturer. I feel stuck with this product now since I threw out the Packaging.",

We use a bath sheet (super-sized towel) rather than bed sheets to drape the table. Would recommend getting a pad for the face/head rest.",

I was also worried about the legs only have 1 leg fastener.... but it truly works and is very stable. invest in a carrier with wheels if you travel a lot. Also the pegs on the side where the patients arms lay sometimes jab into the skin. So few minor things, but overall it's an amazing product.",

The first one (Sierra Comfort) is also a good table, but not wide enough for people to feel comfortable. EarthLite made their table at 34 inches (I was hoping to find 36\") but this was the best bang for the buck. I spent some time on my own table recently and I found it was well cushioned, wide enough for my arms and sturdy enough that it never faltered. I am happy to use this on my current guinea pig and it will turn into my practice table once I pass my boards.",

Now I am a little disappointed about the quality of the new one. The wood definitely is of less quality then it used to be, cushioning is ok. Carrying bag pretty cheaply made! Don't get me wrong, it still is a good table for the massages I am doing and a good starter table, not so much if you plan to do lots of house calls/out calls. Would I buy it again? Sure ... but not if I would have more money to spend on a lighter table.",

Also included is an arm sling which allows the person on the table to have their arms hang down below the head. A high quality canvas like carrying case with a heavy duty zipper and shoulder strap round out the deal which I highly recommend.",
