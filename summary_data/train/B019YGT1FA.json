Make sure you have enough for back-up, because they won't last beyond a long evening of burning, and you'll want to replace them if you plan to keep your decorations for any length of time. Floating candles can be used in tall cylinders or in short bowls, and the choice of what you use with them is endless. These are beautiful, white, clean-burning candles that add an elegance to whatever I put them with. I always keep a supply in the house for table centerpieces, and for entertaining.",
