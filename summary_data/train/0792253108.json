I decided to get this one for him vs. other ones because this is color pictures instead of B/W pictures in others I\u2019ve found. I don\u2019t know if that would have made a difference to him, but it did to me. It\u2019s also a nice size, too big to fit in a pocket, but not too big to carry with you in a small backpack when hiking.",

When we go to other regions he sees trees that we don't have here, and I thought this would help him identify them or even add to his knowledge of trees in our region. We like the book, but it would have been nice to have some color photos, not just drawings. I realize that the same tree can look very different from tree to tree, the drawings are more accurate, but it still would have been nice to have something with less imagination involved.",

It is missing range maps and does not always show all the parts (flowers, fruits, bark) of the trees. That said, the illustrations are very good. Having used many guides, I have a strong preference for paintings over photos. It does not cover shrubs, which might be considered small trees. But otherwise I have found it to have good coverage of both native and introduced trees.",
