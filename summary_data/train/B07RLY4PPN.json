Thanks to its true-to-width fit, breathable interior, and grippy lugged outsole, it has earned positive reviews. However, a reported con draws it away from perfection. By and large, the Wayfinder Mid Outdry from Columbia is a boot that ticks all the basics.",

      "text": "First time wearing this hiking boot was climbing the slopes of a very steep volcano. The soles gripped the loose rock and dirt very well and the boots performed well overall. On the minus side I am not sure I like the thinner material on the top side of the boots just yet. The boots probably breathe better through this material but I am used to the thicker, more rugged material on my previous pair of Columbia\u2019s which have lasted for many years. Time will tell.",
