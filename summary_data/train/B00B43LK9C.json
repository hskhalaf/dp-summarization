You would think for using the grill that it came with it shouldn't do that. It's not being over powered (turned up too loud) That is normal use. I had to turn down the sub bass to get a somewhat okay sound while taking most of the bass away. But for average use it may not be so bad. I will spend the money and get something a little more up my ally.",

They fit with no modifications to either the car or subs and sound good, I put some weather stripping on the back of the mounting surface so they wouldn't rattle and used the wires off the EO subs so it was plug and play so to speak.",
