A week after buying it, the one I really wanted was now on the site, and it was $50 cheaper (but no hot water, but that's okay with me).",

      "text": "Everything has been working great so far (2 months), I am docking 1 star because it is not as stable as I would have wished. I have young kids and I did not feel comfortable only using the on hold down point as suggested. I ended up opening the front panel and screwing through the bottom of the cooler body. It is now as stable as any water cooler I have ever used. This may have been over paranoia as a parent but a 5 gallon jug of water falling on a young kid would be disastrous.",

The machine is not loud like some of the previous ones we've had. Just your average water dispenser, doesn't look fancy or modern like some of the other ones do. But for this price and quality, you really can't beat it! Water comes or icy cold and super boiling hot (enough to make instant noodles/coffee/tea). Uses you standard water bottles or reusuable water bottles. No storage space under the dispenser. On and off switch is behind the machine. Ready to use out of the box! Delivery was fast and efficient.",

For example, in order to dispense hot water you have to push in a button before the hot water flows. It's a great comfort to know that a small child can't easily get hot water on themselves. The other safety feature is that it comes with a safety clamp that can be attached to the cooler & back wall so that it can't be bumped over. It's an attractive cooler & produces very hot (hot enough for an instant coffee) & also a nice chilled glass of water. Great purchase!",

However, I do not like the build material, which is plastic, it is weak and easily scratched. Also I do not know if the internal water storage inside is plastic or stainless steal, there's nothing that indicates which.
