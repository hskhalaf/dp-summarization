I bought this smaller package to try the product before investing in the bigger purchase. I actually don't like it much. On the bright side it mixes like a dream. The flavor is about standard for soy isolate. On the down side, it foams up really badly in the shaker. Then when I add water to the shaker to rinse it out it foams up again. Then it still feels foamy in the stomach after I drink it. Because of the foam issue, I really didn't like it.",

The label says Distributed by Henderson, NV but the truth is it is sourced in China, no wonder theres a warning not to exceed 30 grams per day and to keep out of reach of children. This is why I always buy organic soy milk and bulksupplements would do well to invest in USDA organic certification if they want to stay ahead of the supplement curve. Personal experience, powder does not blend in a blender and always settles to the bottom like sediment no matter what you mix it with. I hope GMP means no heavy metals, especially from China.

      "text": "I've been looking for a simple, soy-based protein powder since my favorite retailer pulled theirs from the shelves. As a pure vegetarian, I don't like whey or casein. The bitterness and oily consistency of hemp is terrible. I don't digest pea protein well. This leaves me with soy. I put it in my post-workout smoothies and it doesn't overpower the flavors of the other ingredients. It mixes well - very creamy and nice. I haven't tried it \"straight-up\" and likely will never do so. It'd be nice if Bulksupplements sold cacao but I don't see it.",
