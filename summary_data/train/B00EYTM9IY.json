Because of each of their needs takes up so much space, toys are limited to just a few versatile basic ones. Thought it was purchased for the almost 2 yr old, both loved playing with it. Most notably though the almost 2 yr old who loves practicing shapes. It is small and collapsible, making it great to travel with. We used it on the international flights and in the hotel rooms at night to help entertain the kids.",

Or if picked up the shapes fall to the bottom so you can't put the bottom shapes im the holes (picture 2). Causes some toddler frustration.",

An adult needs to sit there and shake the box each time to make room for the next one. Really disappointing product that had so much potential.",

Only downside is that the case is not very deep so pushing the shapes in can be difficult as they don't \"fall\" in and sometimes when you flip the case the shapes will fall out.

It is a surprisingly effective toy despite its simplicity (maybe because of it?).

I am trying to show her to match the shapes, so hopefully she will grasp it soon. This is very durable and the doggie on the zipper is firmly attached. Very well made and I am very happy I bought it.",

Right now they go in but unless you wiggle it a little to work it under the lip of the plastic, the shape pushes against the padded backing and so can technically come right back out.",
