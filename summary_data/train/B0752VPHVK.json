The August website was not explicit in this lack of compatibility when we researched the purchase. Now the product has to be returned. It would be great if August could develop adapters for double-cylinder deadbolts and include them in the kit.",

It was smooth from opening to closing. No matter what adjustments I try to do, the lock would still only turn the deadbolt 1/3.

Here are a few pros and cons: Pros: - Easy to install - Convenient, especially with a doorbell cam - Leaves ability to use your original key - Can manually turn the lock if batteries run out - Integrates with IFTTT - Works great with Google Home Cons: - Slightly bulky Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with this lock package. This is a seamless integration into a smart home. This has been an excellent purchase and I fully recommend for ease, convenience, and safety.",

It has worked perfectly...........perfectly. I did not install the door ajar button as I didn\u2019t feel being single I needed it. It\u2019s a solid product. Still a 5 star!",

Thing is only good for auto-lock on a timer feature. I've sent support multiple emails, and nothing. Their site outage for support is even removed, likely because their product is trash and they know it and won't fix it. Would return but I'm outside the window so I guess I'm stuck with this junk.",

Once i replaced the deadbolt with a key on outside and flip on inside, install was a breeze....

The only suggestion is to make the bridge a bit more powerful, even when the bridge was very close, it took a bit for the lock to find it and pair, other than that everything is great.",

It\u2019s also nice that there is no way to Tell from the exterior that there is a smartlock on the door. The only thing that\u2019s a little weird is the sensor that does on the door frame to track the motion of the dial to Indicate that it\u2019s locked or unlocked. It\u2019s a little weird having it stil out like It does. Other than that it\u2019s perfect!",

      "title": "Great smart lock! Not so great Alexa integration",
      "text": "We ordered this lock last summer because we found ourselves locking each other out from time to time as well as forgetting keys in the house when going out. This was super easy to install and use via the mobile app, however the Alexa integration is poor and isn\u2019t straightforward like most other IOT devices. On the other bright side it updates itself with the latest software releases without any interaction from us. Overall though, I am very please with this purchase.",
