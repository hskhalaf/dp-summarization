I love them and feel I am in much better health with these in my system! Get them, and don't do the GNC Men's vitamins. They basically give you very expensive urine as most of the vitamins aren't processed and go to waste. Whole Food vitamins are amazing!",

It has highly absorbable ingredients; it doesn\u2019t make your urine neon colored like some multis do. I really appreciate that it is food based and has additional nutrients to address the needs of men over 40. The pills are relatively small for the amount of nutrients packed in per pill. I take one in the morning and one at night with meals. I\u2019m generally healthy and have no nutrient deficiencies that I\u2019m aware of so I take these for insurance rather than an energy burst. They suit my needs...I recommend them for anyone with similar purpose.",
