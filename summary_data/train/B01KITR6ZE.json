Phoebe has been diligently trying to chew it apart for the last hour and has gotten nowhere. A ball that may last more than a week, at last! The only drawback for me is that stuff sticks to the wet ball and doesn't brush off very well. A damp rag takes care of it, just really nasty while playing.",
