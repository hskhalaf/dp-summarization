The contrasting colors and repeating designs, the very thing that I thought would be helpful for her, kept her from being able to work this puzzle. It would probably be excellent for someone not overwhelmed by the 'business' of the design.",

I had to do it with her because she could not understand how to organize the edge pieces and how to look for pieces that had the right color on them for an adjoining piece. But that's her. Maybe something other than the Beatles for photos. Music from 40's/50's would have been better. Overall, it is a good puzzle. I have found that the horizontal puzzles are easier than ones that are vertical. She can see the horizontal puzzles better and she has difficulty reaching to the top of this vertical puzzle since the pieces are so big.",
