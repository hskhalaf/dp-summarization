I typically buy the blue (navy) version (and will now always do so going forward), and the sizing is always consistent and as expected - and as such I rate the navy version with 5 stars. As for the black version... you're on your own with guessing the size that will fit you. Good luck with that.",

Depending upon brand, sometimes small fits great and sometimes it is tight. For this product, for the top/chest, the info on the Amazon product page matches the box, medium is 38-40\u201d. The shirt is a bit big and I probably would be happier in small (34-36\u201d).",

However, I just felt they were too loose on the groin area, but other than that they are definitely warm. I got three pairs and used them in Colorado while it snowed. I think the weather was btwn 0 and -6 degrees at night and I was happily warm.",

I bought him a pair 2 years ago to wear under pants when its really cold out, but he thought they were so comfortable that he began living in them round the clock while at home.(he's retired). When I saw these I was looking for a softer material than what he already had and these fit the bill nicely! I got a pair in Navy and one in Blk and he's been wearing them everyday(makes me wish I hadn't found them in the first place!\"). They wash up well, haven't shrunk or stretched out or lost color.

Anyways I'll be returning these. Not sure if I want a bigger size or a different style. These are an odd fit as stated in other reviews.",

The material doesn't have the pebbly weave other long johns I wear in winter have. This is a plus since the texture of those others tend to cause areas of itching. I would buy this garment again.",

As noted in someone else's review, they don't fit as snugly as briefs, so unless you're more of a boxers fan don't be surprised if you're more comfortable with a pair of briefs as an under layer (I am).
