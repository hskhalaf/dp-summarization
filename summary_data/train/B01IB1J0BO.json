Just look at the ingredients and analysis: 38% protein, 18% fat, 90% of protein comes from actual meat and not peas. If there\u2019s one thing I know my pup loves, it\u2019s meat. Tip: if you buy in bulk, more than 5 lbs bags, learn how to properly store kibble because they do go stale. Victor does not come in resealable bags so please store in a proper airtight container.",
