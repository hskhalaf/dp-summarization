However, it didn't fit my whippet mix (size of Italian greyhound) - the size was right, but the fit was wrong. The chest area was good if a bit short, but the back was too big and kept sliding over his tail and down his legs. For dogs that are normal proportion and don't have the bulky chest and thin backend, it's probably great and I would have kept it if my other dog of a different breed was the same size.",

After the bandages came off, hair started growing in and the incision scab was drying. This resulted in her trying to \"scratch an itch\" so to speak. I needed something that fit loosely and was comfortable, while at the same time covered the incision site so she couldn't worry it. In addition to a soft collar, these pjs did the trick. I got the small as she measured into a small and it did fit nicely. Soft and cute. I would, and did, order another product from this company.",
