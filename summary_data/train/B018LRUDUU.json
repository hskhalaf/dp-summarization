Will draw water down to about 1/8 inch of water or less but with water sensor it only pumps down to about a 1/4 inch but its doesn't matter since I have the leak contained.",

The major flaw with this pump is the length of the power cord. It is short compared to every other sump pump I have and this is dangerous. Apparently, that is where they cut costs. I married the cord to a similar extension cord and water proofed the connection, creating a longer cord. Not ideal, and probably cost me more than paying a little more for a sump pump with a proper length power cable.",

      "text": "It's the best pump in the market. Had many others and none compare. Having drain hose come out the side is huge as many others go from the top. Even if used on top base of unit makes it so the unit does not fall which happened all the time with the others. I use it for my pool cover and it sucks the water dry even being on a pitch. Great price as well. I would recommend to anyone",
