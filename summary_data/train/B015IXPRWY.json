The dust pan is quite large and the broom is much heftier than I was used to. The clip that allows you to attach the broom to the dust pan is very tight. You really have to muscle the broom away from it to detach it. Hope fully in time it will loosen up. The dust pan seems to make good level contact with the floor to seep dust into it.",

The broom does a good job sweeping. And it does remain standing up once I'm done with it without flopping over. Doesn't hurt that it's a pretty blue. So a good purchase.",

Since the handle of the dustpan folds forward, ostensibly to collapse for more convenient storage, you can't push down on the handle to really force the lip of the pan to sit flush with the floor. The \"feature\" of collapsibility actually makes the whole dustpan feel flimsy; without it, I might keep the dustpan and buy a better broom. I did like that the dustpan was rather large, so I will probably use this to sweep up leaves outside or something.",
