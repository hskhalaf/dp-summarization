I run at home on my treadmill, and it's awesome running in these without other clothing. Does anyone know of shorts made just like these underwear?",

I started running earlier this year in my daily cotton boxers and on longer runs I would have issues with chafing. Having tried cotton boxer briefs in the past, they would ride up and just weren't very comfortable, I was reluctant to buy these especially for $10/pair. But I'm glad I did. They don't ride up at all, breathe great, wick away sweat and best of all no chafing!",

I have found the Under Armour Boxer Jock are the best underwear I have ever owned. I purchased these Adidas boxers as a less expensive replacement. They do not compare to the Under Armour boxers. They cost half the price, but for me were a total waste of money. At any rate, they are just not a comfortable pair of underwear.",

      "text": "These are great, and more importantly a great deal. I've tried these as well as UnderArmor's BoxerJock version. I like UA's a little bit better. They just feel ever so slightly more comfortable, but only slightly. And they of course have the pee hole which makes going to the bathroom easier. HOWEVER, whereas a UA two pack is $35, the Adidas two pack is usually $20. That's a huge difference in price for the UA ones only being slightly better. If you only need one or two boxers like this maybe go with UA. If you want to wear them all of the time go with these as the savings will be considerable!",

I am pretty sure it\u2019s because my muscle mass increased quickly after taking. That stuff is potent. My quads gained a lot of mass so I had to switch to the Adidas boxer brief. These don\u2019t have the tight band around my thigh so the fit is much more comfortable. I\u2019ve since bought another 6 pairs. Definitely recommend these.",

I have Champion and Under-Armor boxer-briefs that are several years old and they are still fine but these didn't even make it a year before they started to fall apart. Initial quality is great, but the longevity on these is garbage so I can't recommend them.",

I bought two packs, washed them, and then tried them on...These are not comfortable across the man bits...Maybe I have larger than average thighs from 10 years of Crossfit, but these are so tight across the groin that I find them unbearable. Lesson learned, don't wash the second pack until you've tried on the first. Athletes beware!",
