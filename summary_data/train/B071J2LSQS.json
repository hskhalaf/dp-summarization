This is perfect if you need a large batch of ice, quickly. You have to pour water into the machine, you can't hook it up to a water line. It's not very loud either.

It does make the first batch of ice in 9 or ten minutes but that first batch is really thin sad looking ice. Barely suitable to cool down a 10oz drink. After that and the interior cools down, it routinely makes ice every 9 minutes or so appropriate for one 10 to 12 oz drink unless you want a full cup of ice and you can have that about every 20 minutes. We use ours at least 5 times a week and it runs constantly on the weekends. I would not hesitate to recommend this product.",

I simply shake the basket, dump the ice in a gallon size ziplock, and throw it into the freezer. Every time I empty the bin into the baggie, I whack the bag on the counter to break the ice up, and voila, no ice chunks. This works like a charm. Lots of ice for my family get togethers! Love it!",

I bought it because we are living in an RV full-time and this has been one of the best investments I have made! The only advice I would give is once you have finished making ice.....DO NOT LEAVE ICE MAKER MOIST. PAT DRY WITH PAPER TOWELS AND THEN AIR DRY WITH THE LID OPEN UNTIL COMPLETELY DRY. If you leave any moisture, you will grow mold! I make ice and pack it into quart size bags and store in freezer. A light tap will break ice apart when you are ready to use. Simple!!!!!",

Cleaning is a challenge because the interior parts are small and oddly shaped. I never felt like we could get it clean. My sister had a machine that stores the ice and mold is not a problem. It's quite a bit more expensive but, having tried the cheap route, I now realize it's worth the price.",

I'll update you when the issue is resolved. Right now I'd say buy ice. Ignore the following. As advertised. Makes ice quickly, quietly. We use distilled water for flavor and to avoid mineral build up. We have it in our travel trailer. It'll pay for itself in one season as opposed to going to town to buy ice.",

Seems a lot of work, but got into a rhythm doing this every other day; enough to keep 6 people happy with ice on hot days.",

Runs very quietly, the only sound I hear is when the ice drops into the tray. Takes up a bit of counter space but frees up freezer space, which I need more than counter space.

I can't imagine using this for a gathering real time, I would make batches of ice ahead and freeze, for future use.
