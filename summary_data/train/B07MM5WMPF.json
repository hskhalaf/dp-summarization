Get the HR version it's only a bit more but the heart-rate tracking adds a lot more data including REM in sleep stages and graphs showing which \"zone\" you're in when walking/exercising.

Accuracy seems to be about the same as the Altar. But the charging lead is a joke! It's far too short and is supposed to be held in contact magnetically, but the magnet is far too weak to be reliable. So charging needs improvement. This means you will need to add another \u00a35+ to the cost for a longer lead. Aesthetically, it's much better than the Alta.

Edit 2: contacted the sellers and they were extremely helpful sending me a replacement after checking that it was indeed defective. Great customer service Pre problem: It's comfortable to wear, the app is easy to use and it's pretty useful. The Inspire lacks heart monitor though unlike the hr so the sleep tracking is a little confusing tracking restlessness by movement detected.",

Well worth the money and quite motivational. Not being technical I do need help from my husband to understand things, but the feedback on my laptop is as useful (or not) depending if I want to use it. The best part I feel is the sleep record. I don't use all of the features as I only use what I am interested in. The only thing I have a slight issue with is the charging part as it is easy to knock and disconnect. A brilliant invention though.",

Like all such devices it suffers a little from mistaking movement that isn't walking for steps, but the quality of the hardware is good. The app is one of the better ones. The battery life is great. The more you invest in the device and the app regarding interaction, the more you will get out of it. Plenty of branded and after market straps available too to customize the look. Judging by other friends purchases this is probably the best in class at this price point. On balance I would happily recommend it.",

As the purpose of buying was to track heartbeats,steps etc whilst hiking, it does not really reach expectations. Sync to the app is good, data viewed there helpful, but live data problematic due to poor dial visibility. I saw a fellow hiker had one, and she was struggling to read it too.",

When I cut the grass it recorded it as exercise, I work in the garden, weeding, digging, trimming hedges it doesn't record it. Makes me drink more water tho' and I do move more trying to keep my steps up and beat yesterdays total! I would buy it again.",

Other than that, would probably recommend, but if asked to choose between this watch and another, more accurate, more easy to use one, I'd probably choose the other one.",
