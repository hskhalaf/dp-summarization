I\u2019m satisfied with this order and totally recommend it to anyone looking for a good and practical cleaning toy set for kids. Not only toys but also real tools to use daily!

Plus the broom keeps falling off of the handle. Other than that, she likes it. The dust pan is cute but she doesn't use it much. The mop is too short but she has used it on occasion but because she has to bend over so far, it's not her favorite. The bucket is really neat and the spray bottle just gets used in the pool but the duster is the best thing. It actually works really well and she enjoys cleaning together.",

He shared with his friends, and it was adorable to watch the kids cleaning up after the party. These toys are well-made and realistic so the kids feel like they have the real deal.",

The dustpan and hand broom will be easy to take over soon. Lol! He watched me as I\u2019d mop, back and forth, so this was an easy pick.

      "text": "This cleaning kit is exactly what I needed! My daughter is 3 and always wants to help me. She really needed cleaning tools that were her own size because she ends up banging my broom and mop into everything. She is thrilled with this kit and has been cleaning everything since it arrived. My favorite feature is that all of the tools are fully functional, even the little spray bottle. The broom is tall enough that it should be usable for a few years (she\u2019s 3\u20191\u201d and it comes up to about shoulder height on her now). And the mop handle is adjustable. I\u2019m glad I chose this kit, very satisfied!",

The \"play\" swiffer actually mops VERY well and the cloths are washable... the broom, dust cloths, whisk broom and even the collapsible bucket are perfect for the space conservative environment of an RV.

      "text": "I bought this for our 16 month old daughter. She LOVES it! Plays with it every day. Our friends were skeptical - cleaning products for kids??? But she really enjoys it and they look and perform like real cleaning tools. It's saved my broom from being attacked by her to play with now that she has her own little broom. Pleased on quality and number of tools. Like others said the wet floor sign is cardboard - no matter, we don't even play with it - too many other things to play with. She loves the spray bottle.",

My only issue is the wet floor sign, it is a cheesy cardboard thing that he will destroy in seconds. I really think it would be best to make a plastic one or just simply remove the cardboard one and don't include one at all. It really cheapens the overall product the way it is now.",
