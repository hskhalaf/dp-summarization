      "verdict": "Flourishing throughout the years, the Keds Triumph Nylon reinstills its glory days by remaking the classic Keds Triumph canvas shoe into a nylon counterpart which enhances comfort and convenience. Don't be fooled by its minimal form as it can pack quite a punch regarding styling and fashion at an affordable price.Adorable and vibrant, the sneaker is an easy option for clothing as it matches most clothing combinations in a wide variety of forms. Along with other Keds sneakers, it also bears the same affordable price range.",
      "pros": [
        "Along with the imprinted trademark of other Keds sneakers, the Triumph Nylon is also super easy to clean by just throwing in the washer",
        "Besides that, users can wipe the dirt or grime off the shoe",
        "The sneaker comes in two sets of laces for an added variety in style",
        "According to some, the sneaker fits their foot size perfectly",
        "The conformity and design of the sneaker conveniently match any clothing",
        "The Keds Triumph Nylon also has a small form that is convenient enough to fit suitcases while traveling",
        "Many users found the sneaker very comfortable which can be worn for long extensive walks or by standing all day",
        "Some wearers continuously receive compliments while wearing them",
        "A handful of reviewers mentioned that the colorways of the sneaker are good",
        "According to a couple of wearers, the form and design of the Triumph are cute and adorable",
        "The sneaker is affordable"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "According to one user, the nylon upper does not stretch as much as the canvas which would hurt the sides of the feet and toes",
        "The sneaker would sometimes run small and narrow for those with wide feet",
        "Although the sneaker is best to be worn with no-show socks, the low-lying collar would tend to pull the socks inward and rub against the Achilles heel which would sometimes cause blisters"

I ordered a 6.5 as I was worried the 6 would be too small. I totally could have gotten away with the 6, but I'd rather not deal with exchanging so I'll make due with this size. I'll be ordering more styles for sure.",

Best shoe I've purchased in a while. And, quick shipping!",
