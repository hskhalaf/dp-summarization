You're constantly fumbling around with this piece of garbage, turning all the lights in your house off and on, disturbing people in other rooms. I can't believe I spent $90 on this.

This really should be a prototype for future lighting. Put your switches where YOU want them, not where you can cut a hole in the wall. This product however needs some more functionality. The buttons should be able to CYCLE two scenes each, at least. The big button should be a configurable as a toggle for on and off. Also, as a pioneering channel on the IFTTT service, you should be able to use the Tap as a IFTTT trigger. Still, a high 4-star review with room for improvement.",
