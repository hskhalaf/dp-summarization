I've only has it for about a month so I can't comment on the durability, but as to the performance for the price, it has exceeded my expectations.

We have a dog and seven cats, a vacuum that doesn\u2019t clog and is easy to clean is a must. This inexpensive little gem has outperformed a $300 Bissel and two Shark vacuums, all that were supposed to be perfect for pets. Save your money, I love this Eureka so much I bought a second one- one for each floor of the house. (I have osteoarthritis in my spine, it was worth it.) It doesn\u2019t come with a million attachments I\u2019ll never use, it does not clog, it\u2019s easy to empty and the filter is washable.",

I used the main part of the vacuum to vacuum up dirt on a hard wood floor and it pushed it every where and made a bigger mess then before I started. I can't believe Eureka put their name on this.

The price makes up for the flimsy construction, but it makes no sense that such a good vacuum is such a piece of crap. So in my opinion, 5 plus stars for performance, 2 stars for quality-the designers at Eureka should really rethink this.",

My main complaint with this vacuum is that it sounds like a freight train! It\u2019s SO loud!! I took one star away for it being super loud and one for it not being good for stairs due to the short accessory hose.",
