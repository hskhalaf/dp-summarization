I'm a first time mom so I'm nervous about everything, but I felt like he was very secure floating in this. The sun shade is nice too to help keep baby out of the direct sunlight. It was easy to blow up also. I would highly recommend this if you have a little one going to the pool.",

We call it the \u201cring of zen\u201d because so many times my son would just chill in it for extended periods of time without crying and be very content. The mesh material is soft on this legs. The floating ring part is great for holding small toys for entertaining him. You need to stay with your baby while in this for safety.",

We were able to use it at Grandma and Grandpa's house deflate and put back into the case, which means we only need to buy one for the summer and can take it easily with us for each outing. Highly recommend watching the YouTube video by Swimways demonstrating folding, it took three viewings but I now have the folding technique mastered. Would definitely buy again.",

My 2 year old was able to lean forward to splash and then sit back to keep the sun from his face. To inflate it took some time as it was awkward to position the mouth. The fold up is easy once you get all the air out, no residual air left or it won't fold correctly. Glad to have this and is good quality, I don't forsee it having holes or leakage problems as with other floats.",

Contacted the manufacturer and they were willing to replace it but it would not arrive on time for my grandson to use it so they substituted a Spring Float for an adult (me) which arrived today. I love it!!! I can sit in it without getting my hair wet - Its a win! Great customer service!",

He felt like it was restricting his movements and play time. Maybe it is because he likes splashing so much and there wasn't much space to do so? As far as safety I'd give it a good rating, but I dont think it's a good play toy/floaty because of the design that I believe is meant for safety. Overall I think this is meant for a younger baby and definately wouldn't get it for a baby older than 10 mo.",
