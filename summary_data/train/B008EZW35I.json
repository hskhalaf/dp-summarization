After a couple of months the gray bags began separating at the seams and progressively got worse. In October they finally got to the point the seam was about to burst. I reached out to the seller and explained what happened and they sent a new set of bags without hesitation. The new bags are the expected heavier material so I doubt there will be any issue. Very impressed with the seller. ** Update ** Over a year later and the replacement bags have held up very well and we use them a lot.",
