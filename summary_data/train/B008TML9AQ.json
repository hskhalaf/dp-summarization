It was important to me to follow the AAP recommendation to have our baby sleep flat on his back, rather than in a rock n play or swing like a lot of our friends have done. The all-mesh sides make a huge difference, there are times when he wiggles himself to the edge of the mattress but because he can still get plenty of air no matter where he is in the cradle I feel comfortable keeping him in it. Not cheap, but in this case you get what you pay for.",

This was essential in the middle of the night to have just a gentle tap on the side from me to go back to sleep, mesh all around which in my opinion should be the law, and looks so stylish.

      "text": "I feel like I got duped, and I'm not happy about it. I was willing to spend the extra money for this bassinet based on its design and the fact that unlike 99.9% of baby items, it was made in Europe. I got it, and set it up, and loved it. Today, I wanted to wash the textile portion to prepare for baby's arrival next week, and upon disassembling it, found the 'textiles made in China' tag. That is false advertising, and not what I wanted to spend my money on. So disappointed in this, and Baby Bjorn for falsely representing their product.",

      "text": "I purchased this bassinet trusting the reputation of Baby Bjorn. When I opened the bassinet and attempted to put it together, I noticed the mattress pad is 100% polyurethane foam which has been identified as containing toxic substances. Baby Bjorn states their products do not contain flame retardants; however there are other chemicals present in the foam. Also, the board beneath the mattress is MDF board which contains formaldehyde. I want the safest option for my baby so I returned this item.",

We wish we could return it, especially since we spent so much on it, but with Amazon's return policy of 90 days we can't. I would not buy it until after baby is born so you are able to return it if they don't like it. It also doesn't \"rock\" as advertised.",
