Returned the phone because after a day, not even connected to a carrier, it stopped working, wouldn't respond to touch, buttons, or plugging in. Unable to figure out why. Very frustrating since I had paid extra for expedited shipping, sim card didn't fit initially (why I still hadn't connected it to carrier), and still ended up purchasing a different phone, waiting for shipping, and the time it takes to get my returned money from Amazon.",
