      "verdict": "People are generally happy with the Merrell Nova Rainbow and what it has to offer. This trail running shoe is deemed efficient and versatile, especially when handling daily tasks. The colorful facade has been highlighted as the element that elevates the performance-to-fashion capacity of the design. On the other hand, the flimsy collar hug and some instances of the upper fabrics ripping apart make up the negative points.Enthusiasts of neutral running shoes that are for the off-road paths are the target market of the Merrell Nova Rainbow.",
      "pros": [
        "The flexibility of the Merrell Nova Rainbow\u2019s construction allows it to function well in a variety of activities, according to several testers",
        "Those who have tested this running shoe are happy with the versatility of its lightweight structure",
        "The rainbow color scheme is welcomed because it is eye-catching and able to make the product appealing as a casual sneaker",
        "A handful of consumers have exclaimed their appreciation for the responsive midsole unit of this Merrell trail running shoe",
        "The aggressive lug configuration is lauded for having flat ends that still encourage steady steps on even planes",
        "Various testers believe that the forefoot section has a roomy construction that permits the natural splaying of the toes"

      "cons": [
        "The minimal ankle support is lamented by some runners who desire a bit more security from the collar",
        "A few reviews tackle the upper unit and its apparently quick-to-rip nature"

      "text": "I made a big mistake, blisters on the first light (1 mile) run ... I know, I should have worn it before, just to see how it behaves. If you are not blessed with completely standardised feet better to keep away from these otherwise fine and cheap trail running shoes. Trail means you need more support, but running in a vice on your heels? Not my kind of fun to be honest. The heel support bit doesn't come up to all the way in the back, finishes abruptly, that was the source of the blisters for me. Also, wet socks from morning dew. I'll have to try some treatment before complaining more.",

The one major drawback is that they are useless in damp conditions! Not only are they not in the slightest bit waterproof they slip like crazy on damp surfaces. Now I've had Vibrim soles before and I don't remember any such problems but if you intending walking on anything even resembling damp you'r toes will be slipping back the whole time! Putting them away till the summer... When I'm sure they will be great.... hopefully.",
