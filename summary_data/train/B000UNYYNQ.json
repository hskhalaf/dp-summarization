Now, Am Std says bad orange peel is up to their Americast division\u2019s standards, although they advertise \u201csmooth glossy finish\u201d. My 23 year-old Americast tub at home still has a nice, smooth glossy finish\u201d, but Am Std\u2019s actual standards have apparently gone down the drain. Don\u2019t buy if you expect a finish resembling porcelain, it\u2019s worse than actual orange peel.",

He preferred to put together his own overflow and drain which looks and works well. The deeper tub adds a little \"something\" extra to the average bathroom. Very happy both with Amazon customer service and with the product. Because the tub is deep, consider installing a grab bar/safety bar to get in and out. Useful even for folks who are not elderly or infirm.",

      "text": "Nice tub with good size. seems to be well constructed and both sturdy and light at the same time. It was easier to install since it was on the lighter side, I could actually do it myself. Install is simple, you hang a stringer 2x4 up and set it in. After install is seemed very sturdy, not cast iron but not flimsy either. I didn't seem hard to clean or easily scratched but to be honest it was in the guest bath so it didn't get used much and then I sold the house. I would say I was happy with the purchase for ease of installation, construction, and looks.",

I would have filed for a return, but considreding the item was already installed we worked the tile around the defects. Otherwise the tub is beautiful.",
