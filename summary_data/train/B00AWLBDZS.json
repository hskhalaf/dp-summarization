I would buy this one again. I know that if it is like our last Keurig it will only last a couple of years, but the features are so much better that unless others improve, I will buy another one.",

I'm totally thrilled with this unit. It brews in a fraction of the time of my old unit, has a bunch of nice power saving features, and has some features like cup size that I sorely missed in the old one. I can't complain, I'm one happy buyer.",

I was looking into smaller one cup coffee makers and came across the reusable coffee K-cups and was so excited. To have the ease, simplicity, and options that Keurig offers with my favorite coffee?

Second, you can choose the amount of water you will be brewing, allowing larger and weaker coffee, or smaller and stronger coffee. Ideal for houses with different strength preferences. Third, and in my opinion the best feature, is the almost instant brewing after the initial warm up. With automatic on and off time set every day, I no longer ever have to wait to brew. If it breaks tomorrow, the next one will be ordered the same day.",

We don't waste any coffee and we were previously throwing away 1/2 of our pots. The flavor is amazing, the machine is fast. Hope this machine lasts for years because we know it will get lots of use.",
