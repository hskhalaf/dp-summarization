This piece of climbing gear wins the approval of buyers, thanks to its lightweight construction, sufficient support for edging, and sensitivity.However, it is not able to win the hearts of everyone because of its flimsy Velcro straps. All in all, those who can manage to get past its issues may find a good Tenaya climbing shoe in the Oasi because of its send-worthy qualities.",

These shoes are incredible for steep climbing - They are down-turned and aggressive, though soft enough that you can smear. My favorite thing about them, though is how well they fit the heel. They are like a glove and I can heel hook just about anything both bouldering and route climbing. THESE ARE AWESOME!!",

Also, the heel in this shoe does not gape, fits nicely, making heel hooking feel solid. I would highly recommend this shoe!",

Very soft. I was able to climb longer, and harder with these amazing shoes on. I sent my project that day! Deffently get these shoes.",
