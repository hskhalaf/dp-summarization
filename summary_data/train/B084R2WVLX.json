I am using these mainly in the office because I have a lot of annoying colleagues :)) and these headphones doing there job perfectly. Because of less bass and no F.T.F. comparing with previous Monitor version I am giving 4 stars out of 5.",

It says hold the button for 5 seconds and then it will be visible on the Bluetooth device. This is wrong. You have to hold the button in until the light goes a deep blue colour, not white. This takes about 20 seconds of holding the button! I had to go through to the support on the Marshall site but they were great and even commented that the booklet needs updating!! Great headphones. Sound is brilliant. Buy them",

Simple to use and are controlled form your iPod/phone/iPad etc, and found them easy to pair. I would highly recommend the headphones to others, and when comparing them to more expensive brands the sound quality is in no way compromised by the cheaper price.",

And you can answer the call. The sound quality is great. Nice natural sound. I was totally amazed, and made my family try on. They are all amazed.
