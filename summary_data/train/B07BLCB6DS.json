      "text": "I searched everywhere for a 2 wheeled, VERY light weight carry on bag and this fit the bill. It seemed far too small when I first unpacked the box, however, I needed something that met the international carry-on requirements. I've now used the bag on a few trips and have been completely satisfied with the smooth rolling wheels and can fit more than enough for 10 days into the single large compartment. Since it doesn't have all the extra metal/structural components that add weight and create a sturdier bag, it remains to be seen how long this will last, but so far, I'm 100% pleased. Highly recommend this bag.",

Pros - super lightweight and sturdy A zippered area for putting dress shirts inside the top cover portion Quick grab area for passports and wallet Smooth ride What I'd fix - Still think this needs another handle - at the bottom (only one on top and on side) It narrows toward the top. Not sure but this seems smaller than my previous one",

Never had an issue with its size in terms of it being allowed as a carry on. Definitely recommend it.",

This suitcase has suited me well (pun intended, so sorry) through two international trips and many cobblestones. Roomy enough to hold enough clothing for a two-week trip, yet small enough to get through international check-ins without issue. The only downside is the wheels - I wish I'd splurged for four-way wheels, but this option is still sturdy, well-sized and lightweight. Very content with my purchase.",
