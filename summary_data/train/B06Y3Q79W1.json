I just got tired of spending $40+ every 18 months to buy a new coffee maker so I decided to try and find something with replaceable parts. I found this, read millions of reviews, bought it grudgingly, and then watched in fascination as the water went through the middle tube thing and brewed my first pot of Moccamaster coffe. Then this crazy thing happened...my coffee was good. REALLY good. Is it the placebo effect of spending this much money on a coffee maker? I don't know and I don't care. Just get in my belly.",

However, several times now it has stopped dripping into the carafe and the water and coffee grinds are stuck to the filter cup, and it overflows and creates a huge huge mess. I've stopped using it and gone back to another brand. This is not a coffee maker that you expose to everyday use.",

The best part about it is the toggle on/off switch that allows me to use a smart plug to turn it on from my phone.

The machine's operation is straightforward; however, one must take care not to put to much coffee in the filter/basket. Overfilling the filter/basket with coffee will likely result in a messy and inconvenient overflow. We use about 4/5 of a cup and have no issues. We use thefilters. Possibly the greatest thing about the machine is the quality of the coffee that it produces; it's easily the best coffee I've ever gotten out of a machine at home.",

There is also talk about the perfect brewing temperature (more hype). If you like hot coffee, it's a disappointment! The company talks about exact measures of coffee and water. In reality, it's how strong you like it! Quality is good. But plastic is plastic and glass is glass, just like all the rest. Bottom line: Not worth the money it costs.",
