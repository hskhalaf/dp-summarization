The band is plenty thick and wide to absorb and distribute the force of the weighted chain evenly around your body. It is a little stiff out of the box, but better that than too loose. The chain is strong, should fit through most any weight plate you hit, etc. Anyways, I'm revieweing a dip belt, so there's only so much to analyze. Really, what set this belt apart from the competition for me was 1) the ridiculous blue camo, and 2) the frikkin' awesome flexing moose. Usually I hate logos or brands on my stuff but this moose is just pure genius plain and simple.",

Beyond that, shear forces that cause any twisting of the D-rings will eventually tear the weak binding threads. It needs to be riveted.",
