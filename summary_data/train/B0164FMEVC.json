It's very firm, but comfortable, and looks decent. Reached out to amazon about the damage. They quickly sent a replacement (2 days), scheduled a pick-up (next-day) after I received the new one. After having it a few days, I can say it's well worth the price. But you get what you pay for, it does get quite uncomfortable after a long movie, for example.",

      "text": "This couch is super sexy and modular, but you can feel the inner springs every time you sit on it. For reference I weigh 170lbs. Excellent for a short sit in the seated position but lacks comfort when trying to lounge or layout. Folds into a full bed area but you will feel every board and metal support in it while laying on it. Very noisy clunks when changing the seat positions. I add a mattress topper to it when laying it down and that works well.",

I used 2 pieces and it worked quite well - I don't know that anyone would notice if they didn't know about it. It just kinda sucked to have to do. An extra $30 for a mostly okay couch. :P",

Even worse, as you can see, it has completely started collapsing in the middle and there's no way to fix it.
