Leave your reeds soaking and don't flip them until you're having guests (or whatever you need it for). That way your oil should last longer.",

      "text": "I don't dislike the scent, but it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. Its hard to describe the smell as it has a strong alcohol scent that doesn't seem too natural as it smells more like a perfume than a flower smell. Only had it a few days, so can't comment on longevity just yet. Everyone has different preferences on what they like, so I would say UT's a 50/50 chance if you will like the scent.",
