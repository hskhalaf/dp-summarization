The only place I've gotten a bite so far while using it was my face because I neglected to apply the lotion there. I wish Skin so soft came in gallon jugs.",

Essentially it is two products in one and it works. It is mostly water resistant and you should reapply it if you or your child goes swimming but it really repels bugs, and knats and keeps you from getting sunburnt. As far as I know, Avon is the only cosmetic company with such a product. Kind of pricey , but worth every penny. A southern mainstay , helps the nasty summer be a little less nasty....",
