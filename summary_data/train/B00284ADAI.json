I have never had an issue with it. it is beat up, scared and scratched. it's been my trustworthy adventure buddy for so long I had forgot when I purchased it. if I lost this watch, I would replace it with the same model without hesitation.",

It drains the battery pretty fast. I had it on and didn't even know it so the light turns on every time the watch is at a certain angle....great feature but it will die extremely fast if you don't get a ton of sunlight.

I have other watches for other occasions, but for outdoor activities or travel, this is my GO-TO! It\u2019s one of the best choices in tactical timepieces.

This is another classic Casio that's been around forever, it's just a good looking watch that can get abused and still function. Overall if you like G-Shocks and want a lower priced yet solid watch, consider this watch or any of Casio's other lower cost G-Shocks. They're all just as durable and built with topnotch materials.",

I got it for Christmas, and I liked it so much that I bought it for my brother in law for his birthday. 2 Year Review: I love this watch, I wear it for all of my outdoor activities. I wear it very often. I've never had to replace the batteries, the band is still in perfect shape. I've replaced nothing on this. The one I bought for my brother is exactly the same. He has worn it every day since he got it. We are both outdoorsy and the go people. Buy this!",

I was wearing the watch, sitting near a window (North facing). I like to take this watch on vacations, since the world time makes it easy to switch back and forth to local time.",

I turned the chimes off and kept it on battery save. It took a while for a sunny day to arrive, but one sunny day was all it took to get it up to high. Since then, I give it a hour of sun here and there, but otherwise it charges with lights at work and stays on high.",
