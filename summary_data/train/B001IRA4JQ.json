      "title": "This Waring Commerical deep fryer is fabulous",
      "text": "I was extremely satisfied with the superb performance of this deep fryer. I was especially impressed that it maintained the temperature of the oil while I fried several batches of chicken. Since the oil neither popped nor splattered, I didn't worry about burning myself while I either added food or raised and lowered the basket. (I used the 2-lb. steel wire basket that's available as an accessory.) This deep fryer turned out non-greasy, crisp fried chicken and french fries. I'm a home cook. I bought this deep fryer to use when I entertain guests. It's the best small appliance that I've ever purchased, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to prepare perfect fried foods.",

Comes with two small baskets and no choice to select the single basket. Single basked costs over $100 which is outrageous. Not a true Commercial fryer. Very flimsy built fake.",
