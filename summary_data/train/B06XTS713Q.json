I found that it fades quickly and it's too terribly overpowering, but the first time you put it on, it's kind of a bizarre experience. The products themselves are great! My skin is SO soft and noticeably firmer with fewer lines after only a week. I'm 26 and in the \"Preserve! Preserve! Preserve!\" phase of skincare and this stuff has been working really well for me so far. My only complaint is that it does make my face a bit oilier than usual. I wear both these products with my usual aveeno cc cream on top, so it might just be too much moisture for one face!",

The only problem is that I have become completely addicted to the Drunk Elephant line now, and have expanded to also buy Babyfacial and Protini. My skin loves me, but my wallet is still adjusting :)",

The Hydration serum is decent but for the price, there are other better and more affordable options- in my opinion. I didn't notice anything that would make these products stand out, which is disappointing because I have heard so many great things!",

The vitamin c serum had a weird smell though that was off-putting but did slowly fade my acne scars over time.",

The day/orange one also smells horrible, like expired tootsie rolls and it's absolutely disgusting. Guess I can't expect much size out of a extremely expensive (for no reason) brand. This kit should only be $7-10 considering the size and smell. Definitely not buying again nor would I recommend it.",

The B hydra serum is just ok but I would never purchase in the regular size. I\u2019m sorry drunk elephant but this is just mediocre vitamin c serum that\u2019s hella overpriced.

When formulating the products, they focus on pH levels and safety and always making sure that the active ingredients are at efficacious levels. This is the Drunk Elephant difference.\n\n TIME TO WAKE UP\nUp your daytime routine with this dynamic duo! Firm and brighten your skin with C-Firma Day Serum and lock in hydration to nourish your fresh face with B-Hydra, leaving you with a youthful glow. \n\n - C-Firma Day Serum\n- B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Gel \n\n NO FRAGRANCE\nAfter carefully balancing the best ingredients available, Drunk Elephant doesn\u2019t have to add anything to mask their natural scents. When you smell their products, you will likely detect nothing but a glycerin base with slight hints of Marula oil, Zinc Oxide, Thermal Mud, Fruit Enzymes, and Vitamins for a refreshing and reassuring scent. \n\n BREAK THE CYCLE\nDrunk Elephant\u2019s formulations are balanced and optimized to work with the physiological processes of the skin to make harsh ingredient indulgences less necessary, less often. With the help of Drunk Elephant, you will finally be able to give your skin a clean break. \n\n MADE IN THE USA\nDrunk Elephant doesn\u2019t take shortcuts or compromise ingredients to save money. They are hands-on and will stay true to their ethos. Their products are designed, tested and made in the United States.
