The decanter feels like a Christmas ornament and the topper is an extremely lightweight plastic. I was planning on gifting this to my boss and checked it out when I got it. At first all seemed well, until I put the topper in the bottle. The plastic \"seal\" ripped off the topper on the first use and everything is very flimsy and cheaply mass-produced. Do not expect a quality product.",

Glasses are nice and thick. ... Beautiful! 3. The globe/ decanter seems very fragile and a bit thin. 4. The stopper is a very yellow gold. Looks cheap to me. LQ material. Kinda kills the look. If you're going to go gold, to it right or opt for a sliver type finish. Again though, it was a great gift and I filled it with balvenie 12 year single barrel. My husband loved the whole thing.",
