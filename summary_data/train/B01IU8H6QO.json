I was disappointed when it arrived, very large, chipped on the edges and not terribly attractive like the pics. Then the rest of the set arrived and it did not match the other items. I went through amazon and did a return for replacement, which arrived the same day. The replacement matches the other items and is smaller, heavier and of much better quality. So the moral of my story is, if it doesn't look like the picture, try again. Maybe you'll get lucky like I did.",
