Lots of other features that make it well worth the price.",

It has NO WAY to truly delete these steps, apart from a hard reset (pushing the recessed button inback) which deletes ALL saved history.",

To set the pedometer up, map a two-to-three-mile course on Google Maps... then walk the course. Keep adjusting the stride length (read the instructions) until the pedometer reads out the same distance as the Google Map. Map a second course, then double check it. The pedometer records distance walked by the day and the week, and holds 52 weeks of past data. BTW: Apple iPhone has an App that is supposed to do all of these things, but (i) is not nearly as accurate, and (ii) is nowhere near as convenient to carry on a daily basis.",

Every night at 2 a.m., the step count reverts to zero. I have no interest in anything but my daily step count, and no interest in having my personal data uploaded to Big Brother, so this is perfect. Six stars (at least)!",

I can bag up the trash, take it outside, put it in the dumpster and my step count is 0. But when I take my morning walk and count 200 steps, it reads 200 steps. It works fine in my shirt pocket but not in my shorts pocket, I guess because I'm so big. I played with the stride length until I got it dead on accurate. I've been very happy with this little gadget and would highly recommend it.",

It is a great little gadget; it tracks your daily steps, and keeps track of 30 days and 30 weekly totals, that's alot of space.
