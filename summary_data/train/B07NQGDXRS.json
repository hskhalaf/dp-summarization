I think part of it was that there were things I'd rather be doing, like playing with bugs, but I think part of it as well was that there weren't any Barbie dolls I could connect to. They all seemed so superficial. I wanted a career and to make a difference, even from that young age. Well, my prayers have been answered. I dedicated my entire life to wildlife conservation and I think I found the doll for me, albeit 2 decades later. I guess there really is a Barbie for me after all.",

The only downside is the little book in her hand is just a flimsy piece of cardboard. My little one loves her. Perfect gift idea for little explorers and animal lovers.",
