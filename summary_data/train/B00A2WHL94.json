The eye has gaps and welding splatter that was never cleaned up. The blued finish has blotches, swirls, and a visible weld on the side. It is junk made in India. Spend a little extra and get a truly hand forged hawk made in America. I got an email from the seller asking if I was satisfied, I replied telling them my disappointment and I never heard back from them.",
