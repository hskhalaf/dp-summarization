The thing that impressed me with this vendor is that he was kind enough to include new ink. He also included the printer cord, telephone/fax cord and USB cable. The printer was clean, like new just as promised and all components work (print, fax, copier and scanner. He even included an alignment page. I would definitely use and recommend this vendor. The printer runs quietly and smoothly. I had this exact printer but it stopped working. I think it is one of the best that HP made and I am thankful to have one again. Kudos to this vendor.",

      "text": "THis machine has made my life miserable. In the last 6 months, I don't think it has printed more than 3 faxes without jamming. TO make matters worse, the output tray is shared by the paper input tray. It just pulled in 6 pages of completed received faxes to use to print more faxes. I often find 2-sided faxes. This thing is way too tempermental and I'm tired of babysitting it. Not up to HP standards",

Although the printer is pretty slow for any kind of lengthy printing job, for the infrequent printing it works just fine. Good color copies too! I would recommend this product for any light printing home office.",
