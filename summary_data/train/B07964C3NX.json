When we called the manufacturer to complain, they blamed Amazon, telling us they weren't responsible for what happens to the product in Amazon's warehouse! After being passed around from person to person on the phone they finally told us that they'd make an exception and send us temporary plastic replacements even though we hadn't registered the warranty. We still haven't received the permanent metal wheels they promised. I couldn't believe how they refused to acknowledge responsibly for parts missing on a brand new item they manufactured!

The adjustment on the angle of the seats is a little weird but functional. It folds up so easily. It is a little on the big side folded but its a roomy double stroller so I think that just goes with the territory. I love the built in cup holders and cubby. I dont use the MP3 player but the covered cubby for your phone and keys is wonderful. It also rides very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone!",

We use it ALL the time. The front wheels are a little annoying. However if you lock them the wobbling goes away. Sure it makes it harder to run if you're making a lot of turns, but at least I get a better workout \ud83d\ude01",

I don\u2019t always want to walk in my neighborhood, so being able to throw it in the back of a vehicle was so nice. I bought this when I was pregnant with our second (a year ago) and now I\u2019m pregnant with our third and I\u2019m considering selling it. I loved it when it was good, but it didn\u2019t last long that way.",

In that case, you'd be better off getting one where the kids go one in front of the other. I wish I had done so.",

The design of incline/reclining the seats is horrible - a buckle to try to tighten across the back of the seat to incline and even tightened all the way doesn't get the seat completely upright.
