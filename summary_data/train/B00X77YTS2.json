If you're a competitive or very experienced swimmer, and a good seal is your top priority, you might be used to this, but I wouldn't recommend these for a casual or beginner swimmer.

      "text": "These goggles are really well-constructed and you can tell alot of thought went into their design. The case alone is on par with a Tesla design, if they were to get into the goggle case business. It took me a little while to figure out that you have to turn one end to unlock the case \ud83d\ude01. They do seal on to your eyes very well. However, the bevels on the sides of the goggles creates a blurry interference which blocks some of your peripheral vision. If they could make that a smooth rounded edge to expand peripheral vision that would be a great improvement to the design!",

We live at the beach and have yet to find a great pair of goggles that we don't have to buy a new pair again after a couple weeks use. Yes we wet them first. No we don't wipe the lens. Yes we immediately wash them with fresh water after we use them. No luck. We never had any issues with leaking. They came with a case.",

The issue I have is that we can all see perfectly clearly above the water, but under the water, like so many other reviews, these seem blurry. Very strange. I am writing because I read the customer service for this company is outstanding, so hopefully they will suggest maybe a different lens for me to try. UPDATE: the company contacted me immediately and offered to send me new goggles for the 3 that were blurry. Very courteous and generous. Buy these goggles but make sure you get the flat lens!",

First day they worked great as recommended, no issues no fogging. On the third day of use was another story, the goggles began fogging, the lens smeared easily. When I wiped the inner lens, it scratched easily. I was very disappointed and decided to discontinue the use of this product. I wish I got my money back.",

Pros: There cheap They work Con's: The tinting is very fragile and scrapes easy, falling on the ground can leave scratches, etc in the tinting. They are sensitive to positioning, so you need to confirm a tight fit before you swim with them. They are very distorting on edges and sides due to the shape of the lenses.",
