Camera downtime occurs 2 to 3 times a month (it's been down almost 4 hours so far this morning). Customer service is almost non-existent - hold time varies from 40 minutes to over 2 hours. Hundreds of unsatisfied customers can be found on their Facebook page. I'm looking for an alternative now. What sucks is that I bought 6 cameras and am paying for cloud service and I'm not sure if they will refund any of that. Bottom line, purchase at your own risk.",

So, while the hardware is identical to a Nest, Google, ignoring their Don't Be Evil mission statement, are evilly refusing to honor delivering it. Before you go buy the Nest to get what you paid for, ask yourself if you want to trust a department of Google that are clearly willing to ignore promised support and users who've already given them money so they can chase more money from new people.",

Let me be clear, the camera works, installs easily and has good quality and resolution and sound. If you never want to record anything go for it, but you can probably find something a lot cheaper than the DropCam or NestCam to do that. Shame on this company.",

On several occasions we have needed to go back and review activity in the baby's room during the day and find that we are unable to access that footage because the app continues to crash and/or improperly record and store the video. I do not feel the camera is providing the safety or reliability that should be expected at this price point and would advise anyone using this as a tool to monitor their children to look elsewhere.",

We have also used it for viewing the dogs and cat inside the house while we are away a short time. We did sign up for the subscription and find it worth the money for us. The picture quality is excellent. Great product!I",

Tried a D-Link cam before these and never got it running in spite of stubbornly spending hours trying. The Dropcam was a real revelation on how simple a setup can be. Image quality is good. Mounting bracket could maybe have a few more options such as a magnetic base or some velcro, but you can do those things yourself and overall I'm very satisfied.",

After using it for six months, I have now purchased two additional cameras for my house and two cameras for my parents house so that they can monitor their house as well.

Very happy that they did not waste resources saving to local memory card which I would never look at anyway. Awesome deal. Just ordered another one. Took literally two minutes to setup and now while away from home - can easily check on my cats. I can tell now that they miss me. Not.",

      "text": "I researched monitors for my baby for hours and they all had mixed reviews. I wanted a baby monitor without the bulk. I bought this one due to being able to view live video through an app or through my computer which works great! I'm looking at my baby right now and the night vision is great. Sound is good. Dropcam is awesome! Set up is very easy. Will probably get another one if we have another baby. UPDATE: My son is 9 mo old and I still love this monitor. I watch my baby online or from my iphone. Best baby monitor without the remote!",

      "text": "Very easy to setup and use. Video image is excellent and I like that I can listen only or listen and talk to anyone in the room. Turn off the motion sensor unless you need it as a security camera or it will keep sending you text messages that it sensed movement. Put the app on my cell phone and tablet. Easy to use. I really like that Nest bought the Dropcam company and Nest is owned by Goggle. I'm sure expanded uses an innovation won't be far behind.",

Option to record with paid service ($10/mo-which means capturing \"firsts\" -most monitors you can't record at all, even though it costs money we think it's worth the service) We use this with our IPad and phones. We love this camera and feel we made the right choice.",

There might be interference coming from other electronic devices near your camera. Try to reduce the number of connected devices near the camera. Cordless phones, baby monitors, microwave ovens, garage door openers and Wi-Fi speakers are just a few of many devices that are notorious for causing interference. If your camera is located close to electronic equipment with a large power source, such as a large screen television or home theater system, try moving the camera further away from these devices.
