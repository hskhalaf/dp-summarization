Maybe it could use better heat dissipation. Its simple and straightforward to use. Inside my house I have ZERO Sprint Signal and this gives me a steady 3 bars (out of 6). My other option was locating the Air Card outside the house and get 2 bars which was enough for my Netflix/Roku viewing and regular internet browsing. I wish the coaxial cables were 5 to 10 feet longer each (it comes with 2).",

Proper permanent installation is critical and not easy. Outside antenna had to go outside on a pipe so it could be aimed-- as much away from the inside antenna as toward a tower. Wison is a good company and Prime is a good way to buy w/o risk.",

I live in rural where we can only get Sat internet or LTE internetis, Sat internet is worthless, LTE works great at broadband speeds outside but spotty at best inside. Had -118 db inside my house, spotty conversations and data that bairly worked, out side seemed to work okay With -112 db. Climbed up on the roof one day and found -102 so I though I would give this a try. Wow! Once I hooked it up and my readings went to -80db inside my house! Phones work great and now my down load speeds have increased to over 25mbps consistantly. Highly recommend this to anyone that needs a boost!",
