Tips: Give it time to work. You can't expect instant results. When you are done with the bath, shake out the turtle and then blow to air dry the metal part on the bottom, then it won't beep incessantly after. I am giving 4 stars became am having to buy a new one. The screen has water in it after two years. But I like it so much I'm buying it again.",

My wife and I find ourselves throwing the turtle under pillows or in closets so we don't have to listen to it as it dries out in a beeping fury. We pass each other in the hall, exchange a look, say \"The Turtle!\" and move on. I have gone back to the trusted finger in the water. Seems to have worked for every generation before ours.",

It has an alarm that is clear but not annoying when the tempurature is to hot or cold. I have never had my little boy refuse a bath because of water tempurature since using this to make sure I have the tempurature right.",

He is MUCH happier at bath time - I was running the water way too cold for fear of burning his delicate skin, but I shoot for a 96 degree bath now and he loves it!",

It's also pretty sturdy: both my kids use it as a toy now and then and it's withstood being tossed out of the tub a few times. Overall a well designed product.",

It's wonderful to be able to place this gadget directly in the water and have it give back a temperature reading in seconds. If it's too hot, it will continue to sound a soft alarm until the water reaches a safe temperature.",

The battery is installed out of the box, you simply put it in water and it starts showing you the temp of the water. I try to keep it at 95-97 range since it's the middle ground. Baby loves the bath now and never screamed cuz of hot water anymore... It's pretty big, like toy size. I guess that was the intention of it for being a toy thermometer.
