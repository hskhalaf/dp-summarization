Now I\u2019m sending back the first box to gamble and hopefully get another box with the perfect white light. This company should be a lot more consistent!!!

Two for our daughters, two for my husband & me, & one in the center to represent the unity of our family. It was a real hit with our guests too! Thanks!",
