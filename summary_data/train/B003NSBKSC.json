They're definitely designed with live sound in mind - that being said, once you find the right tips for your ear, these sound fantastic. At first I was disappointed with glaring mids and nonexistent lows, but as I tried different tips I found that they were fairly adequate for a headset of this price. I was intending to return them at first, but I am getting used to their sound and will likely keep them.",

The 425 is just as durable and fit my ears perfect but is no where near producing the bass the 215 has, even as I made sure I had a tight seal. Returned it immediately within 8 hrs. and treated me to the 535. Let\u2019s see if the extra money is worth it.",

Great for all day listening or a long flight and the in-the-ear design is unbeatable for your workout. Keep in mind that the quality of your source is key for the richest sound replication.

They could have used fiberglass or metal for this price range. I felt I've wasted money on this transaction. The cable was ok and thick which I like. Disappointed!!!",

      "text": "I am just your average music listener, but my take on these earphones is that there is very little (to no) low end sound, which makes for a very lack-luster listening experience. The disproportion of high to low does not provide a full, rich sound. I tried all of the combinations of earpieces to try get the best fit but no earpieces really helped. For the price, I would recommend looking elsewhere.",
