Perfect length, and fabric was good quality, but not the thin fabric we love the most. They have a mesh liner. They are a little too big in the waist, but the drawstring helps fix that. They seem to rub my little boy\u2019s thighs every time he wears them, so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just because they are still a little too big. He\u2019s used to wearing the tight fitting speedo type shorts- he hates the feeling of wet baggy swim trunks on his legs. We will try these next year, hopefully with better luck.",
