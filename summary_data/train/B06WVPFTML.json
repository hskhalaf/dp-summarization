      "text": "This is a really nice clothing rack! I recently moved into a tiny studio apartment, and my only closet has shelves, no clothing rail. I decided to use that closet for other storage and opt for a freestanding clothing wrack instead. It was a breeze to assemble with my boyfriend's help and so far it seems sturdy (and as you can see, holds a lot of clothes). I'm also really happy with the A-frame type design because the clothing bar at the top doesn't interfere with my apartment's built-in shelf above.",
