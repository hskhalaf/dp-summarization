Couldn't stack the pieces because the white ceramic would chip; when I washed it, it seemed like there was a residue left--gave it to St. Vinny's. Anyway, I couldn't adapt to the ceramic! I love the Calphalon: it's easy to clean (and can go in the dishwasher), and heats very evenly compared to the Revereware. I might get a small GreenPan, though, to cook eggs.",
