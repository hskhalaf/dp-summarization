And the hand pump allows you to top it off with just the right amount of pressure. It' is essentially as good as a solid kayak! We love it!.",

A strength is that this can be fit into a large duffel bag and stowed in a trunk rather than requiring a rack. The only weakness of this boat would be the tendency to take on some water between the outer shell and the air chambers. This occurs by way of a nylon fabric seam that isn't water tight. The outer hull is a scuff resistant layer more than a water barrier. Draining isn't difficult but it may take a few days of air drying before long term storage.",
