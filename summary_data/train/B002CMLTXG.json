It's cast iron, you need to make sure it's well oiled and hot enough, otherwise food will stick. A stiff brush (but never steel wool) works great for cleaning, and cast iron gets better (easier to clean, more non-stick) with use. Shipped quickly (by quickly I mean I ordered it around 6pm and it was on my porch at 9am) and was packaged well.",

I did rub it with a little oil and put it into the oven at 500 degrees for about 20 minutes. Worked great. Next, we'll try it on our outdoor gas grill. So much easier to deal with than the racks on that. Love Lodge products and love that they're made in the USA.",

I used Olive Oil instead, so who knows if that is the issue.

I think I would have been better off putting the money towards a good electric griddle. This will probably work well on a grill, but I haven't had an occasion to need a griddle on my grill.",

It doesn't have high enough walls, so I don't make bacon on it or anything too greasy, which defeats the purpose. So if my pancakes are uneven and the bacon grease spills out, what else can I cook on it? I do like cast iron, but I think I should stick to pots and pans with sides.",

Since cast iron doesn't have the heat conductivity of other metals I do have some issues with uneven cooking of both bacon and pancakes. The other issue is that there is no easy way to remove grease from the griddle and no grease storage groove on the sides. The sides are also quite short and you have to be careful when making pancakes that it doesn't run over.",

Griddle comes pre-seasoned and gets better with age. NOTES: Use low heat as this heats fast and multiples applied heat. Level stove required as well as burner grates. Check level prior to use. Nice steel, square spatula recommended, get two as one may be needed to hold griddle down with minor sticking. Really good cooking gloves are highly recommended as well.",

It's a little hard to clean the grill side, so I will have to buy a specific tool for that. I like that I can get my cooking and weight lifting in at the same time (LOL! this thing is heavy for sure!).",

It fits the length/width profile of the burner and flame perfectly.

I've put four packages of six breakfast sausages on here without problem. For sausages, I also use the Lodge LGP3 Grill Press. On the smooth size, we've done a huge load of pancakes without moving them around at all. What's really great is that it takes the \"shiftwork\" out of making breakfast. Typical Lodge high quality.",
