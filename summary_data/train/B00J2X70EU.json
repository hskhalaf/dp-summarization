I can live with that overall, but what is not in the description in the 24 pound weight at least is the diameter of the bar itself. This is much thicker than a normal weight bar and difficult to handle for normal exercise. This makes this a simple no on its quality. I have used many of the weight bars in gyms and this is too thick",
