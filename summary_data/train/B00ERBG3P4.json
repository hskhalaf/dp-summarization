She has been known to take long naps in this chair. The size is just perfect for her room. The assembly was so easy. The hardest part was screwing in the legs - Not! I would definitely recommend this recliner to anyone who wants comfort without the bulkines of most modern day recliners.",

I would not recommend it for a larger person-man or woman- because it is a smaller chair.It looks gorgeous for $200.00 -actually like a much more expensive chair. The leather is very comfortable.
