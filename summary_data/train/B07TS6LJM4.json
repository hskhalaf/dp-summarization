Once arrived I was relieved to find out it was perfect and even her siblings enjoyed them. They are very easy to use, as the beads pop in and out of each other very simply and she is able to play independently. The packaging of the product is probably my favorite part- love the carrying handle, and it's such great quality- so far cleanup has been painless. Highly recommend this product for any kid!!!",
