      "text": "I am not sure what makes this a beginner Nootropic other than its easy to spend $100s creating stacks. I spend a ton on supplements and believe many are largely placebo long-term (including the very expensive stacks). That said, Alpha GPC is more than that IMO, and Double Wood's Alpha GPC provides a much better mental and physical boost than other brands as well as drastically more expensive alternatives I've tried - especially long term. Would definitely recommend this supplement more than most!",
