It's a very flexible steamer in terms of size. Easy to clean. There's a hook you can use to pull the steamer out of the pot, so that makes it very convenient since there's no need for heat-resistant gloves. It also comes with a free stainless steel julienne peeler! Very glad I chose to puchase this steamer. No regrets.",
