Setting the alarm is easy though. For the price, this thing should have some basic scheduling, and not have the functionality of a $5 hotel alarm clock.",

I should have tried one of the cheaper non-Philips versions on Amazon (1/2 the price of this one) or gotten one of the older models. Stay away from this light!!!!!!!",

Haven't noticed the slow brightening of the light helping me wake up in the morning yet so it is mostly useful as a bedside lamp. Next time I will opt for one with a sunset feature as well.",

I was doubtful at first but it works great, I tend to wake before my alarm these days, if i have any complaints it it that its such a gentle awakening I don't have the adrenaline spike to get me out of bed when i used to get startled awake. I would recommend getting the more expensive version of this alarm clock. I bought this one as I was skeptical it would work and these alarm clocks are expensive but it does work and I wish I had the features of the more expensive one but I am too cheap to buy it while this one is still working fine.",

      "text": "This light works great, but it doesn't wake me up 'naturally' every morning like I had hoped. You do have to be facing it in order for it to be effective, which makes sense, but if you turn on your sides away from it when you're sleeping then there's a chance it won't wake you up. Like most other reviews, the fact that you can't disable the alarm is annoying. I did buy it knowing this ahead of time, but it's not the most pleasant sound to wake up to. I guess if the light wakes you up before the alarm, then it's not as much of a rude awakening.",
