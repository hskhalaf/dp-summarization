I had to completely remove the nail polish because of how wet my nails were . It was completely ridiculous and I\u2019m disappointed amazon would sell such a terrible product to their customers and the design quality was that of a three year olds toy.",

You can buy any brand polish and it will work fine. I would say definitely give it a try.",

The nail polish itself seems to last longer than regular nail polish but still hasn\u2019t lasted me even a week.",
