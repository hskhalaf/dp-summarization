I always hand washed and never used metal utensils, it just started peeling while I was cooking. Would like to return but it's out of the return time. Wasted my money on this one.",

I read other bad reviews about the coating on this pan before I ordered, but ignored them because I have another Lodge pan (dutch oven) that is great. I may go for one of the more expensive brands instead Lodge for this item.",

The chicken was cooked thoroughly, and it was so tender and juicy! The clean up was a cinch as well. I am very pleased and would recommend this to anyone!

So I thought I'd invest in an enameled cast iron dish and I LOVE IT! It is easier to clean and (shhh! Don't tell anyone) but I even opted out of cleaning it after using it to cook dinner one time. The next day I cleaned it and it looked as good as new...no rust...no re-seasoning...no nothing! It's my new go to pan.",

My larger enameled cast iron pot (different brand) was packed the same way and was fine. I'm still giving it 4 stars as here I am buying another one because I liked it so much.",

The sauce didn\u2019t cook down so fast and it thicken up to a wonderful gravy. The Dutch oven needed more attention to keep adding water to the hours of braising the meat. Plus it cleaned up so fast and easy too ! I love this pot.",

I did not have issues with sticking, and the small amount of food that did get burned on was very easy to clean off with 3min soak and plastic scrub brush. I LOVE my other basic cast iron, but I am not great at maintaining it as I should, resulting in rust that I later have to get off with salt... not an issue with this pan.",

    "title": "Lodge 3.6 Quart Cast Iron Casserole Pan. Red Enamel Cast Iron Casserole Dish with Dual Handles and Lid (Island Spice Red)",
    "description": "Color:Spice RedThis 3.6 Quart enamel covered casserole is great for cooking, marinating, refrigeration and freezing. The color porcelain enamel on cast iron can be used on gas, electric, ceramic and induction cooktops, as well as in the oven. Not recommended for use on outdoor grills or over open outdoor flames. Not for use in microwaves. Lodge Color Porcelain Enamel on Cast Iron cookware is cast from molten iron in individual sand molds. The porcelain surface eliminates the need to season cast iron. The cast iron vessel has superior heat distribution and retention, evenly heating bottom sidewalls and even the lid. Tightly fitting lid seals in moisture. The excellent heat retention reduces the amount of energy needed for cooking. Two layers of very hard, glossy porcelain enamel are chip resistant and easy to clean. Lid knob is oven safe to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. The black rim on the pot is matte porcelain, not exposed cast iron. Hygienic porcelain enamel is non-reactive with food. Although dishwasher safe, hand washing with warm soapy water is recommended to preserve the cookware's original appearance. 11 3/4\" diameter, 2 1/8\" deep. Complete item measures 14.4\" x 12.55\" x 3.4\". Island Spice Red. Allow cookware to cool before washing",
