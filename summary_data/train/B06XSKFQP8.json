      "text": "This is by far one of the best comforters I've had in recent years and the quality is top-notch. There are some lint bunnies that you need to pick off the comforter, but that is to be expected. The packaging was exceptional and shipping was fast. The comforter is fluffy yet lightweight and very soft to the touch. I have a queen-size bed but went up a size to a King size which is the perfect size I wanted. I highly recommend this comforter to anyone who's looking for very affordable and stylish comforter that'll just make your room pop with elegance and a design is timeless. I hope you found this review helpful.",

When it arrived it was in a zippered bag and it appeared to be flat, thin and small. Therefore, I do admit that initially, I was skeptical of its quality. However, I went ahead and took it out of the bag and left it sitting overnight. When I awoke the next morning I was completely amazed when I picked it up. It felt really thick, plush and heavy in my hands. Finally, I spread it out on a bed and was immediately impressed. I definitely will be buying at least one or two more of this comforter.",

      "text": "I was nervous about purchasing this due to some of the reviews mentioning it being too small for a king size bed.. Its the exact perfect fit. If you want something that hangs down over the side, this is not for you. But if you want an amazing cover, that is light breathable and yet keeps you comfortably warm, this is the blanket for you! My boyfriend is super picky, and he even loves it! We ordered a duvet insert from this brand first for our daughters bed, and now that we have ours we will continue to buy from them. SO happy with the quality for the price. Thank you!",

It's soft it seems to be durable but only time will tell after it's washed. But I like the pattern very much. I did buy a king size for my queen size bed which I like very much it being a bit oversized. I would recommend it I will update if things change",

The comforter filling isn't bound to those quilt cells in any way, though, so the individual cells of filling eventually just kind of balls up and wads into a corner of each cell. This makes the filling feel very uneven throughout the comforter, kind of a lumpy feel.",

It comes vacuum-packed and once opened it becomes very fluffy :) This is not cotton nor is the fill down, but it is of excellent quality.- The color is excellent as well (not dull not patchy). Recommend highly! One last thing, because I read that they are not as big to hang off to the sides as the picture shows, I decided to buy a king for my queen bed... Love it!",
