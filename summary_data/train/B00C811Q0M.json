The settings are awful. 2 is too light; 3 overcooks it. The last straw was getting a piece of bread dropped in bottom and no tray to get it out.

Neither lever would stay down, they simply wouldn't lock in place. I tried repeatly and it would typically take 20 attempts before the toaster would begin working. Unfortunately I threw the box away or I would be returning it for full payment. Today I am buying another toaster. Hopefully I'll have better luck.",

      "text": "Pros: Perfectly accurate toasting at every setting every time. Wide slots for artisan breads or bagels. Cons: Rotary control knobs very flimsy. Cord storage leaves a lot to be desired, as it does with most Cuisinart appliances, of which we own many. You need to be a bosons' mate to wrap it up on the cord holders.",

The toasting results are to our satisfaction, am not really that picky and observant as some other reviews seem to suggest. I toast bread primarily when it is no longer as fresh .. so not really a toast expert.",
