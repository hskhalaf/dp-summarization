Would reorder-great price. Also, I received my tag in a small envelope, protected but not I over packaged. Also came with a 10% off coupon for their other personalized products.

Our dog really wanted to chew the rubber liner, so she was always getting it loose from the tag and I was always fitting it back onto the tag. I figured she'd eventually lose interest in it, but within a week it got caught on something and broke off. She wears the beautiful metal tag now without the liner and that's fine, but I wouldn't bother ordering a liner again.",

The embossed paw print on the opposite side is of high quality. It's the perfect ID trinket addition to give our Goldendoodle's collar that designer's look!

The silencer does exactly what it\u2019s suppose to! My only wish is that it came with a jump ring as the hole on the tag is too small to attach to our tag clip as is. We found a spare so no biggie but good to know it doesn\u2019t have one. So far we are very happy with our purchase, would definitely recommend",

Attached to the collar very easily and very easy to read. Did not purchase the rubber outer ring but it doesn't seem to make much noise when our pup is walking around. Probably could have gone with the small for our specific little guy but the regular is not overbearingly big on him. Overall, very happy so far.",

My dog is 15 lbs so the small tag is miniscule on him and gets lost in his fur, it is best for dogs 10 lbs and under. There are only 2 sizes offered so I thought the larger tag would be too big. I suggest that the company offer another size and give a better description of the small tag so that people with dogs that are small, but more than 10 lbs don't make the mistake of ordering it.",
