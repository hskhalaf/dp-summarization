The image are tack sharp, autofocus is extremely fast, and the bokeh is so smooth. This lens is hands down the best lens I have ever used.

There is convenience, quality and flexibility in this lens that can handle low light situations like a champ.

I have used every available lens for a Canon DSLR camera body and this lens is tied with only one other lens for being the sharpest lens available in my experience. But that other lens is only available for crop sensor camera bodies. I know the price is high but if you want to produce the best images, this lens will help you make them. If you are fine with less, there are certainly other nice options out there.",
