Well luckily it was a sunny day, now she loves it! Human-friendly too. The suction cups were easy to assemble, and are super sturdy.

I call it his tv -- it is truly wonderful enrichment. The cot is sturdy beyond all belief -- my cat is only 10lb but he is RAMBUNCTIOUS and has lept onto this thing at speed multiple times. It hasn't budged. Thank you, Kitty Cot, for keeping my cat entertained and happy.",

    "description": "Size:Kitty Cot LargeBLACK Color Kitty Cot Original (Large) measures 25-1/2\u2033 wide x 14\u2033 deep (width measured from outside edges of suction cups on Kitty Cot). Actual frame dimension is 14\" x 23-1/2\". Minimum window glass for use is 25\" wide x 21\" high. Kitty Cots attach to glass windows, mirrors and smooth non-porous surfaces using four PATENTED Giant Suction Cups made in the USA. Each cup is rated for 12 pounds so the Kitty Cot will hold about 25 pounds of cat(s). Kitty Cots work indoors and outdoors. The frame is made of PVC plastic pipe and fittings. It\u2019s not glued together so it can be taken apart. The Kitty Cot hammock is a super-tough black nylon fabric called \u201cTiger-Mesh\u201d. It\u2019s so strong that it\u2019s virtually impossible to rip or tear, and cleans easily with soap and water. Our design is so simple that anyone can put it up, and best of all you need no tools to install it. Lay your cat's favorite blanket or pad down to make it even more bed-like and comfortable. Install it next to an outside bird feeder or another action location and your cat will be entertained for hours. Tips on Using Suction Cups: The care and use of suction cups is very simple. Make sure the suction cup is clean and free from debris. If the suction cup needs to be cleaned, wash in warm soapy water then dry gently with a lint-free cloth. Clean the surface you are applying the suction cup to. It won\u2019t adhere well to a dirty surface. To enhance suction, a tiny dab of Vaseline or cooking oil may be rubbed on the rim of the cup. Press the cup all the way down, against the surface. The suction cup may need to be \u201cburped\u201d periodically by pressing down on it to remove any air that may have seeped in. Temperature and humidity variations may make a suction cup lose its grip. If bonded above 40 degrees Fahrenheit the cup will provide the most reliable service from -22 degrees to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. To remove the cup, simply pull up on the release tab to break the suction.",
