      "text": "We have had the Worx 56v Cordless Grass trimmer for one season and are happy to report it does what it is supposed to do. Clears a wide 13 inch path per pass. Trims brush without problems. We purchased the Worx 56 v trimmer to use around the garden. This gives us to batteries when we need a second. Depending on the amount of brush I am trimming I have been able to trim for half the day without changing the battery. Recommend!",

I have to pick up these lines from the yard after trimming. I would prefer a push bottom line feed only instead of auto feed. Not satisfied with the purchase.

    "description": "Style:Cordless Grass TrimmerThe WORX WG191 56V Max Li-Ion 13-Inch Cordless Grass Trimmer features a new Command FeedTM system that allows instant trimmer line advancing \u2013 no more bumping or waiting for the line to advance before cutting. With Command FeedTM, the user electronically controls when to feed more line through a simple push-button above the trigger. This not only conserves line, it eliminates downtime when edging and waiting for additional line to advance. This trimmer uses a thicker professional-grade trimmer line (.080\u201d diameter, 1\u201d x 20' in length) that\u2019s more durable than conventional line. WORX incorporates a quick-change, easy-to-load, pre-wound spool accessory, so there\u2019s no fumbling with line changes. The WG191 also has a new method to switch from trimming to edging \u2013 the push-button feature delivers a seamless transition between functions by simply pressing a button at the top of the shaft and twisting. The WG191 comes with a set of twin wheels that help guide the tool while edging, wheels that can be removed and housed on the lower shaft to give you full visibility while trimming. The head pivots from 0 to 90 degrees to provide any angle needed for trimming and edging.",
