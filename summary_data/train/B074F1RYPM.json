I have to admit they are smaller than I thought they'd be, but it makes sense given their size relative to the controllers and the original steering wheels from the Wii. I've added a picture for scale. Overall, though, very good accessories for the Nintendo Switch and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.",

They would fit inside the wheels used for a Wii. Adult hands get cramped while trying to relive old glory while playing Mario Kart and getting beat by children. I do like the colors though. When playing with four people it makes it easier to remember which controller belongs to each person. We bought this pack of blue and red and another set of black ones. Black controllers go into the red and blue. Red and blue controllers go into the black wheels. Easy.",

There's a little bit of side-to-side play in the slot for the controller, so that the joycon can slip around about a half-inch, but it's nothing serious (and I think it might even be intentional, because if you line up the + or - button with the controller, then the should buttons align perfectly for the left and right joycons. They're comfortable to hold (although more for a kid's hands than an adult's), the should buttons work well, and the colors match exactly. They're also easy to get the joycon into and out of (my not-quite-6-year-old can do it easily) and they hold securely without any concern that the joycon might slip out.",

I've never used the official ones to know if that's the same, but it's the only downside I can think of for these. I'd buy them again!",
