Build quality on this is a 10 and the wire included with the controller is long enough to work for most setups. For the price this controller is a steal!",

The wired portion slowly deformed at the top of the controller not allowing the wire itself to properly seat, therefore due to the light weight to the wire it causes the controller to lose power because it's not making the proper metal-on-metal connection. I got caught in the nostalgia aspect, but it's a cheap product. I'd return if I could.....",

The rumble is good, the thumbsticks are good, and it feels great for someone with larger hands. People with small hands could have a difficult time using it, though. This is just die to the size of the original controller that this matches so perfectly! Disclaimer: it's not wireless but it's still great! Would recommend!",

I would definitely recommend this controller in any or all colors if you are a fan of Xbox. Also, the cable the Duke controller comes with is also compatible with any Xbox One controllers, so it's a win win!",

But it's been coming back the more I play with it. Overall, I enjoy using it. I also liked the Sega Saturn 3D controller, and even the Dreamcast (big hands again haha)",

Yes. It operates via basic micro USB, so that's nice. They added bumpers on the shoulders which were not on the original. These are simply duplicates of the Black/White buttons. They are just a small added benefit. Every time you click the middle button, it shows the Original Xbox startup screen, which is awesome. I recommend this for sure, but only if you understand that it is not a normal sized or normal feeling controller.",
