Which, upon doing some more in depth reading about the issue, is pretty common for this particular laptop. The rest of the computer works great; it's very fast and sleek and has decent memory. Just wished that it didn't come broken so we didn't have to jump through hoops and phonecalls to get it fixed. Super annoying working with the customer service reps. Impossible to reach through email, the only option is via phone.",
