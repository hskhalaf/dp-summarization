I was getting really lazy about vacuuming the house as my old vacuum was on its final legs after two decades of use. Well, the Dyson small ball has made cleaning an exciting experience as I can literally see all of the particulates and hair being picked up into the transparent canister. Now, I feel like I'm on a mission to get the whole house in order!",
