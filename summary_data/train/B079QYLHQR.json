There is a lot to learn about yhis computer...er, camera, with both basic and advanced manuals, but anyone can manage the point and shoot. I am curious why Camera Mall put white stickers all over the UPC codes. It sure wasn't priced as a grey market item and not easy to register a warranty this way.",

Compared to previous model - I can't say that the difference in image quality is that large, but the ergonomics is better. My only complaint - I'd prefer to buy body only, without the kit lens, for I have enough lenses and this zoom, while not terrible, is very mediocre.",

I've shot photos with a number of lenses (25mm prime, 12-60mm f3.5, 12-60mm f2.8, 14-140mm) and all look good as far as color and image quality. I used to have a GX85 and this is definitely an \"upgrade\" from that camera although each person will have to decide if the differences are worth the cost. I wanted a smaller m43 for times when my other cameras were too large or heavy. This is a nice size for walking in parks and cities. Not too obtrusive but very functional.",

    "description": "Color:SilverFirst in Mirrorless innovation, LUMIX by Panasonic leads in Mirrorless ILC camera innovation with the sleek, compact LUMIX GX9. Its flat body style is favored by LUMIX G enthusiasts and noted for high image quality and the streetwise creative freedom it delivers. The LUMIX GX9 captures vibrant, true-to-life, high-quality images with excellent resolution, high contrast and impressive color reproduction. The 20.3-megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor (without low-pass filter) ensures maximum performance across a full range of LUMIX G and LEICA DG Micro Four Thirds lenses.\n\nThe LUMIX GX9 incorporates 5-axis Dual I.S. (Image Stabilizer) to more effectively suppress blur. Combining an O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer, 2-axis) and a B.I.S. (Body Image Stabilizer, 5-axis), the 5-axis Dual I.S. compensates for a wider-than-ever range of movement. Users can enjoy blur-free photo/video shooting from wide to tele, even in low-light situations. The LUMIX GX9 integrates an electromagnetic drive in the shutter unit to reduce the shock created by the movement of shutter diaphragm by approx. 90% compared with its predecessor, while also minimizing shutter sound.",
