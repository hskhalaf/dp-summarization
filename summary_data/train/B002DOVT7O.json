It was as if I had a blanket removed from my speakers. Highs, Mids and low frequency jumped out. Highly recommended.

With the player set up near waist level, when I walk up close enough to press the buttons the display becomes illegible. I have to bend way down to get to an angle where the display becomes readable. I knew immediately that I would be returning it, which I did. I ended up getting an Onkyo C-7030 instead.",
