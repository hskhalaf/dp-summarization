The Micca is great as the center speaker and adds a great dimension of quality sound for under $70.

Certainly helps counter the absorption of the higher frequencies in a typical furnished room. The woofers are a little weak on the low end, but they're certainly helped by the rear bass port. Placing them in a bookshelf or corner is a good idea. Pairing them with the SA-CS9 subwoofer is perfect to balance the excellent highs with thundering lows.",

They're simply the best bookshelves you'll find in this price range -- especially at their quarterly sale price, which is about half their list price. They're obviously not the Focal monitors I have in my studio, or the $4k BW towers in my media room -- these are well suited for just jamming out in an office, garage, workshop, family room, etc.",

IF YOU CAN GET THESE WHEN THEY ARE ON SALE... there is nothing better. Very nice FLAT tonal response (No funky muddy Mids or Bass) with beautiful highs, great cymbals...
