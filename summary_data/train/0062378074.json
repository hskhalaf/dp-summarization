I've worked as a psychologist with military folks and cops in a prison setting and their attention to detail is crucial when dealing with difficult scenarios. They drill, drill drill to be prepared for whatever might come up (especially the crisis management teams) and this includes even obvious, common sense details. The author wants to make sure that you don't overlook anything in the survival game. This is an excellent guide with tons of useful information. Highly recommended.",

The author did spend a small amount of time on shelter, but most of it on building in the polar region. This is a region which most of us never see, therefore the author should have spent the majority of shelter building on the temperate zone, where the majority of people in world live.

The book presents a subject, lists a quick topical blurb and then moves on. No true learning takes place. The author paints with broad brush strokes at times and doesn't teach key practical skills - case in point, the book shows types of shelters/pictures, but not how to build one. Really? Wouldn't that be something important to know?",
