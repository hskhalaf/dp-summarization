Sure these panels are priced competitively, however, LED failure after 2 years is atrocious! I have a 10 year plus Hitachi Plasma that is still working! Aside from the LED failure the smart TV functions are really slow to load and navigate. The remote control is poorly designed with the battery cover easily sliding off. The remote also lags, meaning when you press the volume button it doesn't work right away. Sometimes you have to take the batteries out to get the remote to work responsively.

Smart TV apps are pretty lame, but its hard to expect a top of the line experience at this price point. If you have an Xbox or Playstation for streaming video, those definitely produce a superior experience. Great picture, great aesthetics (I love the two foot design), and an unbeatable price.",

They referred me back to Vizio, who simply offered a $100 discount on another one of these. Fool me twice?... NO Thank you. This was my first and LAST Vizio purchase.",
