I've owned a Wii U since it came out and had never heard of this game (which is surprising because the Wii U doesn't have a ton of good games). So far, it has been a blast. The only thing I don't like is that it forces one of the two players onto the Gamepad, it doesn't allow split screen for the 2 players. This is a quite deep game with a lot more variability than Mario Kart. The campaign experience is a major differentiator from that series.",

The disc didn't have sharp edges so it is almost impossible to hurt yourself. Plus you can race in a lot more worlds than you can in the first one. It comes with big packs of weapons you can shoot in the game. I would recommend it to someone who loves racing games.",

Interesting courses, transforming cars and lots of recognizable characters.

At $40 this game is a steal. Great gameplay, visuals, music, and characters. This is more than just a placeholder until the next Mario Kart, it stands on it's own very well and it won't be put to the side when that next MK does roll out.",
