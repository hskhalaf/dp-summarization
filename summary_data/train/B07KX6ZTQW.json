Although this mask pulls off some oil/dirt in pores, it leaves a lot to be desired for such a product. Did a great job at pulling out some peach fuzz around my chin. It did leave my skin softer than when I began but I overall expected more and will likely just go back to charcoal nose strips after this.",

You have to use a warm/hot cloth beforehand to open the pores! Once that's done, applying the mask is pretty easy, it is thick, but it has to be to work right. Wait 30 mins or so until it's completely dry, peel off, and observe the gunk. After use my skin looked really nice soft. No irritation or redness. Good results.",

I went though the WHOLE bottle, multiple different uses and different method to open my friggin pores up, including holding a steamer away from my face (do not recommend), and still couldn\u2019t get this sucker to pull anything out. However the reason people say that it\u2019s painful is because it\u2019ll pull out all your little face hairs, giving you a nice wax. Would possibly purchase it again solely for a good at-home wax, but definitely not for a face mask.",

It actually wasn't that hard or painful to peel off as some reviews state, and did not leave my skin red or irritated. I do recommend pulling back all of your hair with a headband and avoiding entire eye area/eyebrows and lip to avoid too many small hairs being ripped out. Also be sure to wash your face with warm water first to open up your pores and really make the most of the mask. I use 1-2x a week and have seen a big drop in blackheads!",

As soon as the Christmas chaos was cleaned up and the kids were out for the night we opened this up, applied it to our faces, sipped some wine, and waited for it to dry while doing some well deserved relaxing!! The squeeze tube makes application neat and easy... the mask itself spreads like a dream... and peeling off is so satisfying. Our faces were soft and glowing afterwards. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes peel off masks!!",

I don\u2019t recommend this product. Save yourself the money and just buy a box of Biore strips.",
