If I could get the same deal I did on this cooler, I\u2019d get it again in a heartbeat. Heck I\u2019d trade a kid for one. It fit perfectly in my large SUV.

So i laid it to rest and bought another one. This cooler is worth every penny.",

That the hinges can be bought in a 2 pack and this chest takes 3 hinge was a bit strange. This chest would be an excellent cooler and it is really big and needs a lot of room. I would recommend it as a cooler and minnow tank. DMD",

I would have liked to see a more substantial retainer strap (that keeps the lid from opening too far) and sturdier hinges, but then again, that would increase the cost.
