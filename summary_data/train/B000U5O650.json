I read that I should try a non-alcohol toner to perhaps soothe my skin, so I purchased this one. It suds up when you rub it between your hands, which was very off putting. It definitely leaves my skin more moisturized. I use a 50/50 combo of this toner and witch hazel, the best of both worlds shine though. Still a little iffy about how it contains perfume, since that\u2019s known to dry out skin.",

After removing my makeup, I use a cotton ball to dab it over my face. However, the only downside to this product is their packaging - I wish they used a more efficient way to pack it. A spray bottle would have been so nice to use. I hate to find a cotton bottle before I can use this product. Other than that, wonderful product! Hats off!!",

Also I don\u2019t like how it suds up like soap, makes me feel like I probably shouldn\u2019t be leaving it to soak into my skin. It\u2019s also perfumed, not a bad scent but smells like laundry detergent. I don\u2019t find it moisturizing either. Idk, personally I really don\u2019t like it and I\u2019m worried it might actually be causing more harm than good.",

Not a strong perfume smell. Besides the scent, the alcohol-free toner did feel nice on my face. It didn't sting like most toners containing alcohol. It left my skin feeling pretty clean. I will probably look for an alcohol-free toner with no fragrance from a different brand.",

Other than that? I highly recommend.",

On the other hand, it is a good product, I love the scent, it smells clean, and it\u2019s not overpowering, it cleans and moisturizes the skin pretty great.
