Came with free strings so I could get right to work. The machine doesn't take much space at all. All the attachments and pliers and so on are high quality. Just works. Really very pleased.",

This is my first racket stringing machine (our teenage tennis player started to go through so many strings it was becoming expensive and a pain to have the rackets restrung at our local tennis store), and I've had a great experience with it over the past five months. The product is well-made and easy-to-use, especially with the clear racket-stringing instructions provided by the manufacturer. The first few rackets I strung took me over two hours, but now I'm down to just over an hour, and I find the process of stringing a racket satisfying and enjoyable. Highly recommend!",

It is very sturdy, feels substantial, and very easy to use. So far I re-strung three of my racquets. First one took about 2.5 hours, next two were 1.5 hours. The instructions included with the stringer are excellent and do a fantastic job in guiding you through the stringing process. I would definitely recommend.",

I had to buy a tension calibrator to know the exact weight, but I found a cheap one on ebay and it worked great to. But the klippermate was perfect and I don't need anything else.",

    "description": "America's best selling racquet stringer for the past 30 years, the Klippermate is used by more players than any other stringer. Join thousands who save money each year by stringing their own racquets. Free shipping offer available at klipperusa.com where you can also read our Frequently Asked Questions, see a review by Tennis Magazine and view testimonials from many of our satisfied customers. *The Klippermate utilizes the drop weight tensioning system. This system is accurate within the industry standard of plus or minus one pound and is calibrated for life. Our exclusive Cam String Gripper eliminates the need for the clutch or ratchet pulling system resulting in an average stringing time of only thirty minutes. *The Klippermate is the only machine that comes with string clamps made out of steel and guaranteed for a lifetime. All other machines provide plastic composite clamps that do not hold as well, may have sharp edges and are not covered by a lifetime guarantee. *Strong two point mounting system guarantees damage free stringing and supports all size racquets. *The base of the Klippermate is made of steel and not light-weight aluminum or plastic. This eliminates the need to bolt or clamp the stringer down during use and allows you to string anywhere. *Since 1967, over forty years experience in the manufacturing of racquet stringers has led to the development of the best selling stringing machines in America. We're proud to be the only company making racquet stringing machines in the USA and the only one to offer an unlimited lifetime guarantee along with a 30-day money back guarantee.",
