I think some people are buying them thinking they are adult sizes. Yes, they do shrink a bit when you wash them. However, if you don\u2019t over dry them and stretch them a bit when they come out or the dryer they go back to the size they were. Overall I think they are a great buy!! Can\u2019t beat the price or quality.",
