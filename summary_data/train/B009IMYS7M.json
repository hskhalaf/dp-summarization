Basically everything that is a pain to iron with a traditional iron, it would be hard to flatten out with this too, BUT for fabrics that shouldn\u2019t be in direct contact with a metallic iron, because they will get an undesirable shine, or they might burn, this product will do great. Perfect for women\u2019s clothing, t-shirts, delicate fabrics like silk and polyester, thin cotton, fancy dresses, kids clothing and more. It heats up fast and it won\u2019t burn you with dripping hot water. I\u2019m so glad to have it.",

Luckily I kept my old one, so just used the pole from that one instead. This steamer replaced my old one that stopped working. I liked it enough to buy again. Since the pole from my old one was still good and I needed to use it right away, I just used that part from my old one and didn't bother returning it due to the missing part.",

However, this product has two main problems we encountered: 1. The clips on the hanger are so weak and essentially useless to hold anything up. I never actually used them as a result. 2. The steamer handle gets *very* hot when in use. It seems to have very bad insulation and sometimes I had to use oven gloves to hold the handle in order not to get burnt.",

The press and roll feature provides support so you can actually \"press\" the wrinkles and put a crease into your pants. I bought it when my son got married. The bridesmaids ordered chiffon dresses that arrived in an extreme wrinkled state. I used the Rowenta on them and the wrinkles in the fragile chiffon fabric vanished like magic.

Can\u2019t imagine NOT having that feature. It alone makes this the easiest stemer to get good results from. Before buying this steamer, I read reviews about it burning fingers. Well hello, it\u2019s a STEAMER! Learn to keep your fingers clear.",
