So I've spent a significant amount more money than what I thought I was going to with this purchase. It'll be my first return through Amazon as well.",

It would overheat, stop working and flash, the now infamous, Red Ring of Death.

      "text": "The next evolution of gaming. I can't stop thinking about how almost every single genre is going to be improved substantially with VR. While PS VR is the shiniest of the bunch, it's without debate the most practical, comfortable, and affordable. Not to mention it's PC competitors are almost dead in the water due to pricing and severe lack of quality software. This means most VR developers have already, or will eventually, jump ship. It's already outsold both competitors combined and shows now signs of slowing. I've spent 10+ hours so far and it just keeps blowing me away. Sony is going to pioneer the greatest advancement in video game tech since analog sticks.",
