Whenever Itype for more than 2 minutes, several of the keys start double or even triple imputing the letter (e.g. when I try to write \u2018hello\u2019, it would come out as \u2018hhelllloo\u2019). This proved to be a extreme burden to me, and this made the product virtually unusable. Would not recommend.",

However, the touchpad is one of those kinda grippy ones where its hard to slide your finger easily, and there's no physical buttons which makes it very hard to click/right click/click 'n drag, etc... so i returned it. i want this exact one with physical mouse buttons (and a smoother touchpad surface).",

Notably, the engineering allows for good hand-held operation; holding the keyboard in one hand while typing with the other. The double-click scheme works well, I had no difficulty resizing windows and dragging and dropping. One ding for old-timers is that <esc> requires a 2nd function key. If you use an old editor like vi or vim under Linux, changing from insert mode back to command mode requires an additional keypress, which is counter-intuitive if you are not accustomed to it. If you count on auto-fill for speedy entry, the <tab> key is a one-press and quicker than <esc>.",
