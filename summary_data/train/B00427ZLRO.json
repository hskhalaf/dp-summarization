As I look over the mass of my work for the last four years, most of it has been shot with this little camera, and I have made beautiful ANSI C size prints from the files. It is an amazing little beast, that I would not be without! The RAW files are easy to work with within ACR. The newest camera in this series (Coolpix 7800) has an electronic viewfinder and a slightly higher pixel density CMOS sensor. I am almost tempted, but I think I will stay with the 7100 for now.",

The auto systems on this camera are spot on for amateurs without the study and experimentation that a DSLR needs. I didn't start shooting digital until the early 2000's and have always used Nikon, with respect to all brands of camera users. I also shot medium format for my important clients with the Mamiya RB 67 Pro SD and the Mamiya m645. If I did not retouch these photos in the dark room I would say the photos the P7000 take, out of the box as any proofs, before retouching, are extremely good.",

      "text": "This is the camera that pros and semi-pros will want to take on vacation. The P7000 is only slightly larger than a point-and-shoot (P&S) camera, but offers the creative control and image quality of an SLR. Novice users can leave all the controls in \"auto\" and get great results. Experimenting with the \"scene\" and user settings can overcome the problems that spoil difficult shots. Some museums and theme park PR people get nervous when professional SLRs is pulled out; no problem here. At first glance, the camera is just a point-and-shoot camera. The large, 10-meg sensor and Nikkor lens produce terrific images. A great buy for P&S owners who are ready to expand their creativity.",

I found it difficult to shoot manually, or on aperture/shutter priority. Just don't think the controls/menu are very user friendly. Also, for some reason, the images quite often turn out over-exposed so I end up setting the dial to underexpose up to 1 stop. Camera seems to suck down battery life. Lately the battery has been dying with the lens extended in the middle of a shot. Maybe Nikon has improved on this camera with the P7100, but I would not give it a try based on this experience.",

I have to turn the camera off and back on when the zoom control fails. Camera is slow. Auto focus may be ok, but it is hard to tell until you open the pictures in a program such as Photoshop. I didn't expect these problems from Nikon and wouldn't accept these issues in any camera at any price.",

The price was good, all the paperwork and extras were included in the box, and the camera, used by me extensively in many settings over Christmas vacation, seemed just as good as new. There was a 30 day guarantee, but I didn't need it.. Hooray for Amazon that connects a needy buyer with a refurbished product that matches her needs.",

You need to use your fingers to open it fully, precious moments would be lost, you'll get annoyed. Sometimes you'd forget about it and will have dark corners in photos. Do you need this in your camera? Other that this problem the camera is not bad. Should've chosen G12. I chose this camera over G12 because of -bigger zoom -changing zoom during video -IR remote -price. Do yourself a favor and look somewhere else.",

Trying to ignore the manual and figure it out for yourself can result in lost once in a lifetime shots or damaging the camera. I'm loving it now.

Shooting indoor without a flash is futile. Focusing took forever and still didn't get it right. In all cases the write speed was slow. I'm surprised Nikon put this product out.
