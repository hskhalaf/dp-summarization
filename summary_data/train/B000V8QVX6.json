I unplug it when we are not using it, even when the car is off because I haven't seen an off button. But it does have a timer of 30 minutes or 45 minutes so that is nice.

Warms up quickly in frigid weather, uses her truck's cigarette lighter slot to energize it and, best o all, shuts off after she leaves the vehicle so the battery doesn't drain needlessly. Keeps her legs toasty warn and, a side benefit, can keep the take home dinner very warm so one doesn't have to zap it in the microwave. Very good purchase.",

It is at the end of a long cord and breaks very easily when it drops and hits the concrete floor. We were able to repair it a couple times, but had to buy a second when we could no longer repair the cigarette lighter power connector.",

This works excellent as that little extra warmth you always need on a boat for drafts where you want to sleep. Great buy for the money.",

You'll be surprised! It heats twice as fast as the car's heater when the car and the blanket are started at the same time. It works well for me. My only complaint: it's not machine washable or dryable -- and it loads with static easily. I have not tried static-guard or anything like that on it yet -- maybe that'll help. For the price -- an excellent product!",

Great warmth and functionality for the price. Well made. Good length of cord. Like the timer options to keep the blanket from staying on too long and wasting battery life.",
