      "text": "This product is very expensive. Mars Wisdom #2 gave me more information, including weight prediction and basic health issues as well as breed determination. Embark was limited to breed determination. For the price of $129 vs $79 for Mars Wisdom #2, it was not worth it. When I called to at least get a weight prediction, I was told that was an \"upgrade of extra $99\" for trait and health. Very pricey. Will not use again as I am an animal rescuer and use a DNA test a lot. Will not recommend.",

It only took 3 weeks for myself though! For the life of us we could not figure out what our mutt was, well obviously there was no way! she's so split on everything! Very satisfied with my dogs results and could not be happier!",
