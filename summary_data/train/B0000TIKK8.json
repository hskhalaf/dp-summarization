I went to watch store and got the battery replaced for $6 because I like that this one has different colors for the hour hand and the minute hand as my daughter is just learning how to tell time. Also, this watch is supposed to be water resistant. We haven't tested that yet. Fingers crossed.",

The stretch band on this one makes it much easier for her to take off and put back on. She has said that the ticking does keep her awake at night, but I expect that would be true on pretty much any watch. I've had several Timex watches over the years and they always seem to wear well. I am overall pretty happy with the watch and it has helped my daughter get better at telling time.",

      "text": "For a \"beginner\" watch for a child learning to tell time, this watch could confuse them. Instead of the minutes past 30 being marked as 35-40-45-50, etc. They begin to count down, so 25-20-15-10. etc. VERY confusing for a 7 year old. 3:40 was looking like 3:20 to her, thanks to the markings on the watch. It made me sad to see her so frustrated. I used it as a learning tool to teach \"20 minutes till 4\" but that was over her head as she is still trying to grasp counting minutes on the clock. I will be buying her a new watch that doesn't confuse her.",

      "text": "The watch is a typically reliable Timex analog timepiece. The floral design is fairly appealing. I would have given that combination four stars if it weren't for the deficiencies with the band. First, the closing mechanism is the kind you find on some sports caps which require two hands for adjustments. This band requires that you take off the watch to change the size which is a hassle for anyone especially for children. That's bad enough but what makes it worse is that the closing mechanism is poorly made so it often doesn't lock properly. I would have returned this watch but didn't because my 8 year old lost it on the playground after taking it off for adjustments.",

The wrist band is really well designed, it stretches and adjusts making it easy for her to slide it on/off, a crucial element (also it's inexpensive so should she slide it off at the movies it's not the end of the world).

It seems to be well-made, and so far is keeping perfect time.

My only complaint is the adjustment on the strap is a bit 'slippery' and when she puts it on it will slip to a slightly larger adjustment from time to time. My son has a similar band on his camo timex and it doesn't have this issue. Once the band gets a little wear to it like his, it won't be so slick and things will work out ok. Beyond that, it's a durable kid's watch. Better than anything else I've seen in stores that cost more. (I've tried them and they invariably break rather quickly)",
