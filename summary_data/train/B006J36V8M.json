      "text": "Pretty good coin sorter. It does occasionally get jammed, but most mini-jams clear very quickly by just reversing the handle. Most difficult jams are cause by odd coins (or other debris) getting stuck - I had a big bag of coins w a few small euro coins and Guatemalan quezal in the bag apparently. The foreign coins caused serious jams that required several minutes to clear. Also a Bobby pin. I also found it works best if you don\u2019t get too ambitious with the number of coins you drop in at once.",

You have to go slow with it as if it gets stuck just crank the opposite way for half a crank and it gets unstuck. Now I save all my change for vacations and have them all rolled when I bring them into the bank",
