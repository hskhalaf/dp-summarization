I bought the refurbished one. Works great! Worth the the price savings.",

I have my speaker connected to a pc via bluetooth and the problem I'm having is that when watching something online, if I open a new window, the sound shuts down for 30-60 seconds...then starts back up. I don't know if this is a function of the bluetooth connectivity or my pc which is newish and runs the latest OS or the speaker. Very annoying since I am use to multi tasking. If anyone knows, feel free to comment on my review. I may have to resort to wired speakers and use this mini in another room with my iphone.",

I can use my logitech speaker for four or five hours and then leave it on without any music playing for another four or five before it starts chirping (its signal that it's about to die).",

However, if you want a speaker that can reach more than a large living room over some overhead noise, then you'll probably want to get the big boom. Overall, great product for the price!",

The support staff at Logitech was very helpful in working through possible solutions, but it still doesn't work. I have been approved for a replacement, but after weeks it still hasn't been shipped. Logitech no longer makes this speaker, so will be replacing it with an upgraded model. My advice is not to buy this speaker from third parties. I liked the size, price, simple set up, etc. but mine simply didn't work and has yet to be replaced.",

Great for travel -Build in rechargeable battery that last up to 10 hours -Great sound considering its size -Input line if you don't want to use bluetooth -Speakerphone Capabilities -Can be paired with another UE -Nice rubberized coating -Price Cons: -Will not charge your device -No auto shut off feature The bottom line: The UE delivers big sound for music, ebooks, netflix, etc via blue tooth or line in from you iphone or device of your choice. Considering its price, size, and suprising big sound, I would recommend the UE for those looking for a portable bluetooth speaker with great sound.",

I'm mostly using it for playing music outdoors - on the sidelines of Ultimate Frisbee, hanging out at the pool, family picnics, outdoor gaming, etc. I wanted a speaker that would be small enough to not take up much space in my bag but still loud enough to make it worth bringing. This little guy has an impressive volume for its size, and doesn't sound tinny at all - it's drastically better than the speakers in the $30-$40 range. Pairing it with my phone was effortless, and I've been very impressed with how long it holds a charge. Well worth the cost, in my opinion.",

It had been on my office shelf the rest of the year - not in the elements or a cold room.

Most discouraging thing is the delay when watching video. Lips are not in sync. This is apparently true of all bluetooth devices, to some extend or another. It has a jack for direct wiring that eliminates the issue, if the device you are using has a headphone jack for output.",
