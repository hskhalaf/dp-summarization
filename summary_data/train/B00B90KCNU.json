In the end I was talked through creating a report to send to the tech. Per the tech, it may take 24 to 48 hours to see if this issue can be resolved. At least I'm exhausting all of my avenues.

It was unlocked as specified but I couldn't use data services due to locked (verizon) APN settings. However, this was resolved with an OS upgrade. Finally, if I'm running an app (especially a high graphic game) the surface of the phone gets hot to the touch and making a call can be uncomfortable.",

I don't even bother typing with 2 hands because 1 handed typing it so efficient and fun with flicking words. The word prediction works great too. Highly Recommended. Get your Z10 now!",

The on/off button does work, I have to remove the battery from the phone to shut it off. I was so excited about this phone and am so disappointed it didn't work. Am curious as to whether these phones are tested before shipping. How can anyone not check? Unacceptable.",
