They have to truly be invested to take these off and get to the knob. They are a little annoying for grown-ups to always have to remove to use the stove, but worth it. Why gas stoves ever put the knobs within child's reach is beyond me. Hmmm... a little dial you can turn and release flammable gas into your house, that seems crazy dangerous and I am normally on the spectrum of, \"eh, go play in the street kid, you will be fine.\"",

They needed some tool work to make it fit (cutting a small slit near the bottom to the left or right of the hinge so it would expand enough to fit around and behind the metal ring behind the knob, as well as cutting out the small strip that latches it in place -- which is fine since it's such a tight fit that friction holds it closed just fine), but it's better than having the dog turn on the stove when we're not home.",
