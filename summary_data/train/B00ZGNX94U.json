Excellent for use with your phone as they are very efficient. The Mic sounds great. You can also skip the track forward with a double click. Stock sound is as if the highs are hidden behind some veil. It is as if they are accurate but somehow out of reach. They are! Just remove the ear cushions. There is a small piece of foam glued to the plastic in front of the drivers. Simply pull it off. The sound will open up and sparkle. No worries if sibilance or fatigue. Turns the headphones from 3 stars to 4+.",

Several good reviews are available on YouTube.The wiring that goes to both sides may not be everyone's preference, but this design does not require wiring through the headphone body, and allows both sides to receive equal signalling. All material is of very high quality -- I expect these earphones to last. Reasonably comfortable, but I would have liked a slightly bigger earmuff so it is not so close surrounding my ears, and a few mm thicker padding would have been nice.",

Although, because there are alot of bots on this product I do need to give an honest review of these because they are not honest in their description. There is no real wood on these headphones. It's plastic with a wood grain detail on it. They are technically 'on the ear' headphones, for someone with large ears. They're not as heavy duty as they look. Very light weight which is a plus for me, but maybe not for everyone.",

It almost matches the performance of an ATH-M30 that i own.Sound is a little \"boxy\"; not sure if it's because of the wood or not, but i like it. 2. Great bass response. 3. Physical design is good. The wood definitely makes it look premium The bad: 1. The cords are very flimsy, and they don't tightly couple with the headset. Any movement results in distortions. 2. These should not be called \"circumaural\". They're more like on-ear headphones; but still pretty comfortable. Not sure if i can wear these for long hours though Overall: Great buy for the money",

Kara, from Symphonized responded to.my message in less than 24-hours. She then made my day by telling me that Symphonized would send me a cable, free of charge. I didn't even pay postage. Better still, when the package arrived today, they sent 2 cables. How often does a company exceed expectations anymore?",

Awesome as production headphones, as in listing to audio in camera for film shoots, and they even feel better. Highly recommended.",

Looks, the wood is very premium looking and goes very well with the metal frame. High quality construction and very sleek. The adjustable band slides up and down smoothly. I am overly satisfied with these, and especially for this price. Highly recommend this if you are looking for more unique headphones. It even comes with an extra cable with a mic. This over beats any day! Enjoy!",

Whenever it would rub on my clothes or if I would touch it, I would hear some sort of feedback through the earcups. If you like bass (which I am indifferent to) these are for you. There is a lot of it. Close to too much. These might be for someone but they just weren't for me.",
