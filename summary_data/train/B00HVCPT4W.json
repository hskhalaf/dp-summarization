      "text": "These bins are awesome! I bought them to pack, keep in the garage, and be ready to throw in the trunk of the car at a moment's notice. Forbins fit easily in the back of my SUV, and hold a good amount of stuff even though they're not overly huge and cumbersome. Plano always makes great storage units for all kinds of things, and these bins are no different. The price on Amazon is wonderful for this product, and I highly recommend them for things that are going to be thrown around and don't have to be treated delicately. I just feel bad for our mail person having to deliver such a huge box! :D",

I actually have two of these, one in each of my two vehicles. I have recommended them to two other firefighters that like them as well. The latches can be a little bit of a pain to get them close completely because the sidewalls flex, but its a minor inconvenience. I think I may purchase more for hunting gear and things like that.",

It is not shock-absorbent or insulated at all. Depending on what you need it for, this should work for you. If you just need a plastic, lockable, durable tote, this is it. If you want anything more, look elsewhere.",

The channel had been stretched so much that the latch drooped and wouldn\u2019t click into place. Furthermore it looked as though the plastic had stretched so much that it was thinner at the latch joint and could break easily. The latch on the opposite side was sturdier and had not stretched.

In fact, the sticker on the side of the bin shows an OD green one. So just know that green actually means dark grey when ordering.",
