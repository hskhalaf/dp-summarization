The photo print is very good, better than my loyal HP 970, is not perfect, but is really nice. I recomend this printer for many users at home or office.",

Network setup was easy and works great in this area; however, I felt as I took a downgrade from my previous printer. Software is bloated and causes all type of problems, even with all three being HP laptops, tech support is not much of help and no auto document feeder for fax or scanning. Regular text print quality is great, and photo quality is great as long as you don't use the HP papers, Canon or Epson papers highly recommended. Overall, I'm happy with using it as a network printer and have learned to live with other shortcomings.",

The printer does not have a feeder tray for multi-page faxes or copies. You must load one sheet at a time on the flatbed screen. 2. I just recently ran through 5 color cartridges in an attempt to print 150 color copies. The kicker is that my document's main color was green. So, when that ran out, I had to replace the entire cartridge. That was pretty irritating to me.",

CON: 366 days after I purchased this printer the scanning mechanism broke and scanning and copying features ceased. The folks at HP offered me 15% coupon towards the purchase of a new printer, but little else in the line of help. The scanner was used less than 50 times over the life of the product. I have heard from a number of people in stores that these printers are notorious for this problem. Bottom line, if you have the funds to replace annually this is a great printer, otherwise I would recommend looking elsewhere.",

I can't even scan from the scanner itself even though the printer finds the network. After uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers and many calls to tech support, still doesn't work. I don't see why anyone should purchase this printer. It prints decently but is severely flawed as an all-in-one solution.",

After lengthy investigation with tech support, we determined that problem was interference from McAfee during install (although I had 'disabled' it). Uninstalled Mcafee, reinstalled software; now works perfectly. An excellent product! I just wish tech support was in the US (got a follow-up call from them at 1:00 am this morning!).",

I recommend doing the minimal software install.
