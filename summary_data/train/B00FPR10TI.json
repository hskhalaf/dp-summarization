      "title": "Works fine as a level",
      "text": "Works fine as a level, fairly bright and narrow laser line. A big plus is that the self-leveling function can be turned off and the cross hairs left on. This is very handy for projecting perpendicular lines on a wall, floor, or ceiling. Perfect for tile work. You can even rotate the cross hairs, e.g. for a diagonal pattern. Other pluses are the threaded mounting hole for use on a camera tripod, and the articulated arm which permits projecting lines in any position or angle. Bottom line - if I lost this one, would I buy another? Yes. Well designed, easy to use, well priced.",

The problem is the laser light is not strong. With any light (be in sunlight or lamplight), I can barely see the laser unless it's within 3-4 feet of what I'm pointing it at. For the price in comparison to other products of the same nature, I would still recommend this as I'm sure you can make it work, but improving the visibility of the actual laser would make this a 5-star product.",

Instead of using levels and tapes, I can get out my adjustable height ladder and set the laser at the height I need and just start hanging. Max range in normal light is about 20', it starts to get dim after that. I haven't used it outside yet, but it probably is not bright enough under most conditions. However, its a great indoor small project self leveling laser. The level also has a separate mode non-self leveling mode, where it will \"paint\" a straight line based on the orientation of the laser.",

My only complaint is that the unit needs to be fairly far back to cast a laser on the ceiling to run the distance needed. It seems about 3-4ft in front of the unit will not display the beam on the ceiling. It is not horrible but something to keep in mind for tight spots. Makes getting plum walls easy. The mount is nice too plan to use it for setting my outlet box's hight for given walls.",

That is when I discovered that the only part Bosch will sell you is the battery cover. I resolved to just replace it with something less costly, and bought this Stanley. It does exactly what the Bosch does for less. We'll see how it holds up, but I am happy with it so far.",
