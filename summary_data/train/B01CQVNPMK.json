We thought it was defective at first and we would need to replace it, which was frustrating. Removing the front wheels and lubricating the posts and mating surfaces with some silicone grease fixed the problem and made a night and day difference to maneuverability. Hope that helps if any others have the same problem. Other than that it works great and the ability to switch back and forth from the car seat to the stroller, and the ability to change the direction baby faces are really nice features.",

I wish I could return to amazon and get my money back but it's too late to return. Britax is sending me a replacement and I hope I don't have the same problems.

It was great for the first two weeks and all of a sudden the front wheels are very hard to steer. I've tried removing things from the stroller (child included), taking off the wheels and putting them back on, unlocking/locking the front wheels and it still is hard to push. I'm very disappointed because it was not a cheap stroller. I'm going to reach out to Britax and hopefully they have a solution, otherwise we are stuck with a hard to turn stroller. Other than the steering it is great, very convenient. However, steering is a major part of strollers.",

You can simply pull the handle bar towards you and the front wheels automatically \u201cshoot out\u201d while the stroller is folded and sitting upright on the ground. Great design. Smooth rolling too. We were going to buy the uppa but just couldn\u2019t justify the extra cost when this one was so amazing.",

      "text": "Folds easily, and the coordinating infant carseats (anything by Britax) snap in and out with little to no effort. Very light as well. The seat that comes with it detaches easily, and this is also the model that will fit the child snack tray and stroller organizers/attachments (which is convenient). It fits neatly into the trunk of our compact car with extra room to spare, so it isn't a massive space-hog either. The material is high quality, and the storage compartments are durable and well-secured, so no worrying about things falling out. I'd definitely recommend this stroller for new moms.",
