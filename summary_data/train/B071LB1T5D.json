The snips do get more dull as they are used but lasted just as long as a $12 pair of Testors brand snips. The exacto style blade will not last past a single model build, but again, the cost of the whole kit is about what an Exacto brand blade costs. The files are durable and very useful and the fact that a metal file is included is great. The tweezers are very pointy and perfect for decal application. This is a great beginner's kit and an exceptional value.",

The thicker filing stick is the one you'll want to use more than not when sanding down nub marks on your kit ,as the thinner one will mark up your plastic quite a bit. Even then that's more my fault than anyone else's. Inexpensive and convinient. If you're looking for a hobby kit to get your hands dirty with gunpla I would highly recommend this!",

I have put together a whole army of Warhammer figurines after purchasing this set, and the combination of the precision cutters, precision knife, and various grits of emery boards have helped me tremendously for making them look professionally assembled. This kit has everything you need to prep models for display-level quality. My only complaint is that the emery boards seem to wear out quick when using them, however they still get the job done well. And the knife isn't the sharpest, however, it still gets done what is needed as well.",

It was a tedious process and produced countless little flakes of plastic. The clipper in this set changed my life. It can get right up against the pieces and it's so sharp that it makes a clean cut every time. I rarely have to touch up the pieces after cutting them out. I haven't used the other tools yet, but the clipper alone makes this a fantastic buy for anyone looking to build models.",

The blades that come with it are so dull your going to struggle to get any mold lines with it. The remaining tools are pretty okay, but those two pieces are pretty important so them being trash kinda ruins this kit.",
