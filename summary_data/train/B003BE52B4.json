The color is lovely, the texture makes it look like naturally healthy lips, and if you apply several layers, letting it dry in between, you can make it darker, but it just doesn't last long enough. You'd do better to apply beet juice with a Q-tip than to use this. If you like looking at yourself in the mirror and applying this light tint several times an hour, and if you don't actually have to get any work done, it's perfect, but otherwise, don't waste your money. It is lovely and very natural looking as a blush.",

So you put it on, and need to give it like 3 minutes or so to dry. It's very matte once dry. After that, I then layer on lip gloss on top of it (I prefer Mary Kay, with the tube and wand). It stays on all day, even after eating or drinking, way more so than if I did the lip gloss alone. I can't really comment on the product if worn by itself, because I don't really like the matte look on my lips.",

I've eaten and drank with it on with no need to reapply! You can put chapstick or lip gloss over top to make it glossy or shiny. This is truly a great product, especially if you find yourself constantly reapplying lipstick, no need to with this stain!",
