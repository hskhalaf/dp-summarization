After enduring the tedious process of unwrapping and only getting 5 done in about 30 minutes, I came up with a solution! I soaked them in a bowl of warm soapy water, and rinsed the paper off under running water.",

Thankfully, I had no broken pieces and handled them very gingerly based off the reviews and the experience of some folks having had broken pieces. If you handle with care, these icicles are well worth it.",

These are really lovely. There are a few different types/sizes/styles that come in this order. They are big enough that they add a really classic touch but not so big that they weight down branches or detract from other decorations. Caution: they do break somewhat easily. I had one fall off our tree from a height of less than a foot and it snapped. The good news is that it didn't splinter. Would recommend.",
