It\u2019s usually a more vibrant green but this one was pale green. Anyway, I started using it and became really sick and nasaeous. This never happened before. I continued to use it and the symptoms just became worse. A week later after I stopped using it, I feel better. My point is that make sure your protein is not pale and that it is a rich green color.",

You can't open it all the way without having to make some sort of tear or cut. I would much rather have a recyclable tub that has a little less in it. To be honest the \"value\" you get from the bag is not enough to actually make a difference.",

If you're looking for an fiber supplement, go for it. I wanted a complete protein with the fatty acids needed to properly utilize the protein. Hemp seed is amazing for you because of the oils, but without the oils, it's really just fiber. I'll stick with psyllium husk for fiber and went with a whole milled hemp seed for protein.",

It's quite good in smoothies though and being plant-based, I'm used to the earthy taste -- it's only truly prominent when consuming with just water anyway. Keeps me full for hours.",

This is my second time ordering the product and the bag does not close properly because the plastic lining design is very inefficient. The first time I ordered it, I struggled to close it every time, the second package, doesn't close at all. Trader Joe's sells nutritional yeast, and I wish vendors who use these type of packaging (the bags) would learn from trader joe's - they have a seemingly velcro closing design which ensures the package closes properly.",
