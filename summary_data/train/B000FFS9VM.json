I had an older model Graco lightweight stroller for my now 10 year old that was much more comfortable and better made. I figured Chicco could at least make a comparable product but it also feels cheaper and less sturdy. Disappointed.",

It is light, doesn't lay flat but does support the baby enough so the head doesn't fall forward when sleeping. It is good on pavement walk way, not really for off the road type of use. The handle is not very comfortable when pushing for longer than 45 min, but easy to carry when in collapse position.",

This stroller is wonderful!!! It is very easy to fold, lightweight and has a carry strap for easy transport. Shade is removeable. 2 position recline is sufficient-it does not fully recline. 5 point harness is perfect. My only issues would be a small basket size (although not unexpected given the type of stroller)-I can still fit a small diaper bag in the basket and when folded, the wheels touch the stroller canopy which gets the canopy dirty when then wheels are wet or dirty.

But, she bought it despite those things and still likes it. Sturdy. Super lightweight. Easy to open/close. One issue she's uncovered is that it is difficult to push with one hand. That would be a problem with any umbrella stroller, however, because the handle bars are not connected.",

      "text": "It's much stronger than any stroller from a dollar store but it's terrible anyway. My back hurts from bending because the handles are too short and they don't extend. I keep kicking the wheels and I am afraid I might trip if walking too fast (they are set apart rather narrowly). It is difficult too buckle up, the middle strap's (the one between legs) buckle is sitting way too low and I would add a remowable front bar to protect a child from falling out. Looking for a replacement and no, I do not recommend this product.",

      "text": "The Capri Lightweight stroller is a good balance between weight, size and durability. We took it overseas to visit family and it held up to the rigors of travel well. Our son loves using it. The only reason for the 4 star review is that for me it isn't quite tall enough, but to be fair I'm 6' 8\". I would say anyone 6' 4\" or shorter would be able to comfortably push this stroller. It's super easy to fold away and has a basic reclining feature which works well for longer uses. I would purchase it again for travel, but at my size I'll be using our full-sized stroller more often.",

You would think with time they would get better but in this case they did not. The product is still made well but the features have been tampered with. They are no longer made for tall people, with long handles and they no longer recline all the way back for sleeping. instead handles are shorter and stroller only reclines have way down. Why mess with a good thing. Its no longer quality that matters but quantity. Its sad.",
