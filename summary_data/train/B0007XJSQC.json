I could instantly tell that the 2 versions were different. Either Sennheiser's quality has gone downhill in 2 years, or the ones I received were fake. The band was smaller, the plastic was borderline delicate, and the sound randomly shorted in and out when I plugged them into my PC for an hour. Not what I expect from Sennheiser. I'm just ordering replacement pads for my 'old' 201s, which are about 3x sturdier than what I received. Buyer beware, I guess.",

I honestly cannot believe Sennheiser puts their name on them. Sure, they were inexpensive, but I never imagined they would be this horrible. I see another one star review, making a similer complaint, so ?i know it isn't just me. Buy these at your own risk!",

In the time I have used them, they seem okay, but they just look like a nightmare in terms of being destroyed under normal wear conditions. For the price this is a non-issue.

While this is probably great for most, I find that since the cushion sits on the arms of my glasses and squeaks against the plastic. It squeaks with the slightest movement- even just breathing. After these die- because for $15 they won't last forever- I might go back to headphones that sit on the ear. Those never squeaked against the glasses.",

It is cheap and nice to use if you don't care about hearing every detail of sounds.

      "text": "I am pretty impressed with these headphones for the month or so that I've used them. This $20 set of cans sounds almost as good as a pair of $100 Audio Technica that I own. Build quality is pretty impressive too, again considering the modest price, and they are quite comfortable as well. The only flaw that I can see is the cord, which is very thin, and I suspect, without proper care, will result in one of the headphones going out after a time. So you do need be careful with them. Other than, an absolute bargain at $20!",

The bass is enough and voices are crystal clear. So far no \"hissing\" sound that some reviewers mentioned. Although the headphones itself do not feel physically as sturdy as some other higher-end models, for the price you can easliy afford to purchase a replacement if needed. Overall I'd say a great buy.",

We found a little thing online that allowed her to wind up a portion of the cord to allow it to be more manageable. She said the sound is great, and she listens mostly to Naturescapes while studying.",

Of course, they are probably not ideal for listening on the go inconspicuously but they are great for watching movies, listening to music, or playing games late at night without getting sound complaints from your neighbors.",

At times the bottom end sounds a little boxy and is not as clear as I would want. Other than that they seem to do a good job. If you are looking for something in the way of a low cost headphone you could do worse as I have tried several other manufacturers.",
