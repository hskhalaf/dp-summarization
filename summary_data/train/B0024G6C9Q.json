      "text": "This is a great ski rope!! We had purchased a ski rope at a boat marina that the owners recommended and it was crap. Fell apart and frayed after one use. This rope is wonderful. Very easy to see and visible on the handle floats. The handle is one you can grip and is not slick, so your hands don't slip off. This is a sturdier and thicker rope than the one purchased at the marina and it is what we needed as we are teaching beginner skiers. Very pleased with this rope!!",

The different colors are cool, and helpful to adjust for different riders. One big downside for me is that the HANDLE DOES NOT FLOAT. So many times a downed rider can't locate the rope because it has sunk, only to pull it up with weeds all over it. I'm looking for a new rope right now, and will not buy this one again. It is still a decent value, but you get what you pay for",
