I'm sure this is why this product is so inexpensive. My video shows the actual response time. You can see there is much more regular polyurethane foam than memory foam. I like the gel swirl foams because the mix of foams sleep cooler. I was just expecting a different ratio. There needs to be more regulation of foam bedding. In particular, manufacturers need to start indicating the ratios of foam types along with density. Good gel foam is hard to find in one-off sheets",

The bad, the product arrived badly packaged, it had a small tear and one area was squished flat, I doubt it will regain its proper height. The odor coming off of the product was very very strong. 24 hours later still pretty stinky although I imagine it will dissipate. So I'm okay with the issues, although more considerate packing would have prevented any damage at all. Definitely open it in a room where you can air it out for a while maybe several days. My sister was also knocked over by the odor.",

With this topper there is no residual \"memory\" indentation left in the foam--your handprint disappears immediately as the surface of the foam springs back to its original shape.
