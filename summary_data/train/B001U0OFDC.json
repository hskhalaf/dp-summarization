It was easy to change the settings on this however, my biggest problem is that, this is more of a distraction to me than it is helpful. It gives me an error message about 5times during my workouts about my HR signals. It just pointless, I have to keep checking it to ensure that its working which takes time off my workout time in the morning. I had higher expectations purchasing this but I must say am disappointed. The only thing is that, am now using it more as a wrist watch than a HR monitior",

It tracks calories burned too so you can see if you have to work harder to burn more calories. This is a pretty basic model but it's all I really need. I use a program on my phone to track distance for my walks and rides since I keep my phone on me anyway.",

One worked out of the box, but the other required a change of battery of both the watch unit (CR1632) and the chest strap (CR2025). These thankfully are user-changeable and don't require you to send it off to a service center. After a change of battery, the unit worked OK. Just keep in mind that this bumps up the true initial cost of the FT7 to $100+, depending on how cheaply you can buy these batteries. Will update review in a few months to comment on longevity.",

Polar's customer service was quick and kind. I cannot speak for any other product in their line, but this specific one is a dud in my experience.",

Seriously, if 44 inches or more (I think) of chest size, you need the big strap, which amazon does not seem to sell with the watch. Other websites sell the watch with option of chest strap size for a comparable size.",
