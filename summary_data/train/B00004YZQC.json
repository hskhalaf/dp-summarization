The tool does what it needs to do but the punch just barely lands on the cutting pad. The back edge of the punch is right where the pad\u2019s radius starts. There is also a lever intended to lock the tool closed, but the rivet that it pivots on is mis-located so that feature doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s a shame that the Chinese can do it tight for half the price, but that\u2019s what has happened to American manufacturing.",

There were several options and this one seemed to be the best value. When I got it, it worked as advertised. Another reviewer suggested putting a piece of denim under the belt. I think that is a good suggestion. It makes it easier to punch through the leather and will probably prolong the life of the punch. The cost of this tool is about half of what I spend on a single belt. I was able to save 7-8 belts. Nice!",

Only other thing I recommend is to be sure your hole lines up with the other ones; take the time to measure and place the hole approximate to the other holes in line(on my 2 belts, they were 2.5 cm/1 inch apart).

Even a male's hand strength was not sufficient to make a hole in 2 ordinary thicknesses of leather - a strap on a special shoe. The design is like the old models, but the quality of the hole punches is lacking.",

      "text": "This hole punch is easy to use, and makes holes in a variety of materials. The hole punch needs to be cleaned out periodically or it does not make a clean hole. I've been using a very small screwdriver to clear out the excess material from the punch. It doesn't take much force to use, and works like it should. I accidentally broke one of the punches when it hit metal instead of the plastic I was trying to cut. I'm not bothered though, because there are several more sizes that can still be used.",

It's well constructed, the hole punch knobs are sharp and hey, even my puppy is happy with the results!",
