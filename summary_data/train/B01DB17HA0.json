My three year old always takes out the whole drawer trying to open it. I would not buy this product again or suggest it to friends and family.",

It\u2019s your average plastic that you see on most toys that you can tell isn\u2019t the quality it should be but the toy is still nice. Should it be cheaper? Yes. I purchased additional toys to go along with it as the pictures show accessories that don\u2019t come with it. I planned ahead for that and if you plan to purchase you probably should too as the toy wouldn\u2019t be as fun without accessories. I got Doc McStuffins and the plush crew that fit in the bottom tray of the cart. It keeps the toys neatly where they are supposed to be for a good play time.",

Everything else about this toy is awesome. We just don't turn the volume on at all which was part of the appeal of the toy.

The volume is Very loud and there\u2019s no volume switch. It\u2019s on or off. 2. The X-ray part on the top has a piece that\u2019s interchangeable, but it\u2019s really hard to get in and out...even for the adults. 3. The drawer doesn\u2019t slide in or out very easily.
