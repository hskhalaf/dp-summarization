Featuring a range of new features, the Xperia S is a handset that offers the latest in convergence technology.Debuting Sony\u2019s \u2018Iconic Identity\u2019 design approach, the Xperia S sports a look that is instantly recognisable across all of the Xperia NXT series. A transparent element at the base of the phone creates an iconic silhouette, emphasizing and underlining the display. The element also integrates the phone\u2019s antenna component and creates illumination effects. The Xperia S is the most powerful Sony handset released to date, featuring a 1.5GHz dual-core processor and 1GB of RAM. While there is no MicroSD slot, there is 32GB of internal storage and, with cloud storage becoming ever more important, we may see an offer similar to Box\u2019s 50GB of free storage for Sony Ericsson devices that is currently available.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n(View Larger.)

It features a cleaner, more refined interface with new icons, improved top notification bar, and more intuitive navigation. \n   \n   Multitasking in Gingerbread allows you the ability to run more than one app at a time. If you're playing a game, you can easily switch to an incoming e-mail and then switch back to the game without losing your place. And like the previous version of Android (\"Froyo\"), Gingerbread provides support for Adobe Flash Player 10.1 for access to the full Web. \n   \n   A new onscreen keyboard makes it easier to type thanks to additional spacing between the keys and larger font sizes. And the more you use the keyboard, the easier typing will be as the enhanced suggest feature records previous input history to make better suggestions.\n   \n   The Xperia S also brings one-touch access to the popular Google mobile services you use every day. It also provides easy access to both personal and corporate e-mail, calendars, and contacts supported by Exchange Server and Gmail. And through the Google Play store, you'll get access to thousands of useful applications, widgets, and fun games to download and install on your phone, with many more apps being added every day.\n   \n   GOOGLE INTEGRATION\n    * Google Play store for browsing and downloading thousands of free and paid apps \n    * Pre-loaded Android apps: Browser, Calculator, Calendar (Google or Corporate), Camera, Clock, Contacts, Email, Gallery, Messaging, Music, News & Weather, Phone, Settings, Video Player, Voice Dialer, Voice Search, YouTube \n    * Google applications: Gmail, Google Search, Google Voice Search, Google Latitude, Google Maps, Google Places, Google Talk \n    * Google Maps Navigation with spoken turn-by-turn directions showing real-time traffic and 360\u00b0 views of the destination \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   UNLOCKED PHONE\n   This unlocked cell phone can be used with a GSM network service provider. It does not come with a SIM card, and it requires that you provide a SIM card for usage with your selected service provider. \n   \n   This phone can be paired with 800/850/1800/1900 MHz UMTS/HSPA 3G networks in the United States (as well as 900/2100 MHz 3G networks found around the world, including in Europe and Asia). In areas not served by a 3G network, you'll continue to receive 2G data service via the EDGE network (depending on network compatibility).\n   \n   Note that the downloading of maps, games, music and videos and uploading of images and videos involves transferring large amounts of data. Your service provider may charge for the data transmission, and the availability of particular services and features may vary by carrier. \n   \n   This phone comes with a full manufacturer's warranty (1-year).",
