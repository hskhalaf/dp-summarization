It's a real shame too, since the jacket seemed to be really well made with thick leather, and a nice thick removable liner inside. Lots of pockets, too. The crazy thing is that when I was looking at a replacement in a larger size, I saw a sizing chart that went up to 12X! Perhaps I would try that, but they apparently don't sell larger than 5X on Amazon. Too bad, returning.",

      "text": "This jacket is top quality and made of a heavy leather. I had a jacket similar to this but outgrew it. I'm hoping this one will last just as long. If there was one gripe I had with this jacket is that the liner is useless to me, it's not going to keep you warm if that's why it's in there. Not enough to take away a star in my opinion. It has heavy duty zippers that should not break on you. I recommend this jacket if it's your style, or you could go to the Harley dealer and spend 3X as much for the same quality.",

It'll get better when it wears in more, so it's not a big deal but it's the only complaint I got.",

There is a nylon liner underneath the zip-out portion, so it is still comfortable to wear without the liner. I added a bullet zipper pull to the main zipper, as it is difficult to grab with my motorcycle gloves on. Aside from that, the jacket is perfect for what I need. Highly recommend this product!",

Seems as though they try to their best to never give out refunds as I\u2019ve had longing email conversations with their support, they told me that they would refund me once the jacket is returned, so I shipped it back to them with the label they provided. The jacket is good quality, I just had some measurement problems which is why I sent it back. The real issue is I\u2019m at a lost of around 130$ with no jacket either. \ud83d\ude21",
