Was wanting to use at work but I need to carry things so I have to let go of cane sometimes and it would be more of a challenge to have to pick up the cane . it has three tips on bottom...maybe four would work better. If you really watch it and aren't distracted by other things it can be good. At home it's easier to lean against something so I won't have to pick it up.",

      "text": "I broke my hip 7 weeks ago. 2 weeks ago I transitioned to this cane from a walker. I bought it because it was Amazon's highest rated product. More money that other canes. With just 2 weeks of use, the handle broke. This was 1 day after the return policy ended. I have contacted Amazon and they will be sending me a replacement. They would not do a refund. Replacement is acceptable. I did find it to be somewhat stable and I have never folded it up once I put it together. It does fall over frequently if I do not lean it against something. But, I think most canes would be the same.",

    "title": "HurryCane Freedom Edition Folding Cane with T Handle, Original Black",
    "description": "Color:Original BlackThe #1 selling cane on Amazon just got better! This is the cane that is featured on National television! The Freedom Edition includes a re-designed feet locking system with the WhisperFlex base design, for a smooth and silent pivot. Inspired by the Most Advanced Machine on Earth: The Human Body. We built it from the ground up to feel like an extension of the body. Engineered with 4 critical innovations: 1. Stabilizes like a foot: Just like the human foot, the HurryCane gives you 3 points of contact for superior balance and stability. It naturally simulates your instinctive walking motion to provide you firm footing on any surface. Whether you\u2019re sitting or standing, the SteadiGrip base gives you more traction at any angle. 2. Pivots like an ankle: The ankle is the most complex joint in the body because it has the trickiest job: Support your full weight while giving you the flexibility to walk, run and turn on a dime. It automatically pivots to help you maintain balance on inclines, uneven ground and shifting terrain. We designed the HurryCanes proprietary pivoting head to meet the same demanding standards - and it does it all, automatically. 3. Bends like a knee: Your knees bend to help you get in and out of restrictive places like cars. But the HurryCane is even better: Instead of one joint, you get 2! When you need to store it in a purse, glove box or under a chair, the HurryCane folds up in seconds to one-third its normal size. And when you need, it flips out instantly. While our cane has two joints, it\u2019s still strong and sturdy enough to be pressure-tested to support 350 pounds. 4. Changes in height: People come in all different heights. With just the push of a button, it instantly adjusts to any of 8 convenient heights, ranging from 30.5\\ to 37.5\". To enhance your mobility experience add these HurryCane Accessories: HurryCane Replacement Feet the Heavenly Handle. Weight capacity of 350 lbs.",
