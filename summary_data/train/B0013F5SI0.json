The synthetic footbed is a bit hot feeling through the summer in the canvas style but is a bit better with these leather ones as they have a footbed liner.

      "text": "I had to buy this shoe a half size up from my regular 9 because of the width of my foot. It is one of the most comfortable and supportive shoes that I have ever worn, and I buy European comfort type shoes. My podiatrist even let me wear Keens like this after a bunionectomy surgery because he said it gave the same strong support as a surgical shoe. Plus, it is a lot more comfortable than surgical shoes. I recommend this shoe to anyone who needs extra support for your feet.",

The right sandal has a weird ridge on the instep and I blistered there the first few times I wore them, but after a few good uses, they've broken in well.",

I have sports injuries to my knees which cause chronic pain. Usually after a day of hiking I'm popping the Advil. Not after these shoes! After hiking 4 hours through the mountains and my knees couldn't even tell. I had no pain! They're SUPER comfortable. HIGHLY recommend!!!",

These shoes are great for that kind of thing. They cover your feet enough to protect them from the elements but give you breathing space for rain or warm air.",
