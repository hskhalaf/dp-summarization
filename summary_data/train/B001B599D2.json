The hermit crabs we bought almost immediately buried themselves to molt-- so I'd say the hermit crabs approved!",

This is NATURAL river sand that I've been using in my terrarium for over a year now. I clean out and refresh the sand in my tank every 4 months. My crabs just love it! They tunnel and play in it. I initially spray the sand with warm water (bottled) until the top is moderately wet. That moisture coupled with the Zoo Med ReptiTherm\u00ae Under Tank Heater really provide a nice environment. My crabs have molted several times. Just make sure to watch the humidity levels (too high and too low actually cause the crabs pain and sometimes death).",

It also gives me a little more peace of mind because I worried about the dust from our old sand getting into the uro's lungs and getting them sick but since this sand has no dust I do not worry so much. It also has a very nice, natural color, which makes the terrarium look great. Highly recommend this product.",

Soft-shell turtles especially prefer the find sand for digging and burrowing. Other types of water and ground-dwelling reptiles, such as frogs and salamanders, will also benefit from riverbed sand because of its soft nature. A rough surface, such as gravel, can easily injure skin tissue. Riverbed sand is very fine and can be easily secreted when ingested, unlike gravel or pebbles which can cause indigestion. Created over time in an African river, riverbed sand is extremely fine and round, making it an ideal and safe substrate for the aqua-terrarium. Natural sand, no added dyes or chemicals. Creates a natural and attractive aquatic environment. Stimulates natural behavior. Available in brown color. Available in 10-pound plastic bag.",
