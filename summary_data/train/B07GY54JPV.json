We recently cancelled cable, and purchased the TiVo bolt to work with an OTA antenna. And, for a month I thought this was a great decision as everything worked smoothly. However, we're in the second month of ownership, and the TiVo has started to have problems when playing back recordings. Now, when we try to play a recorded show for the first time, we often get a gray screen and the unit pauses for a long time before eventually starting to play. Sometimes it doesn't play at all without rebooting the unit. Very frustrating!",

However in both rooms if I hook the antennas directly up to my television I get 12 channels with 99% solid picture. Obviously this is unacceptable.",

Restarting the device helps, but I found that full functionality wasn't there until the second day. This device seems to need time to communicate over the Internet with the \"mother ship\" before it gives up its full awesomeness. Worth the wait.",
