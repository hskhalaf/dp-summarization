AND it would still work nicely if the manufacturer would update the firmware to work with modern operating systems. Lack of commitment to the product really left a bad taste in my mouth for wanting to buy any other devices from this manufacturer.",

Once on an open network (no security) though it's been fine. Go figure. Cool tool in all, just not as reliable as it could be for everyday users.",

I have tested it out with Pandora, my Locationfree player, and MP3s stored on a NAS. The only problem I ran into was the fact that the jack for the digital coax cable is recessed far too deep into the unit, therefore a \"premium\" digital coax cable will not fit(I think a previous reviewer mentioned this).

My only issue with the product is the music link software that runs on your PC to \"hook\" the audio stream and send it over the wireless network. The software seems to be fairly poorly designed (but works well), and it gives you a very annoying ok/cancel dialog every time you switch from the wireless bridge back to your PC speakers. If linksys sends out a better software to go along with the hardware this would be a 5-star product.",

The buffer size can also sometimes cause problems. Even when adjusting buffer size for different media there can still be strange breaks in play.... particularly after extended use. Also: connecting and disconnecting and muting and un-muting can be problematic... both the computer and the bridge can get confused and sometimes it's easier to restart either the program or bridge than fight with it.

However, the unit I received didn't produce any sound even after it was connected either through a cat5e cable or a 802.11g signal. It was able to pop the speakers when the power was disconnected so the problem is probably the software that produces a virtual sound card under Windows. Also, the Installshield scripts are outdated and do not clean up after themselves.",

    "description": "The Linksys Wireless-G Music Bridge lets you bring the digital music streaming to or stored on your computer to your Home Entertainment Center, without running cables through the house. Using a wireless connection, the Music Bridge finally frees your digital music collection from those little computer speakers to play in full glory through your stereo or surround sound system. The Wireless-G Music Bridge sits by your home stereo and connects to it using standard consumer electronics cables. Then it connects to your home network by Wireless-G wireless networking, or if you prefer, it can be connected via standard 10/100 Ethernet cabling. The included software creates a virtual sound system in your PC, which sends the audio output of any application to the Music Bridge and the stereo system. Use your favorite media player to play your music, and listen in the comfort of the living room. Let the Linksys Wireless-G Music Bridge bring your digital music out into the living room for the whole family to enjoy\n\nAMAZON.COM\nYou're having a party, but you don't have the time it will take to burn a disc of your favorite digital tunes.
