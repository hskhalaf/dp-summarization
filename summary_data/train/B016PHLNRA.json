From the picture, it looked like a regular carpet like mat but it is much more. It has nooks and crannies to completely catch most of the cat litter my cats get onto their paws. Love this mat! It is worth the extra price for something that is so different from all other mats. Get it, you won't regret it.",

I'm going to try the smaller sand to see if it catches more of the litter on my cats' paws. I need to probably wash it sooner than later since one of my cats is a non-box pooper, so I will see how easy that is when it's time. One last comment: I prefer the material this one is made from since my cats scratched the \"rubbery\" ones to pieces.",
