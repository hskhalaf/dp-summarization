It's either sloppy manufacturing or a bad lot with poor quality control. Doesn't matter. I'll never buy another Danby product again. Why would I?",

In my mind they should have allowed me to ship it back at their expense and either refunded my money or sent another. Instead, they made me file a claim and had numerous pieces of info they needed (pictures, location in home....) before they would even consider a refund/replacement. DO NOT BUY FROM DANBY!!!",

I like that it doesn't have a refrigerator section like other 'friges, but I'm disappointed. I guess if you like English beer (50F), this would be suitable, but barely adequate for office sodas. I'd still buy again because of the size, and lack of freezer wasting space, but it's a compromise.",

Got for my office at work and have no complaints! If anything happens will update but otherwise happy! Packaging was great! Original box was foamed inside another box. Temperature inside fridge is within safe, you can even get it colder if you would like with the dial on the back which says to turn to the right or the larger blue to increase the coldness. Great purchase!",
