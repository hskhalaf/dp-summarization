      "text": "Our cat has really needed some serious attention to his teeth, so we purchased this kit. On the good side, it is a LARGE kit which has a decent supply of the paste itself. The tools included are also of a higher quality than most pet teeth cleaning items, so I believe that they will be durable and last a while - along with the big supply of paste! My only pick of the nit variety is that my feline distinctly dislikes the flavor. He ends up drooling for a bit after we have cleaned his teeth due to this. However, he still ends up with clean teeth, so it works perfectly well! I only wish there were other flavors.",

I bought this because we recently got 2 calves and are bottle feeding them. Baby cows have very \"good smelling\" poop. So my nasty dog likes to sneak in a few bites when I'm not paying attention to him. This works amazing. No one wants cow poop breath. His breath smells so much better now and hopefully I can keep him away from his favorite disgusting snack. (:",

He was hesitant about the taste of this toothpaste at first but wouldn't stop licking it. Eventually, I turned it into a game where he would try to bite the brush and I'd take full advantage and start brushing. His teeth were noticeably whiter and most of the tartar buildup are gone only after a week. His bad breath is gone as well. I used to think that giving him chew bones and dental treats were enough. But nothing substitutes for a good brushing. Definitely need to get this and start early!",

I can't belive that for 7$ we got two full size toothpastes and a toothbrush and a finger brush. It's surely improved my dog breath from the very first time used. I couldn't believe it.

Warning: your dog's breath will IMMEDIATELY smell like tuna. I mean, fresh fresh fresh fresh out of the can TUNA. But, the next morning she had completely white clean teeth and her breath didn't smell like anything. I'm glad we got this product :)",

The multi tip brush works great, I have a pitbull so the smaller end is perfect for her front teeth and the larger size works better for her back teeth. She also used to fight me to brush her teeth but I guess she likes the taste of this way better because we have no issues! Would highly recommend!",
