The teachers even commented on how great having the small compartments was for developing fine motor skills. Unfortunately, one of the plastic edges that secures the latch broke after a couple months. We kept using it with one latch--we just stopped putting liquidy things like hummus or dressing in the center dipping compartment to prevent leaks--but last week the second plastic edge broke as well so now it's useless. It's really too bad because it was perfect and otherwise exactly what we were looking for. I won't be buying another one since I am doubtful of it's ability to hold up long-term.",

First wash of the green one it immediately discolored from pasta sauce from another plate next to it. It also now has a dent after only the third wash and second use at preschool.

Cons: - Outer box has to be hand washed due to rubber seals. I would recommend this to anyone with kids who pack a lunch. If you found this review helpful, please click, \u201chelpful\u201d below.",

This is also easy to clean- the food compartment is removable which makes it easy to clean either by hand or in the dishwasher. Definitely worth the money.",

      "text": "i bought this lunchbox for my son over a year ago and we have loved it! Never had any issues with leaking into other compartments! It may look a little small, but the compartments are deep and you can really fit quite a bit of food in them! My only complaint is that the latches both broke at the same time, however im not sure if it was due to our sitter closing them incorrectly or not . BUT I will say there is a 2 YEAR WARRANTY that i was able to use and they are shipping me a brand new box! I will be buying another lunchbox for my daughter when she starts solids!",

I have hand washed the entire lunchbox and the customer service staff happily assisted me when I had an issue. I highly recommend Bentgo!",

So easy and helps avoid the retribution of a hangry child who says to you after school, but you forgot to include my sandwich/fruit/veggie/etc in my lunch today! Also great warranty -- when the latches on one of ours broke after a year, the company sent us a new one, which was really great. Love this!",

I never put them in the dishwasher but the front top is still stratched and worn off and slightly blue colored from rubbing on the other 2 I bought, just storing in the cupboard and picnic bag. But the kids love them, can easily open them, holds the perfect amount of food for a 4, 5 and 7 yr old, definitely spill proof so the little circle can have ranch dressing or ketchup. Offers a variety of little healthy treats that make lunch special, easy to clean and store. Wish they had a handle.",

Extra bonus that their Facebook page gives great ideas and suggestions for lunches and the customer service is phenomenal. Highly recommend.",

The company kindly replaced the boxes, but these quickly broke again. (We moved on to another brand, which has held up well, but I won't necessarily recommend it because the latches on that box are really hard for little hands to open, and he needs help from his teacher.)",
