I would prefer to return it because we bought it less than 60 days ago however they will not let me because it is over 30 days. There must be some kind of design flaw as the beans don\u2019t fall from the hopper into the grinder so it runs and runs and runs and no coffee. We have cleaned it no less than 15 times. Save your money and go for the Barratza. Stay away from this hunk of junk unless you like to donate $200 to the internet ether.",

      "text": "The OXO grinder is a pleasure to use. It can be easily adjusted for a range of brews and brewing techniques. It's easy to use - just fill the bean hopper, choose your grind, dial in the amount of coffee you want and then - moment of drama! - press the button and watch it work. The grind is consistent - the output is not full of big pieces and dust, rather it's just what you chose it to be. I use this grinder every morning. It's the best grinder I have ever had.",

      "text": "My wife and I got this for our wedding and we love having the fresh ground beans for our coffee every morning. When we got pregnant, we bought an extra hopper for it so she could have decaf while I continued drinking regular. It does give a reliable and consistent grind every time and has a wide range of settings to really dial in the grind you like. I found that the scale had to be re-calibrated a lot more often than I would have expected. Also, the plastic cup the grinds fall into is prone to static. I replaced it with a small, wide-mouth mason jar which works really well with no static problem.",

      "text": "This thing is super-nice, easy to use, FAST, like everyone says. An easy way to make it even better is to grind directly into your coffee filter (use a simple pour-over holder like this). Place that with your filter under the grinder, zero it with the tare feature (once). After grinding you can place the loaded filter in your coffeemaker, no messy pouring of grinds or dealing with static.",

      "text": "This is a good grinder. It produces a nice, even grind. The use of a scale to determine the exact amount of coffee ground is really nice. There are two downsides: 1. It is inconvenient for an espresso basket. You cannot grind directly into the basket, and the container does not pour easily into a small container. 2. The beans stop feeding into the grinder especially when the bean container is full. Although you can loosen the beans by shaking the grinder, it is a nuisance to do especially with the scale.",

Seem truly concerned with me. The bean holder detaches. I bought 5 extra holders and I can keep 5 different kinds of coffee ready for use. I also own Oxo's Barista Brain 12 cup coffee maker. I am pleased with it as well. These items are designed to look like a set. Very impressive on the kitchen counter.",

After about 6 months the scale wouldn\u2019t tare properly anymore and have to put a small amount of weight on there in order to set a grind weight or it just keeps resetting to \u201c-\u201c. About a year after use and the grind is pretty terrible. I get everything from a fine dust to 1/8\u201d chunks all on the same grind setting. I\u2019m becoming pretty exasperated trying to find a good grinder that lasts. It seems that they don\u2019t exist.",

    "description": "Size:Burr GrinderA truly perfect brew starts with ground coffee, but it takes the right grinder to help coffee beans unlock their full flavor potential. The OXO On Conical Burr Coffee Grinder\u2019s intelligent, built-in scale precisely measures coffee as you grind. Choose from 3 grinding modes: cup mode using pre-set ratio of 8 grams per cup, grams mode to grind the exact amount of grams you like, or manual mode to grind by time. The Grinder's high torque/low-speed DC motor helps keep beans from overheating while grinding; the conical burrs create a consistent and uniform grind for optimal flavor extraction. Whether you like strong or mild, espresso or drip, French Press or pour-over, the OXO Conical Burr Coffee Grinder helps you get the grounds you need to make your perfect cup.\n\nIt's easy to tare the scale to get a precise read or if you'd like to use a different container for grinding. Here's how you do it:\n\nPress and hold the OXO button, until the ring around the button blinks and the menu mode appears (keep holding!). The button light will turn red and there will be a three-second countdown on the display; keep pressing the button until you reach \"0\". That's it! You're ready to grind! \n\nNOTE: PRODUCT IS ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH 110V OUTLETS\n\n\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy OXO",
