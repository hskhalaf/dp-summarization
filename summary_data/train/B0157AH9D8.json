I ordered the purple, and the image on Amazon makes them appear like more of a lavender rather than the medium-purple color they are. I have pictures of them both inside with yellow light and outside with natural light so you can see the color. Personally I'm glad they're darker like this because the dirt won't show up as much as it would on the lavender. The size range is also really nice; options, options, options! Overall, I'm very pleased and would recommend this set to a friend.",

This is a nice inexpensive set for someone who only travels occasionally, that who this is intended for. Con: The largest bag is 64.5 lin. inches. (32 x 20.5 x 12) 2.5 inches over max bag size for United Airlines (and many other airlines). That measurement is an empty bag (not overstuffed) and includes the wheels.",

It is easy to overload the two large suitcases to over 50 pounds because there is so much room.

      "text": "Oh man, maybe it's just because I went from ten year old luggage with a single set of wheels to this, but these are a DREAM. And I gave them a pretty harsh breaking in: I stuffed the biggest and the medium bag FULL of books to take to used bookstores. While getting them in and out of cars was hard, due to the sheer weight, rolling them up and down the San Francisco streets was no problem. I suppose, so long as this review remains at a five star, it means the luggage is holding up!",

Also, it's not all that easy to push along when the bag is full.",

I purchased this luggage for a cruise in Nov. so I can't say how it will withstand the airlines, but I believe it will be fine, due to it's quality construction.
