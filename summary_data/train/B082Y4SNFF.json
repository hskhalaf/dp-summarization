The sound quality is good when it\u2019s not cutting out, but I shouldn\u2019t have to try to fix it every two minutes while I\u2019m driving. A waste of money considering now I have to buy another one.",

The product itself comes with two connectors which were not useful for me, but with the right cable, it does work and sound is PERFECT....! The gadget does the trick!",

Compared to the others this TaoTronics unit feels substantial and well-assembled. No complaints about sound quality - matches other sources (radio, Sirius) through the same stereo, plug fits solidly into the aux jack, no clicking or signal dropout, and doesn't generate that awful buzz if you're charging it while you're playing it. Overall it's probably the best of the four. Being the least expensive is icing on the cake.",
