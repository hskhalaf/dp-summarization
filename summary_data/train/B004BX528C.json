Durrability lost a star for the bearing roler that this sits on. It does function but its very weak plastic and it has to stay perfectly clean. Dirt gets intothe track and binds it up. Also the bearings are rusting after only a month of use.",

      "text": "Just purchased and constructed the storage unit. For the price, it is a nice unit and organizes your DVD's very nicely. Like other reviews, the assembly was not complicated, just awkward. I reviewed the instructions very closely (which I rarely do) and made sure all the pieces and parts were laid out prior to starting. The one thing that I used that I would recommend is the use of a large clamp to hold the sections together while securing all of the wood dowels and screws. Otherwise, you will need an extra pair of hands. Also, make sure not to over tighten any of the fasteners or you will break off pieces of the unit.",

It kept falling apart, due to the above mentioned problems, because the dowels didn't hold it tight. I would suggest that 2 people would work better than 1 when putting it together. I love how many DVD's it holds and it is very attractive and is on a roller base so you can turn it around to see all the DVD's.",
