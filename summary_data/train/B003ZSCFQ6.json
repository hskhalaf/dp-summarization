      "text": "I bought this well reviewed chair for my husband who has a progressive neurological disease. At first he used it in the shower just for additional stability as he was standing. In recent weeks, he starting sitting on it to wash his hair. After using it to sit on only a few times, the back legs buckled, causing a ugly fall in the tile shower. The chair is rated for 300#, but my husband only weighs 185. Stability has to include the integrity of the materials used. Clearly this could have been much more serious than some scrapes and bruises.",

      "text": "Very Easy to put together, pretty much ready to go out of the box and the only thing we did was click in the the handles. Perfect for our aging Mum's needs for a safe tub experience. Lining up the handles took a bit of care so that the bitty buttons could slide properly but other than that we are more than pleased. Can't go wrong with NOVA. We added a hotel grade gripper suction cupped rubber mat for additional protection directly onto the floor of the tub for extra slip protection. JS",
