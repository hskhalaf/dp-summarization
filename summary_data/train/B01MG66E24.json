I highly recommend them. However, the cleat hardware that was included with these is garbage. the black alignment washer has holes in it that are the incorrect size, and allow the screw head to protrude through the washer! you can see this from the picture above. the lower washer is one from a different pair of CrankBrother pedals, the upper one with the larger holes is from this pair. Not sure why these are different, but beware if you get a set with these large holes, you'll probably need to replace them.",

But the 3s were on sale so I said yeah let's do that. These pedals are night and day to anything I have had on the bike before. I am not terribly comfortable with slipping out of the clips on uneven weird ground. But honestly riding nonclipped they don't shift or move at all. I have done 10 mile rides in sandals and felt like I was stuck with magnets. Awesome pedals, I couldn't be happier.",

As hybrids, they are not as robust as some of the mountain pedals, however, they do feature Crank Brothers simplicity and ruggedness, not to mention cleat compatibility. Both Welgo and Shimano have made single sided pedals for some time, but I much prefer the Crank Brothers design. Have always liked the idea of being able to clip out ahead of time approaching a technical section and the large platform of the Mallet was ok, but not ideal. The Doubleshot is exactly what I have been looking for.",

    "description": "50-4467 / Crankbrothers Doubleshot Platform Pedals The Doubleshot platform pedal is an all-new hybrid platform pedal that truly gives you the best of both worlds and lets you ride either flat or clipped in without sacrificing comfort or stability. The new design eliminates the 4-way engagement cage that Crankbrothers is known for, instead substitutes a double-sided engagement that enables you to ride either clipped in with cycling shoes, or utilize the platform pedal with normal street shoes without having the pedal cage pushing into the bottom of your foot. Diamond plate pads and molded pins provide excellent traction on the platform, while the double-sided entry cleat provides customizable float and easy entry. Hybrid pedal half flat / half clip-in Moulded pins and ribs for grip Diamond plate pads for traction 2-sided entry / superior mud shedding Premium bearings & double seal system Includes cleats and hardware",
