      "text": "After purchasing and trying two TYR wet suits, (sleeveless and full) and an older de soto, which always seemed to tight, despite the fit guide, the Synergy is wonderful. Nice relaxed fit in the shoulders with plenty of length in the arms and legs...I am 5'10 at 158 lbs, with a long inseam and short ertorso and the fit guide is very accurate. Very good value for the money. Especially easy to get off during transitions and quite comfortable with triathlon gear underneath (tri shorts/top). I wore compression socks underneath without any issues. Highly recommend this wet-suit to my friends and family.",

First, the logistics - the suite arrived in two days in solid packaging with messaging about putting it on, etc. The sizing chart is spot on and the suit is a perfect fit, great range of motion in the upper body without any chafing. As for performance, after the first swim, no tears, no issues, no chafing and the 5mm provides good flotation on the open water. All of the seams are taped on the inside in key areas and it absolutely feels good, in fact I wanted to keep swimming!",

It is like this suit was custom made for me. The wetsuit itself is great. It is excellent quality (especially for the price). It gives full range of motion in the arms and shoulders and does not choke at the neck. Very comfortable for long open water swims and easy to get on and off. I also appreciate how Synergy provides good information on how to put on, take off, care for the wetsuit. Overall an outstanding product.",

However there's a little piece of the neck (about an inch), that has glue on it, which makes it sharp/hard. This part rubs on neck, to a point of drawing blood :( I cut down this glued edge with scissors, i will update the review if it helps. \u2014\u2014 Update: cutting out glued part helped a lot. No more rubbing in one spot. I also started to apply body glide around the neck, and no issues. So far, so good.",
