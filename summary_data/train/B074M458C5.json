We used a little double stick tape and stuck them right to the Valentine. We had fun picking out a unique animal for each classmate and even had a few left over to keep at home. I keep a couple in my purse for my kids to play with when we are on the go. Very cute and seem to be pretty durable- they are withstanding the inside of my \"mom purse!\"",

My kids 5-14 each saw them and wanted one, so fun for the whole family. There is a very slightly sticky/moist or tacky feeling, but if that bothers you simply put a little baby powder on them.
