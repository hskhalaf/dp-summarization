It is a little on the heavy side, but thats expected with the full aluminium build. I get looks from people with macbooks often mistaking it for an apple computer. The 1080p (non Qhd) is more than adequate in terms of clarity and color accuracy, and doesnt kill battery as much (normally charge once every two days for schoolwork and the occasional video).

We will never buy an HP laptop again after this experience and I suggest you do the same.",

Brand new, out of box, there were scuffs on the lid, the casing was aligned crooked (edges not flush), and the touchpad was rattling. Yup. The touchpad is loose, which means it does not register taps sometimes, and constantly rattles. On top of that, the lid doesn't line up. It's crooked. Imagine a thousand dollar computer that can't line up the top and bottom? Really? I mean, it is either lined up, or, its not, right? How do you mess that up? Lazy, that's how.",
