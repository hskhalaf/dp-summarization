Three days ago I purchased the same product for my parents. When I tried to use it the first time, the plastic part just cracked. As you can see from the images, the new is a little bigger than the old model and the plastic is much weaker. I cannot understand why the manufacturer upgrades the old model. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AS A MEAT GRINDER",

So , it\u2019s for meat grinding, not for vegetables. Still. Strongly recommend! It\u2019s easy to use assembling and cleaning. It comes with several pasta making parts but I didn\u2019t try yet.",

The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that it would have been a great design without this major flaw. I would say, look elsewhere until they fix this problem.",

If you don't have a clean, non-porous or curved counter or table edge to place it in, then the suction cup won't hold. This is the biggest issue I came across with this. You need to have it at the edge because the crank is longer than the main body. However, even with a clean edge, the suction cup did not hold on it's own when pressure was applied during the cranking motion. You'll have to secure it by putting pressure at the top of the meat holder, which is not really meant to be done, but you'll have very little choice.",

When it clogged it kept grinding the meat--it just wouldn't push it out of the machine, so it turned the beef into a grind so fine it was almost a paste. I will keep it in case there is another sale on steak--but would never use it again on chuck or other cuts that are less than perfect.",

We decided to stop buying any pre-ground meat, so when we want sausage or burgers we use the Norpro. It took a few tries to get the fat content right, but the flavor and texture are great.

First, there's no way that it can work as a pasta maker because of the way that the dough comes out. Because of the circle shape the dough sticks together and is unusable. Secondly, the handle is much longer than the machine, which eliminates the convenience of the no clamp design. Third, the spaghetti attachment makes the noodles way to big so even if they didn't stick together they would be the biggest noodles you ever saw. Finally, the suction cup bottom is not strong enough to hold the machine in place for the entire duration of use.",

      "text": "The grinder is durable and easy to use . I was skeptical of how easy it would be to use, given its low price. Typically when I buy a less expensive gadget, it has more pieces to assemble, and it is more apt to rust out. But this grinder really is made of quality materials that have not degraded, and ...if you spend a few minutes to read through the directions, it is as easy to use as can be. I have used it to make pasta , and also to grind a steak into meat for hamburger. Excellent product.",

The blade and die are stainless - no rust like on both my others. It is used exclusively to grind meat - mostly Chuck Roasts when on sale to make pink-slime-free burgers and meatloaf. Makes a great Gift, too.",

If you're going to make sausage make sure your mix is cold-cold-cold to facilitate the stuffing. Haven't used it for pasta yet, so no feedback there.",

      "text": "I had to give the Norpro Meat Grinder three stars, not for it's performance, but for the way it was shipped to me. It was packed very loosely in a very large box with a 30 pound printer which broke the plastic container for the grinder. The grinder itself and it's working parts were fine, so I decided not to send it back, because I have other containers that I can use with it.",

It has a suction cup at the bottom that you can engage so you can grind food with as much muscle as you need. Definitely worth the price.",

Needs some prep work- the meat has to be pre-cut in cubes or longer stripes, but I can't complain. It is perfect for my small kitchen with very limited storage space. It is light and easy to assemble. Easy to clean, but the metal parts has to be well dried before putting away. I did not try it for pasta yet... I warmly recommend this product for anybody who is concerned by the freshness and the quality of ground meats from the grocery stores. The product was shipped next day and arrived faster than expected.",
