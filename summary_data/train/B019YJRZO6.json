They are lightweight and easy for baby to manipulate. But best of all, they have the rest so when you put it down, you don't get baby food on your table or high chair tray. I love these so much that I bought a second set!",

      "text": "Love these spoons. They are easy to clean, easy to feed baby & easy for baby to hold. It's very well designed in my opinion. We have many different baby spoons but this one is my favorite. Because the front of the spoon is rectangular and flat, serving semiliquid items like yogurt is much easier for baby. Also, the entire spoon from handle to mouth lies on a straight plane (as compared to spoons that are angled from handle to mouth) it's very easy for baby to self feed. The downside of this spoon is that it's harder for liquid items like soup. But we've a separate spoon for that. Anyway, overall we love this spoon!",

They wash great and are easy for our son to pick up and learn to use. Colors are also fun and bright!",

The handle is really long, so there's enough space for mom's hands and baby's hands to both hold the spoon together. This is nice when you're trying to stop the baby from throwing food everywhere. I'll definitely be buying more of these.",

The spoons are wider yet thinner and easier to feed baby. I rarely even need a bib since it so much easier to feed! I like the thin longer design and very easy to rinse clean. Great for home and on the go and they dont break the bank. Highly recommend!!!",
