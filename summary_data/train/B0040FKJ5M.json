I also found it helpful to assemble the drawers first, rather than toward the end (as instructed), in order to deal wth fewer screws, etc, as I was assembling the night stand itself.

      "text": "Nice addition to my bedroom! Slowly updating my furniture and saw this cutie. Needed something a bit smaller than my previous one. It came fairly quickly and was easy to put together. Packaged nicely and had no damage. WARNING: None of the parts were labeled and all screws were mixed together in one bag. Had to use the pictures and guess if I had everything the correct way. Will be drilling a hole in the back top cubby part so I can pass my tablet charger through. It is also spacious as I have put my laptop and tablet in there. Other than that, I am very pleased with this purchase and may get another one for my guest room.",

      "text": "I really love this roomy and elegant nightstand. Assembling it took at least couple of hours because the instructions aren\u2019t great. The parts aren\u2019t labeled and it takes a bit of detective work to figure out which rectangular board is which. I realized at one point that I\u2019d put one piece on in the wrong direction, and had to carefully take it apart (luckily nothing broke, despite the materials being pretty fragile). So it took a while. Worth it, as the end result is a nice nightstand, but even for someone like me who has assembled a lot of internet furniture, this was challenging, as the instructions leave a lot of room for error.",

We bought a nice sleigh bed last year, and I had some sticker shock when I saw what it would cost to get the matching nightstands...this one was less than a quarter of the cost of ONE of the matching ones and it looks great! For the price, I was impressed with the quality. The height is great for my DEEP mattress. Was fast and easy to put together (about an hour, with several interruptions). We will be buying the second for sure.",
