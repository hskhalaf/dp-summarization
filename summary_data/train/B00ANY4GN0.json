If you try and eat the entire bar at once with no water your mouth will dry out and it will be hard to swallow it. Overall.. I think these are great to have just in case.",

They're emergency food, they don't really need to be more than enough to keep you from dying when nothing else is available, and they do that! I think these are pretty average. Very similar to Mainstay. Millennium bars are superior and just as shelf and temperature stable. Tastes are pretty subjective though. In my opinion if you want to know for sure you should buy small versions all of the options and try them all.",

If you are hungry and need calories etc, you are likely not going to whine about having something to eat. Thats why I bought several packages of these and placed them in with my emergency food supply. Not a bad price for what you get, they are compact (easily fitting in a backpack) and light enough weight so as to not throw off the overall weight of a bag out bag etc",
