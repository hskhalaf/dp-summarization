They felt very comfortable on. Have not played in them yet, but the price was fabulous! I just got through wearing the Stella McCartney Adidas and they were double the price of these. They also wore out really fast, and my budget can\u2019t handle that. Four stars due to poor sizing and the hassle of having to return and re-order.",
