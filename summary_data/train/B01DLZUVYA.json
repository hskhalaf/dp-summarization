Collect all 5 Protectobot figures (each sold separately) to create the G1 Protectobots team and build a Defensor figure in the G1 configuration. Protectobot Groove is a freedom fighter who would sacrifice his own spark if it would bring peace. He combines with his fellow Protectobots to form Defensor. Protectobot Hot Spot forms the torso, Protectobot Blades and Protectobot First Aid form the arms, and Protectobot Streetwise and Protectobot Groove form the legs. Collect all 5 Protectobot figures to complete a giant G1-inspired Defensor Combiner robot. (Figures are each sold separately.) This Deluxe Class Protectobot Groove figure changes from robot to motorcycle and back in 10 steps.
