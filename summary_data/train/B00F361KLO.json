The application wasn't too hard-- watch YouTube videos first to be sure you've got it-- and it's perfect. No bubbles. My favorite thing is the self healing aspect. Wow! So cool to make a nick or scratch and then hours later it's gone. I would buy this again and again! The only thing I will ever put on my iPads!",

The trick is to remove the clear film on the \"outside\" of the protector (the part you are going to be touching when using the device) before you remove the back layer and expose the more adhesive part of the shield to apply directly to the device. Make sure your fingers and the device is covered thoroughly. Use light pressure to apply in the center, then work your way to the edges. Let your device dry and wipe any excess fluid away for 1 minute before use and you should be good to go.",
