      "text": "I was getting tired of my kitchen looking increasingly cluttered by various cooking devices. I got this multicooker hoping to pair down from having both a rice cooker, steamer and slow cooker. I've also realized that I can probably get rid of my electric fondue pot because this should do the job nicely as well. The pasta cooking feature and risotto making feature I'll probably never use, but it is nice for making soups and rice. My one complaint is that the slow cooker can only cook on high and has no low feature. If that's a deal breaker for you, then you should look into some of the other multi-cookers.",

I suspected that the risotto-making feature was too good to be true, and unfortunately that seems to be the case. Your mileage may vary, but I find there really isn't any mechanical substitute for the tedious process of just standing over the stove and stirring, stirring, stirring and adding the broth a bit at a time.",

      "text": "This is great for consolidating your cookware in a small kitchen. It's versatile and does everything it's supposed to do, and does it well. The problem for me is that we use a slow cooker for making bone broth with chicken, but this is much too small to get a whole chicken into it. It also only slow cooks on a high setting. So this won't be replacing our other slow cooker. Regardless it's large enough for everything else we want to do, since we're cooking for two. It's light and fairly compact which makes it easy to store and use. The only other downside is that it's aluminum and for health purposes I'd prefer stainless steel.",
