Immediately, I discovered a cloud of black dust all over the place. I ran my hand on the hanger, and the velvet flocking just came off. If you read other reviews, you will see similar experiences. I have other velvet hangers that do not shed like this. I am shocked that Amazon would put their name on such a defective product. These are going back asap and now I have to wash my sheets - that were literally just washed and put on the bed prior to this. Grrrrrr.",

Oh well, a couple of days delay didn't hurt anything. However, I came here to write my review and it showed that I already reviewed the product. What??? The review said, \"Tired of my clothes sliding off the cheap plastic hangers. These are a perfect solution!\" Who wrote this??? Not me...I checked the items I reviewed yesterday and this was not among the ones I wrote!!! What the heck is going on???",

I like these because you can turn the metal part, whether just a little or to flip the direction of the hook. I needed to be able to slay the hangers to get the coats to fit in the closet and by being able to turn the metal hook part, they are able to fit. I attached a picture that shows the coats sideways a bit but the metal hook straight.",
