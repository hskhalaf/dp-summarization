After like 30 minutes of training on my own against a wall I was able to ride it with no problems. The only thing I find bad about this hover board is that every time it starts up it makes a really loud starting indicator noise and says Bluetooth on which I wish I could switch off. Also sometimes when I get off and if it hits something it keeps beeping and won't stop until I power off and back on again. Apart from these two things I think the hover board if pretty great.",

The app has a self balancing mode, adult mode, you can set the speed limit, change LED lights, shut the hoverboard down and a few other functions. We think it is a lot better than the others because of the rubber tires. My daughter even brings it in (after cleaning the tires) and rides it around on our hardwood floors with no damage to them. The speakers on it are great too!!",

In October the kids just couldn\u2019t wait any longer so I gave them their boards early while the weather was still nice. They loved them! However within a few hours of using them, one of the boards was shaking and stopping. My grandson has fallen off twice and injured himself because of this defect. I would love to give this 5 stars because it is well made and the kids love them. But the shaking and stopping is not safe and negates any Positive benefits.

Another couple reviews mentioned the hoverboard shaking -- and this happened for us as well, but only when my daughter was on it. Once we downloaded the app and put the hoverboard into \"Child mode\" - the shaking stopped entirely. I'm sure this has to do with how the board responds to a lighter rider, and child mode must compensate for the lighter weight somehow. All-in-all, for the price on prime day, this is a solid value.",

Since then, I've emailed Gyroor support asking for help multiple times. Each time they insist I give them a 5-star review before they will take care of the issue. This is straight up extortion and manipulation of Amazon's review system. It's no wonder this faulty product has so many 5-star reviews *and* so many 1-star reviews. Heed my warning.

Sturdy, smooth, battery life is fantastic and has Bluetooth so you can jam out if you want to. It is a bit awkward until you get the hang of it but once you do, it\u2019s just wonderful! I couldn\u2019t ask for a better hoverboard! Can change the light color in it as well! Has kid mode, you can control the speed, what\u2019s not to love about this! Definitely will purchase more Gyroor products in the future! Will definitely suggest this to anyone!",

He loves it and it does great on our property, we live in a very rural area and very little concrete. Does well in our yard and gravel driveway. The biggest drawback and why I'm only giving 3 stars... I wish the battery life was longer so he could enjoy it more. I feel like it is on the charge more than it is being used. I figured it runs down quickly down because the surface makes the board work harder than simple smooth concrete...defeats the purpose for us.",

He shoots basketball hoops while on it with no issues at all. It goes through the grass and up street curbs (gently) without any problems. It has a smooth ride and charges completely in about an hour. He also likes to play music on the speakers. They're quite loud, much to his delight! We strongly considered buying one that was much more expensive and are glad we didn't because he loves this one. He weighs around 75 pounds so doesn't put much stress on it.",

On the rare occasion it will start up one side will just stop as he's going. We bought the additional warranty but it is still under the manufacturer warranty and have been getting the run around. They've sent us the same email directing us to reset the hoverboard and required two separate videos be sent of my son rising the broke and dangerous hoverboard. Very disappointed. Would not recommend Gyroor.",

After 3 months, once we unplug the thing all it does is beep at us.

This hoverboard has no trouble navigating any of the steep inclines or broken pavement, and he quickly learned how to use it. He also zooms around on gravel, grass and dirt paths. A few weeks after he got it, he had some problems with the self-balancing function, and the company graciously sent a new board. I would definitely purchase it again!",

They ride it in the house as well and we have taken it camping. Works wonderfully, no issues that I have noticed. Plus the music makes it even more fun. One small complaint is that the zipper on the carrying case that it came with broke like the second time zipping it up. Not really a huge deal since it has two zippers and we are able to zip it most of the way closed. Overall I'm glad we bought this particular hoverboard.",

My husband and adult kids can ride it fine with no problems. The higher weight limit was also a reason we chose this hoverboard and it's handling that great! The boards were easy for everyone, including my younger kids, to learn to ride and maneuver them. They love riding them around inside or at a park. We've had a lot of fun with these!",
