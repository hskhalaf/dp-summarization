We are not small people, and most cheap pillows weren\u2019t comfy at all. You can really throw yourself on these. I\u2019m 5\u20197, hubby is 5\u201911, and pillows are long enough to hug and have support your legs at the same time. They are very heavy so takes a little effort to move them around in bed. The pillow cases they come with are super soft and have maintained their quality with weekly washings for five years now. I highly recommend these!",

I normally have a lot of low back pain so I always knew when it was time to replace my body pillow. I don't see that being an issue with this pillow. It's designed so that I don't think it will ever go flat. It has a memory foam core and around that is soft. I've not had one night of back pain since using this. I will be recommending this to my chiropractor and everyone I meet.",

You will need to work/knead the foam chunks that make up the inside of this body pillow in order to evenly distribute the foam, and occasionally to \"loft\" it back up as the foam can travel over time and use.

And it's quite lofty, but nothing extraordinary that makes you think you're purchasing a cadillac-size pillow. Agree, because of the memory foam, it does trap heat, so you will feel as if you're snuggling more with another human being than a pillow, so dress lightly if you use this at bedtime so you don't sweat. After pregnancy, this converts perfectly to a main pillow on a guest bed. love the versatility of that compared to buying an actual \"pregnancy\" that has little function after its use. hope this helps.",

The pillow is just 1 bigger rectangle cotton pillow folded around the memory foam, then zipped up. It just didn't meet my expectations, but i still like it. I paid $45 for and but I think it only feels like it should be worth $20.",

      "text": "I am IN LOVE with this body pillow. I tell every pregnant woman I know about it. I could't see spending insane amounts of money for a pillow specific to pregnancy. I did a lot of searching and reading of reviews and finally decided on this pillow. Purchased it about 20 weeks ago (at about 10 weeks pregnant) and have loved it since the beginning. So comfortable! Only complaint in the last 2 - 3 weeks is that, as I am getting more pregnant, I go to turn over in the night and have to of course switch the pillow to the other side and it is now starting to get heavy.",

I mean, why do you need to be lugging this thing around with you in different places of the house anyway? Last I checked, a body pillow is meant to be used in your bed, something to snuggle up to even. If you want something light to carry around the house with you for some odd reason, get a regular pillow.",
