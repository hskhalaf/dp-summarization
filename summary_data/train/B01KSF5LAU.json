The smoothie setting starts out reversing blade direction repeatedly to avoid a big air bubble stopping the blending, a problem with every previous blender I used. After reversing 5 times, it blends in one direction with power and vigor. Handles thick mixes which included semi thawed fruit. Disassembles and cleans easy. I don't understand the review that complains about the plastic ring. Every blender I've owned has an almost identical base assembly which is usually trouble free if assembled properly. A bonus is that the blender is super powerful and very quiet. I love it so far.",

This isn't the industrial build of the far more expensive models, and may not last your 20 years. But for the price I paid, it is a very strong and versatile blender with a nice assortment of options. The base looks great. But when you touch it you can feel it is just chromed plastic. And a tad flimsy at that. But this is cosmetic, as you don't blend with the outer shell.",
