My new Yorkie pup was suffering with SERIOUS separation anxiety. As soon as I would put her in her crate and walk out of the room, she would flip out, whining and barking. The first night with snuggle puppy, she whines a little until she realized it was warm - bam! She slept from 22:45-0600. It is now day three - she WILLINGLY walked into her crate and cuddled up to her little buddy - no whining, no barking.",

Our starter kit came with a pink blanket, after calling the 800 customer service number and talking to Trenton, we had a blue one in the mail six days later. Plus, a paid return envelope to send back the pink one. Awesome customer service \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",

Unfortunately, my dog just thought it was a toy and spent hours trying to rip the beating heart out of the stuffed dog. It did not calm down her anxiety about being in a crate or help with any of that in the least. So as a toy, I would say it\u2019s hours of fun, but kind of expensive. As an anxiety reducer, not so much.",

However, ours is super smart and now tries to open the belly and messes with the velcro so he can't have the dog at night any more. No fault of the manufacturer-it is made very well-he's just a chewer and figures things out very quickly. I highly recommend this box to anyone planning a new puppy!",

    "description": "Color:NeutralFinally, the perfect puppy starter kit for your new puppy. Help your puppy transition to his or her new home. This new puppy starter kit comes with a snuggle puppy, 3 extra heat packs, an extra soft snuggle blanket, a puppy teething aid for puppies, and a puppy's 1st toy. This kit is a perfect way to welcome your new puppy home! The snuggle puppy is a pet anxiety solution. Whether they're new to the family, or perhaps just going through a tough time, the snuggle puppy?is designed to provide comfort and helps relieve anxiety in your four-legged friend. Whatever the case, whether crate training, fireworks, or perhaps a thunderstorm, rest assured this dog anxiety solution will be there to help. Dogs are pack animals and are instinctively drawn to their mother and others in their pack. The snuggle puppy recreates that intimacy with physical warmth and a 'real-feel' heartbeat. The result is a calmer, more peaceful pet; one that feels less loneliness, fear, and separation anxiety. The puppy teething aid is an all-natural puppy teething aid. Just add water and freeze to give your puppy relief from aching, itching gums due to teething. The massaging fingers, ridges, and melting ice soothe your puppy's sore gums. Nothing beats seeing your pet curled up all cozy, safe and warm. You'll feel all the feels when you see your pet curled up in their own snuggle blanket while you're lounging on the couch next to them. Sounds lovely, doesn't it?",
