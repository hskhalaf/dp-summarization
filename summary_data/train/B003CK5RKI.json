      "text": "I bought one of these last year to keep my sunglasses from riding down my nose when I hike and sweat but with all the sweating, the color faded and got nasty even though I rinsed it regularly. I bought this one and am trying to rinse it more often but the color is already changing a little in certain points. It comes with the territory I guess. I use it for hiking so it gets tested and sweated in quite a bit. Another reason I like this is that I can take my sunglasses off and leave them around my neck if I am overheating, want to see something without them or it's not bright enough yet.",

      "text": "Well, I should have paid attention to previous reviews. So while the chums are lightweight, they absolutely fail in two important areas. First, so while they are adjustable, they are too long to provide a tight fit against the head when wearing glasses during active sports. And second, unless you have very narrow glass stems, these will not work for you. They will only accommodate narrow ear pieces. Keep looking if you want something that will work for you.",

Either the piece that attaches to the arm wasn't tight enough, or the retainer was too long, etc. These are perfect! Super tight fit around my Costa's, nice soft material that doesn't bother the back of my neck, adjustability to fit over my head with a cap on but still be able to tighten up when doing something that would cause them to blow off. I plan on using these until they fall apart and replacing with another pair! ***If you found this review helpful in anyway, let me know by clicking \"yes\" below!!!",

The ear pieces fit tight and did not slip at all. I have used the retainers with a tail and did not like the tail rubbing on my neck, so these retainers are a great solution to my problem. I recommend them and I will be buying more of them.",

If I push hard enough to slip the retainers on, it'll crinkle the rubber upwards towards the lenses. I've only tried to use these a few times, they'll work better for non-rubberized ends.",
