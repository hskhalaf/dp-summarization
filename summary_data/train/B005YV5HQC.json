These are great. They can be used all all my products from iPhone to iPad to computers and sunglasses. I've even used them to clean my dash and GPS screen in the car. I would buy this again. I can tell the difference in the this product.",

I am extremely happy and will definitely reorder more when I finish this box. I highly recommend it.",

I am in college learning to be a software developer so I commonly have my laptop, tablet and smartphone on my desk for a 3 screen type of multitasking. Electronic devices are magnets for dust and the touch screens collect a great deal of dirt and oil from your fingertips. These wipes are very effective at gently removing all three without harming your device.",

I am not sure how the pricing works but when I went to buy them again, they had gone up in price substantially. Luckily by then time I checked out, it had gone down. I wouldn't have bought them at the higher Price.",
