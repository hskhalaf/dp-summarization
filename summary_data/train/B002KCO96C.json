You might want to use a pencil or something to force it open as stuff collects on the outside, which is what I have to do A couple other minor things I don' like about it would be how you open it to release the junk and how hard it is to re-align the case when you pull it out to throw out the junk.",

      "text": "I love this thing. No, it is NOT a regular vacuum, but it doesn't cost very much, either. Mine definitely is perfect for small jobs and for cleaning the stairs fairly well (it is so light weight it makes cleaning stairs easy!). It's fun to use and functional enough. Just don't expect it to be the equivalent of a regular vacuum cleaner. Now and then I need to get the big vacuum out but this one works in-between just great! Glad I bought it.",

It will not deep-clean carpet, but it will pick up off the surface, and I found it's really great for throw / bath rugs, as it isn't strong enough to lift them up and have them get stuck in the suction, but strong enough to give them enough of a clean until the next time they are thrown in the washer. Overall, I am extremely pleased, and actually came back to this page to buy a few more for gifts.",
