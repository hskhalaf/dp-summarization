      "text": "I thought the colors were a bit washed out, but perhaps I had not dialed in the settings correctly (too bright?), I'm just not sure. Otherwise, the image was beautiful. I thought the frame interpolation was excellent. It made sports more fluid and smoothed out regular movies in the lower setting. The highest setting made movies have an undesirable soap opera effect. My wife did think the projector was louder than our older Benq W1085ST which was a bit disappointing. Overall, I'd recommend this projector as a high end consumer projector.",

      "text": "I have been using this for a few days. It's very quiet, and the picture is phenomenal. I have run into a few problems which I will address with BenQ support: Although it is set for auto shut-off after 5 minutes, I left it today with no input for about 45 minutes, and when I returned it was still on. I am seeing some problems with the remote failing to work, and thought the 3D works great with my bluray player, I'm not getting a 3D picture when I feed it side-by-side from my cable box, even when I manually set it to side-by-side mode. Maybe they can walk me through a firmware update that will fix this.",

      "text": "I've considered to choose Benq W1500 because it has FullHD resolution, 6-segment 4-speed color wheel (RGBRGB), high brightness and also it has WHDI connection with any hardware with HDMI-out. I use 150\" MW-screen (about 330 cm width) and the picture with max brightness looks over-exposed, so I had to lower the projector's brightness to 40%. And I had to use ECO mode due to noise, because the noise in normal mode is too high. The projected picture quality is very good, but when I was watching a bright scenes, the contrast is not enough - may be due to the white environment (ceiling and walls) around the screen. So, I was satisfied with my new Benq W1500!",

Looking at the how it works I was very familiar with the DLP technology and could not believe this was available in a home unit. Easy to install and align. The picture is incredible! It arrived in time for the Super Bowl and WOW what a game! Best benefit, my son brings his girlfriend over to watch movies here cause it's cheaper then going out! It",

I was excited about them, but ended up using external speakers, which is fine. I didn't take any stars away for that because the picture quality is stunning. More than enough hook-ups for Apple TV, hooking up my laptop (both thru HDMI) and even our Super Nintendo (s-video). It was between this one or a similar $1500 BENq projector - and for nearly half the cost and identical picture quality - this one wins hands down.",

I can usually restore the connection by pressing another source button on the remote and then pressing the wireless source button again which can sometimes take a half minute or more to reconnect.

    "description": "WHDI uses 5GHz radio transmission band to transfer 2D and 3D video and audio throughout your home.View larger DarkChip3 DLP Technology projects higher brightness and deeper black levels for film-like quality. WORLD'S 1ST BUILT-IN 5GHZ WIRELESS FULL HD PROJECTOR\nBenQ's W1500 Wireless HDMI Projector integrates the latest technology for one-of-a-kind, big screen, at-home entertainment enjoyment. As the world's first home projector with built in wireless features, enjoy Full HD 3D video, frame interpolation for ultra-smooth motion quality, brilliant color performance and the flexibility of placing the projector in any room, regardless of size and brightness. W1500 is able to project uncompressed FHD images from HDMI output devices (e. g. Blu-ray, DVD or AV-R player, set top boxes, games consoles) without the hassle of HDMI cables and unnecessary expenses such as wall/ceiling mount. The projector uses WHDI (Wireless Home Digital Interface). It's a wireless HDMI connection standard that uses the 5GHz radio transmission band to transfer both 2D and 3D HD video and audio, which produces the same quality a wired connection would provide. There is no latency over distances up to 20 meters (line-of-sight). You can use this projector in any room thanks to the W1500's convenient zoom. The projector can project a screen size up to 84\" from just 6 feet away, making it perfect for most media rooms, game rooms, or even a temporary outdoor theater.\n\nBUILT-IN 2 X10W BIG SPEAKERS WITH SRS WOW HD\nPlug in and play. All you need is the power cord and the connection to the video source to have theater-like entertainment. W1500 comes with two built-in 10W speakers with SRS which can save money (or extra costs) by eliminating the need for Hi-Fi or external speakers. The built-in SRS WOW HD improves compressed and uncompressed audio performances by expanding the size of the audio image and creating a deep, rich bass response. And it improves audio playback quality by delivering a dynamic 3D entertainment experience with deep, rich bass and high frequency clarity for crisp detail.\n\nBRILLIANT IMAGE PERFORMANCE WITH ZOOM, SHIFT, AND 3D FEATURES\nEquipped with the latest DLP technology, watching 3D movies directly from Blu-ray DVD or even 3D gaming just became the norm.

Enjoy the experiences of 3D without worrying about the costs and limited 3D contents. W1500's 1.6x Big Zoom feature frees up space with an impressive range of throw distances; giving you the freedom and flexibility of placing the projector anywhere without having to compromise your current decor. Lens shift offers the extra flexibility to overcome any minor miscalculations during projector installation. All you have to do is adjust the switch next to the lens to shift the projected image up by 110%-130% within the projector housing. With this helpful feature, you'll never have to worry about positioning the projector slightly out of place again.\n\nFASTER IMAGES, BETTER COLORS\nW1500 features Texas Instruments' advanced DarkChip3 DLP Technology, which projects higher brightness and deeper black levels by \"filling in\" the area where the digital micro mirror connects to its hinge--producing smooth, film-like picture quality. For optimal color precision, the W1500 is built to match one of the highest high-definition video standards seen in professional-grade home projectors today: the native Rec. 709 color gamut. This enables the projector to deliver colors so real that it reflects what the human eye perceives. The special Frame Interpolation mode minimizes the appearance of motion blur and judder to give you an ultra-smooth view of all the action--especially in fast moving scenes in movies and sports games.
