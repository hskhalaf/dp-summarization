It runs and usually keeps good time, but it must be stopping occasionally because every few days it will suddenly be off by 20 minutes or more. It is a very nice watch and still under warranty but here is the problem. The warranty is only valid if the seller fills out the \u201ccertificate of limited warranty\u201d at the time of purchase. And guess what. Amazon did not fill out the card. So, if you buy a Seiko watch from Amazon be aware that you will not have a factory warranty.",

I cannot reach Seiko through Amazon as that option expired after six months. Avoid this watch. I will also avoid Seiko in in the future as well..",

I happen to have such a device. the alternative is to take it to a jeweler, which shouldn't cost much. don't think they made that clear",

We also ended up needing to buy a jeweler's set to remove a few band parts to get it to fit, but we've already used the set many times for different things so really no big deal.

The charcoal face is very striking and the fact that the dials and the numbers are luminous make it very practical in a darkened room. I wholeheartedly recommend this watch.",

The band and case also seem very high quality. It is very comfortable to wear. The many reviewers that say it is a bit heavy are correct. It is 5 oz on a postal scale, versus 4 oz for my older steel Seiko (so 25% heavier), and 2 oz for a titanium Seiko (which is extraordinarily light). The bezel is a bit too shiny for my liking. But the steel on the band is more muted. So overall, it looks classy without being too 'dressy'.",
