The zipper worked perfectly. This has a nice amount of pockets. Has a nice hood. The interior of the jacket feels like it will keep me warm.",

Good quality manufacturing. This has been excellent in weather down to about 20 degrees F. It doesn't have a heavy-enough insulation to work into the below-zero temperatures we frequently get so I'll need to keep my old parka (that this was to have replaced) around for a while longer. This is quite stylish so it is well worth keeping.",

Well, Ample pockets, adjustable cuffs to keep your arms dry, removable hood, with Velcro chin straps, to keep it on as tight or as loose you want. And the coat still looks good with or without the hood attached. I've been comfortable in temperatures hovering in the teens colder, and a sweater or sweatshirt is added. I imagine I will have many good years of staying warm and dry in the winter. Quality and a good price. Can't go wrong",

The pockets are easy to access and are very large to accommodate gloves and extra head gear.

It appears to be a little more water-resistant, but the fabric is stiffer and makes a rustling sound every time he moves. If you don't care about that, this coat is of good quality for the price, with LOTS OF POCKETS! It's a winner in my book!",

The jacket is quite water repellant to keep you dry, and the fleece lining is just enough to keep you warm for most Mid-Atlantic winter days. For extreme cold, layering is necessary. There are a number of handy pockets, and the jacket is good looking. Very pleased with the purchase.",

There are a few other pockets as well, but not an inner pocket as I often like for items I want to be sure remain warm. It's thinner than I'd expected, can't be sure yet it will work for the coldest of Midwestern winter weather. It was comfortable in 40 degree Fahrenheit--actually a little warm--but I don't know how it will perform in below 0 temps and with hellacious wind chills.",
