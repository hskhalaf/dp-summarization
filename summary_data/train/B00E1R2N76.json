The manufacturer needs to redesign the keyboard so the keys don't stick.",

Took a star off for comfort, as the key throw is shorter and the key spacing is a little tighter, both of which you get used to after a while. Overall, I have zero regrets - this keyboard's great,",

The transition was easy for me. ***I wish they made one without the additional numeric keypad, so it was even smaller. Maybe they do and I missed it.",

The only problem I've encountered thus far, other than just getting, used to it is that the [delete] key is so sensitive, that when I go to press the [end] key, the [delete] key is also activated, but this is not entirely awful; it's just a bit of a nuisance when I'm trying to write code or something. Otherwise, I think, especially for the price, that this is an amazing buy. If you're in the market for a flexible, portable keyboard, or if you're just looking looking for a quieter option, you should definitely give this thing a try!",

However after delicately hand washing with sponge and dish soap, internal wiring must not be very durable because afterwards buttons functioned oddly or didn't work. Initially all buttons inputted option+ characters so \"hello\" looked like this:  \u0307'\u00ac\u00ac\u00f8. The most lasting result is both delete and backspace buttons do not work. I've tried replugging, re-recognizing within system preferences and relaying still unable to delete. Seems the option+ has gone away but sometimes \"i\" will type with random other letters, \"random\" would look like this \"riiaindiom\".",
