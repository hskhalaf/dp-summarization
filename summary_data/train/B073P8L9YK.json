I picked the animal pattern, but you have many others to choose from. The material is thick and not cheap looking at all. Price is reasonable. I like that the back side has little dots that prevent it from moving.",

When they arrived, I quickly unfolded them and noticed that the colors from the animals transferred to other parts of the mat.

Overall, it seemed the ink used was of poor quality and made me wonder how it would actually hold up to messes. I returned both mats.",
