I like that it isn't one of the really tall ones, because it is significantly less to inflate. Also, we stayed plenty warm - even though the ground was pretty cold, we couldn't tell!",

But it dries out quickly and if you get the rechargeable pump with it, it's a quick easy refill. Good buy for the price.",

The problem of course is that when one person moves, the other person on the mattress will also move. There is no isolation of movement like on a real mattress. Therefore if you have somebody who rolls around on the mattress a lot, any other occupant will bounce around all night too. Thus nobody got a good night's sleep. And the air pretty much all leaked out by morning even though it was brand new. Will save it for inlaws when they come to visit.",

It stayed perfectly inflated which is great (and expected in a new product), but the curves on the mattress are very deep that it is so uncomfortable. I sleep on my back and it was just so lumpy. This is maybe fine if you sleep on your side and you sleep in one of the curves, but I had to sleep on this for 3 nights and it was horrible. I'm 24 and had back pain after every night. I seriously don't know why the top of the mattress isn't just flat. Horrible design",

We got it the day before we left for camping and just got back and we loved it. We always go to the ae spot and have used the small self inflating mats but this air mattress was a way better idea. It was very comfortable and durable. It has a thick material so we didn't have to worry about getting holes. It stayed aired up all 4 nights and didn't have to re air it up once.",
