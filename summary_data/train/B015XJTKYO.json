Wow, what a shoe....I never looked back. Excellent running shoe and keeps feet and ankles very comfortable all day when on my feet at work during the week. A bit pricey (quality often is), but trust me, I get my money out of these puppies. (My wife will attest to that).

Looking at others' comments, I think the problem might be in the last of the shoe. Apparently, some are wide, and others not so wide, so a wide shoe width only goes so far to accomodate a wide foot like mine. The other factor is the last on which the shoe is built. So, I would recommend caution for buyers with wide feet. On the plus side, Amazon does have a liberal return policy, and I was able to return them for a refund.",

About an hour or two break-in removed the initial stiffness. Reasonably light for leather runners.",
