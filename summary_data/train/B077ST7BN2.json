This would happen if the pole got stuck in rocks and you had to pull it out a little bit. (The sections wouldn't slide out completely, maybe just a quarter inch, but it was a bit annoying.) I general I think it's worth considering a pole that has adjustable height so you can have one height for going up in another height for going down. Hopefully Amazon or Black Diamond will take care of the broken strap for me.",

Not worth the frustration and I think I'll go back to a different style where you can adjust the sizing as well. One size is OK but it's nice to be able to extend or retract them a bit to adjust when going uphill or downhill, especially on 10+ mile hikes in the Rockies.",
