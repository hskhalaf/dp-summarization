When I called customer service they were great and sent me another right away. The second one lasted about 4 uses and the same mount cracked and broke off. The third one and then the fourth one.. need I say more. This is a defective product. I am now sending it back to get a full refund. I will have to say customer service has been great!",

My wife doesn't use it often; however, when needed it processed like a dream. The plastic bowl and the metal sprocket in the middle seemed at odds when put to the task. As per photos, the crack is very noticeable and began to leak the contents. After looking closely at the bowl, we realized the plastic bowl had failed. In the end, I am sure that if my wife had used the processor with higher regularity, we would have encountered the problem sooner. Very disappointed to say-the-least.",

When taking the lid off, the dough blade came out attached to the lid. This was caused by the hot plastic melting onto it. While trying to get the dough blade released, I burned my finger. The heat from the machine killed the yeast, so my dough was useless. Contacted Breville by email and sent pictures and have yet to recieve a response. For $400.00 one should expect better performance and service from the manufacturer. Don't use this machine for dough. So disappointed.",

Well, if you like to cook, BUY THIS. it is worth twice what I spent for it. It has good solid parts, metal where it is needed. Strong shafts. It shreds parmagane as if it were butter. It does a beautiful job of thin slicing vegetables, very thin, if that is what one wants. Let me tell you, I am in love",

Processing cabbage for slaw, I have tried the larger grating blade and it did well. Recently tried the julienne blade. With this blade the orientation of the cabbage in the hopper allows you to get a slightly larger/coarser product that with the shredder - worked great.",

      "text": "Love it! Processor does not hop around on counter when using, and it is easy to use and clean. If there was one thing I'd point out, it is that when using the small bowl, contents do splatter into the bigger bowl, therefore, both bowls requires a quick wash & rinse. I can live with that. I'd recommend visiting your local library for the Food Processor Bible for a lot of great ideas too, or buy the book.",

I like the adjustment for different size slices. The spatula seems to scrap the bowl perfect and makes everything come out easy and the brush is great for cleaning the blades. I haven't used every attachment yet, but can't wait to try all of them. I wish it would cut food into small cubes. It chopped my potatoes up too much, but maybe I just need more practice. I would recommend this food processor.",

Putting them in the back of the dishwasher makes it less likely that anyone will accidentally bump into them when loading and unloading. I guess it goes without saying to keep away from children!",

The product cleans up very nicely. The food chute is wide enough to get your hand in it for quick cleaning. We have used it for chopping, and again, the results were quick and the chopped pieces were uniform. We highly recommend this product!",

    "description": "Color:Stainless Steel\n\nAll accessories included with the Breville Sous Chef are housed in a convenient plastic container. It can be stored flat or on its side to take up less counter space.  WHY THE BREVILLE SOUS CHEF FOOD PROCESSOR?\nEvery Breville product begins with a simple moment of brilliance. The Breville Sous Chef began with the observation that the food comes in many different shapes and sizes, making it difficult for one machine to consistently cut all ingredients into the optimal size pieces. So how do you make sure that you get the perfect size for what you\u2019re cooking?\n\nThe Breville Sous Chef solves this problem with its unique design. Its wide feed chute makes it possible to slice vegetables of all shapes and sizes, while numerous disc and blade options makes it easy to get perfect results, any way you slice it.\n\nCOMBINING CONVENIENCE AND VERSATILITY: THE GREATEST SLICED THING SINCE BREAD.\nFood processors are supposed to make food prep easier, not more frustrating. The Breville Sous Chef has a 5.5\u201d Super Wide Feed Chute that reduces the need to pre-cut most fruits & veggies, saving you time.\n\nThe Breville Sous Chef comes with a set of 8 discs and blades for numerous prep options, all housed in a convenient accessory storage. The discs include a variable slicing disc that can be set to 24 different slicing settings so you can customize the thickness of your slices from a paper thin 0.3mm all the way up to a thick 8.0mm. Other discs in the set include a julienne disc, a French fry cutting disc, a whisking disc, and a reversible shredding disc, while the blades include a micro-serrated universal S blade, a dough blade for kneading and combining ingredients, and a mini blade for use with mini-bowl. \n\nThe Breville Sous Chef includes two bowls, a large 16 cup processing bowl and a 2.5 cup mini processing bowl, for convenient processing no matter what size portions you\u2019re chopping. The 16-cup option allows you to blend up large servings of soup or dough, while the mini processing bowl is perfect for processing small amounts of sauces or nuts.\n\nCombining slicing options and two size choices with the convenience of the wide mouth chute, it is no wonder that the Breville Sous Chef was rated the best food processor in 2012 by a leading American reviewer of products.\n\nPRODUCT FEATURES\n\n\n 1.  Small Food Pusher: for improved processing control of smaller ingredients. It also doubles as a measuring cup for adding/measuring ingredients. The food processor will run continually whether the small pusher is in or out\n 2.  Large Food Pusher for pushing food down the feed chute. The food processor will not start unless the large pusher is in place correctly.\n 3.  Feed Chute Safety System: prevents the motor from operating unless the bowl, lid and large food pusher are correctly locked in position.\n 4.  Super Wide Feed Chute so large ingredients don\u2019t have to be chopped before being fed into the food processor\n 5.  Silicone Seal: reduces the chance of leakage while processing large volumes of liquid ingredients.\n 6.  Processing Bowl: 16 cup bowl for dry ingredients and 12 cups for liquid (wet ingredients). The processing bowl locks onto the motor base.\n 7.  LCD Display with Count-Up & Count-Down Timer: used to set desired time required for processing. Can count up or down, stopping the processor once the time is reached in count down mode.\n 8.  Solid Die-Cast Metal Base\n 9.  Direct Drive Motor: with safety braking system.\n 10. Non-Skid Rubber Feet: for added safety and stability.\n 11. All parts that come in contact with food are BPA free.\n\n\n\nClick on image to view larger.",
