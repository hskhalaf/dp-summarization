Be aware sometimes plugging in a new high power or data device may pause another port briefly. For example, when I plugged a portable hard drive in, the moment I pushed the power button to that port, my audio interface plugged into a different port disconnected briefly, before reconnecting. Then both were connected and seemed to work fine. But there may be an issue with high power devices affecting other ports. Other than that it is a solid unit with plenty of ports.",

I've tilted it up and leaned it against my label printer, but even then it's hard to see due to glare off the plastic cover, and the recessed lights are hidden if you're not looking directly onto the top. I wanted the on/off switches so I can see what's active because with Mac Catalina OS, my Brother portable scanner will not work if a Brother printer is also plugged in via USB.",

This covers an absolute majority of the devices, but not ALL of them, and i've already discovered one externally powered proprietary device, which couldn't care less about the state of that button.",

I didn't notice any speed differences with the hard disk or reading USB stick from directly into my laptop. I love my laptop, but it really does not have enough ports to do what I want. Plus some left over if I want to connect something else. It has LEDs but they are not obtrusive. I won't rate on portability or for travelling because it is more or less a fixture on my desktop. If I want to take my laptop with me, it is just one cable to unplug.",

      "text": "I just got a new laptop, but the one downside to it is the presence of only one USB port. I use the Logitech connector that allows me to run up to six things using the one little connector, but I am also taking a course in transcription and I have a foot pedal and headphones, plus a gadget that will enhance the audio for me if necessary--all needing a USB port. I found this on Amazon and it seemed just the ticket. Glad to say it arrived expediently and it is working faboulously.",
