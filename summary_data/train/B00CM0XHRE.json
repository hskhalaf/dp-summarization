Dropped it too many times to count and it always worked. So, I got a new Boom 3. I'm so disappointed. Looks great, but can't be used for phone calls. Found this out when I took it to work the first day and was showing off my new and \"improved\" speaker. Major embarrassing fail. Tried to salvage the situation by plugging in an aux cable. Surprise! No 3.5mm jack. I'm returning the 3 tomorrow and shopping for the original.",

The sound from these speakers really sets them apart from any other bluetooth speaker out there, including comparably-priced Bose Mini wireless speakers.

It gives you enough control of the speaker from the smartphone app that you don't even need to physically go to the speaker. The sound is very good for its size.

Additionally, the firmware is updatable, and the charge time is significantly less than other models.

I worked at a restaurant on The Hill in Boulder, CO and we had the bright blue Megaboom speaker, so I knew the big ones were great, and this smaller version is great too. I do wish it were just a tab bit louder at its MAX volume as I like pretty loud music, but will ok until I buy the bigger one.",

If you use it upside down, the power cord would come out the top, and it is bright yellow. Not too attractive, and it would have been so easy to have the power cord plug into the side.

The sound is good. I even like to take it outside when I am working in the yard or on the porch. I don't have to have earbuds in and miss what is going on around me. Super product. Love it.
