It has a full charge and yet it still stops mid-job. I would love a refund to be honest. Bummed. I was super excited about this purchase and waited a long time before I splurged.",

However after owning 2 Roombas and the hassles with tangling in the roller bar and the side sweepers falling off and the noise, I am loving this little gem. I have 2 dogs. Sometimes 3 when granddog visits. This keeps me sane. She runs at night when we go to bed and everyone is accounted for. ( we learned this the HARD way after not one but Two poop incidents involving Roomba. OMG) Especially for the price I love it so far.",

Now, not even a year in I noticed it's not picking up anything, Just pushing dirt and dust around. I changed the filter, cleaned everything out and still no suction at all. Not worth it for $179 for a year.",
