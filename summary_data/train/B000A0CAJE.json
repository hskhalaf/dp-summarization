      "text": "This was a good fit for my 2004 Toyota Sienna XLE. One thing to note is that the filter is not marked as to the orientation it should go inside the air cleaner assembly. The side of the rubber gasket that has the groove on it goes down and the long edge with the notches in the groove go towards the front of the vehicle. You can't get the cover back on with it incorrectly assembled but it would be nice for them to print on it the orientation. Good quality though. Visit my blog at johnfixesstuff.blogspot.com and search for air filter to get instructions with detailed pictures on how to install this filter on your Sienna.",

No Fram stamp on the filter and no arrows to direct which side is up and down. It's like a totally different flimsy filter (old Fram one was very solid and sturdy) placed inside a Fram box. Worse of all, the old Fram filter took me 30 seconds to install. This new one wouldn't go on even after 30 minutes of fiddling. This product obviously does NOT fit a 2005 Toyota Sienna. Amazon and Fram owes me 30 minutes of my time back!",
