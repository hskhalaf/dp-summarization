Keep in mind the connection has a left hand thread. That being said, the torch lights up with one click of the spark lighter. It is quite powerful too. Only open the valve on the torch an 1/8 of a turn when igniting. I found that setting to work well on average weeds.",

In both cases the weeds were growing up from their burned or wilted remnants within a week. I would try to return it but already tossed the box. I really urge you to stay away.",

Just linger over it and come back day 2 to see the full effect. Used a home based brew of vinegar, salt and soap that was not as effective. Gets tiring lugging around the propane tank. Used a wheel barrow.",
