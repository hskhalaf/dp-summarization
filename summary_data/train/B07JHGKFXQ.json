One snapped on the way down; fortunately not one of the main load bearing straps but rather a stability strap. Needed something better so these were rated at 5200lbs break, and it was a kit. The ratchets were better than the Lowes. Made the return trip with no issues and the straps were in great shape.",

Also love the sticker put my first one on my tailgate of my Ranger lost the second one but sure would like a second one if I can so I can put it on the other side of my tailgate",
