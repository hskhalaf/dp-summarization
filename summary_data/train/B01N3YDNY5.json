The assembly took some imagination, because the instructions did not match the parts list, i.e., some of the parts that the instructions said to assemble appeared to be missing, but closer inspection showed that some parts were pre-assembled before packing/shipping. I suspect many users would be confused by this, looking for \"part A\" to assemble to \"part B\" when no part A, as shown in the drawing, could not be found in the package. I finally discovered that it had already been installed into part B, for instance. Other than that, I have it put together, looks OK, but have not used it yet.",
