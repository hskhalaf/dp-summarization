The last bag we got didn\u2019t smell right, my lab (who needs a massive rock in his food to slow him down to eat) refused to eat this food. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because of the heat coming in or what it was so I ended up going and buying a bag locally to see a side by side comparison. The online food smelt sour - definitely something off with it. My lab immediately ate the locally bought store food without hesitation. Until now we have had no problems, but it\u2019s just not worth the risk imo and tossing a whole bag of food.",

The result is he is a big strong happy boy (at 102 lbs at 9 months) his coat is smooth and shiny, stools are firm, breath is good and teeth clean.

Not sure who that falls on but we will be buying through another company and hopefully get the same great value but with better results.",
