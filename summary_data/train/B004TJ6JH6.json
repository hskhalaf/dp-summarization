I'm pretty sure this is the same product cuz I just pressed buy again. No option for color temperature on the description. I'm going to have to return it.

The only reason I gave this four stars is because it does not include the battery or charger. I feel for $30 it should include those items.",

The light it exudes seems to be fine, and the filters (diffusion and 3200) work ok. I don't know if they make additional filters for the unit but that'd be good if they do. Overall construction material seems pretty cheap. The battery compartment is open, thus exposing the batteries and connections to the elements like moisture and dust. The clamp for the hot shoe requires some manipulation to seat properly. Overall, I have to say that this unit strikes me as something I can use, but not count on.",

The swivel mount thing is also a bit hard to adjust. Not terrible, but not 5 star operation.",
