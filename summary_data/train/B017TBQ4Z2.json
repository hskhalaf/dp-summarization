I like that the set has bags to store the tunnel and poles and protectors for the sharp ends of the poles. Very easy to set up, break down and put away.",

You may want to get your sewing kit and reinforce the loops that hold the stakes for the tunnel before use, and try to keep the dog out of it until they are all in the ground. Avoid using the tunnel when windy too. All in all, when it is back in stock, I plan on buying a second set. Can't beat the value!",
