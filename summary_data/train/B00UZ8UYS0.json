For anyone dealing with intestinal disorders, especially bacteria overgrowth and leaky gut (where you cannot absorb minerals like silica well), this is quite literally a magic bullet. Every disease and disorder that the GAPS diet addresses will also be combat with this supplement; from crohn's, to colitis, to candida, to IBS, to autism and schizophrenia, this supplement should undoubtedly be a staple in one's regime.",

Initially, I really liked the effect, because for a couple of weeks my hair became more shiny, came back to normal, somewhere in a month of taking the nails became stronger! The taste and especially the smell is somewhat unpleasant , but if these drops are added to the juice or tea, it is not felt. Contains choline and silicon, which generates the formation of collagen. It is taken 2 times a day-5 drops in 1/4 cup of water. It's important to drink immediately as soon as the remedy is stirred!",

It does have kind of a fishy sort of taste to it which is why I prefer to mix it with juice, but it isn't completely unbearable. It's completely worth the results I have experienced.",

I\u2019ve been joking with people that I don\u2019t know how to cut my nails because I\u2019ve never had to do it. This product is fantastic for nails, still trying to determine if it\u2019s impacting my thin hair",

I use the liquid and just drop it right on my tongue then drink some water. It doesn\u2019t taste good but doesn\u2019t bother me either. I don\u2019t have time to bother mixing it into something.",
