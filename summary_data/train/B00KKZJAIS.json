Someone at my gym said it best \"It is like taking your workout shirt and putting it over the bar and trying to do pull-ups on it\" Too slippery! Talk to people at your gym, and they will recommend something like Bear Komplex or picsil. I hope this saves someone else $40",

Workout included toes to bar so I was psyched to be able to focus more on getting my toes up than how badly my hands hurt, but I couldn't, because I slipped right off the bar. Of course you don't know this until you cut the little slits for your fingers otherwise you can't get them on your hand to even try them out - and then since you cut them you can't return them. Awesome. Chalk didn't help either. Since I'm out the $40 after not even one use, hopefully this will save someone else their money. Very disappointed.",

There is full/strong wrist support. I also use chalk with these. As long as you rinse it out after each use, there's no remnants of chalk, sweat, nor stink. Would absolutely recommend this product.",

Other than that, I really like how they function for movements that usually tear my hands, like pull-ups and kettle bell swings.

I highly recommend WODies and the Nubs to go with them. i really never noticed I was wearing them, very comfortable. The only time I had to remove them was for HSPUs.

I don't know if it's because of these grips but it felt as though it was easier than usual to hold on with just fingers, but the bar was not in my palm.

The reason I didn\u2019t give them 5 stars is because you have to cut your own finger holes.
