My only complaint with this seat is that I had to buy a different bike as it just didn't work on my mountain bike due to its frame being too thick to allow me to turn with the seat attached. Definitely recommend this seat though.",

Cooper loves this seat! He has a blast during bike rides, especially the downhills. The little bar for him to hold in the front is great and I think it helps him feel in control. His legs aren't long enough to put in the leg straps but he's not going anywhere once the harness is buckled. Safe, secure and fun for our little guy.",

We love having our sun in the seat and riding right in front where we can hear him and point things out etc. The seat is very, very well made, well designed, and works very well. It's super easy to install, and also easy to put on and off each time with the quick release mechanism, but it's also nice that you can lock it on. Would definitely buy again. We considered the ibert, but are very glad we paid the extra money to get the Yepp.",

I purchased it as a Father's Day gift for my husband and now he and our 9-month-old enjoy bike rides daily. It's lightweight but sturdy, and we were able to set it up quickly and easily. It fits our Elektra beach cruiser perfectly with no adapter or additional parts needed. I can't speak for how well it bodes with more serious cyclists, but if you're in the market for a safe and good looking infant bike seat for leisure cruises, I highly recommend this product. I just wish Yepp made infant helmets to match!",

Everything about it is good: the back is high enough to provide support, the straps are easy to work, the double safety clips are a great idea. Baby loves the little handle, too! Went on our beach cruiser easily and is very, very easy to ride. We don't seem to have any issues bumping our knees on it (like we have seen on some reviews of other seats). Also, has a quick-detachment feature that means the seat just comes right off if you don't want it. Plus, the seat locks ON if you want to prevent theft. A great purchase!",

Every time we go out and ride in our neighborhood or on a trail, we get constant compliments. We've almost caused a few car accidents because people driving by just stare and forget to watch the road. The seat looks good, seems comfortable, and is very sturdy. There is absolutely no wobble when you ride, and the 5-point harness keeps our son positioned well. The first time we rode in this seat our son fell asleep and slumped onto the handle in front - which turned out to be a nice head rest! Great seat!!",
