There is no dust created, even when I split a pill into quarters. Plus, I can precisely control where the break occurs. Thus, any uneven pieces are all my fault.

      "text": "I cried uncle after cutting pills for my mother for a few weeks using a knife and thought that there's got to be a gadget for this. I did research and read reviews and decided on this one. It's well-made, sturdy and performs like a charm. No more shattered, unequal halves. This is a comparison between knife and gadget, mind you. But, I successfully measured twice and cut once with the research as well as with the use of this product. I don't pre-cut a week's worth, I cut the one pill that needs splitting each morning because it comes out so satisfyingly perfect that it sets the tone for my day!",

Feel free to try using razor blades and if that works for you, great, but this seems like a solid cutter that will meet my needs for a long time.",
