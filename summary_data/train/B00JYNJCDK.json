As several others have mentioned this vest does tend to ride up on your chest when using it, and could use a strap that goes from front to back under the crotch that can be used to prevent this. Based on these reviews when I got my vest I added such a strap myself. I had a left over web belt so I simply cut it to the correct size and used waterproof glue that works with fabric to attach the ends ends of the web belt to the vest. My fix worked great and with the belt in place this vest gets a five star rating. :)",

It also doesn't have any air chamber around the back of your head, so the total amount of air it held seemed less than most other vests, therefore it probably had less buoyancy than some of the others.
