The camera makes some disturbing sounds out of the box, they can be disabled from the menu and I would suggest turning them all off. When first turned on the focusing parts move out and makes a small noise. This is the second camera of this model - the first one the battery had to be returned (that takes a while). Normal for a commodity electronic item, mass production will always have lemons and QC problems. A bit slow... shutter, response and refresh all a bit slow, but what I would expect at this price.",

The only thing I will look for different in our next camera is the ability to find a waterproof case (or just get a waterproof camera). One piece of advice, use name brand SD cards, I don't know if it was the card or the camera didn't like the cheap SD I put into it but few of the pictures came out and it would lock up the camera. When I put a name brand card back in, the camera worked normal.",

It was more than I thought I could get for what I could afford, and now, I wish I had bought one for myself as well. My daughter loves it, and you should see the pictures of my little grandson!

The camera quit while I was taking pictures. Bummer. Now I have a wonderfully pretty pink screen. I can't take pictures and I am beginning to sense that I have wasted the $150 invested. My advise...choose something else. However...it's your money...and I am only person. I have other Kodak cameras...I bought this because of the 8mp feature. Hope this helps some of you.",

I especially like the ability to overide the automatic settings and get a little creative with this camera. It has a high ISO, which allows you to take existing light photos, even at night. I recommend this camera, especially for under $200, it is a real deal. Negatives? A bit bigger screen, and perhaps a bit better optics. (The optics aren't bad, just not great, but this is typical of sub $300 aim and shoot cameras.) Overall, I am very pleased with this camera.",

Great pictures, so easy to use, nice video feature, etc. But here it is 6 months later, it's jammed, frozen, won't work and it's the holidays. I have to send it in to be fixed with no clue when I'll get it back. I've baby'd this thing and am never rough on it nor have gotten it moist, wet, anything. NOT IMPRESSED!",

It wasn't too expensive and it's 8 MEGA PIXELS!!",

As a casual camera user, I nver know which mode to choose when I shoot photos, but the Kodak tells you as you scroll thru like 20 different options. It also takes very crisp shots and travels easily. I used to be an Olympus guy, but Kodak's user interface has swayed me.",
