But we also use it when we don't have small things to grill as a tray to carry things in and out from fridge to grill and grill to table. Very handy - highly recommended.",

As soon as i got my normal sponge out it was perfectly fine.",

Normally I will have coated my veggies with olive oil before grilling, this tends to discolor the surface after use but I was expecting that. Its been easy to clean. Normally I use a Scotch Brite scour pad briefly and then stick it in the dishwasher. Being made of a heavy gauge of stainless steel I anticipate many years of trouble free use.",
