I may change vit c and my glycolic brand, but you can not get better than elta md. I loved their uv clear sunscreen so Much I used it at night. I now use this at night and uv clear tinted during the day. What makes this different are the other ingredients that even your skin tone and reduce inflammation. Try it for 30 days and you will be HOOKED! I am a skincare guru. This is #1 on my list.",

I've been putting this on after my tretinoin at night, and after the already-dry skin all ran its course, my skin now is great. I plan to keep using all of these products and would recommend them to others that have similar issues. If I didn't have such problem skin, I'd probably use drug-store brands for cheaper.",

I looked at the bottle and it seemed fine until I noticed a small holes on the bottom of the airless pump. Looks like whoever is selling this added some other product and it is definitely not Elta MD. The consistency is so off, usually this moisturizer is like silk when applied, but this product I received smelled like sunscreen and balled up on my face when I applied it. FAKE, this is a scam!! Do not buy from them",

    "description": "This facial moisturizer works to moisturize, restore and repair skin while you rest. Niacinamide and antioxidants work to improve skin color and tone. EltaMD PM Therapy is oil-free, fragrance-free, noncomedogenic and safe for sensitive skin. How to activate pump: With the cap cover in place over the pump, invert the container upside down and tap firmly 4\u20105 times. (This will force the liquid up into the actuator and create a vacuum). Return the container to its upright position. Remove the cap, and with the nozzle away from your face, press the pump to dispense the product into your hand. It may take several pumps to completely prime the pump to allow the actuator to deliver product. If pump continues to fail, try steps again.\n\nBRAND STORY\nEltaMD Skin Care is committed to helping you have great skin for life.
