It is light-weight where my old crock pot insert was heavy, cumbersome, and hard to manipulate in the sink while washing. It looks good on my kitchen counter. It also has a saute/browning feature that negates the need for an additional pan for browning. But best of all, it cooks meals perfectly. I prepared a ham with pineapple in it and my husband said it was the best he had ever had. It actually melted in your mouth.",
