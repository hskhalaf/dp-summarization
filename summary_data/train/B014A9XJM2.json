Loved the window size and both side accessibility. Could have fit 2 smaller cots or a double size air mattress comfortably. Cons: 1. Bag to pack up has only one zipper toggle (if it breaks there isn't a second to rely on) and bag itself is very thin- ripped as I was packing the car and had to use duct tape to use for the first run. 2. Does not come with a rainfly/staked tarp for the cost.",

Cons: 1) comes with an extra mesh screen that is useless inside the tent and is not sealed and also takes up precious space. 2) either the tent is not sealed or the holes in the screen mesh is too big because multiple types of ants kept coming inside the tent, not only that, I caught a baby centapede in my tent!",

Just be forewarned. Edited to add: The tent itself is wonderful and does pop right up. All the videos show folding back up a smaller tent. One of the other reviewers, Meryl posted the best video and it allowed us to fold ours back up and put it in the bag. It is still difficult to do however.",
