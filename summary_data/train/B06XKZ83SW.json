I was looking for a more ergonomic chair as I sit in front of my computer for most of the day, but a lot of the chairs I saw were much bigger than what I needed. First impressions, back support is noticeably better than my old cheap meshback chair, and the seat cushion is nice too. No tilting, but I didn't need it. There's a distinct plasticy smell, I think it's from the foam cushions but I'm sure it'll go away in a little bit. The chair wasn't hard to put together, the instructions were one straightforward page and extra screws were included.",

The mesh back panel offers supreme comfort and makes an airy, breathable option and is comfortable for long hours of typing at a desk. It is highly useful to sit in a correct posture, and the cushion is firm without being overly hard. The back panel provides firm lumbar support and feels much sturdier than it looks, and it reclines with adjustable resistance. The headrest hits in the right position to allow my body to relax.

The reason this is only a 3 star for me is that the lumbar support was way to strong. People who like a strong lumbar support will love this, but I returned it because the lumbar support was too painful. The chair also doesn't stay reclined, which is something I like. The chair also arrived with a tear in the back but that isn't a big deal because if I had liked the chair, I'm sure they would have sent a replacement part.",

      "text": "PROS: +Easy to assemble, and they give you a set of spares which is a good consideration. +The seat is pretty comfortable, and I like it a lot. +Mesh back and seat keep the chair cool CONS - The chair's balance is slightly off, so if you scoot forward too quickly, sometimes it tips forward. - The back covering is unbearable now because there is a leather lip in the middle of the chair that has curled downward. It pokes at my back and hurts a lot after a couple of minutes of sitting. I have to put a pillow to block it. This was a big minus for me.",
