I really love the sort of rubber coating around the front of the shoe. Seems most of my shoes that have the mesh overlay tend to rip there, but hopefully these won't. I had them in my cart for a few days and the price dropped to about 30 bucks! I couldn't pass that up. Thanks Amazon!",

The negative is the front flap of the shoe slides across it does not matter how tight I tie my shoelace that pies slides over just slightly then you end up w/the knot of your shoelace on your ankle. You may not notice but for doing Zumba and other moving activity this is bit annoying so I have to watch what days I pull them for the gym. So that I am not distracted in class pulling them into place. Not a happy camper.",

I bought these for my cardio on the (treadmill for 60-70 minutes at 4-4.4 mph at an incline) they are stiff, they also slip on the belt at times. I haven't tried them on an indoor court floor but would caution they probably would be too slippery for any running on basketball or racquet ball courts. For the price they aren't bad and as a casual shoe they are great, but I won't be buying again to use for exercise.",
