The second most important thing; hold the finder parallel to the studs you're looking to find the edges of. This will typically mean vertically for wall studs. As the directions state, sweep from both sides and find the edges from each side, the center point between the 2 marks will be the best place to drill. Check the distance between the two marks to ensure it logically fits the width of a wall stud and then also find 2 other studs and check the distance apart. Each stud should be the same width and each should typically be the same distance from the others.",

If you don't use this before trying to set a screw in a hollow wall and you hit a stud, your wall anchor will likely destroy the sheetrock. If you know where the stud is, you will know where to just use a screw with no anchor. Many wall anchors will bend back towards screwdriver if you hit a stud or beam. This often enlarges the hole past repair, or even crumbles the drywall (and wallpaper). I always blamed the anchor type. Possible but no, usually a wooden stud or beam is behind the wall.",

You need to move it reasonably fast over the wall to find the studs. Then it shows shapes on the little screen and it shines a red light in the center when you have this unit perfectly aligned with the stud. Then yoiu can mark the spot on the wall and drill a hole in the wall and into the stud you just found with this unit. I am glad they make this.",

    "description": "Size:Edge Finding| Style:A100The StudSensor A100 is Zircon\u2019s newest edge locating electronic stud finder that is sold exclusively on Amazon. The A100 is designed with a smooth, ergonomic rubber grip allowing for a comfortable yet secure hold for any size hand, at any angle. This stud finder uses the most recent technology in density detecting software and circuitry. The scanner has 2 scanning modes to locate the edges of wood and metal studs and joists behind walls, floors, and in ceilings up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep. In StudScan Mode, the SS A100 locates the edges of shallower wood or metal studs up to 0.75 of an inch (19 mm) deep. Switch over to DeepScan Mode to double the scanning depth to 1.5 inches (38 mm). This stud sensor is programmed with a Wire Warning Detection feature that indicates the presence of live unshielded electrical wires up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep when using either stud scanning modes. Finding studs using this edge finding tool is simple. To get started, install one brand new 9V alkaline battery (not included). Place the unit flat against the wall and press the Power Button to calibrate the sensor. Once you hear a beep indicating calibration is complete, continue to hold the Power Button and slowly slide the tool across the surface. The easy-to-read LCD will alert you as the stud detector approaches the edge of the stud in both scanning modes. Once the edge is detected, the patented arrow-shaped SpotLite Pointer will shine, the translucent base will illuminate, and an audio tone will sound. DO NOT DRILL HERE! Instead, mark the spot in the \u201cV\u2019 marker groove at the head of the tool and continue past the stud. Repeat the process in the opposite direction and mark the opposite edge of the stud. The center of the stud is midway between the two marks. Make sure to note whether the Wire Warning Detection is alerting you to live, unshielded AC wiring before drilling between the two marks into the center of the stud. With the Zircon StudSensor A100, you can safely maneuver through the most complicated of projects with the professional confidence that comes from owning a Zircon.",
