I have an all white couch which is typically covered/protected and has the cushions removed every couple weeks to bleach. One cleaning with this and it looks like the couch was bleached. Plus it gets all the hard to reach places that aren't cleaned. I have tried the vacuum attachments, the roll over things, this was easier and worked far better. So far I am in love!!",

I did all 12 stairs and a 4X4 landing on one battery charge. Can't believe the amount of hair and dirt left behind my our other vacuums I did not buy extra filters, but I can see they will be required. There is an aluminum 90 degree bend after the pickup brush and before the collection canister which keeps clogging. A butter knife will easily clean it out, but think of what I am missing when it does clog?? Very happy with the Shark and it's performance.",

Which is really annoying. And when I go to empty it, dust gets EVERYWHERE. And the little filter thing is very hard to clean.",

And, although the new vac fits on the old base, the tools are not compatible. Damn, my wife is not happy.",

Filter catch\u2019s a lot of dust ( which is great!) but only clean with a dry rag or old toothbrush; wet cleaning the filter led to a moldy smell for the rest of the life of the filter. Definitely satisfied with quality for the price paid. Will be buying more Shark products based on experience and general reviews.",
