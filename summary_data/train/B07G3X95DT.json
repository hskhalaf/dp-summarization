I needed a medium-ish sized bag and when I came across these I ordered them because they came with different colored tissue paper and I thought that was convenient and the scratch area on the front was a nice touch. When I got them they surpassed my expectations. Great bags, good quality. The tissue paper saved me tons of time and since I needed 7 bags for 7 people the different colored paper was perfect. But the scratch pad is so cool. Use the provided styluses to write names (white I did) draw pictures or do whatever. So cool.",

With these bags, I just simply scratched the message on the front that I wanted to say and placed the plastic back over so it wouldn\u2019t scratch off. I didn\u2019t even need tissue as a single sheet was provided for each one in a different color. They were a hit and so easy! I highly recommend and I\u2019m getting another set to have on hand for other last minute gift giving.",
