Never encountered detonation. Smelled like the real deal when we have a fuel leak even! In some ways I prefer it to race gas from a drum because you never really know how fresh that stuff is, particularly at the start/end of a season. With the concentrate you're using local supply that's likely always fresh.",

I have a 2004 supercharged Lightning and i have a tune with lots of parts and with 93 octane it would ping and knock some times, but i installed the whole 32 oz can to 10 gallons of 93 and it got me 99.5 about . Big difference. No more pinging or knocking and it has allowed the tune to perform to its fullest. Nice....If you're running a boosted engine give it a try. Don't waste your money buying others.
