My 8-year-old great-granddaughter demonstrates how stable the GPS feature works, making the drone a pleasure to fly. My instructions to her were to \u201cTake-off, fly straight out over the field, move it around some, bring it back, land it.\u201d This is just her second time flying the drone (1st flight was immediately before this flight). She is using only the joysticks. She is 8, I am 75 next month, and we enjoy sharing family time together, and flying the HS100.",

Con: it can't be flown out of sight. The remote phone holder feels cheap. Night flying to capture videos needs to improve.

Been flying for two days. As long as you do the ritual for gps. It will comeback home and hover any time you hit home button or the battery is low. Controls work good. Pics are good. Great price for what it is. It is cheap and easy enough to fly you can let friends or family learn to fly.",

He absolutely loves it. Actually, we both do. We followed the included directions and also watched a few videos prior to operation. Once the weather cooperated, we took it outside for a test-drive. The camera is clear. We love the \"follow-me\" feature and especially the \"return to home\" feature. The quality and overall operation are as advertised and meet our expectations. I would say this is a great drone for beginners, and we will be purchasing the next generation drone from Holy Stone.",

This allows during the learning process to get all back in place when you lost control, and take a deep breath. Also, it is essential for taking photos or filming, where you need to concentrate on that rather than controlling the drone. The drone is robust, operates pretty silently, and it is easy to control.

It has comparable features to the other higher end platforms, features like return home and lond range. I am not going to get into all the details, as other reviewers have done that quite nicely already. What I do want to convey is that the drone is fun, and takes really nice photos and video. I really enjoy flying it, and really like the controller, and the software. It does give nice long flight times which is 12 -15mins as advertised.",

The setup was fairly simple, once everything went together and all batteries charged, I took it out for its maiden flight. Everything synced well and with the one button take off, it was flying like I was a pro! Very stable, As a beginner, this drone made everything simple. The drone is easy to control without it flying off into the bushes. I look forward to many flights with this. Highly recommend this drone. Now to find a case for it....",

The camera angle can be adjusted so you don't see the bottom of the propellors. Operator error. We had an issue with the first battery, but they sent us a replacement immediately. No issues with that one. Then we had a hard landing and one of the motor kept giving us an error. Customer service again was phenomenal. Helped us work through the problem and the drone is up and flying again. My husband says it's easy to use. Calibrating it initially was a bit confusing, but we figured it out. Excellent drone and excellent customer service.",

So apparently the battery is not holding it's charge from the time I fully charge it until 5 minutes later when I try to fly the drone.
