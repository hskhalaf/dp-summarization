I contacted Garmin support and they told me to take the cadence sensor of the bike. As a professional cycling and triathlon coach, I've owned dozens of Garmin products. Their support used to be exceptional, but in the last several years they seem to be OK with their products just not working. I'm just one customer and they essentially have a monopoly. Very disappointing.",

Working in the computer industry and specifically on interface design and user satisfaction with the technology, was very frustrated with the Garmin 1030. After several hours trying to pair the Garmin 1030 with an iPhone, I failed and gave up. My thoughts are, if Garmin can't Bluetooth pairing correct, what are the other pain points and how much time will be wasted trying to make the Gramin 1030 function as well as my years old Garmin 800?",

      "text": "I returned the product for a refund. I believe it was defective. It would not navigate to a downloaded course, regardless of the method importing a course. Garmin connect/express, ridewithgps, txc, fit, gpx..nothing worked. The course might load, but it would not calculate distance to destination etc., and it would not give turn directions, though the course appeared on the map and my position was accurate. Two calls/chats to Garmin, and they wanted to blame it on 3rd party (ridewithgps) file corruption. Followed their instructions to delete folders etc. Used a file created on Garmin Connect, reset the device. Nothing worked. This problem is evident on their forums, but they are unresponsive. I'll wait for an updated version.",

Constantly power cycling, re-pairing and deleting/reinstalling the Garmin Connect app on my phone in an attempt to restore connection. As I'm typing this I have spent the last 30 minutes trying to get the device to connect with my phone.Already went through this yesterday after yesterdays ride, having to do it again after todays ride.",

Quick delivery and pleased with the vendor, too. Highly recommended purchase.",

I was pleased with the 800, but the 1030 puts it to shame. Much easier to read at speed, more information per page, and good battery life. The interaction with the Garmin app works well and improves the whole experience. Price of course is a concern and the 1030 certainly isn\u2019t cheap. Now that I have one I can say it was worth the money to me and I would do it again.",
