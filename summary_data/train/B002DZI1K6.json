Our 7 year old loves watching them eat these.",

      "text": "I use these not as a staple, but more as a supplement when I'm feeling lazy or out of frozen blood worms. They're little sinking pellets made especially for ADFs, and they can smell them in the water. They don't go nuts like for the worms, but it's nice to offer some variety in their diet. Edit: I'm upgrading my review after careful observation and going over the ingredients. My frogs usually find them because the #1 ingredient is anchovy meal. They're also packed with vitamins that bloodworms can't provide, so I've been using them more, and bloodworms maybe twice a week. With 50% protein, these are the most nutritious I've found that they like.",

It does seem to take the frogs a long time to realize they are in the tank though, so I'm not sure they smell so strongly (never have that problem with live black worms). On the plus side it gives my shrimps a chance to eat them too - who seem to love them! The granules should be softened in a little water for a while before you attempt to feed, and I recommend a feeding dish because they could easily disappear in between gravel and never be found by the frogs.",
