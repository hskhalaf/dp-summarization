Of course your phone must have wifi but all phones have that anymore. This could be used as a remote spying camera if needed. Also the app allows easy transfer of pictures from camera to phone or from phone to camera. The NFC fea ture works well with my Samsung galaxy s5. Camera takes great photos as well.

I had to send it back to Samsung to get it fixed. They fixed it fairly quickly. Once the zoom was fixed it does zoom in pretty far and takes decent pictures when zoomed in pretty far. I dont like trying to navigate through the different functions Trying to find the best shoot mode. The panoramic photo option is pretty cool but most times my phobe takes better pictures than the camera",

The video quality was good but it did drain the battery quite a bit. I was not able to video the full graduation. I am very happy with this purchase.",
