I did not have drops like a lot of people reported. Unfortunately what I did have in July 2018 after 7ish months of use was a burning smell coming from it. As you can see from the picture, the unit was starting to burn up and melt down. I have used the wall outlet it was on for various things, and have never had an issue. The item was plugged in appropriately and never removed or messed with. This could have burnt my house down.",

The primary thing to keep in mind is this is not a MESH network. (Meaning one SSID and seamless connectivity) You have to set up a second SSID for it to even slightly work. Even then it's hit or miss with its coverage and constantly drops off. I would not recommend this product, instead, I would go with the Mesh X6S. Also to add, I attempted to set up as a single SSID with my existing wifi, and could not get it to route to the internet. (Its supposed to support this configuration)",

Signal dropped every 5 minutes. This was only used to connect two devices even then it couldn't handle the load. I tried running an ethernet cable and still did not make any difference. THerefor I would not recommend this product if your house is larger than 1500sqft.",

The connection quality is OK. When you extend both 2.4 and 5GHz networks, it uses only the 5GHz band to extend both frequencies, meaning the extender connects to the router only at 5GHz and then creates the 2.4GHz extension off the 5GHz, so both frequencies are actually extensions of the router's 5GHz band. That's not really too much of a problem but it adds extra load to the 5 instead of leveraging the 2.4. Maybe it's just a performance limitation in the product's engineering.",

I bought this one on amazon and it does not enhance the WiFi or extend it at all. I ran a speed test under this WiFi extender and it came up as error multiple times finally these are the best numbers i got on the speed test. If anything this is slowing down and interfering with my main WiFi connection. Buy something better!!",

We bought 2 of these so it added 4 new networks to all the devices in our house. Then nothing would change from one network to another. I called tech support and the guy hung up on me after a few minutes. Next time two times I called, they put me on hold until I hung up. Bye. Got other ones through my ISP and they installed in under 5 minutes using just my single wifi network. Far superior.",

The cable company, which I'm not going to name names but we all know who they are in Florida, was trying to charge me $20 per each wifi range extender and o think also charge me monthly. You cant beat the price and the quality of this product. Thank you netgear.",
