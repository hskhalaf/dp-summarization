Using a normal pillow was okay, but I'd fight with the pillow all night and wake up with sweaty legs. I've been using this knee pillow for the last 2 weeks, and it's a WORLD of difference. It's like it was created to fit perfectly between my knees, but I'm sure it'll fit perfectly in between your knees just as well. No more fights with my pillow, and no more waking up with sweaty legs!",
