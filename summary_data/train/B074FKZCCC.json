The second one I ordered will be delivered tomorrow. I\u2019ll use it for some books, my jewelry making kit, and all of my crafting tools & supplies. I love that it\u2019s so easy to build and you can make it any shape/height to fit your needs and your space. Five stars!",

The intended room for it was under construction until 4 days ago and I\u2019ve just gotten around to assembling it. The doors don\u2019t align or close properly, pretty sure if you put anything on the \u201cshelves\u201d they\u2019d break. Great concept, pictures make it look sleek and clean and modern, but it\u2019s plastic, made in china junk. Save your money.",

The description is wrong, the actual product they sent did not match what they are advertising. The instructions that came with the box were a mess and asked to put parts together that DID NOT FIT TOGETHER. I spent so much time trying to put it together in so many different forms. I'm so annoyed by how badly designed it is. Just dont buy it.",
