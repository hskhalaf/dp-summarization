He told me that he would constantly lose screws in the case and couldn't tighten certain parts (e.g., motherboard) properly because of the hard to reach angles. I said screw it (hehe) and bought this bad boy. This screwdriver made putting my computer together an absolute breeze. Not only was I able to access hard to reach places, but I didn't have to worry about balancing the head of the screw on the screw driver before reaching it's destination. If a PC build or repair is in your future, save yourself the time and buy this awesome product.",

In the meantime you have a long screwdriver for any other job that requires a long reach. Or I guess you could use it for making shish kebabs, or drilling for oil, or sword fighting with pirates.",
