Then I contacted GE directly, and I found out that, like Amazon, they have a excellent Customer Service, so we were able to solve the problem. I recommend the machine, is a good one. But don't buy it from this dealers, there are other ones where you can buy. My 5 stars are for the machine.",

Dryer is extremely quiet when in operation. The only negative I would comment is that when the washer is agitating it has a weird sound... kinda like a duck. It is not annoying but just have not heard a washing machine make this sound before. We are getting a chuckle out of it. Overall we are very satisfied.",
