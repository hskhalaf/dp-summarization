They smell so good, I can\u2019t stop burying my nose on them. And they don\u2019t seem to complain!",

I left a review on the Shampoo and it has seriously helped with my dog's shedding. I gave him a bath on Sunday and I have yet to vacuum my home (I used to have to do it everyday, twice a day -- during the cold months then once a day). I am amazed and pleasantly surprised by both the shampoo and the conditioner. I will continue to use together. I HIGHLY recommend these products if you have a dog that sheds a lot --> Golden Retriever mom.",

I love that they contain natural ingredients and they are tearless, even though I use J & J Head & Shoulders formula when washing fur faces. I love, how soft it makes my dogs coats feel and how cuts it down on shedding. The Lime Cocoa Butter is my favorite scent so far. I also recommend the Oral Care Fresh Breath Water Additive, I'm on my second bottle and I think it's really working to keep the tarter down.",
