Otherwise seems like a decent protein blend to split its effects over hours, though I'd have liked a bit more egg protein instead of adding it myself.",

Still unsure. It would have been nice to have offered a smaller sample variety pack with maybe 3-4 scoops. I will try it as a smoothie but really takes away from the convenience factor.",
