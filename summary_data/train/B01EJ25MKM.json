      "text": "This product is handle for a camera. It is not a stabilizer. Why am I giving 5 stars? Because it is exactly what the manufacturer says it is - they clearly state no gimbal, no batteries - and it is well manufactured. I got caught up in all the reviews saying it helped stabilize video. I guess it could, if the reason for your shaky video is because you had to hold your camera/phone with two hands and now you can use one. But the device itself has no anti-shake or anti-shock springs or anything - it is entirely rigid. But still a nice handle.",

Almost hurt my finger cuz of how strong it is. Overall it's a great alternative to a gimbal. The C-shape design and lightweight build make it easy to maneuver.",

It has nice padding also on the bottom holder, and rubber grips underneath for when you want to put it down somewhere.
