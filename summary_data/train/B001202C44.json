It seems to manage all the channels in a very balanced way, which is of course more to do with the AV receiver amp, my older Denon. The sub-woofer is just the right amount of bass and all channels come through clean and clear. Dialogue comes through really well. I like the small speaker size but wish they came with a choice of finishes other than just lacquer black. Music sounds pretty good too.",

The speakers work beautiful and produce a sound that's incredibly clear and detailed. Similar to what you'd find in extremely expensive speakers but for way less. The only fault this product has is if you plan to put this in a big open space it won't work as well. These guys work great in a smaller space like an apartment or condo, but if you plan to use this in your 1,400 sq ft living room the sound is going to get lost no matter what you do.",

My only complaint is that the satellite speakers would not mount right side up on the set of stands i bought due to the location from which the cable wires attach to speakers. Had to mount them upside down. barely noticeable unless you are looking directly at them. Connected through a Yamaha RX-v483 receiver and the bass sound very clear yet not overwhelming. Satellite speakers break out the sounds very well. No need to crank the volume to get loud, a small increase makes a huge sound. very happy with this purchase",

I tracked this down and it was some looseness in an internal connector of the right front speaker. This was remedied by taking the speaker apart and moving one wire. Since this repair they have worked flawlessly. The sound is truly exceptional for a set of speakers for this price. I would recommend this product.",

One big disappointment is that the subwoofer's dustcap came bended, its is very hard to fix. I contacted Amazon immediately but its has been 5 days and had no answer so far. make sure you buy good wire, 16 awg with polarity,",

After calibration setup I was blown away with the quality! They look pretty, they sound pretty, these speakers are the bees knees!

I noticed that lots of people who review this speaker systems are very picky and tend to favor higher end speakers and higher price tags.

Music that I listen to sounds amazing and the sub isn't over whelming. Everything is just perfect. I recommend this set to all of my friends looking for a basic 5.1 setup and those that bought it have not been disappointed.",

      "text": "These speakers are everything I hoped for. My expectations were very high after doing a ton of research and looking at all the reviews. The Cnet reviews just seemed too good to be true, but for the price I had to give them a shot. I used these speakers with a Sony STR-DN1050 Receiver and even before the 100 hour break in period they sound amazing. They are so clear that it has made me want to watch old movies or play old games again just because the sound is so good it's like watching/playing them for the first time.",

    "title": "Energy 5.1 Take Classic Home Theater System (Set of Six, Black)",
    "description": "Style:Home TheatreThis landmark Energy 5.1 Take Classic home entertainment system flaunts superior MDF cabinets finished in sophisticated high-gloss black. It includes a powerful 200-watt subwoofer with a front-firing port, 8\" driver and patented Ribbed Elliptical Surround(TM) for well-defined bass reproduction. But the coup de gr\u00e2ce is the newly added Convergent Source Module (CSM) with its 3\" poly-titanium woofer and .75\" Hyperbolic(TM) aluminum-dome tweeter. This proprietary technology provides a dynamic frequency range and an expansive soundstage, resulting in smooth, realistic sound that emanates from each satellite speaker as well as the center channel. Music and movie lovers can now rejoice because the Take Classic not only breathes life into every entertainment experience, it incites an intense passion in every listener.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nA CNET Editor's Choice winner for February 2009, the Energy 5.1 Take Classic Home Entertainment Speaker System is a no-compromise collection of high-tech components that offer complete and uncompromising fidelity at an affordable price. Made up of four Take satellite speakers, a Take center channel speaker and one 200-watt Take powered subwoofer, each high-gloss black speaker component in this system is masterfully integrated with each other creating a killer sound that is much bigger than it looks and that seamlessly meshes with any flat panel HDTV system. \n\n \n\n\nDramatic home theater quality beyond its size.\nView larger. \nPatented Convergent Source Module 3-inch poly-titanium woofer and .75-inch hyperbolic aluminum-dome tweeter.\nView larger. \nStylish high gloss black finish across all components.\nView larger. \nAmazing deep bass from 200-watt subwoofer.\nView larger. The Lowdown\nTake Classic proves that convenience doesn't have to mean compromise. Sure, you can shop for individual home theater components-but you won't get better performance, or better looks. Integrating the best technologies Energy has to offer, the Take Classic can fill your room with hair-rising effects and theater-like sound: hyperbolic aluminum dome tweeters for screaming highs, Convergent Source Modules for clear, crisp dialogue and music and a Ribbed Elliptical Surround on the subwoofer that makes every explosion a room shaking affair. In addition, integrated keyhole wall-mounts, threaded inserts and rubber bumpers let you choose how and where to place your speakers.\n\nBragging Rights\nEnergy has been a leader in audio research and development as well as in the engineering and manufacturing of speakers since 1973. With this pedigree Take Classic components were developed with Energy's core principles in mind. These include:\n\nFlat On-Axis Frequency Response with Wide Bandwidth - Speakers should reproduce the entire audio range in a uniform manner. By ensuring that no one frequency dominates any other, Energy ensures that every note is the way it was intended to be-and the sound as natural as possible.\n\nWide and Constant Dispersion - Sound at all frequencies radiating from the speaker should be in an even pattern, in all directions throughout the room.\n\nLow Distortion and Resonance - Speaker system is distortion- or resonance-free, but Energy has achieved a significantly lower distortion level, a clearly audible improvement.\n\nThe Take Classic 5.1 home theater system also offers terrific performance and great features:\n\n * Our patented Convergent Source Module (CSM) 3-inch poly-titanium woofer and .75-inch hyperbolic aluminum-dome tweeter -the heart of Energy speakers\n * Patented Ribbed Elliptical Surround woofers create high efficiency, low distortion\n * An aluminum dome tweeter for sonic accuracy\n * Front and rear venting for more powerful bass response\n\nTake Classic raises the bar for 5.1 speaker system performance. It includes a powerful 200-watt subwoofer with a front-firing port, 8-inch driver and Ribbed Elliptical Surround\u2122 for bass that you feel as much as hear. The Convergent Source Module (CSM), with its 3-inch poly-titanium woofer and .75-inch hyperbolic aluminum-dome tweeter, focuses sound for clearer dialogue and stirring music. The CSM gives soundtracks a dynamic frequency range and a huge soundstage, for smooth, realistic sound from each satellite speaker and the center channel. Music and movie lovers rejoice. Take Classic puts the passion back into your favorite films. Exclusive Energy\u00ae Brand Technologies\n\nConvergent Source Module\nThe Convergent Source Module, or CSM, provides wide dispersion, low distortion and amazing midrange performance. The speaker's midrange and tweeter are positioned in close proximity to one another and act as a single source, thereby increasing overall dispersion and reducing any lobing effect. The chambering of the mid and tweeter lowers the driver's resonance, reducing distortion.\n\nRibbed Elliptical Surround Technology\nEnergy's patented Ribbed Elliptical Surround technology (U.S. patent #6,725,967, Canadian patent #2,407,123) increases excursion, eliminates distortion and raises efficiency on woofers and subwoofers. The Elliptical Surround encompasses the cone, allowing it to move identically in both directions, resulting in near zero distortion. And while conventional designs are often plagued with surround dimpling, which causes them to radiate in and out of phase and distort at all listening levels, Energy's designs aren't influenced by dimpling at all, instead proprietary Ribbed Elliptical Surround technology allows for a larger cone surface, resulting in greater efficiency. This design also lets the cone achieve greater peak to peak movement, thus allowing it to travel more than double the distance of the competition. These attributes enable Energy woofers and subwoofers to move incredible amounts of air, ultimately allowing them to play lower frequencies with greater bass extension and fidelity.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nA 6-piece, high gloss black set of Energy Take Classic 5.1 speakers: 4-Take satellite speakers, 1-perfectly matched Take center channel speaker, 1-perfectly matched Take powered subwoofer; 1-owners manual.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\n * Frequency Response - Sat: 115Hz-20KHz; Center: 110Hz-20KHz; Subwoofer: 33Hz-150Hz +/- 3dB\n * Crossover Point - 2.9 kHz\n * Sensitivity - 89dB\n * Power Handling - Sat & Center: 100 Watts; Subwoofer: 200 Watts\n * Recommended Amplifier Power - 20 - 100 Watts RMS (continuous)\n * Impedance - 8-ohm compatible\n * Subwoofer Variable Low Pass Filter - 40Hz-150Hz @ 18dB/octave\n * Tweeter - \u00be-inch (19 mm) Hyperbolic\u2122 aluminum-dome\n * Woofer - Sat & Center: 3-inch poly-titanium; Sub: 8\" IM Cone with Patented Ribbed Elliptical Surround\n * Dimensions (inches) - Sat: 6 7/8 x 4 1/8 x 4 1/8; Center: 4 1/8 x 10 1/4 x 4 1/8; Subwoofer: 12 5/8 x 12 5/8 x 12 5/8 (add 2 1/6\" for feet)\n * Weight - Sat: 2.9 lbs; Center: 3.2 lbs; Subwoofer: 19.7 lbs\n\nMaximum Performance Tips: \nThe center channel speaker needs to be centrally located so that the dialogue appears to be coming from the center of the screen. It needs to be above or below the monitor, as closely to it as possible. If you're using a rear projection television, the most likely option is to place it above the screen. If you have a front projection system, you have choices-stand mounting, or placement on furniture, for example. It is important, though, to place the speaker so that its front edge is even with the edge of the shelf or stand supporting it. Unwanted diffraction occurs when the center channel is too far back into a cabinet or other surface with edges that could impede sound dispersion.\n\nFor left or right front channels, the distance between the speakers should be 6-8 feet at minimum for the best stereo imaging. The optimum room shape is rectangular, with the speakers along one of the shorter walls, facing the opposite side. If possible, do not place speakers against a wall or at rear of a bookshelf; corner placement is usually the worst option. Try to keep the speakers-especially rear vented models-at least two feet from the surface behind it, unless you use a vent plug. For best results mounting on a rear wall, position the speakers so they flank the main listening area and point toward the front of the room. They should be raised to a height of approximately six feet and should ideally have a space of six feet between them. The three most common subwoofer locations include corners (which can result in boomy or exaggerated low frequency response), placement along a wall, away from the corner (producing moderate bass performance with increased fidelity over corner placement), or beside a front speaker (creating a better blend with the front speaker, but sacrificing overall volume). Experimentation with subwoofer placement is highly encouraged; slight adjustments can create big differences in sound reproduction. To test subwoofer placement, install it temporarily in your main listening position and walk around the listening room while playing a familiar piece of music until you find the best sounding position.\n\n\n\nREVIEW FROM HOME THEATER MAGAZINE\nREVIEW FROM HOMETHEATERMAG.COM: ENERGY TAKE CLASSIC\nIt came as no surprise to me that Energy's Take Classic speaker package was such a fine all-around performer. The brand has a strong track record in sat/sub packages, and this set continues the tradition. No, these speakers won't give you the slamming low-frequency effects you'd get from phat towers and/or a giant sub. But they deliver the midrange goods--the single most important aspect of speaker performance, if I had to choose one--and kept me intelligently entertained.\n\n * Read the full review at hometheatermag.com\n   \n   REVIEW FROM HOME THEATER MAGAZINE\n   \n   \n   REVIEW FROM HOMETHEATERMAG.COM: ENERGY TAKE CLASSIC\n   It came as no surprise to me that Energy's Take Classic speaker package was such a fine all-around performer.
