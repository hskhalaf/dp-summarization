Only gripe is that the transformer it has does not have taps to power switches and accessories (They make a very similar looking one that does), but that is a relatively minor quibble.",

If you just want a basic train, this set is the way to go, but, the dcc set gives you sound, better controller, more track and better quality track. Read my review on the dcc train set though. You might get a faulty locomotive, and the sound will quit working. The days of quality train sets lasting 50 years are over. Just do your research.",

Works well so far, and does not derail as easily as other trains. Well made for price. People may complain about the product being cheaply made, but, if you want more quality, you must spend more money. Do not expect something phenomenal from a cheap price. I personally like it.

I wanted something that was better than a crappy toy grade, affordable, and at least reasonably durable, preferably with replacement parts available. I don't have any plans to expand on the set, but it's nice to know track is available. This set fit the bill perfect. Out of the box it ran without a hiccup and was easy to assemble. The cars look great and I think the build quality is great for the price point.",
