She loves using it to train at home and I feel a lot better about her tumbling on these instead of just her regular mats! We bought her 2 so she has plenty of space and can connect multiple skills! These are also the cheapest we have found after doing a bunch of research! She loves using these in the pool as well! Their customer service is A++ they answer every question and help every step of the way! Don't waste your money on a more expensive brand! Buy Ibigbean you won't regret it!",

Works adequately for the session but by the next day needs air. It has always been like this - and no noticeable holes/tears. Is this normal? That said, she loves it. It was expensive! and it large and a pain to store but works really well. To be clear, it doesn't lose ALL the air, but it definitely needs to have air added.",

Her friends love it, too, and some are planning on getting their own. I would advise getting at least the 16' if your child wants to do more than one flip at a time. I don't have any problems with air leakage. The 16' comes with a powerful electric inflator pump that fills the mat very quickly (note the 10' comes with a manual pump). Highly recommended if you have a gymnast in your family!",
