They both cause very serious health problems that can lead to death! Do a search & look up the dangers of ingesting both Sucrulose & Aspartame!!! You'll be horrified at what you'll learn about these dangerous chemicals! The sucrulose is processed with chlorine & when sucrulose enters the body it slowly turns into formaldehyde which is imbalming fluid that they put into dead bodies at funeral homes !!! Why companies still use sucrulose & aspartame in foods is horrible!!! Please do the research for yourselves!!! Your life depends upon it!!!",

When you read the actual package, there is also 6g of sugar alcohol (which is a carbohydrate) and soy protein isolate, rice syrup (which essentially is a sugar), Maltitol Syrup which is a carbohydrate and can raise glycemic index, and artificial flavors. These bars are not high quality and it's insulting to consumers when manufacturers \"hide\" ingredients or do not advertise them properly to the consumer. Either make a healthy Protein bar or don't. Do not try to fool us. Advertise for what it truly is and the consumer can make better choices",

I also liked that it was bigger than a lot of other similar bars. It is a crisp product so means it will be bigger due to air, but the larger size can make you think you are eating a bit more than you actually are.",

These taste absolutely incredible. If these flavors are in your wheelhouse at all, you won't be disappointed. Also purchased the vanilla marshmallow and PB crunch and, while they taste good as well, they don't stack up to salted toffee. It's just such an original flavor. The others can be found anywhere, and taste like many other protein bars I've tried. Anyway, back to salted toffee. I'd rather eat it than most candy bars. No joke, it's that tasty. The bars are great between meal snacks. Will be purchasing more soon.",
