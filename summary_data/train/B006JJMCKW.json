So my 17 month old, within 5 mins of sitting in the chair got a bump in her head because she fell face first when making the mistake of stepping on the recline, that goes down if more weight is put into it. After the bump, lesson learned, do not put up the recline and leg rest. But the chair itself as a chair is nice.",

The lift doesn't go up easily my son has to really force it leaning back or the easier solution is i just pull up the end for him. That's why i gave 4 stars.
