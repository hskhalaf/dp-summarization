      "text": "Sadly, my unit got water-damaged few weeks after the 1-year warranty ran out. It was a decent camera while it lasted. Took some great photos on our family beach vacations. I'm very meticulous when it comes to my electronics, and I took great care FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS ON CLEANING AND MAINTAINING RUBBER SEALS on the camera. Despite this, water got inside shortly after the warranty period ran out. Highly disappointed! Before the purchase, I did notice that there were negative reviews about water damage, but I figured people weren't reading the manual and following care directions on rubber seals. I was mistaken! It appears there may be design/manufacturing defect on the water-proof seals on this unit. Very dissatisfied with this product!!",

This camera stated it could be submerged, so we decided to take it to the local public pool to test it out before our vacation. All I can say is wow! We would go completely under the water and take pictures of the kids swimming and diving. This camera took amazing pictures and still works to this day. We took the camera with us to Yellowstone and used it throughout the whole vacation. There was no fogging of the lense noted after water use.",

I charged up the battery just in case it can inadvertently run down. Put it back in, still nothing. I'm sad because it was a great camera. Maybe I got a lemon battery or something. They have to give me a refund because the one I ordered is not available to give me an exchange. :(",

Other reviews said it leaked so that had us a bit concerned but we found that with the correct care (Soaking in clean water for 10 minutes after use) this camera was the PERFECT choice for us :) We had our good Cannon camera for everyday dry pictures and this one for our possible water shots. It was so light weight and small carrying 2 cameras worked for us! I took some really awesome underwater pictures of fish and corral while snorkeling on several occasions as well as pictures from when we swam out to a waterfall.

We discovered our previous (non-waterproof) digital camera, after many years of service, no longer turned on. Thankfully 2-day Prime shipping got this camera to us the day before we left! Overall we are very pleased with the usability of the camera and quality of the photos. I read that most people now tend to use the cameras on their smartphones, or own higher-end cameras such as DSLRs. We enjoy bringing an easy to carry camera that we take with us to the beach and into the water...plus on future vacations. This camera was highly reviewed and I can see why.",

      "text": "My brand-new Lumix took 200 photos in an hour of snorkeling in the ocean, and then it died permanently like quite a few of the other reviewers' Lumixes. I figure that's a little less than $1 a photo, which would have been a normal price in the old film-camera days (it also cost around $3 for Costco's service to rescue the photos from the card). Is it under warantee? Other reviewers don't hold out much hope -- anyway it will be too late for this trip. So if you are planning a snorkeling vacation with several times in the water, I suggest you buy three or four of these cameras so you'll have a new one ready for each dive.",

I have not tested the waterproof capabilities of the camera, but I have no doubt about this - the battery compartment and memory card doors have nice, soft rubber protection to keep the water out. The camera also features a \"locking\" switch to really close up the doors tightly. I'm very pleased with the decision to purchase this camera.",

After using this camera in sea water you need to soak it in clean unsalted water for at least an hour before opening it.

But I did pay less than $150, and it's only when I take pictures at night where the quality of pictures don't hold true. But for a point and shoot camera, this one definitely does its job.

We love everything about this camera other than the fact it failed for us twice. We are now looking for other options.",

I'd prefer to just return it to Amazon but we got home 8 days after the return period ended. If I get no satisfaction from Panasonic, I'll return it for a partial refund and call it an expensive lesson.",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix TS20 16.1 MP TOUGH Waterproof Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom (Orange) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Color:OrangeFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nPANASONIC LUMIX TS20 16.1 TOUGH WATERPROOF DIGITAL CAMERA WITH 4X OPTICAL ZOOM, SHOCKPROOF, 14\u00baF FREEZEPROOF, DUSTPROOF & MEGA O.I.S., ORANGE\n\nA STYLISH EXTERIOR AND A TOUGH INTERIOR BODY WITHSTANDS YOUR ADVENTURES\nA Waterproof Digital Camera with a Tough Body and Rugged Design for Extreme Shooting! (View Larger)Flat and Slim, the TS20 LUMIX waterproof GPS digital camera shoots in style in any environment. Submerge up to 16ft for underwater fun or beach scenes. Shockproof from 5ft, the TS20 rugged camera lets you shoot with one hand while maintaining your balance. For your hiking or camping trips, the digital camera can withstand fine dust particles, reducing the chance for a malfunction. Simply wash off dirt, soil, and dust with water and you're ready to keep climbing. Shoot while skiing, snowboarding, or skating in temperatures as low as 14.\n\nOUTDOOR SCENES & SHOOTING IN STRONG SUNLIGHT\nSet sail and shoot in, around, or under the sun. (View Larger)On the TS20 rugged camera, select the outdoor Scene Mode that best fits your day ahead (like Sports, Snow, Beach & Surf, and Underwater). And with a 2.7-inch LCD not only do you get wide-angle views, you get brightness adjustments in 11 steps and Anti-Reflective AR coating that minimizes glare for better visibility even under strong sunlight or locations with bright daylight.\n\nTAKE A PICTURE AND RECORD IT IN FULL 1280P HD WITH 4.6X ZOOM\nOn the water or at the campsite: Shoot and Record in Full HD with DOLBY Sound, MP4, and AVCHD.\nThe waterproof digital camera's Motion Picture button lets you record while taking photos without having to switch modes. Make videos in full HD 1,280 pixels in MP4. MEGA O.I.S. stabilizes images and corrects blur not only for your active shots while walking, swimming, or hiking, even your evening shots will also be. When the camera is in Active Mode, MEGA O.I.S. counters blur by stabilizing images against blur while you record movies or videos for optimal clarity. This is especially useful while walking, hiking, or shooting underwater. Panasonic digital cameras use a technologically advanced optical system where the image is not electronically processed resulting in minimal degradation and higher quality.\n\nZOOM INTELLIGENCE. WIDE-ANGLES. MINIMIZED SHAKE. FOLDED OPTICS TECHNOLOGY.\nThe LUMIX DC Vario lens, the heart of a Panasonic TS20 (View Larger)The 16.1-megapixel high-resolution DMC-TS20 waterproof digital camera features a 25mm wide-angle lens with 4x optical zoom (35mm equivalent: 25-100mm). The 25mm ultra wide-angle lens has about twice the shooting area as a standard 35mm lens. Use the digital Intelligent Zoom function to extend your reach to 8x as you record that rock that turns out to be a sea turtle. And with Intelligent Resolution technology, the waterproof digital camera preserves the image quality of your underwater or outdoor scenes as naturally clear shots emerge. MEGA O.I.S. stabilizes your underwater footage and reduces blur. And the Venus Engine revs up the high-speed processing so you won\u2019t miss the action.\n\nSHOOT LIKE A PRO WITH THESE PROFESSIONAL-GRADE CONTROL FEATURES ON THE TS20 DIGITAL CAMERA\nGo after those pictures-in-the-making with the TS20's 16.1MP High Sensitivity CCD Sensor and Noise Reduction. (View Larger)The 16.1-megapixel CCD Sensor with its 2-channel signal output structure boasts higher signal transfer speed for the active moments you need to capture that require high performance and fast processing like continuous shooting of the dolphins dancing across the ocean. Image quality is bettered with condensing light thanks to increased lens sensitivity. The CCD sensor and the Intelligent Noise Reduction system in the Venus Engine adjusts photos and videos taken in sensitive areas and creates clear, crisp imagery. You also get quick start-up time with Sonic Speed AF so you can follow sea lions with AF Tracking.\n\nSHOOTING AND PLAYBACK OPTIONS TELL YOUR PHOTOGRAPHIC STORY\nUse modes like minature effect to creatively enhance your photos and videos (View Larger)If you want to capture wild animals while they hunting and gathering, prep the TS20 Time Lapse feature to shoot the action over time. For fun, apply Miniature Effect and turn your shots of big fish into tiny fish. A Panorama Shot feature, on the TS20 waterproof digital camera, lets you shoot a 360\u00ba view scene. When you playback, use Auto Retouch to adjust the contrast and brightness as you recreate your shot with the touch of a button (great for lightening images taken on a beach at dusk). And in Handheld Night Shot, generate a beautifully illuminated night scene.\n\nAN EASY TO USE DIGITAL CAMERA BECAUSE THE CAMERA DOES THE WORK FOR YOU\nPoint-and-shoot using an AR Coated LCD as iA detects conditions. (View Larger)In iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode, the camera does all the work, leaving you free to compose shots and record videos. In iA Plus Mode, you have a range of creative settings from Motion Deblur to Scene Detection to Face Detection. The Intelligent Scene Selector senses your environment, automatically selecting the right Scene like Sunset. With Happy Mode, optimize color for brilliant stills. Intelligent Exposure corrects backlighting issues reproducing its natural likeness. And with a 2.7-inch LCD not only do you get wide-angle views, you get brightness adjustments in 11 steps and Anti-Reflective AR coating that minimizes glare for better visibility even outdoors.\n\nA LUMIX CAMERA THAT MAKES SHARING YOUR PHOTOS WITH YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA CIRCLES EASY\nMake sure your images make the social circles with easy uploading to Facebook and YouTube. (View Larger)With the LUMIX TS20 waterproof digital camera, upload photos and videos instantly to Facebook and videos to YouTube. Photos or videos recorded in AVCHD on the SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Cards are easy to view on a Panasonic VIERA TV. The PHOTOfunSTUDIO 8.1 AE makes it possible to sort and organize new photos and videos and those stored on your computer.
