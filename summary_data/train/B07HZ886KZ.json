      "text": "I've had nothing but trouble with the Microsoft Surface 2 laptop I received. I've had several blue screens of death. Whenever I came back to it after not using it for a while it was unresponsive and required a reboot. After several days of problems, I found a solution on the Internet, disable the Surface Intersil Ambient Light Sensor, see the attached video for how this works. Also notice how much memory is freed up when this device is disabled. The one star review is because you should not need to search for solutions like this for a new laptop. I would have rather the computer be dead on arrival than partially working.",

I wanted something lighter than my Macpro for my travels and external meetings. I bought a an iPad Pro 12.9 inches and it simply didn't work for me. I reluctantly bought the Surface Laptop - old fears of Windows OS: viruses, speed. Its weight (or lack thereof), keys, pen/touch screen and seamless use of MS Office won me over. Seven months in, I have no regrets. I actually bought a Windows Desktop to replace my Mac.",
