I read many articles claiming the Bosch and Raines were both good, so I purchased both. The rain x had 3 unique characteristics. It always performed worse and streaked. The Bosch icon did not. The rain x assembly rusted. The Bosch icon did not. The rain x fell apart. This was only after 1 year and maybe 5000 miles of driving over a winter in Ohio. I won\u2019t be buying this brand of wiper again.",

Okay, I didn\u2019t expect them to perform as well for the price, but after just a few months...oh boy! Such a disappointment! These blades did not hold up. They streaked and left a film that made it hard to see in certain light. I won\u2019t be buying these again. I\u2019ll spend double the money and get four times the value and life!!",

This causes the last several inches of the blade to have no pressure, to the point that the blade is in the air, not even touching the glass. I would return the 26\" if it didn't come as a pair.

The clip holding the blade to the wiper itself broke so now the wiper will not stay attached to the car. That's pretty weak considering I purchased this back in November 2018 and it is now August 2019. Sigh. I would have preferred it lasting at least 12 months or have the warranty support a one-time replacement. I think the actual warranty is 30 days.",

The problem is that no matter how you attempt to apply it, 1/3 of the blade does not sit flush on the glass and cannot be made to sit flush on the glass. It leaves a terrible unwiped streak when on. Fortunately I had not thrown away my old wiper blade. I've used Rain-X weatherbeater blades before on a 2008 Mazda 3 and had liked them. This review is 1-Star due to fit, not quality.",

The other is that the wiper has started leaving a nearly-vertical linear smudge on the windshield when it completes its upward sweep and begins to go back down. The smudge dries off quickly, but it's a tiny bit distracting as it's right in my line of sight. I'll use these wipers until they need to be replaced, but I'll probably look for another brand at that time.",
