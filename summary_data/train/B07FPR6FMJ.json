Amazon advised that there was a system-wide issue with Fire TV login, and this prevents any use of the TV, even for non-Fire TV. Just what I don't need, another hidden factor to try and diagnose! I suggest buying a TV with an extra HDMI port and a Fire stick if you want Fire TV but avoid a combined unit!!!",

Toshiba/Amazon, standardize your mounting, and if you don't, please provide a recommended bracket that WILL work.

It isn't hugely heavy or awkward to handle either, so it works out for one person to hang. Overall, I'm really happy with this. I've been using it for two months and have had no problems with it.

If you are looking for a TV to plug a Roku or firestick into, or perhaps use with cable or non-smart TV integrated programs then this TV is probably a good bet.

We no longer have a cable subscription, between Prime, Acorn, Netflix and other streaming services, we have more than enough TV. I am changing all of our TV's to this setup. The simplicity and ease of use of this combo makes this the bargin of the year in my book.",
