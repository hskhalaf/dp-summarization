More importantly to me, though, is the company\u2019s excellent customer support. One of the lids wasn\u2019t closing properly (too small, not defective). I wrote the company directly to request a new lid only. By the next day, they wrote back saying they\u2019d actually shipped a 2 piece container set! They exceeded my expectations in an extremely timely manner. I\u2019ll definitely continue to buy from them.",

Really this problem makes the container unusable. Also while opening the top, the snap from the narrow side pops open. If this is a defective item, send me a new one.

Online and on the box it clearly states that you will receive 3 piece cereal containers , 8 chalkboard labels, 1 liquid marker , 4 piece spoon set , and card with bonus surprises and the only thing I received was the containers and tops NOTHING ELSE! This is the only time I have ever had an issue with an amazon order and I\u2019m highly upset .",

I like that it comes with the cute labels PLUS chalkboard marker. Another added bonus are the measuring cups which is plastic, but good quality. Highly recommend.",

One note is that, if you're dealing with Costco or big box store cereal boxes (normally about 1.5-2x the size of a standard box), they won't fit into one of these (at least not the ones I purchased).",

You can\u2019t beat that guys.",
