There was a need for a shelf that was of a certain size, and I wanted something not only to fill a very specific space but to be made of real wood and to handle maybe being sat upon. The sturdiness is impressive, as it is quite heavy and solid. Assembly was a bit tricky because you have to REALLY pay attention to every single little detail in instruction diagrams. But it all makes sense and the shelf accommodates big books (sideways) as well as other random things I needed to put away. I left off the casters to make it closer to the ground and lower and more stable.",
