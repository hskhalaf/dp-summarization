It looks even better than it does in the photos. I honestly have not tried the sound yet, but it is more for the office, so it will not be playing at a high volume anyway. You can spend maybe 20 dollars less and get something similar, but that extra 20 is going to get you a nice speaker that is more durable that the other light plastic stuff out there. It is really sharp looking, I love it.",

If you can get it to pair and stay paired, the sound is weak and full of static. I could never get it to stay paired to my phone. I bought it mostly to use as a radio and I am very pleased with the sound quality when it's used as a radio. It is well made and very appealing. Bottom line, if you want a retro radio that has solid sound in a small attractive unit, this is a good option, but if you're looking for a Bluetooth speaker, you're better off going with a Mini Marley.",

It's constantly topic of discussion when friends n family come for a visit. I can have it playing quietly in the background or really loud if the kids and I are cleaning and need some fun music to listen to. It plays loud enough to be heard clearly throughout our 2 story home. I hesitated to buy because of the price, but I gambled and I have NO regrets! The sound is crisp, the wood is NOT pine...I hate pine! The size of it is perfect! It's small but definitely packs great sound!",

Volume adjusted nicely. My husband likes to listen to music while he falls asleep each night so he really likes the light-up dial. Would give one more star if it were just a little bit bigger since it is so nice to look at. (That would also make it easier to turn the knobs.)",

I don't like wearing earphones for very long so unless I'm trying to not disturb others, I'd much rather listen from a source not plugged into my ear. It is easy to charge with a common USB cord. It would make a great gift for anyone who like to listen but needs a simple to use source. I'm happy with my purchase.",

I have found I use my Marshall speaker less and and less. I'm very happy with this and I highly recommend.",

I live in Metro Atlanta and I can get two stations. I guess I thought it was bigger, but I was wrong. Very small and not very good sound quality. Would have returned it but I missed the return window by one day. I bought another speaker for half the price that out performs this one in every way.",
