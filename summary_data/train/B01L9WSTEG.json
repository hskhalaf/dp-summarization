The threads inside of attachment hose extremely soft and have actually worn down after approximately 10 uses. Makes attaching hose to tire stem nearly impossible.",

The gauge isn\u2019t super trustworthy, but the auto-shutoff gets you in the ballpark with EXTREME convenience.

      "text": "New to RV lifestyle. Love this little guy. Just attach to the tire, set the PSI, turn on and it will auto stop when the PSI is reached. Will say that u may have to play around with the connection point to properly activate the airflow. If the compressor vibrates a lot, u do not have a secure connection. There should be a steady hum without any vibration. It's not required but I recommend a little break in between consecutive fills to prevent overheating. I noticed better subsequent fills worked better after a break. Note that this is a small compressor so it may take some time if your item needs a lot of air. Stores nicely.",

Disconnecting it releases such a TINY amount of air if you're careful, so I don't know what some others are complaining about with that. Checked the pressures afterwards and all were dead on.

So if you are at 32 and want 34, you have to twist on the inflator and that drops it to the low 20's. Then you need to wait for inflation all the way to about 35 or 36, so that it drops to 34 when you remove. Hard to give this more than 2 stars.",

My tire was leaking on the way to a camping trip and instead of having to find a gas station every hour we could just pull into a parking lot and fill it back up with this. The next morning, the tire was completely flat, but I was able to fill it back to 32 PSI in under 10 minutes to take it to the tire shop. Another time I used it to fill all 4 tires and it did start to get quite hot. The instructions say to let it cool off for 30 minutes before using it again.",
