Not only did the bowl rock back and forth when attached, there was also a sizable gap between the feeder and bowl where food could get trapped in. Maybe this is a result of was damage during shipping? I really liked the first generation-which was built pretty solid and there was no issue with loose parts or exposed wires. So far tho pretty disappointed with quality at this price. I will not be replacing or ordering again from this brand",

I contacted support right from the app and they were able to see on their end that there was a possible issue with a gear that dispensed the food. So... They sent me a newer model. Assisted me with setting it up and now it works great. Fantastic support!! One thing I would recommend if you get this, is to check out the foods that they have listed. If you use one of those, it will add in all the nutritional facts about it automatically. You can also add your own with pictures and info too though.",
