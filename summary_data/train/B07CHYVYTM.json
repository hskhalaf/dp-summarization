I prefer to use natural cleaning supply that isn\u2019t toxic so this is a good option. I was surprised by the bottle size as they are huge and you get two. Would absolutely buy again. My only problem is that one bottle had burn stains inside the lid and it smelled really bad. I emailed Trinova about this and hopefully it\u2019s safe to use. The second bottle didn\u2019t have any issues and I am overall very happy with the product.",

If you need a deep cleaning, as with any cleaning solution, spray some extra on the stain area and let it sit for a while before wiping it away. Many people don't do this, then complain about how the cleaning solution is bad. I haven't tried it in the bathroom areas, but for the kitchen, dining room, living room, etc. it's great and great that it's non-toxic so it's safe to use around small children or pets.",

I find the scent light and refreshing. I wish the company would make an air freshener with the same smell as Tri Nova\u2019s Multi-purpose cleaner. FYI it does not work on mold as Tilex does. Nor does it claim that it does. You can replace, at least, a half dozen of your other products.",

My counters have never been so spotless, it smells amazing, and the size of the bottles is a terrific value for the price (embarrassing admission time: when I purchased this, I thought I was buying one bottle, so I was flabbergasted when two AND a microfiber towel showed up!).

      "\u2705 SOME NATURAL CLEANERS don't work - they are weak or they leave streaks or streaking. Our multisurface product is a necesarry supply for your household because it works on glass, toilet, floor, home, countertops, and more. DON'T WORRY about getting a weak spray that can't actually tackle the mess that life brings your way.",
      "\u2705 WANT YOUR HOME TO SMELL GREAT? If you're looking for lemon verbana, grapefruit, or basic house supplies you won't find them here. OUR CUSTOM SCENT is a totally unique blend of white tea and thyme extract. Here's a preview of you smelling it: \"OH WOW - THAT'S NICE!\" Don't believe me? Go ahead and buy a bottle and if you don't like it we'll just give you your money back!",
      "\u2705 NEED A PRODUCT THAT WORKS IN EVERY ROOM? Your best stuff deserves a specialized cleaner - that's what we believe. We make specific products for every surface, but we're also not naive. Sometimes you need a bottle of cleaning spray that can come from your kitchen to your bathroom to clean walls, floors, oven, countertop, quartz and you want an eco friendly version that works better than some multipurpose stuff from a less than honest company. We're here for you.",
      "\u2705 GREEN PRODUCTS SHOULDN'T COST A FORTUNE. We are including 2 bottles of 32oz so you can clean your house for weeks on end - even if you have children that don't understand the word \"no.\" And because we don't want you throwing away rolls and rolls of paper towels (well, maybe one roll - kids are impossible) we're including a premium microfiber towel. You're welcome. So buy it now or subscribe and save to get it delivered every month.",
      "\u2705 THE BEST PART? We're 100% customer focused, so even if the product is on sale as the deal of the day or even if you get it for free - we want you to be satisfied. If that's not the case, get in touch and you'll have a hassle-free experience with our dedicated customer care team."
