So you could buy this cheap tarp instead of the tent's footprint (sold separately) if you wanted to have a free standing rainfly without tent. The blue tarp also covers the vestibule area, while the tent's footprint (sold separately) only covers the tent's floor area. The tarp is supposedly 6'x8' but is actually 5'6\"x7'6\" which again lines up almost perfectly with the tent's dimensions, so it's an almost perfect match.",

One night we set up our tents and then a huge rainstorm blew in. The wind and rain were awful and it lasted a good hour or more. Her tent blew over and got soaked inside, while this one stayed up and dry. I'm no thru-hiker, looking to drop every single ounce I can - we just go out for a few days at a time. So although this tent may weigh a few more ounces than the super-expensive backpacker tents, I'll take the extra ounces if it means staying dry!",

The Lynx tent is the first tent I have used that is absolutely perfect. Great quality and it fits me exactly how I wanted. It fits my LightSpeed self inflating mat correctly and is the right amount of tent for 1 person.",
