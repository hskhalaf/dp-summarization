Remember when lighting the wood chips make sure the machine is on. I durn near burnt my finger off trying to light it when it was off. So don\u2019t make my mistake.

I would have expected metal, as I would think the plastic would eventually melt, and effect the taste at a minimum, or create health hazard at worst. The tube that provides the smoke is does not fit well, and slides off very easily. It also has a very strong rubber smell... The housing that is removable for cleaning does not fit well and no longer fits flush with the smoker. The only reason I have given it two stars, is that it does provide a great amount of smoke. Bottom line, would not order again.",

It infuses the smoke flavor in seconds, which I actually thought was probably asking too much of a tiny portable smoker. This definitely works as well as claimed and I'm happy with it!",

Works great for small projects though, was even able to fill up a full-sized hotel pan with heavy wood-smoke fairly easily. As a culinary professional though I think it's not a good option for anything more than light use.",

Instead of using wood chips I eventually branched out to using herbs and spices for other dishes. Definitely a unique piece to have, especially since it\u2019s portable for camping, tailgating, etc.",

There is a faint smokiness, but sometimes it can be missed on stronger flavored foods. Overall, I'm not that impressed at this point with smoke guns in general. What is nice is that this product didn't cost the 4x of price other fancier guns producing similar results. Overall, I'd rate it as a novelty. It works, but I think these things are over-hyped.",
