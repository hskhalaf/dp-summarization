      "text": "I use this product quite a lot with my job because it is good for 'routing' especially when you have Airplay products in the setup which require the Bonjour service.Set it up properly and it will work a dream BUT the wi-fi range is appalling! You get much better signal strength from most of the devices you get for free from your internet providers. I don't know why they bother putting 3 wireless antennas on it. To get a good network setup you can have your main modem/router that comes from BT/VIRGIN/Talktalk etc. in modem mode, use the Linksys as a subnet, turn the wi-fi off on the Linksys and get some decent wireless access points trough out the house.",

      "text": "This is easily the worst router I have ever encountered - and I have had a few including other Linksys/CISCO ones; even even still have other CISCO ones. This router was difficult to set-up and to say that it did not play well with other routers is an understatement. I eventually bought the Linksys WRT 1900AC (see I have no issues with Linksys); this set-up like a dream, first time. So if you can afford it get the WRT, if not simply avoid this dog.",

I would recommend you buy a different brand as if you need support this could be costly , The router appears to be of a cheap build not quality build of my net-gear router it replaced should have stuck with them",
