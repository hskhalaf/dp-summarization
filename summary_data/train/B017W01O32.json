      "text": "For years I have used small,battery operated sweater shavers. They were never very useful. I ordered the KOODER Sweater Shaver. I LOVE IT!! NO batteries, it come with a wall plug and cord which easily charges the shaver. I really like the size. It is easy to use and empty. The charge lasts for hours! I have a couple of beautiful, large chairs that are covered with a material which pills. I was able to use the shaver on both chairs and the pillows. The shaver cleaned up the pills so easily and now they look new again. It has been an excellent purchase for such a low price!!",

The only down side is it takes 8 hours to charge and the power does not last for a long time so I ended up buying two of these. Considering the price it is a good buy but I wish there is a more premium option.",
