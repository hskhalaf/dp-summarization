The shipping has cone down hill over time (crushed boxes and mashed larabars) but this last order is TERRIBLE. They do not taste *anything* like Blueberry Muffin. I could not even bring myself to eat the entire thing, and now wish I stopped earlier because I feel sick to my stomach. What on earth happened? The wrapper appears to be the same - same ingredients... but there's on way. I doubt a single blueberry went into the production of the bar I regret eating half of.... I just canceled auto-ship.",

The consistency is just on the solid side of gooey, this coupled with an underwhelming flavor, makes these bars pretty unappetizing.

I was eating them somewhat absent-mindedly in the car on the way to work, but my husband noticed that some of them had mold on the ends. After opening and checking a few more bars, we found mold on all of them so ended up throwing away half the box and not ordering again. Too bad. We are big Larabar fans and are now ordering the Carrot Cake instead.",

Flavors I'm not a fan of are pecan pie, cappuccino (this one is awful), apple pie.",
