It's a nice floor Cheval mirror that allows me to see clearly from head to toe, and it looks great in a corner of a room. No, this does not look cheap like the run of the mill plastic framed mirrors that you see at local supercenter stores, and you can see the nice wood grains on the frame. It looks much more costly than the price I've paid, and I'm definitely satisfied with my purchase.",

I will try to fix it to add height, like boring upper holes to the L & R arms (about 1 1/2 inches above the first holes), then making the stand a little bit higher.",

The four stars is because you'll need a long, thin Philips head screw driver., and the site should warn you about that The first 3 I tried weren't long or thin enough. Fortunately, the fourth worked, but be aware that the bottom legs screw on from the inside, so long screws (provided) need long screw driver. No distortion at all. Very pleased with this purchase.",

I actually love it now because it is able to move forward or move backwards. It is versatile and a gorgeous wooden color. It was quite easy to put together, took me about twenty minutes.",

I also expected the optical quality of the mirror to be less than it was but am very pleased with how clear the image is with no ripples as seen in cheap light weight mirrors. It now sits in the corner on its steady, simple base doing just what a iron should. It looks good and does its job.",

It was easy to put together and shipped quickly. It arrived in fantastic shape with all its parts. And it truly does look a bit more expensive than it actually was. It was a great purchase. I would recommend it for small rooms and apartments. (I live in an apartment.) Right now it's sitting in my living room since my bedroom is a bit too small (it has a queen-sized bed and a larger dresser in it, taking up most of the space). But this mirror is a keeper.",

There were minor indentations into the wood in various spots but you have to look hard to find them. For less than $50, this is easily the biggest mirror you'll find for the price, but the frame isn't of great quality (as expected for such a deal!) . The assembly is easy, but if you move the mirror a lot, you'll have to tighten the sides every so often to make it so it'll be a little resistant to moving.",

Even with these flaws, for a product this price I would still purchase it. Overall still happy with my purchase and would recommend.",
