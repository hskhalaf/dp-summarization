This, however, is a product review and not a discussion of effective technique. This thing is built like a tank. It's solid steel, bent and riveted. I don't have a calibrated light meter, but it sure looks bright enough to be 10,000 lux at 17\". I expect it to last for years, just on how well-made it is. It's hard to get a sense of how big it is from the picture, so, for reference, the screen is a 19\" diagonal and the footprint is 11\" x 18\".",
