It does have a multi use type cord with it that can be used to attach to pc via usb and also has video cable I guess to attach to tv etc. Battery charge is not nearly as long as my Lumix had, but hey, don't have to buy batteries either.",

The photo quality from this camera is so poor compared side by side to my Nikon; even from photos printed 6 years ago. The only thing I like on this camera is the panorama mode. I don't know enough about cameras to explain why this Sony takes such horrible photos on Auto or Easy mode, but if you're a novice shooter like me, don't get this camera. I'll be buying another (and cheaper) coolpix next time.",

I don't understand why...may be there is a mismatch between the pixels of camera LCD and computer LCD. I guess I'll need to try reducing the pixels on camera and then compare the quality..overall I'm satisfied by this camera...worth my money...",

We taped Adelle at 140 meters in the dark and the results were amazing. I am an experienced shooter but not a serious photography buff; for me this Sony does everything I could ask for. Minor caveats: Zoom during videos may corrupt audio. No intermediate resolution between VGA and 5M. Video is MP4 only.",

Camera has a number of good features, namely an x10 zoom, 3\" LCD screen, panoramic picture taking, and what I liked the most - a very impressive image stabilization system. Battery life is decent - 2 or 3 days of rather intensive picture taking. Negatives include a somewhat bigger package (not sure anything smaller can have an x10 zoom), and a very slow interface. Operating zoom is a challenge, as it is obviously micro-controller operated, and sometimes is busy with something else, when you are trying to frame the picture. Turning the camera off is also excruciatingly slow.",

Nice panoramic photos, I use them as wallpapers. Only one thing I couldn't do with this camera was shooting the moon or filming it, may be I have to read the manual with more calm.

The SDHC memory card slot is more popular than the memory stick duo which often requires an adaptor to read. The DSC-H55s 10x wide (25mm equivalent) lens takes better shots from greater distances and wider landscapes in a compact body. Take breathtaking panoramic shots. I love this camera!!!!!!!",
