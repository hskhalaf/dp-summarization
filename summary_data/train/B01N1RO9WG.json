      "text": "Love the product but it is now useless. The regulator valve for the propane side busted and blew off. Thankfully it happened when no one was near it. I tried to find a way to contact the seller or Amazon but the time for refund is passed and there is no way to leave a message. This is my only recourse. The valve is plastic and if it had been metal it would probably be okay now. The rest of the burner is quality - why go cheap on the valve? Another buyer had the same issue. Now I am searching for a metal regulator with a fitting that will fit this burner. Any advice is appreciated.",

Unfortunately, it tends to smoke up the kitchen. I take my Gas One outside on the patio to do the sear, and it's GREAT! I use the small propane tanks rather than butane, because they're easier to find. And the Gas One heats the pan up like crazy.",

Seems to be a common issue and only complaint with the stove. Instead of dealing with manufacture I ordered a new hose, one that goes straight to a larger tank.",
