The main advice I can give if you are thinking about buying one for yourself or as a gift is that it's a camera first and drone second, i.e. not a toy for kids. Also make sure you look into where you can fly and the rules around the world. Every country has different laws and also airline restrictions.",

But generally the product is very impressive so definitely swapping it for another one. Can\u2019t be that unlucky. Actually I might even upgrade to a better one, it really is that cool!",

Every flight goes well with no problems, and the results leave even the pilot slack jawed. Take photos and videos from angles that you never imagined possible Only criticism is that the controller charges your phone/tablet as a powerbank. Now that can be switched off if you have a Rooted device, but otherwise my concern is that if your phone died you could fly back with the controller or the controller's integrated Go Home button... If the controller goes flat then all bets are off, I'm sure DJI will work on this in future updates",

The Combo kit is great and comes with everything you need for fun in the air including 2 extra batteries. My only concern is that the 16gb micro SD card that's supplied with the Mavic pro is just to small to really take advantage of the 4k camera. So anyone considering buying this product for filming extended periods of 4k footage should really factor in the cost of buying at least one 64gb class 10 micro SD card to get the most from the camera.",

    "title": "DJI 2Z50228 Mavic Pro Drone Combo Kit - Grey",
    "description": "Colour Name:DJI Mavic Pro| Style Name:Fly More Kit ComboThe DJI Mavic Pro is a small yet powerful drone that turns the sky into your creative canvass easily and without worry, helping you make every moment an aerial moment. Its compact size hides a high degree of complexity that makes it one of DJI\u2019s most sophisticated flying cameras ever. 24 high-performance computing cores, an all-new transmission system with a 4.3mi (7km) range, 5 vision sensors, and a 4K camera stabilized by a 3-axis mechanical gimbal, are at your command with just a push of your thumb or a tap of your finger. Video transmission quality is critical to a good flying experience. The Mavic uses Sky Autonomy technology to sense obstacles up to 49ft (15m) away. It can then bypass these obstacles or brake to hover, preventing accidents even when flying beyond visual range. Why fly for 10 or 15 minutes when you can fly for up to 27? With the Mavic you can. Mavic supports 4K video at 30fps. No Electronic Image Stabilization is used, ensuring all footage is 4K. We have created a miniaturized, ultra-precise 3-axis gimbal for the Mavic, capable of stabilizing the camera even during high speed motion for smooth video and sharp photos. Everyone loves a good photo. Whether you just want to take a snap or are building up your portfolio, the Mavic\u2019s 12-megapixel camera with Adobe DNG RAW support is ready to shoot. Shoot like a pro. Automatically. You will not need a film crew when you fly the Mavic because all you need is Active Track. Just tell it who to track and it handles the rest, making you shoot like a pro. Trace \u2013 Follow behind or in front of your subject, or circle it as it moves. Profile \u2013 Fly alongside your subject. Spotlight \u2013 Keep the camera trained on your subject while you fly almost anywhere. With the Mavic in the air pointing at you, a gesture is all it takes to snap a photo. Get selfies like you\u2019ve never seen before with Mavic\u2019s Gesture Mode.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n1 x DJI CP.PT.000641 Mavic Pro Drone Combo Kit",
