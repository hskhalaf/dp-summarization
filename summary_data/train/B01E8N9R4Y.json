      "text": "Short version these are among the most expensive (retail price), and worst headphones I've owned. The sound quality is good. However this is the only positive. The sound cancellation is basically non existent and lots of background noise bleeds through. The buds aren't very comfortable and none of the buds seem to be better or worse than the other. Plus the ear pieces feel very heavy. These two things make the headphones constantly feel like they're going to fall out. These headphones don't really feel like a 70 quid product and I'm glad I got mine for 30 in the Amazon Wearhouse deals, however at this price, I still feel I might have overpaid.",

I'm not an audio professional but as an average consumer, I would highly recommend these! My only issue is the buds don't seem to fit my ear that well. They do fall out quite a lot. However, it should be noted this happens with most of the in-ear headphones I use. Overall, I would highly recommend this product and I would never think of getting rid of mine!",

Yeah it might be not as good as other famous brands in quality of 'bass' but as a person who uses allot of different kinds of equipment such as windows PC, macbook, samsung s6 and iPad it works perfectly with all. So mic will work with all and all the remote options such as volume and answering calls. I may take one star away but in way of ability to work with different devices its one of the best on the market.",

Previous headphones have lasted a year each time and these ones are proving to hold up well, however theyre more irritating on the ear since the back of it is larger and rubs against it but that stopped after a week. Antihero issue is that the volume controls don't work on the Google pixel but I believe that's an issue on the phones side cause they have a jack that's a lil bigger than usual. Overall these are pretty solid headphones though (also use for gaming; mmo's, fps, strategy, mobas etc)",

Using these earphones regularly and always storing them in the provided case, the left earbud started playing up with the sound constantly dipping and always outputting less sound than the other, and because there is no warranty I am stuck with a broken pair of earphones. And on another note the eartips provided are not good for extended use as they fit poorly in the ear and start to irritate the inner ear after prolonged use. NOT WORTH THE MONEY !",
