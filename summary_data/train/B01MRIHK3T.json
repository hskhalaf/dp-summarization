I do have one small thing I would like to mention - stay away from the joints as you fold the legs back down - I seriously pinched a finger! Ouch. I'm much more careful now.",

Now I need to find a little clip on umbrella for the preconcert dining to keep the food out of the sun! It's so easy to set up and collapse. It's all one piece and has a bag. I do have to say, it's kind of heavy (compared to our chairs) but worth it. It folds up small for the size. Also love that it's bamboo. The price is a bit daunting, but it'll last for a very long time, if not forever!",

Two minor issues as shown in the pictures. Missing screws for one of the leg supports. Nothing I couldn\u2019t fix. Next item is the zipper. The first time I went to zip the bag, the zipper pull broke in half. Otherwise, ingenious how it folds up and I like the adjustable legs. Adjusting each leg is also good for leveling the table on uneven ground.",

This table met all those requirements. I just bought it last week and used it for the first time this past weekend, and it was perfect for what I needed. I'm very happy with this purchase.

There are many options out there, but this table offers an adjustable height and a small pack size so we decided to give it a try. The table is constructed of high quality materials and is assembled well. As other reviewers have mentioned, the bamboo table top is almost too nice for camping. It wouldn't look out of place indoors, that's for sure. The table is easy to use and is very stable, even at the maximum height. I love being able to individually adjust the legs - it really helps on uneven surfaces. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this table to anyone...",

While the legs can be shortened (coffee table height) and lengthened (slight lower than standard dinner table)... I wish it had the option of being just a tad taller for when we use it as a prep surface. We still use it all the time, but when it's in the kitchen we aren't using it cut on because of the inconvenient height.",
