This concerns me, 4/5 of the lids did this. **** Update **** The company reached out and explained why this has happened, offered a full refund / return. I explained I wanted to keep the product and just wanted them to be aware of the issue/concern. Overall I am extremely pleased with how quickly and professionally they handled this matter. I would recommend this run to anyone - and I\u2019ll be purchasing again for a birthday gift.",

Our friends who only had a few told us that they want to buy the whole sampler package now so they can try the ones they don't already have. Each individual seasoning is way bigger than I thought it was going to be, I didn't look at the size before I ordered it but I was pleasantly surprised at how much of each I got in this sampler.

Not sure if them coming unsealed would have affected the flavor, but definitely a quality control issue for the company to consider. I will continue to use the other seasonings.",
