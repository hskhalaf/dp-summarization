The 9 was way too tight all over my feet so immediately replaced with a 9.5. The 9.5 was still a bit tight but foolishly I thought they would loosen after some use - they haven't. I'm looking at them now on the shoe rack and thinking, how did Salomon get it so wrong with this model and why did i think they would ever get better? Moral of the story - if they don't fit right immediately, send them back.",

I'm really disappointed about that as i have only had them for 61\u20442months. I would love to get another pair but I can't justify the cost for six months use.",
