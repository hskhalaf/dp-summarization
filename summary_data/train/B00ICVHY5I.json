I noticed he was consistent with going in the puppy pads so once I got this grass patch, he automatically started to pee on it instead. He refuses to poop on it still but oh well, we are working on it. There's NO URINE SMELL at ALL that comes from it. I put a puppy pad between the grass and the base for super easy clean up. He pees on the grass and it goes through the grid onto the puppy pad! I rinse it down in the shower and that's that!",

We were glad that we picked both cuz the medium one had less plastic-ish smell and the artificial grasses were a lil bit softer comparing to the small one. Our puppy is always so picky when it comes to the grasses quality but he loves this product. But it do have some grasses come off easily so make sure you slightly shake before given to your baby.

Picking up the grass leads to massive pee pooling down the sides. - even after rinsing + cleaning the scent is unbearable after a couple of weeks of use - to the point where my puppy does not want to use it and pees next to it.

After purchasing this product - she used it exclusively while we not at home which made things a lot easier and more sanitary. Very easy to spray down and clean and more appealing than potty pads all over the house. I would recommend this product.",

I have a mat for our pup to wipe his feet before he comes back in because they are usually wet from stepping on it. Also it can definitely stink and attract many bugs and maggot type so it is little gross.",
