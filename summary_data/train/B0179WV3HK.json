Controlling the temp is nice as well if you are needing to speed up or delay the finish time. This grill can take a 20% fat burger and make is not greasy, but still super moist. I put 4 frozen patties on with some zesty italian dressing and let it work for about 7 minutes. Done and tastes GREAT!",

It's typically used to grill chicken or burgers and will easily accommodate 4 portions. The temperature setting and removable grill plates are convenient as well and a nice additional to what we are used to. The drip pan is hidden underneath and hides the mess while cooking, so much so that a few times I have almost forgot to empty it. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a clam-shell style indoor grill.",

Pros Lays flat for those looking to use as a skillet option for like bacon. Or flat cooker for like meats. The plats are removable for easy clean, and are non stick. Wish it offered other plats for diffrent cook configurations. Easy clean, and the grease collection is pretty efficient. All and all an solid inside gril for the money.",

      "title": "Great alternative to stove/oven",
      "text": "Love this. I love to grill but live in a small apartment with limited outdoor space. You don't get the same smoky/fire taste that comes with grilling food, but this is a great alternative to cooking stovetop or in the oven. The double sides makes cooking chicken or other meats super easy and quick and the drain helps a lot for marinated foods. It's also nice because you can open it up fully and cook your veggies on the flat top side and your meats on the grill side. After you're done it's amazingly easy to clean.",

      "text": "Big improvement over it's earlier version. It now offers a tilt position to drain bacon fat, etc. into it's drain pan which is easy to clean. The baking plates are very easy to remove or to clean with a paper towel. Heats up quickly to its highest temperature. My only complaint which I noticed in other reviews is it's power cord is too short. An extension cord would solve the problem but must be rated to handle the high current. That should be an easy fix.",
