      "text": "I Purchased this for weekly Racquettball... I ordered a medium, concerned with the size but surprisingly it felt snug without cutting off my circulation while giving me great compression support. Extremely flexible and breathable. Very happy with product and would highly recommend. I am 40 years old with slight elbow discomfort from years of youth sports and various handy-man jobs over the years... my pain is directly below my elbow and flares up every time I play ball. I just started using this brace and impressed with the results. I look forward to wearing it for more than just sports.... If you have that tennis elbows tingle, then look no further... this is the brace for you!",

      "text": "About 5 months ago, while dead lifting my elderly mom from one chair to another, I pulled or tore some muscle in my elbow area. Now, after 5 months and the pain still sharp, I bought this Kunto. In my job I often have to lift CD and DVD players that weigh 25-42 pounds, and wow it hurts sometimes.... Previously I tried the copper fit mofdel and it was useless---too thin to make a difference. Out of desperation I bought the Kunto. I am glad I did. Imeditely when I put it on today for the first time, I truly feel the whole arm is now supported and truly braced. I expect, God willing, now the elbow to heal.",

Products were delivered promptly and in perfect condition. Recommended for sure if you need a heavy duty-heavy use elbow brace that is not hard to put on/take off and is not too invasive or limiting of your mobility.",

Cuts off circulation so I can't wear it for more than a couple of minutes. If I can't get it to loosen up, I'll be returning. If you measure a circumference of 9 inches, get a medium. Good stuff though- it feels sturdy. I can move around a lot without it sliding anywhere. The fabric and stitching are on point. It doesn't have any extra fabric to bunch up in the elbow crease. Aside from being too tight, it's comfortable. If you get the correct size, it'd be 5 stars.",

It fits almost perfect. Anything smaller might have been way to tight. I only have a baggy spot right where my elbow is and it's only there when my arm is straight. And it's only baggy like the skin of my elbow where you can only pinch just a tiny bit. Seems normal to me. I think if you have up to a 13 1/2 inch arm this would be ok maybe even 14.

While I was visiting my MD last week I asked him about copper infused products and he said there is no evidence of the metal helping anything in these compression sleeves. So my choice to buy these Kunto sleeves, although a couple of dollars more per sleeve was based upon the construction claims of the manufacturer, and the claims are accurate. The sleeves are remarkably comfortable, washable and look pretty cool! My tendonitis calmed down in both arms within two days. I'd buy Kunto Fitness products again, no question.",

Would give more stars if it was $5 but $20 feels ridiculously overpriced for the results I got.",

This Kunto Fitness Elbow Compression Brace fit the bill! It does everything it says it does along with the fit. The large fits him perfect, he can wear it all day. I would highly recommend this.",
