But now it's about 9 months later, and the finish is flaking off the pans even though I don't use them all that often, maybe every 2 weeks or so. I have been careful to use non-metal or scratching utensils too, but the finish is flaking off and the metal underneath is rusting. Terrible for pans less than a year old!",

      "text": "I bought these pans to replace some old Bake King pans. It is important to note that a 9x5 pan made in the USA is 5 inches from edge to edge (3.5 to 4 inches on the bottom) and 9 inches long on the top, about 7.5 on the bottom. These pans made in China are a full 6 inches wide, edge to edge, and 4.5 inches wide on the bottom. Length is a full inch longer. If you are used to making bread or loaf cakes in a USA made 9x5, these will result in lower than usual rise as a result of the extra width and length.",

Following the mfr's instructions not to use non-stick spray, I greased the pans with Crisco but I probably didn't need to; the loaves popped right out when I turned the pans over. The pans spent 50 minutes in the oven at 400 degrees several times today and did not warp or discolor. They looked perfectly clean after use, but I washed them out anyway after the last batch of bread. These bake more evenly than my expensive loaf pans, and if I have to replace them every year they will still be a bargain! [Not a paid review; I bought these pans.]",

So far everything that I have cooked in these, banana bread, apple bread, regular bread, etc. has turned out good. Best of all when they are done you can simply tip the pan over and it will fall right out. No need to \"loosen\" the sides. They are heavy enough to give even heating yet not too heavy that you want to avoid using them. I bought one first to test and ended up buying 3 more are now they are the only ones I use (except I did keep one Pyrex because who doesn't have at least one Pyrex bread pan).",

As such, it's nearly a quarter inch larger than its predecessor both ways. It also has a nice heft to it; it should withstand heavy use without any issues. The lip \"handles\" on the ends are slightly oversized to accommodate oven mitts comfortably. I'll be buying another one so I can have separate pans for meat and bread.",
