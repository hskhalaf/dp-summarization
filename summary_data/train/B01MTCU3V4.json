I've only had it 3 weeks and it's already cracking. This mat is a lot thinner and not nearly as durable. It weighs 4 lbs 15 ounces. It's over one pound lighter. It looks like the knobbies are the same height but the mat is thinner. Cracking after only 3 weeks! I think the majority of the reviews are for the older, higher quality version.",
