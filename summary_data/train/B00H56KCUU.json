I'd went from so many high end primers not working, to a lil cheap one that put them all to shame! CRAZY! This stuff works so well for me, it pretty much erased my huge pores.

After 5-6 hours, things get kind of runny (depending on how active you are) and it's hard to dab some oil or sweat off your face for fear of removing the layers you have on. It's fluidity makes it able to fill in pores well, but that is also it's downside since it doesn't firmly stay in place.",
