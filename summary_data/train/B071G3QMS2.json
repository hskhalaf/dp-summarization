I am building this with my 4-year-old daughter and she gets bored after about one bag. So we are going at our own pace and doing one bag a weekend. It's fantastic. Generally speaking, the craftsmanship has also gone up. It's amazing what they can do with Legos these days. Lots of moving pieces and various things like hoses etc that really give the rocket a realistic look. Nothing but love for this Lego set.",

He had one small issue with the first section, but the interior of the structure is intricate, and I immediately figured out what the issue was. Small pieces warning for little builders. This thing is solid! It can be displayed upright, or laterally resting on a series of supports. They give you a lunar landing module scene and a splash down scene. It's a good replica of the Saturn V, but not as detailed as you'd expect from such a large vehicle. Generally speaking, it's an impressive Lego, but it requires some skill",

He is very good at following the Lego assembly directions on any project. He already had the small Space Shuttle kit. However, there is no intermediate project between that, and the full-blown Saturn V Apollo Rocket. So we did order the Saturn V, although $110 was a bit more than we originally intended to pay for his birthday gift. I am sure he will be able to assemble the rocket, one stage at a time. I am impressed that it does also include the command module and the lunar lander.",

Having the lettering and images (USA flags) printed onto the surface rather than using decals is another huge plus. Best of all, we love how the assembled rocket looks more like a realistic model with a smooth finish rather than a cheap toy with Lego pegs showing. And at this price point it's a steal!",

The playability might be a little low due to the size and weight and the fact that it would be flying, but the CM and LM can be disengaged and more easily interacted with. It comes with some scale-sized people too which is funny because you can sense how large the vehicle is. However the completed model is solidly built and can be handled at-will. Worth every penny.",
