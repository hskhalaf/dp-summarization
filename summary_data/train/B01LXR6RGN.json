      "text": "In all fairness to Amazon and to Miele I need to post another review. The first Miele upright vacuum we purchased must have been faulty, but we decided to try ordering it one more time. The second one is working just fine. So far I'm very pleased. It has very good suction and easy to motivate all though it is a bit heavy.",

We settled on this model based on customer reviews and a national consumer magazine's review. Overall, we are very pleased with the Miele vacuum cleaner. The pros include very good cleaning capability, long electrical cord and good handling. The cons include a very short hose for the attachments.and the cleaner is a little heavy but inline with other cleaners. We would recommend this cleaner to others.",

      "text": "Well worth the investment. I moved to a new home with much more carpet than my previous home.Plus we have a dog so the carpets are always dirty. This vacuum is unbelievable. I chose to buy the Active Charcoal filter and use that instead of the HEPA due to the pets. The first time I used the vacuum, the house no longer smelled like pets. The carpets looked like they had been professionally cleaned. My mom was over a week after I got the vacuum and assumed I'd had the carpets steamed cleaned. This vacuum is heavy and it makes some arm strength to use it. I would not recommend it for an elderly person.",
