They are in a dry toolbox, inside an air-conditioned house, in the desert southwest. A drier environment you will not find. Can't imagine how quickly they would go south in any other situation.

The problem is compounded by the screws minimized head material and maximized shoulder angle. If you use these drivers on a regular basis you may experience this same problem, if however, the bits are used infrequently on home projects the bits should be adequate.",

The only thing that seems to be frustrating, is more noticeably on the smaller sockets,say 5, 5.5 mm and 3/16,and 1/14 inches etc.. The Concave angles takes away quite a bit of metal to metal contact. On Lager sockets this quick alignment feature is very helpful to align up the bolt head faster. I also like the six point socket. I don't like 12 point sockets, but that's just me. Thank You Eagle",
