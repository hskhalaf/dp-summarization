Contacted Kohler and they said that they only replace when it's been installed, not if it was shattered through delivery...that was on Amazon. Then I search and search and there is NO WAY POSSIBLE to contact Amazon about this product and get a replacement. So I'm out money...THANKS AMAZON!!!!!",

Unfortunately we recently had a pipe burst in the wall, and it damaged the vanity cabinet this was sitting on, as well as a bunch of drywall, and the wainscot. And, joy of joys, there was asbestos discovered in the drywall mud (house was built in 1973). Sadly, the abatement company broke the sink while doing some demo work. Very glad to be able to find the same sink again, in an attempt to re-create what we had! Will be ordering this in the next day or so!!",

I love the style and it was easy to install (ok, it was easy to watch the handyman install it and it seemed easy and simple for him). As a style feature, The drain is in the middle instead of the back. This requires that you need a longer thingymabob to connect it to an existing drain line that was receiving from the back end of the sink instead. Style is great and the quality seems beyond the cost! Thrilled.",
