The armrests are adjustable and the seat fits both those who prefer a narrower seat and those who like a roomy seat. The chair has a lot of adjustments which can make it a good ergonomic choice for companies which want to focus on ergonomic safety. The negatives - just one. I am not overly tall, but this seat is a little low for me. With the seat adjusted to the maximum height, it is only 18\" from the floor. Anyone with long legs (or bad knees) might prefer that it was a little taller. The chair came already assembled. What a nice surprise!",

    "description": "Color:Black/BlackLeap is a highly ergonomic chair that adjusts to fit your body, so you don\u2019t have to adjust your body to fit the chair. Thanks to its LiveBack technology, the Leap chair back changes shape to mimic and support the movement of your spine. And with its simple and intuitive adjustments, it\u2019s easy to adjust your Leap chair to fit you comfortably for the entire day. Steelcase Leap chair complete features are pneumatic seat-height adjustment, variable back stop, height-width-pivot-depth adjustable arms, black plastic frame, shell, base, arms, adjustable lumbar support, hard casters, fabric, open box refurb.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe streamlined, stylish contour of the Steelcase Leap chair is just the beginning. The Leap is the first chair that actually changes shape to support your movements! With its Live Back technology, it moves dynamically as your back moves, mimicking the movement of your spine; the arms of the chair move in and out, forward and back; the seat glides forward so you can recline without leaving your vision and reach zone, and stay oriented to your work. Even when leaning forward, the seat edge flexes to relieve pressure on the back of the legs. In short, the Leap chair's ergonomic advances allow you to work comfortably, and more productively, in a proven healthy manner for extended periods of time.",
