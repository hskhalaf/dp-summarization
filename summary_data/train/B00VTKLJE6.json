But be aware the hydraulic cylinder quality is very poor. Would not recommend.",

As far as the release handle goes, if you pull to hard, the platform drops very quickly, so be gentle and let it down with minimal pressure on the release, be patient, it comes down nice and smooth.

I use it to lift cabinets I'm building so I don't have to bend over any more. The back likes that.",
