It took no time at all for me, a 69 yr old woman, to assemble the bench.

However, I still feel like its structurally sound, as the crack point is after the frame attach point. It still gets used. I'm just worried about splinters coming through the pleather",

The foam (which is a great thickness and firmness) shifts a bit, its not something I've felt while lifting yet but if I move the bench the foam shifts too. Slight worry that this will be an issue down the line but judging from other reviews it shouldn't be. 2. The packaging was missing a washer for the screws, call me a stickler but missing is missing.

It is easy to move around, I keep my sets under the chair to save more room space and it fits well. When I am not working out, I use it as a normal bench at my desk and it works out well for me. One thing to note is that the bench may be a little shorter on the width and length side for someone who is over 6ft and bulkier than me.",

Keep your finger/thumb firmly while tightening the nuts and the bolts do the work and there...that's not hard now is it. Oh the reason for the four star is because I don't know how long it will last.

The needed Allen wrench is provided. The bench sets solidly on the ground. The top is attractive and firmly padded. By that, I mean that if you press your thumb or knee into the pad, you can feel its softness, yet is overall correctly firm for your workout. I must say I was delighted by this purchase.",
