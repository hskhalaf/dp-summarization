Doesn't matter if i reposition the sensor, close the blinds, move the kids, etc. There's almost always an issue. Sometimes everything works smoothly, but most times one kid ends up being grayed out and not being picked up by the sensor. I've tried this with 4 or 5 different \"dance\" games i've purchased.",

The main exception is the Dance Central series. Beyond that, there's not much to play. As far as controlling the XBOX dashboard, you would be better served to use a controller. The hand motions are slow and half the time you have to recalibrate your sensor if you move or stand up/sit down. If you can find one for 50 bucks or less, its a nice distraction, but not much more.",

Then pop in the DVD that came with the Kinect; Kinect Adventures and start the set-up process. Follow the instruction screens and you will be ready to Kinect to the world in a few minutes! The Kinect works with almost all the new games that are out and with updates you get some limited usage with some of the older games!

Hours of fun slashing and smashing fruit. My only gripe is I have an old original XBOX and it gets stuck \"starting up\" the kinect sensor - but entering into a game quickly remedies this problem. Dance Central is on its way and so far the kids love the 2-song demo also available from XBL Arcade.",

Also, it looks pretty fragile, so keep children and pets off! Last, the energy cable cannot be disconnected. It means you need to find a good place to store it.

We also purchased Dance Central 3 for $39.99 which is a much better game. Kinect is far better than Wii or Play Station's motion tracking (which requires a controller) and is worth the money to purchase. Just try not to play for too long. I played Kinect Adventures for about 5hrs each of the first two days and was quite sore because of it. You don't really notice how tired you are until you stop playing.",

I found, too, there's a fair amount of exercise involved. I think that's a good thing.",

Adventures works great, the game is highly responsive and all the horror stories of game-breaking lag are nowhere to be seen. The hardware picks up your movement extremely well, and adventures has some nice simple family games. If you want to get you/your kids off the couch and have some fun playing video games you can't go wrong with this. I rate this package 5/5 I did get a game (Motionsports) with it that I do not give a good rating to. However, Adventures performs extremely well and is a lot of fun. It's a good family title.",
