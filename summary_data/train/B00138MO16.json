I am not sure if they changed how they are made (which was a big mistake) or if we got a bad box.",

When they break off of the 'slab' it leaves rough edges that catch fire super fast. I used them primarily with Home Fire super dense pressed wood logs that can take some time to really catch on their own. They last plenty long enough to get the job done. I strongly recommend them as the best starters and the best price and value.",

Takes a while to get used to what they can do and cannot do. They will not ignite regular full logs but must be used to light smaller kindling or small half splintered logs first. They are easy to break-off from the rest and have no scent before lighting and when burning. Best thing about Fire Starter Squares is no more need for paper/newspaper. Paper is for the recycle bin, not for it to go up in smoke. I would recommend them.",

However, they have really cut down the amount of wax on their present batch of fire starters and it is bit difficult to start. You can also see the color change. The last year's batch was bit darker (more soaked with wax) versus this years; which are much lighter.",

You have to break up the bigger sections into little sections, but it's easy enough to do along the indentations. I would usually use 2 of the little squares. I'm burning Oak in my fireplace, so the wood is not the easiest to start, but if you're careful about how you stack the wood, using two of these at the bottom of the stack will get the fire lit.",

With the torch, they take about 5 seconds to light. Eventually, I'll try them for lighting the wood stove.",
