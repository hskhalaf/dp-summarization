As soon as my mom put this robe on she exclaimed: \"It's sooooo soft, I love how it feels.....and it's warm, you know how cold I get.....\" She loved the color \"nude\" as it goes with all her pajamas. The quality of the robe is remarkable thus far. No pilling after washing and it remains soft and plush Highly recommend this robe for anyone who appreciates quality.",

The fabric is rather thin and, considering how much it sheds (black fuzz everywhere!), I don\u2019t expect it to last very long.

That said, I like the robe, it appears quite well-made so far (3 weeks) and it is very warm and soft. I hope it washes well. My last fleece robe was llbean and lasted 5 years before I had to thrift if due to pilling. I doubt this one will hold up that long. But, the price was good and I may tire of the color.",

The description should state how long this robe is , other than that , i really enjoy it. By the way I am 5'5 and 145lb and this robe fits just below my calfs which is ok in when you live in a cold state.",
