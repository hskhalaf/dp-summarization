I got this because its compact and I can motocamp with it very easily. I DID NOT use the original rope that it came with. I picked up a cheap 100ft rope separate. I will probably only keep one of these but for the size the quality and use was great. In the pic you can see I had to tie a rock to it because the current was so strong it wouldnt get to the bottom. This is an issue with almost any trap but a cage.",

Those little buggers are quick to squirm away, but I didn't actually keep any of the 3 kelp crabs that I put in the bucket. I haven't yet tried to cast from a pole, but I suppose it would work and you wouldn't need the rope that comes with it, then no tangling. I ordered 2 more for friends.",
