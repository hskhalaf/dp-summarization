      "text": "Purchased a few months ago, and I use it during my work days for my lunch & snacks. Con: Condensation from the ice pack, when placed in the ice pack pocket located on the front zip down flap, soaks through the bag leaving it moist/wet on the outside of the bag. Pros: Better than a brown paper sack. Nice large size, and the food prep containers are solid and do not leak. Food stays cool throughout my 10 hour work shifts. Overall: Too expensive of a bag to have condensation leaking through the bag from the ice pack. Would I recommend this to a friend? No. Shop around and find a bag that doesn't leak.",

      "text": "Fantastic lunch bag! I had Bariatric surgery and this was perfect for me! The side bag gave me a place to put protein and drink mixes as well as my medications and vitamins. The main pouch allowed me to put two smaller ice packs in the front to extend the length it kept cool. I could fit milk containers inside as well as the extra couple of meals and cheese sticks I need throughout the day. This was the best purchase so far and extremely functional. Made very well, too! I highly recommend this to someone that works 12-14 hour days or just wants to be able to store what they need.",
