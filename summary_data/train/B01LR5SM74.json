Needless to say, I will be writing a formal complaint as this caused me to bleed and caused a lot of pain.",

The material looks like some kind of compound, heavy but isn't like steel but more like coal. When a company like Amazon places their brand name on private label products, you'd think these products are thoroughly vetted. I'm really disappointed with Amazon. I hope they'll pull this product out.",

I still think they'll hold up, but only time will tell.",

      "text": "The product itself is delightful. Perfect weight increments for a beginner home workout. The feel of the weights is a very nice texture. Easy to hold. The stand itself feels a little flimsy, but it does the job of nicely displaying the weights themselves. The packaging, however, was an utter nightmare. There was a smaller box inside an extremely large box, which made the 35lb package extremely difficult to carry up my three flights of stairs to my apartment. Once getting it upstairs, there was so much tape to cut through. After nearly 30 minutes struggling to open the heavy package, I finally got it open to find even more small boxes inside.",

The only negative is the stand. It isn't stable, at least not on my carpet in my bedroom where I use these. It is especially unstable if you are using the 8lb weights, and only the 5 and 3 pound weights are on the stand. It becomes top heavy with the 8 pound weights off the stand, and highly likely to fall. My solution is to not use the stand and I simply have these on the floor in the corner of room.",

He does whine when I use them so I think he'd really like a second set with more manly colors. The stand is ok but kind of a pain so I just have them in a wicker basket.
