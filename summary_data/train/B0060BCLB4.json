The balls I received were plain Empire balls as noted on the packaging box. The balls are okay if you do not care about regulation weight, these balls weighed in at 6.5 to 6.7 ounces, although advertised as regulation weight. The Izsybilliard balls probably are at regulation weight, since my community complex has the same exact balls and design and weighed in at regulation weight. I was disappointed in the false advertising here and returned my balls.",
