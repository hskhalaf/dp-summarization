If you have are investing time and money in maintaining your car's finish, don't set you efforts back drying your car with a cheap microfiber towel that will leave fine scratches and swirls. I will only use a premium towel, like the CarCarez Edgeless detailing towel. Use the auto parts store towels to clean your seats ... these are for your car's finish.",

Best part: absolutely no lint or material left behind like when using a cotton towel. They're also awesome for indoor dusting. Give a light misting with water (or not, opinions on this vary) and go to town on dust. Great results.",

It is so soft I cant put into words to describe how soft they are. I used them to remove wax and they do such a great job. As far as drying your car they are not very absorbent.
