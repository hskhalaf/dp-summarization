I can put a pair of Asolos on right out of the box and take off on a multi day trip never having to worry about breaking them in. They are the most comfortable boot I have ever worn and they fit my feet perfectly. What more could I ask for?",

Better durability wise and more comfortable. I also like the traction. The Vasque seem to be better in terms of waterproof qualities. Even when the Vasque are worn out they are waterproof... The ASOLO's are good for waterproof qualities, the Vasque are excellent. I now insist on goretex in my boots.",
