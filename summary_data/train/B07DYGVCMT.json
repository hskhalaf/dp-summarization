The vegan-friendly quality of the Merrell Vapor Glove 4 3D is an added plus to a lot of people.\u00a0Although there have been issues raised by a few users around the shoe lacing system, the overall reception of the shoe has been highly positive. Some wearers claim that they will surely get another pair of the Merrell Vapor Glove 4 3D.",
