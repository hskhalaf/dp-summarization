Image quality is excellent, particularly in low light situations. Menus are a bit quirky, and the on-off switch sometimes seems to have a mind of its own.",

I have been looking for a \"compact\" point and shoot camera that processes a RAW image file. The P330 is that and more. Truly \"pocketable\" and the image quality from a fully processed RAW file is impeccable. I had looked at the P7100, 7000 and others. The size and weight of those units take them out of the \"pocket\u2013point & shoot\" variety very quickly, and the large sensor CoolPix A is not cost effective. This camera P330) has all the functionality I need in the palm of my hands. I love it. . . . bgs.",

Sometimes does seem to take a while to process/save when taking RAW with JPG shots - could be a card speed issue - using a class 10 card, but not the higher speed \"pro\" cards so far - may need to try one. Other wise a great little picture machine.",

On vacation recently I probably made 40-50 shots per day. It has a program for almost every lighting and action level that makes it really easy to just point and shoot. However you must accept that an auto focus has it's limitations in extreme situations. You must lightly press the shutter button on each shot and give it time to focus. in dim light you may need to do it 2-3 times until it focuses correctly.",

The P330 is flat-out the best digital pocket camera on the market. True, some others have much longer zooms, but ALL zoom lenses have to compromise resolution. What Nikon does is supply a large backlit CMOS sensor, which means you can zoom the file later. Further, the P330 is the only pocket digital camera that makes manual operation practical. Sure, the auto features are superb, but every serious photographer has to resort to manual now and then.",

However, the video is fan-freakin-tastic, and the stereo audio (from on-camera mic, of all things) is even better. Shockingly good video and audio. Puts everything as simple files; you plug into USB and move the files onto HD for editing, etc. Very nice overall.
