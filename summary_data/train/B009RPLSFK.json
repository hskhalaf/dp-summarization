The assembly was relatively easy and well-designed. Most of the panels are particle board while the horizontal surfaces (worktop and bottom panel) are MDF. I purchased this with the matching hutch and they make a great combo. My only complaint is that there is very little give for horizontal movement on the cleat (about 1/4\"). In my case I had to cut down a receptacle wallplate because I could not move the desk an additional 1/4\". Overall still happy with this purchase.",

I store all my makeup, tools and brushes, creams, lotions, perfume, and everything I need hidden in the openings and it stays clean and hidden. Great way to organize all your stuff and get rid of the unsightly clutter on top of your vanity. The laminate material wipes off easily if anything gets on it. My vanity bench seat fits great underneath and cleaning underneath is so easy without the traditional legs. Love it.",

If I could find something locally to use for a computer desk I would send this back, but I'll wait and see if the pieces come and see what other pieces are missing once I start putting this together.",
