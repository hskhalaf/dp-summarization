The distance between units does effect performance, but if you are on a trail or tagging along on a road trip; these were ideal.

However, the first time I ever used it, after being underwater for a few minutes, water got inside it, and it died. Reading the description more carefully, now I see they define \"Waterproof\" as \"splash resistant\", which I find confusing. I can't comment on whether it works well outside a water setting; I'll be looking for a radio that's actually waterproof (as in submersible).",

We bought this to stay in touch while traveling abroad. My range tests while in the USA are dismal. I measured the distance and all we got was a range of about 1 mile. Beyond that, the radios did not communicate with each other. Yes there were trees and buildings between the radios but I was hoping for at least 5 miles. Radio was set to high per manufacturers recommendations for maximizing range. If range is what you need, you'll probably be disappointed here",

Sometimes -at highway speeds- the wind causes one of the \"lines\" to remain open so that the other person can't really talk back.
