The car seat was ok for my average sized baby (7lb at birth) for about 2 months. It was almost impossible to buckle her in at even the biggest setting by the time she was 3 months. We ended up buying a new carseat. I find it hard to believe that this carseat could safely hold a 35lb child.",

The canopy or cover is very difficult to adjust and will not protect baby if it's raining as it doesn't extend beyond what is pictured. I wrongly thought I could use the canopy like I have had with any other Graco carseat I've owned where you can place it directly over the baby. I'm disappointed that my baby can get so wet just walking from the grocery store exit to our car in the parking lot. Other than that, the material seems easy to clean and all the clips are easy to use. It's a cinch to install. Love everything but the cover.",

I like that there is a little slit to put the buckle in to hold the straps in place so they don\u2019t slip behind baby while loading them. I saw reviews that said it is narrow but ultimately bought it anyway because of the light grey color. We live in a hot climate and I couldn\u2019t imagine using anything with A black color scheme for babies born in July. I love the car seat and my 5 month old girls fit great in it. I would recommend it.",

She was 6lb 10oz when we left the hospital and she fit well in it! She was on the second strap hole, so it could\u2019ve even sit a smaller baby since the straps go down once more. The base makes it super easy to install in the car. She just clicks right in and I don\u2019t have to worry about messing with the seatbelt or making sure she\u2019s inclined correctly. Definitely happy with this purchase! I wish I had gotten it for my other two.",

The only thing I don't like is that the lever on the top back side that releases the carseat from the base does not release the carseat easily. It catches so I have to use both hands to squeeze the lever extra hard to get it to release. And it could just be the carseat I have. Maybe it's a small manufacturer error.",
