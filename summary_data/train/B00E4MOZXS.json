For me I've battled this for 30+ years and now have spent years with no problems after years of multiple infections a year.",

Since I have been using the NeilMed product, I have to say that my breathing has improved. I'm not saying it's a cure-all. I'm still thinking I need to figure out if I'm allergic to something, etc. but it has definitely helped and I will continue to use it because it has improved my quality of life.",

However, he likes this product much better because it (1) is so much faster to use and (2) has greater force which allows usage under more congested situations. When using the neti pot, there were times when he was so congested that the water simply wouldn't flow. Hint: When doing the 60 second microwave sterilization, make sure you use a microwave-safe plate otherwise these bottles WILL melt (and you will be glad you bought the 2-pack for a spare).",

This sinus rinse procedure works better and faster than any of the medications I take. Often it takes care of the sinus reaction overnight; sometimes it takes two days. I swear by it. If you fly a lot and have trouble with sinus because of pressure changes, try these rinses. They work well for me.",

So while it cleaned my sinuses great, I had to stop using it because the rinse backed up into my eustachian tubes and caused me earaches. I am the exception, not the rule. So if you normally don't have eustachian tube problems, this product will work well for you. I ended up using the packets as a saline spray solution - which works great.",
