      "text": "I was looking for a small cooler to transport about 30 oz of frozen breastmilk on a cross-country flight. I wanted the milk to stay frozen so I could pop it back in the freezer when I arrived. I packed this cooler with four small ice packs on the top, bottom, and sides, put the bags of frozen milk in the middle of the cooler, then packed the cooler in my checked bag. When I arrived at my final destination about 10 hours later, the milk was still frozen solid. Would recommend!",

      "text": "I tested this product immediately as it is to be used for backpacking. 22 cubes of ice didn\u2019t last much more than an hour in direct sun at almost 80 F, however the melted water stayed cold till next morning. On the backpacking trip in the Mt. Hood Forest I used a freezer ice pack and threw in frozen sausages. Although thawed, the sausages stayed cold till the morning of the third day. During this time temp reached about 75F and the cooler was left in shade or backpack, rarely in the direct sun. While I cannot attest to its effectiveness in a harsher environment as of yet, i can say that it was great in the conditions mentioned above.",
