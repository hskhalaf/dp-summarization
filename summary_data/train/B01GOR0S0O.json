I left it unfastened and the covers stayed in place in a 15-20 mph gusty wind. I believe they would withstand a lot stronger gusts. Very happy with this purchase.",

The second set I really had to work to get them snapped together. Took one of each off and compared them. The second set the straps are sewn on about 3/4 of an inch higher. This moves them up the radius of the tire. Which means the straps need to be longer. It comes down to poor quality control. There is no way this set would fit tires larger than 29.5 inches in diameter. Vinyl material seems heavy enough. We will see how well they hold up.",
