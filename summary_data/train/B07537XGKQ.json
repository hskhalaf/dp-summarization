      "text": "Very Ultralight tent. Well made, good quality for the price. My 9 year old son and I used it backpacking in Yosemite. We had plenty of room. I am 5'10\" and weigh 170lbs. Definately recommend keeping doors open otherwise you will get lots of condensation build up on the inside and your sleeping bag will get soaked. Just keep the mesh screen closed. I made that mistake the 1st night. Also the tent stakes are heavy duty but a little on the heavy side weighing in at 1oz each, so I got ultralight aluminum stakes that weigh 0.5 ounce and uses only 6 stakes instead of the 11 that it came with to lighten my load. Definately Recommend",

I was able to set it up by myself no problem while my husband made sure no other supplies were blown away. Kept the heat out during the hottest point of the day and was big enough for 2 adults plus both our packs and shoes. Super durable and resilient; lightweight and compact.

With tents, its always the poles that seem to make it or break it but this tent has no poles making it lighter to pack, more versatile, and very resiliant. We live in PA so there are an abundance of trees and sticks so no poles, no problem. Thank you to whoever finally designed this lightweight tent that makes sense and doesn't break the bank!!",

I didn\u2019t bring a separate rain fly so I had to deal with condensation but otherwise very satisfied. I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d and 270lbs so I\u2019m pretty large but felt fine inside. Would advise tying front door to tree instead of trekking poles. It does make it a little difficult to get in and out of with the pole directly in the middle of the door.",

My advise to you is that if you do buy it (which I highly recommend) is that you leave it open with the screen closed because it does not have a whole lot of ventilation. The quality is very good.",

The stakes only lasted two uses and I had to sharpen sticks just to fashion any kind of shelter.

There is lots of room for one person, but it could fit two easily. Word to the wise though, since this is a low weight, low cost tent, there is no rain fly. Make sure you water seal all the seams well. I also recommend sealing all the panels for added protection.",

It rained both nights that I used the tent, so both the inside and outside of the tent were wet. The condensation seemed to be a pretty big contributor, but regardless waterproofing spray would probably help with this. Overall, it's a solid tent for the price.",
