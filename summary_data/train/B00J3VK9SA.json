I've used it for almost a year now and it seems to help quite a bit, as my checkups are fine. Used at bedtime it seems to reduce the \"morning mouth\" feeling. Doctors are now saying that reducing mouth bacteria is important for general body health, so I'll continue to use this. It comes with a very small bottle of peppermint flavoring, but actually I don't bother with that, as the mouthwash itself is flavorless and I don't care for the peppermint taste. It isn't really any more expensive than other mouthwashes, especially with the Amazon subscription service.",

It comes with a little mint flavoring bottle that I throw away, because the taste is not bad at all. The taste is actually quite absent. It is an easy, burn-less rinse and my teeth look whiter than ever. I think that this mouthwash is a lot better than those cheap Listerine bottles of fire, or those mouthwashes that leave a dark stain on your teeth! How horrifying. This mouthwash is clear and unflavored, which is perfect for me. The bottle is also huge!",

      "text": "I got this after having problems with blue colored mouthwashes staining my teeth. It doesn't stain, and leaves a fresh clean taste. No super mint punch that keeps you from eating for hours after. I love this and even set it up to be auto delivered. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the bottle doesn't travel well. It leaks from the top, like the cap doesn't seal well. I just use another washed out mouthwash bottle for travel.",

I've been using this product now for 6 months; I'm not going back to any other oral rinse now that I use the \"gold standard\".",

Finally, its agreeable taste and non-tooth-staining characteristics encourage patients to be fully compliant. As a non-prescription oral rinse, Cloys not only meets and may surpass CHX in post-procedure applications, it also can be recommended for twice-daily regular oral care as a maintenance and preventative measure. Cloys is now a premium standard for daily oral care.",
