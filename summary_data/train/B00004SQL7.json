That wasn't gonna work.... so purchasing 4 of these individual ones made more sense. Glad I made that decision. Since they are \"Master\" brand... I felt better knowing I was getting a well-constructed lock from a trusted brand (as opposed to the lesser-known brands out there). No issues with these locks what-so-ever....

      "text": "Only two of the four pins need to clear the shear line in order to rotate the cylinder..!! I gave three people a pick and tension wrench and gave them a very basic explanation of lock picking and all three were able to defeat the lock on their first try in less than 30 seconds each. I haven't bothered cutting up a soda can yet, but the gap between the shackle and the case easily appears wide enough shim the lock as well. The one good thing about it is that it is pretty heavy, so if someone attacked you, you could throw it at them and run away.",
