I have normal to oily in the t-zone area skin which tends to break out, and this cleaner has helped with my breakouts (contains salicylic acid), it contains papaya making it effective but not too harsh! I use it twice a day and have experienced no irritation. Highly recommend!",

With wearing makeup it can be tough at times to break down all the oils and dirt. So I think it does a really good job doing that. Also, I get flaky skin daily, which means the acid is doing it job removing all the dead skin cells. And of course I like that it targets aging and acne at the same time. So far so good.",
