Nifty door like an old roll-top desk. But those knobs. It shouldn't be so difficult to zoom in on light or dark toast. Settings for other functions are easier - time and temp. But perfect toast is eluding me so far. It died in late October of 2018, so it lasted about a year longer than the warrenty. Not bad. But I think I'll try a Black&Decker next.",

Hamilton Beach is offering to send me a replacement, if I pay the shipping charges of $11.49 \"because shipping and handling aren't included in the warranty.\" That is totally ridiculous. I bought their product, it didn't last, now they want more $$ out of me to replace it. And I would bet that the replacement is \"refurbished\" not brand new. I won't buy anything from HB any more.",

No insulation at all. We had to be careful where the cord was, it would have melted if it was in direct contact. Sadly, it only lasted a year and the element stopped working. I am probably going to order another, anyway, because I need that size.",
