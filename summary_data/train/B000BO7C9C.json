    "title": "Granite Ware 34-Quart Stock Pot, Black",
    "description": "Size:34 quartsA generous 34 quart size is great for seafood boils, and serving large groups. Porcelain is fused to the steel at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit producing a non-porous, inert glass surface that is naturally non-stick. It\u2019s non -porous so it won\u2019t trap odors or food particles and provides a low coefficient of friction \u2013 meaning that it cleans up easily and, it is corrosion and chemically resistant so it will last a long time. This makes an ideal material for large pots as the glass-like surface is inert and does not interact with or alter the taste of food. The steel core is an excellent heat conductor, requiring less time and energy. No PFOA's or any other chemicals are used that may affect food taste, color or healthfulness. When fired, the vessel is placed on pins so the bottom and sides are hardened during the firing process into one smooth laminated glass surface. You may notice slight pin indentations where the glass has flowed around the pin that supports the base during firing. The pin marks do not compromise the finish or performance of the vessel. Porcelain can chip if dropped, however this does not reduce the effectiveness of the cookware. Not recommended for glass cooktops.",
