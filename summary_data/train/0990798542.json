So many great coaches started with this material so you might as well do the same. While I'm sure Greg is a very intelligent man, he's not trying to prove it with unnecessary details in the text. This book is well written and easy to understand, for coaches and athletes of all levels. If you're a weightlifting coach, planning to become one, or an athlete looking to take your sport to the next level, I can't recommend this book enough.",

Greg goes over the lifts extremely well, and he has a great progression for learning them. He warns the new lifter to not read the super in depth description chapter of each lift. Now that I've been at it for a little while, I appreciate this. Those sections make a ton of sense now and definitely would not have at first. He also includes getting ready for a competition and programming. All in all a great purchase as a new lifter!",
