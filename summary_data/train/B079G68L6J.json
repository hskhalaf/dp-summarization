Almost purchased a Weekender and I'm sure glad I didn't. It's construction is excellent, and the material top quality - light weight, water resistant and a really nice feel. The number of pockets are more than adequate, and the zip down back panel couldn't be more perfect for the desert in summer. Can't believe a vest of this quality is available at such a modest price.

Made the mistake of listening to people and went up 1 size from a large to an XL and it was HUGE. Promptly returned and re-ordered a L and it fit perfectly with room to spare. New vest was received the next day and so was the refund. Amazing service. Extremely well thought out. The back zips down to the mesh that neatly rolls down & stores in the back pocket. Lots of room in the front pockets for photography lenses and filters etc. Would highly recommend this, you won't be sorry.",

It has lots of pockets that either close via reliable Velcro or secure zippers. I use it as a wildlife photographer in the South. I love how the back layer neatly folds into a self-contained little pouch on the back of the vest so that all I have on my back is the mesh. I\u2019ve used it on some of our hottest and most humid days and have never felt like it needs to come off. Not to mention the padding in the shoulders really helps me lug my big lens around in more comfort. Can\u2019t recommend it highly enough!",

It zips but is tight. I'll live with that as I will wear it mostly unzipped anyway. So many Chinese clothing products are in our economy now it is certainly challenging to find the right fit.",

I love my new Autumn Ridge vest. It is very well constructed and I get the impression that it will last for a long time of heavy use. If you're trying to decide on which of the many vests to chose from on Amazon, I would encourage you to consider the Autumn Ridge. You'll be pleased with the result.",
