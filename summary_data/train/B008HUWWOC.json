Some of mine last way longer. But in the end, they all seem to eventually fail. I wish Insteon would get its act together and start using better quality capacitors.",

If only these dimmers were manufactured with quality components, or they came with a 5 year warranty, I would consider them to be excellent. Until then, prepare to replace them often. Not a very cost-effective expenditure.",

The battery operated products (motion sensor and leak detector) are difficult to set up and troubleshoot. My only real complaint is that the iOS app is just awful. It takes forever to load or refresh; it has also not been improved in more than three years of ownership. Come on, Insteon!!!
