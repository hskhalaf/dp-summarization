      "text": "the device is extremely easy to assemble, you do have to make some effort to set it up, the first position wish is the easiest to set up will make no effect on you, the second and third will, i will highly recommend to use any device to warm the muscles of your back first to loose them up before using this device, the blue part is a soft foam, similar to the one's you see in yoga mattress ,the whole thing is plastic, but hard plastic, no worries, the spike are not uncomfortable........i hope you find this review helpful.",

I followed the instructions, was careful, used the lowest setting and didn't stay on it to long. I have since had chronic pain in my back, a pain that I had never felt before. I saw the chiropractor several times but no relief. I can only hope that this is not permanent and will in time get better. To all my fellow back pain sufferers;; please be careful.",
