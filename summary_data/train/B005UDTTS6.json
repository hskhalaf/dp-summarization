I believe the bigger issue is the lack of players to choose from for each mission. You're fixed to only one transformer I believe. Great thing about this is I got it used for like $15 or maybe it was less. Playing these classic xbox 360 games is well worth your money.",

If you are a fan who maintains that love for the older episodes, then this game will certainly put a smile or 3 on your face. PS- Megatron's cannon is perhaps the most awesome primary weapon in the history of video games (nostalgia talking)",

The best part, as well as a slight draw back, is that this game doesn't follow the same game play mechanisms as it's previous release. It makes the game a fresh of breathe air, at the same time it can be a little of an annoyance if you were fond of the original lay out. All in all this game is a must play. The storyline is beautifully done, video scenes are gorgeous and the game play is fun as hell. Do yourself and some friends a favor and get the game already",
