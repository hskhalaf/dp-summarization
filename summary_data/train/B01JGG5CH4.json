I suggest following them and letting the nails cure for 90\u2019seconds between each layer. Also, do not touch the nails when you paint them. It will have a stickiness on them after you paint them be sure to wipe them Down with the alcohol.",

I\u2019ve tried this out several times, and it works great! It dries the LED/UV polish very quickly. I like the option of 30 or 60 second dry time, or it just stays on. It also doesn\u2019t get too hot. Not burning me is a plus. :) I\u2019ve tried this on both my fingernails and toenails, and it works just fine. I\u2019m very satisfied and would put this against more expensive brands.",

It does heat up my nails quite a bit especially with the top layers of nail polish.

Then I washed my hands with soap and water and rubbed a bit of regular mail polish remover on my nails before I applied the gel polish. This really works! My nails have grown out to a nice length and feel very strong.",

It cures my nails SO fast. I'm talking 30 seconds fast. Im so happy with this purchase. I wish i ordered it sooner!! Worth every penny. I think its super cool how it automatically turns on when you put your hand/foot under it lol. Also, my whole hand fits which i am so happy about because my old light only fit my 4 fingers.

If it does dry, it just peels off the next day. Not worth the money at all, spend the extra money and get the higher wattage.",

It also has the ability to motion-detect your hand if you just want to stick it under the UV light without using the timer function. All-in-all it was worth the price and it functions as it should. Downfall, you have to cure the gel polish a few times each coat for it to completely dry. Not sure I like the idea of exposing myself to that many rounds of UV light, but hey, they wattage is lower than some others so that may be why. I would recommend and continue to use.",
