It's a little muffled since it has to come through the padding of the cap. The cap is thin, but it stays warm even in sub-freezing temperatures. Being a little big on me, it looks a little funny, especially with the brown leather \"ears.\" But the extra air and leather padding helps trap heat and keeps me warmer, while also protecting the speakers from weather. Overall, I'd recommend this product with a 5-star rating.",

Ideal for situations where you want to listen or be hands-free, but don't want to be totally cut off like wearing headphones or earbuds. Great little gift for the money!",

First of all, just as a hat alone, it's very comfortable and keeps my head pretty warm, does what a hat should do. Second of all, the speakers in the hat actually sound very good, they're also very discreet, making it great to use at work, school or if your wife is nagging you. My only complaint is that it's a little big and the speakers don't fit directly over my ears sometimes, however for the price it's definitely worth it.",
