The directions in the package were very easy to follow, and in 45-minutes I had the system completely installed. I positioned the camera above the license plate. The video on the monitor is high quality. As soon as I put my gear shift in Reverse the monitor comes on and gives me a clear display behind the truck. Now I can see everything that is behind me to make backing-up much easier and safer. I highly recommend this product.",

So when you have it that high to see down to the hitch ball you only see 15 feet or so behind the truck. If you mount it lower you will be in the middle of the license plate. Hooking it up to the tail gate like a factory unit is not plausible due to the wiring. Still all in all worth it especially for hooking up a trailer.",

Toyota made this easy. The camera is on the license plate, and doesn't interfere with the tailgate. The wiring was easy to run up into the left taillight and secure along the way with the nylon ties. Behind the taillight is a good watertight location, and connecting it to the reverse light was simple with the connectors provided. Picture quality is very impressive, and I'm very pleased so far.",

I couldn\u2019t do it myself so I had to hire someone to do it. Overall the quality is great except for glare from headlights at night time. Night vision without any outside lights from any other headlights is great though. I highly recommend this product but just be aware and ready for a difficult installation.",

Installed on 14 Jeep Wrangler. After this review the company sent me a new back up camera. It turns out the one I received was simply not functioning correctly. I have to say they have been very good in resolving the issue and I appreciate them much more than many other company's that would not have gone out of their way for customers.",

Camera is not completely wireless, but you don\u2019t have any wires in between camera and the monitor, so no need to worry about hiding all those long wires from the dash to all the way to the trunk area. For installation, I just drilled a small hole behind my license plate, took me 10 minutes.",
