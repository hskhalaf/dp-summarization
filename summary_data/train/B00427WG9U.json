Their customer support and policies are designed to be obtuse and unhelpful and to filter out loyal customers who just to get a replacement or refund. I've gone several rounds with them and they are useless jerks. Save yourself the trouble and buy something else.",

My daughter uses these, and won't even touch the Beats earbuds I bought her. If you haven't tried them, I recommend these highly. We own 3 pairs now, and all are in excellent condition.",

Must be a bad connection at the audio jack because when I move it around the sound sometimes does come through. Disappointed at quality for the price. Lasted less than 2 years!",

I just can't quit this damaging relationship, you sleek, attractive, effective but ultimately flawed bastards. For every pair, within 6-9 months (of daily use, and carried scrunched up in pocket), the mic/buttons fail or the 'crackling' starts indicating a bad connection (even after cleaning/swabbing the 3.5mm port on my iPhone). This ultimately results in a malfunctioning mic, buttons and/or either earbud stopping sound. I just wish they were more robust!",
