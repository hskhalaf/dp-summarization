I was going to clean the bowl and when I opened it the inside of the dispenser that is hidden and can only be seen when you remove the top was full of MOLD!!!!!!! I was terrified! Now that I think about it, it is not right to have water that is contaminated by your pet's saliva. I heard that metal bowls do not attract mold. This plastic material creates a gap of humidity, therefore, promoting mold growth.",

Easy to fill, easy to handle, and the dish is shallow enough for my cats. It has survived plenty of 11 month old kitten tussles and wrestling matches without spilling or leaking. For our 5 cats, we fill each of the 2 small sized waterers every other week. The clear container is removed by pulling straight up and also has a spring loaded lid that you tighten before placing in the dispenser.",

I'm confident that it'd work perfectly as a pet watering dish as well, but you still have to clean it out frequently just like any pet water dish. Your pet has food on their whiskers, they get a drink and some of that food washes off into the water, bacteria grows, so you have to wash the bowl out anyway.",

I am still skeptical of the food bowl, but so far our cat seems to be eating as much as usual and the bowl stays filled. I'm not sure how one would clean the bowl except when the filler is empty, but We didn't clean the old one more often than that anyway.",
