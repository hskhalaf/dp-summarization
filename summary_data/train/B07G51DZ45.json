It seems that there weren't any dramatic differences in function per say, but the Cricut had advantages in ease of use and being mobile. Actual heat distribution comparisons were in favor of the Cricut as well. For someone just starting out in vinyl work this is a great product to start with...although it can be a little pricey. We have made several cups, bags, and shirts and haven't had any problems. This has been a great product for us.",
