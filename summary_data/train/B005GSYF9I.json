I'm going to return them (unfortunately, the rest of them seem decent and fit well) because i'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to get them stuffed into wading boots. I can literally fold the stocking feet back over the front of my feet with ease, its almost comical. *ugh*",

The X-large size would have just been too big. The waders come with a wading belt, a repair kit, and a mesh storage bag, though I don't use the bag...I hang my waders up in the closet after they're dry. There is also a nice front pocket where I can slide my reading glasses in and out of, as needed.",

I also liked the heavy-duty plastic D-rings in the front because I was able to clip my fishing tools to them while fishing from a kayak. The knees are reinforced on these, which also came in handy when kneeling in shallow water around sharp oyster shell reefs. My only possible issue was that the neoprene feet in these are huge on me (about a men's size 8.5 foot - these are closer to 11 or 12) so I have to roll the toe up onto itself before putting on my wading boots.",

    "description": "STOCKINGFOOT DELUXE BREATHABLES\nCaddis Stockingfoot Deluxe Breathables are the ultimate in lightweight design. They're ideal for those days when the mornings are cool and the days are long and hot. This product is the perfect all-around breathable wader.\n\nView larger THE ULTIMATE IN BREATHABILITY\nThe secret behind Caddis breathable wader technology is our CaddisDry fabric. CaddisDry fabric's waterproof, breathable layer will not allow water molecules to pass through and enter the waders - however, it does this while still allowing smaller vapor molecules to exit. With no build up of moisture within the waders, you'll stay comfortable in all seasons.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n * Attractive 2-tone taupe color\n * Heavy-duty polyester material\n * CaddisDry breathable technology\n * Reinforced knees\n * Attached gravel guards\n * Seams taped, glued, and stitched\n * Foot taped inside and out\n * New quad pocket\n * High-density neoprene soles\n\nSAFE WADING TIPS\nAlways keep these two rules in mind when wading in any body of water: wade with caution, and wade with care. There are obvious and not-so-obvious dangers inherent with wading. Following these tips will help you experience a safe and enjoyable trip. \n\n * Use a wading staff to feel the bottom before stepping.\n * Never wade alone.\n * Always wear waders that fit properly.\n * Wear a wading belt to create a seal between your body and the wader.\n * In rivers and streams, identify potential dangers down current such as waterfalls, log jams, or undertows before entering the water.\n * Walk slowly, smoothly, and carefully.\n * Wear a personal floatation device.\n * Be aware of tides, currents, and water level changes.\n * If you fall, don't panic. Don\u2019t fight the current, work with it. Allow the current to drift you downstream as you work your body towards the bank.\n * Never continue wading if your waders are full of water.\n\nBREATHABLE WADER KEY FIT POINTS - MEN\nSize Max Inseam Max Girth Max Foot Small 32\" 43\" 9.5 Medium 33\" 45\" 10.5 Large 35\" 48\" 11.5 XLarge 36\" 51\" 12 XXLarge 37\" 55\" 13 Medium Stout 33\" 50\" 10.5 Large Stout 35\" 54\"11.5 XLarge Stout 36\" 57\" 12 XXLarge Stout 37\" 64\" 13 Medium Tall 36\" 45\" 10.5 Large Tall 37\" 47\" 11.5 XLarge Tall 38\" 51\" 13 For short stouts subtract 3\" from the inseam.",
