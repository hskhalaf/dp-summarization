I heartily agree. Just wear shoes: the tiny little pins aren't meant for bare feet. The black pedals blend in, and might not scream, \"Steal Me\" to a degenerate gaping at the bike. The Blue pedals I'm saving for a special occasion: they're just as cool as the black, but it seems like they might get stolen, which would make getting the bike home troublesome.",
