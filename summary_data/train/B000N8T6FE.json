If you use the sleeve supplied, the pole will wobble too much, cannot be used. Even worse, the size of the pole means you need a custom order sleeve to fit the pole tightly enough to use it. In all, too many problems with this equipment. It should be easy enough for the manufacturer to supply a sleeve of the correct dimensions.",

      "text": "My set came complete and the pole itself seems sturdy enough for light backyard play, but the instructions and overall anchoring design are junk. I dug a foot deep hole, 8 inches in diameter exactly per instructions. I poured a concrete footer for the sleeve to sit in and let it cure. Within half an hour of play, the force of the pole getting banged around made the concrete wobble in the ground and eventually crack. A 10+ foot pole with a swinging ball on the end needs a much bigger footer tham what they recommend to be stable. I'll be digging another hole, using a longer PVC piece, and pouring more concrete. Kids were bummed.",
