My wife hated when I was baking the empty pans, because the smoke point of the PAM was obviously south of the 360 degree temp I was using, so it stunk up the entire house. This stuff claims a smoke point of 400 degrees - but despite scrubbing all remaining oil off of the pan and reconditioning, it still smoked in the oven and stunk up the entire house.... Don't know if there was any residual oil (not sure how) - but time will tell if this is actually any better for 2x the cost.",
