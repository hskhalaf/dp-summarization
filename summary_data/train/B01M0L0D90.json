The negative-This treadmill is pretty noisy right from the start, however over time it's become borderline unusable due to its volume. Anytime I put this over 7.5 speed, it starts squeaking and whining at a volume that is distracting and noticable to neighbors. I've done the lubrication and maintenance, but nothing has helped. Not a bad purchase for a few months, but doesn't seem to have staying power.",

I agree with another reviewer who said it shouldn\u2019t be advertised as having one. The machine itself is quiet but it get really creaky and squeaky whenever someone is on it. The pros are that it is otherwise what I had been wanting. It works well, assembly was quick, it\u2019s narrow but not too narrow, and I can use it for walking and running. It gets up to a nice speed and is easy to use. I always lean toward simple is best, and I like the simplicity of this treadmill.",

      "text": "So this is a treadmill. It is useful for running and it serves its purpose well and has held up quite nicely. However, there are some things that I would like to point out that I'm not a fan. When setting up, the wire connection things were just superglued together, which to me, made it seem cheaply made, as well as the piece to fold the treadmill up is just one bar knob thing welded on. Also, the belt which is supposedly 'layered' is very, very thin and probably not shock absorbing. So hopefully these will not cause it to have a short lifespan, but they are a concern for me in terms of longevity for the future.",

I paid $304 for it. The warranty is only good for 90 days. How can it burn out so fast? Do not waste your money on this brand buy another one! Stanford the service manger is a joke. Would not help at all was very arrogant asked him for his mangers name would not give it.",

It comes with pre-programmed workout but they aren't great. It does the job. I can walk or run inside now during bad weather but, like I said, if I had to do it over again I would spend a bit more.",

No holes provided for ice water. 1-9 number system makes it easy to adjust exact speeds during use. Overall a very practical machine, would recommend for people with running in mind. Comes with no extra luxuries and requires regular inspection and maintenance. Definitely not useful for commercial purposes.",
