The lock holding the socket isn\u2019t holding it\u2019s full strength so it could barely even hold up my camera without tilting down. My camera isn\u2019t that heavy or big as well. I was really hoping to use it for my DSLR, but that looks like it isn\u2019t happening.",

The ballhead, however, wouldn't lock and it would not hold my camera in any position other than slumped over to one side. YouTube videos show this product holding much larger DSLRs with larger lenses very solidly. I just use a small DSLR (Nikon D5500) with just kit lenses. What a piece of junk this thing was. Super disappointed. Returned immediately. Good luck to you if you buy one!",

Those two inches that always make the difference (in this case - in a bad way :-P )",

The broader base and higher stance are the only redeeming qualities. I am keeping it until it breaks and then I will likely replace it with another original Pixie.",

PLASTIC legs. PLASTIC ball holder. The whole thing flexes if you push down on the camera. Get a Manfrotto 709B. 100% metal, rock solid, lasts for ages. Do NOT buy it for $57 on Amazon though -- that seller is a ripoff. Get it for $37 on eBay.",

My only gripe is that there is no way to lock the legs to make it stand taller. It sits very low to the ground and if used on a table to film yourself you will have a very awkward angle. Also, I wish they would have incorporated the ballhead from the first pixi with the easy to push button.",

This product is perfect with the H6 and I love the appearance of the pair when I set up my recording gear. There are less expensive options but for a premium device like the H6, the PIXI is the natural complement. I am very happy with this purchase.",

The rubber feet doesn't slip easily and the camera stay in place. I was a bit skeptical but I'm pleased with it. Great buy.",

      "text": "This tripod is awesome. The rotating ball mount is very secure, and can easily keep a mid-range DSLR with lens in place when held at a 90 degree angle. The legs and body are plastic, but feel very sold and reinforced. When the legs are folded inward, it becomes a comfortable handle which can be used for basic handheld stabilization. (It's never going to be as good as a proper steadicam rig, but if you're using this with a cellphone mount, it's much more stable than just trying to hold the phone directly.)",

It's very sturdy; you just need to fit your camera tightly onto it. It is a bit heavier than I would have liked it to been, but it's not unbearingly bothersome. Really travel friendly because of its size. However, not the biggest fan of the head adjustment. It's really hard to maneuver around, and it's difficult to center it back straight. However, I won't be messing around with this too much. Overall, it's a great tripod worth investing in if you like casual photography and vlogging.",
