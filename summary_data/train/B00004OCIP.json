I understand the concept of planned obsolescence, but we shouldn't be filling landfills with plastic just so they can make a few bucks on a new peeler.",

I finally used this one today and (aside from adding a chunk of knuckle to the beef stew) it was a great experience! I paid five bucks for one at the grocery store a few months ago to replace the peeler I'd had half my life and couldn't get used to peeling toward my belly. It was so dull it wouldn't have done much damage anyway, but this one by OXO is like finding a long-lost friend! It WORKS! It peels away in long neat strips! Yay for new potato peelers!",

It has a sharp blade, peeling a thin layer with ease, yet your fingers are protected. It has a safety plastic covering if you chose to keep that for storage. I highly recommend this vegetable peeler.

It is just the right size so it doesn't slip out of your hands when peeling something slippery, again like a mango. I personally hate peeling mangoes so this thing is in my eyes a gem!",

There's an excellent little dimple on the peeler end that's perfect for removing the eyes off potatoes, the blade stays sharp, well, forever, since I've never been able to keep one til it wears out, and I think that out of all the different styles of peelers I've used over the years, this one is the best. It's what I expect from OXO, they've never let me down so far.",
