I have a 93 octane performance tune on my 5.0, and running 104+ with 93 octane pump gas helps me get the most solid performance. She just wants to scream and go...

      "text": "Seems like a good product for what it is an octane booster. They thing I do not like is there is no on the website to calculate how much it boost it. I tried it in my 383 C4 Vette. Thought It sound like needed more octane. I'll know better in awhile, the car is HEAVILY modified, I bought it without a lot of documentation, we are now putting in light weight clutch, flywheel, trying to figure bore and stroke and cam duration. Then we need work on the ECM and will get it dyno tuned. After that I'll be able to tell. It did seem to make a difference, just by the fell of it.",
