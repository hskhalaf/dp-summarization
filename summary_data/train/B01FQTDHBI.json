And, since I still carry around a checkbook for the rarely written check, the interior pocket that's protected with a fold-over snap is perfect for carrying a small stylus/pen as well as the checkbook. Then the zippered slot is perfect for change. Only thing I would change would be to make the zipper color-coordinated instead of gold.

I also could not help but notice the stitching on the inside is even and straight. These qualities give it a 'high end' look. Definitely recommend this wallet!

      "text": "I absolutely love this phone wallet. (Just received). Color is very rich. And appears to be of good quality. As advertised it had lots of space for credit cards, checkbook etc. And it holds the phone nicely and is NOT bulky. This made my life much simpler allowing me to store everything very neatly and organized. Now as long as the product holds up and doesn\u2019t start to look worn or discolor in a short period of time I\u2019m good to good. So for now I gladly give the 5 rating!!!",

This has happened over and over since the day I bought it and with enough brute strength I eventually get it open and always swear I'll never zip it closed again.",

This was packing by Amazon and late delivery and rough treatment by UPS SurePost. This is 2nd problem I've had with both of them in 2 wks. My last package was refused by local Post Office because it was destroyed because of the same thin bag packaging and rough handling. Again.. NOT ItsLife's fault. I rate them an A+",

Took up a lot of room in my purse. I had never heard of this brand but did lots of research on it and several others. I can get more in this wallet and not near as bulky as the one i already had and more room in purse. I saw where some had a problem with the leather odor. There was a slight leather odor but resolved. I also happen to like the new leather smell",

The only thing that I would improve is I would add a thumb hole in the drivers license window because it is difficult to remove my drivers license from that pocket. Also, I tested the RFID blocker by putting a hotel key in it. It didn't work with the key inside my wallet, so my thoughts are that the RFID block works.",

A zippered pocket accessible without opening the wallet, or a snap-open pocket when you open the wallet. I like the idea of the zippered pocket so I don't have to open the wallet and it keeps change in place, but putting change AND bills in the zippered part doesn't fit well. I end up having to fold the bills and stuff them in so the zipper doesn't run them over when closed.",

If I have one criticism -- and this is very minor -- it is that the ID compartment is covered with fine mesh rather than being clear; that probably makes it more durable but you do have to remove your ID for it to be read. But definitely a 5 star product overall. I'm tempted to buy another just to have one for the future or for a gift.",
