When rolling the stove, the cover lock will open with the slightest vibration allowing the cast iron grills and water tray to fall out. I am lucky that my grills did not shattered as noted in other reviews. I now use a strap when rolling the stove. Ridiculous for such an expensive grill, there are better options.",

We've used it several (less than 10) times, packed it up and taken it camping etc., We went ahead and night the extra grill plates so we could have multiple uses. Love them too and would recommend. Yesterday we ran out of propane in our big grill mid-meal. We pulled this out and it worked great. I have one disappointment after pulling it out again the side handle fell off. I feel like this shouldn't have happened since we've used it so little and have always been very careful. They are grommeted on so I'm not sure how we'll fix it- maybe finding the perfect screws",

How about a storage spot for the propane bottle when not in use? Doesn't replace a a decent portable charcoal grille but the ease of propane saves this grille...barely",

However after less than a month and after grilling 5 or 6 times, the right handle fell off completely. You need the handles to mount the grill up and bring it back down. They used rivet instead of screws and they are very poorly made. Another really annoying thing is that the handle take almost half of the table. You can barely fit a plate in there, it's something you can live with but it could have been definitely better designed.",

Heat distribution is horrible and the grill either burns or under cooks. I guess if you just want an easy to move and store portable grill and dont care about the quality of the food cooked on it, then this ones for you. If you care about your food, dont buy this grill.",

The grease collector is a large metal insert that you need to add water to to collect the grease. You end up with a mess of grease floating on the water. This is not easy to travel with, in my opinion. We really liked older version of the RoadTrip grill but are thoroughly disappointed with this version.",

      "text": "I purposely ordered the more expensive Coleman because I believed it to be better quality. The lid comes pre attached to the grill by rivets. After assembling the rest of the grill we now see that the lid is not properly riveted on the grill so it doesn't evenly close. There is about a finger gap on the right side. It's easy to see that the rivets are not lined up with the other side. Very shoddy product and easy to see. This should not of passed their quality control. Now we are apparently stuck with it because it says in the brochure we can only return it to Coleman and are responsible for the shipping to do so.",

The only dislike is the cleanup can be somewhat of a pain as you will need to empty the water reservoir and wipe down with soap and water after each use. Overall great option.",
