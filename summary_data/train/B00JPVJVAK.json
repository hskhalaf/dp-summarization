The gloves dramatically increase the resistance with each stroke, for more exercise per session. One observation - to get the maximum effect, you have to stroke with your fingers spread wide apart, with the glove covering the space in between, thereby increasing the effective size and drag of your hand. If you keep your fingers closed, as in normal swimming, there is little effect from the gloves. Good product - I can't see how paying a lot more for a Name Brand would get better results.",
