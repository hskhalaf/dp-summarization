You have to fumble around feeling for it, then try and press the button without looking. Not safe at all.",

The first pair had to be returned as they had a manufacturing defect making it impossible to get them on on one of the hands due to an obstruction in one finger of the glove. 2. They make your hands sweat and stick to the lining which then pulls out when you remove them and it is a PAIN to get the lining back in. Aside from these negatives, they provide good heat and I love the fact they come with the controller and the wiring needed.",
