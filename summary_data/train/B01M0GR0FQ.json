      "text": "Installed in our Class A motorhome at the driver's instrument panel. Will use it for charging navigation device, and cell phone. Installation is same as adding a cigarette lighter plug in the panel. Drilled a 1.125 in. diameter hole in ABS plastic panel just above an existing cigar lighter plug and it matches nicely. The voltmeter reads chassis battery voltage which is very helpful to monitor alternator output and voltage regulator. Item has cover that allows reading voltage thru it. Very rarified with product.",
