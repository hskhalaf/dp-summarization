As an aside, these are not just great for baby's bottom, but also are great for general cleaning, for instance it removes crayon from marble, and television screens. They also work quite well for getting marker off the wall and little hands. They get puke off the car seat as a great short term solution, and permanent marker off of pumpkins. I can't think of much that a newborn through 5 year old (and their dad ;) ) can throw at you that these great wipes can't handle!",

Unfortunately though, these wipes gave my baby a rash- very red and bumpy. I had gone through one pack of the wipes before I realized that what was causing his rash. And within a day of not using these my baby's rash completely went away. These wipes are also very thick and slightly rough. I gave two stars instead of one because I like the company and the idea of these wipes. But I definitely expected better from Seventh Generation. I returned the rest of the packages I had.",

The ingredients for Jackson Reece aren't as bad but because they are #1expensive, especially when in Hawaii, we have to order and it takes almost two weeks to get here so our 2nd choice would be the babyganics. If Seventh generation had the ingredients of Jackson Reece or better we would definitely switch.",
