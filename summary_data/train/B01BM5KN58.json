Not a real problem as most individuals using a product like this usually have a good idea of the proximate distance they are facing and if the reading passes the reasonableness test.

I still like the rangefinder. I did get the \u201cAsian pack\u201d and I\u2019m not real sure what the difference is, other than a sticker that said \u201cAsian pack\u201d on it. So, if you are gonna buy this rangefinder definitely buy the Asian pack. I\u2019ve never had a rangefinder before, so this may be normal, but I played in fog for the first time. It wasn\u2019t bad and it just would not pick uo the flag, even around 100 yards out. Overall it is a good rangefinder",
