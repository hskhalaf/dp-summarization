      "text": "My two boys LOVED this. This Play-doh Advent Calendar is a very simply designed Advent calendar. Starting on the 1st, we opened a door every morning. They were so excited to see what play-doh toy that they would get. There were scissors and cutters and rollers and many stamps. I was able to get away with one this year, but next year I will definitely order two because I think that they will both want their own Advent Calendar to open. So much better than just chocolates. In fact, it is the Friday before Valentine's Day and they are over in the playroom playing with some of these item right now. Highly highly recommend!!!",

I know it's tough- it's play-doh, but he really enjoyed getting tools to play with- the roller, the scissors, things like that...but he was less interested in getting things like antlers or a Christmas hat. He really enjoyed the Play-Doh that came with it, but he wanted to use it all on the first day.",

Mostly shape cutters (Xmas tree, bell, snow man, snow flake, etc), some tools (scissors, knife), and a few things you insert (santa hat, reindeer antlers, angel wings). Comes with a mat too, which my son wasn't interested in. Also 4-5 small playdoh cans. All in all I'd recommend this set!",

      "text": "This advent calendar is a huge hit with my 4 year old son. It comes with the 5 containers of Playdoh (2 of which are sparkly) and every day, he gets to open a door and get a new Playdoh accessory. Usually it is a cookie cutter type toy, but he has gotten other things too, like scissors. He really looks forward to the daily event building up to Christmas. I like that it gives him a fun activity every day and it is not just candy or whatever. The toy aspect really adds something to the advent experience for him.",

The kids would have probably given this product five stars but for me it was meh.",
