I especially like that this has an adjustable opening to keep from touching the grinder or getting hair caught. I just received it and gave it a try. Used a few treats along the way. She just sat there and let me use the grinder on her. It was a perfect experience. This grinder is very quiet and works well. I highly recommend it!",

It is very quiet,& easy to hold AND handle. It NEVER overheated and it took me over an hour just to do the front 2 paws \ud83d\ude0e... I have used other cordless grinders...BUT this is SUPERIOR! I don't believe you'll be disappointed at all. I highly recommend this product. It also comes with extra little grinders and they are very easy to interchange.",
