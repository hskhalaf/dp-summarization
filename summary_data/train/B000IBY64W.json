Only downside to chlorine tablets is the four hour duration it takes to work (as opposed to a UV pen or other filtration devices).

      "text": "Big fan of these for treating water in the backcountry. After a ton of use, my favorite ratio I've stumbled upon is 1 tablet / 32 FL OZ (Gatorade bottle [946 ML]). That's when I'm in the mountains in the Pacific Northwest and not worried about the safety of the water so much. Totally a qualitative thing here. But seems like a good balance of treatment to exposure to Chlorine Dioxide, considering all chemical treatments are likely bad for your health in the long run. Nonetheless, I'm pretty addicted to how lightweight and fast-to-use these are when backpacking.",
