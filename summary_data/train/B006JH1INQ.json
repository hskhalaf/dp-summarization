I would only use it stacked as a twin.",

Would be nice to have an adapter for the compressor, but that wasn't advertised so no marks off. you can use a backflow cork available at any wine/beer making store. It is basically a rubber stopper with a hole in the middle.",

Very use-able though for indoors and versatile. Quite a luxurious air mattress. I would recommend it.",
