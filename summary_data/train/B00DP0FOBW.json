      "text": "If you are wanting a powerful, but extremely quiet, (for a disposal that is), then, I highly recommend this unit. I had a Badger 5 model that sounded like a saw that they use to slice lumber. Installation was a breeze, (maybe 20 minutes including electrical.) I used the previous \"sink collar\" so that saved a bit of time. The previous Badger 5, from then same manufacturer, developed cracks early in its life and spewed water all over the place. This 750 model appears to be much better constructed and extremely quiet. Highly recommended!",

Installing it was super quick (item DOES NOT come with plumber putty!) and the improvement is VERY obvious - it runs faster, the water flow is so much better. The unit also comes with a manufacturer 6 year warranty. Highly recommended.",
