I ended up spraying the rail/perch with canola oil and now the squirrels fall off; so I guess the small problem has been solved.",

What was once a very pretty bronze finish quickly became extremely weathered (from very little bad weather, I might add), dull, bare metal finish. It's no longer smooth and difficult to clean, as the rough texture \"grabs\" bird poop and won't let go. Stains VERY easily, so any poop that hits it will leave a stain. This has resulted in a very splotchy, dull, ugly finish. I'm just waiting for the roof to begin to corrode.",

The seed tray has a smaller diameter than the roof top. And, the larger overhead of the roof top usually keeps the seed dry in the tray when it rains. Finally, the perch surrounding the circular tray enables several birds to feed at the same time. The Panorama Bird Feeder is our favorite.",

They have enjoyed it from the start this morning & have been visiting all day & will likely drain the feeder by the end of the day. I didn't fill it all the way but put in about 3 cups worth of seed. The bigger birds can't hang on to this which is why I got it. The bigger birds can use the trough feeders, thus leaving this great feeder for all the little ones. It's a medium size to me, not small, not large but just right. I'm really glad I bought it & super glad Amazon sent it so quickly!",

    "description": "The Perky-Pet Small Panorama Wild Bird Feeder is sure to attract many birds to your backyard, including cardinals, titmice, nuthatches and more. The innovative design of this feeder allows the seed to dispense into the tray and stops dispensing once the tray is full. Simply fill with sunflower seed, mixed seed, or any other kind of bird seed. Then, as the birds dine from the circular perch, the seed is replenished into the tray so it remains consistently full. This feeder also features the Sure-Lock cap system, an exclusive squirrel-resistant feature, which ensures the lid stays put and so squirrels have a difficult time gaining access to the seed. Use the built-in hanging cable to place this feeder anywhere around your yard. The Small Panorama holds 2 lb of seed and features a rustic brown finish to blend with your outdoor d\u00e9cor. Remember to clean your wild bird feeders every two weeks with a mild soap and water solution.",
