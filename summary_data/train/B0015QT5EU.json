After 1+ year using prednisone, and various otc drugs, someone suggested using this oil. Within one week her hair started growing in thicker, and within 2 months (the worst summer ever with allergies) she was no longer licking, biting, chewing herself. Her coat is wonderfully thick and soft and I can only imagine what it did for her insides. Can't say enough about this product.",
