These are the perfect size to fill up all treat dispensing toys and carry for walks and training exercises. I personally wouldn't pay more than $7.99/bag for the 6oz bag. I've seen it go as low as $4.99 but it's been a while since the price dropped that low. It's worth scouting and keeping an eye on it since sometimes the price shoots way up! Found my review helpful?

These are tiny pellets, white in color and have no discernable smell. The bag holds quite a few because they're tiny but pack a lot of flavor, if you believe my dogs. They break up quite easily, with very little pressure so even my toothless dog can eat them. If these were cheaper I would buy them as treats.",
