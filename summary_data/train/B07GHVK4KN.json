But there is 1 problem, games that use Unreal Engine can't quite keep up with this card. Yes, you heard me correct. This card is so advanced that games using Unreal engine will crash. In order to fix this I had to underclock my card. And 1 warning to those who buy this card, the fans will not run until the card reaches 60C. In theory this is good, but sometimes the fans just won't run even over 60C. You have to install a driver only for this card to take that setting off, NVIDIA Precision.",

There is no way to sync the lighting with other (non-EVGA) devices. The white color is also a dull blue. The actual Lighting is from what appears to be one or two LEDs at on edge of the fans.
