Along with the key fob attachment, the inner bag has several compartments- one with a zipper and two on the other side of the bag with a snap fob type closure. The bag was well protected while shipping and arrived along with a dust cover and registration material.I ordered the olive color for fall. Can't wait to get another color when spring/summer arrives!",

Wallet is beautiful & fits all my cards etc. very happy with the price because even after searching around Amazon was still the best price! My first DB bag & the style, color & quality exceeded my expectations!",
