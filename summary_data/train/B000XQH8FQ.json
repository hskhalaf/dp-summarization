And I'm not a dealer so no telling how much cost and time all of that would end up being. In the meantime my only option is to buy a new pitch back or use small universal bungee cords that are not the right tension and do not support the net properly. Poor customer service and poor product.",

It\u2019s too light weight for the heavy basketball and the force of a pass into it, so I\u2019d say use it for a rebounder. Probably works great w baseball/softballs though I have not tried. Fairly easy to assemble. I will bring inside after reading other reviews as I think the bands would deteriorate over time in the elements.",

      "text": "This pitch back is just the thing for lacrosse practice for my 8-year-old grandson, not to mention Dad and Grandpa are having a ball with it too. Pitch back is solidly built and well balanced, returns thrown balls very well. Tilting top part is just what I was looking for in this type of item. Neighbor has something similar for his baseball-playing son, but the top part is stationary. Instead of spending $100 up past $200 for a lacrosse bounce back, this fits the bill quite nicely for a fraction of the cost. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to have some practice with the pitch back so that the grandson doesn't make me look bad!",
