Fortunately, things like this are easy to fix and I suppose its good to have plastic so you dont deal with rust. I mostly bought this due to its size. Its the right size for a spa type set up and every store I went to only carried full sized pool nets. This is about 24'' high so keep that in mind. Overall it was a good product for me.",

    "description": "Swimline is a family owned and operated business founded in 1971 and is the leading manufacturer of high quality pool products. At its inception, Swimline was the largest manufacturer of in-ground and above-ground pool liners, covers, and all related accessories. In 1990, Swimline founded International Leisure Products, which expanded the product line to pool toys, games, fun floats and accessories. With this vast array of pool products, Swimline continued to deliver on the needs of its reputable business partners to provide quality products. Four years later, in 1994, Swimline acquired United Leisure Industries HydroTools , which allowed the company to manufacture traditional pool accessories such as leaf skimmers, pool filters, and a wide range of maintenance equipment to keep pools in top shape. HydroTools furthers our commitment to supplying quality products to the pool trade.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThis is a premium aluminum handle spa skimmer head.",
