The countless hours of enjoyment (and re-grinding after my PS3 got hosed...) were well worth the cost of a brand new game. Fun gameplay, easy-to-learn system, achievements and GUNS; what more could you ask for? If you're all-thumbs though, beware. My brother, while drunk, is more accurate than I am while *incredibly* sober using a PS3 controller. I'm fine on a mouse though! Go figure... I'd recommend all of the Borderlands games, especially BL2.",

Please play the first one too :) for your own sake not mine. Its better in my opinion. Plus this game is a sequel of the first. (Just saying ;)) Both good games but this is a nice set and would be much more appreciated as such. That said, its a cool game , especially for you and a buddy or two to pack 20-40 hours into .",

This is one of those games that you can get lost in, spend hours and hours playing (all the while neglecting food, water, bathroom breaks, etc.) and still never lose the fun. The multiplayer brings this game to a whole new level (that is if you have friends) and the True Vault Hunter Mode makes the second (or third, or fourth, or fifth) playthrough just as fun if not more fun than the first! From the comic storyline to the bazillions of badass weapons, this game deserves a 6 star rating. BUY THIS GAME. Even if you don't have a PS3, just buy this game to bask in the glory of Borderlands 2.",

They were the first (to my knowledge) to do a hybrid of 3 genres successfully-action/adventure, first person shooter and role playing game. I loved Borderlands and couldn't wait for Borderlands 2. I waited to review this until I had finished the first play through. I love this game. I like the new characters, the new landscapes to see, the different creatures and more of the story. I highly recommend this sequel!!!!",

Some interesting new characters, classes and locations keep things fresh however you'll soon find, once again, that it's all about the guns...lots and lots of guns. Ultimately not too difficult to solo on your own but the multiplayer element is where it's at. Great fun to be had in groups although soured a little by the open loot system. All in all a fantastic game.",

Music in the environments while running around is awesome and the inside jokes pulled from pop-culture and everything will guarantee a good chuckle or two. Not sure if I'll get the DLC's, but the game on its own will guarantee you a good time worth your dime.",

It's laugh out loud funny, provides diverse enemies, landscapes, and weapons, and really fun skill trees that exceed the first game in every possible way.",

The variety of guns in this game, the art style, the bosses and enemies, and the characters are all fantastic. The co-op is fun as well. The only minor flaw I have in this game is that sometimes the enemies can be way too strong for your level, of course, this leads to grinding, which can be a bit of a pain. But once you find that perfect weapon or reach that high level, it's all major fun from there",
