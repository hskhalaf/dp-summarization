Cons: manual is unbelievably unhelpful, as another reviewer mentioned. Almost a caricature of lousy translated pamphlets. The shipping and inner box were in the worst shape I've ever received in years of ordering online. I was concerned that the keyboard might have been damaged, but it was unblemished and seems to work fine.",

And the space between the v and b keys is very wide, so for touch typing it\u2019s a real problem - it\u2019s a huge reach across the hinge. So I guess given that it was 1/3 the price of the Logi keyboard I shouldn\u2019t expect too much. But it\u2019s embarrassing in business meetings to be making so much noise.",
