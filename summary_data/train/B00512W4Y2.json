      "text": "This keyboard is perfect for the iPad2. It's made of aluminum, closes over the face of the iPad when not in use (puts iPad to sleep), and is a well-balanced platform for iPad use when not on a table or desk. I was afraid the keyboard would be too small to use effectively since it's the same width as the iPad, but it operates flawlessly. It's SOOOO much easier to type with this than using the on-screen keyboard. Five stars! Excellenet product. PS - terrific battery life as well.",

Two cons: The lip on the front edge of the keyboard can bite into your wrist as your typing which I really disliked. Also, the iPad didn't attach to the case which meant that it was hard to use the keyboard when it was balanced on your lap. When I broke this one, I moved to a ClamCase which I find to be worth the additional money.",
