I took it to a repair show, where I was told the screen had clearly been previously replaced (now that I look I can see that the screen is slightly raised on one end) and that the previous damage done was probably the reason the phone is now malfunctioning. This is pretty disappointing considering I paid for a 'new' phone. Awaiting news on a refund.",

They wanted to give me a \u00a315 partial refund after I moaned a bit. Nice one, it cost more like \u00a3100 for a new battery. Not really acceptable condition if it turns off is it. I wouldn't go for the \u00a3140 option from these guys. Maybe the 190 but remember they seem to think intermittent faults are something the customer should put up with.",

I bought it in November 2017 for \u00a3600 and now in October 2019 the battery is so unreliable it can cut out at any moment even if it's at 50%. At such a high price it's shameful that it doesn't even last two years. Unfortunately because I bought it on Amazon I don't think Google will help me so I've learned my mistake and will not buy a phone on Amazon again.",
