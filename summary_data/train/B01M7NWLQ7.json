The packaging was very well done but I could not stop my savage ways and I viciously tore it open. I must admit that as soon as I opened the box, I nearly fainted. The 12s were laying in there, so mezmerising and authentic. Pictures do not capture all their beauty in my opinion. As I am sitting typing this review on my smart phone, I am also currently picking out a honey moon suite for me and my 12s \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude0d",
