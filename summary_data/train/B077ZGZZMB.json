Just set it up in the grass, pull the plug when you're done, and carry it to it's storage spot in the garage. Easy peasy. Also possibly worth noting, step 2 offers replacement accessory kits for this and other water tables. Our daughter loved the bucket this came with which somehow got misplaced. I placed an order with step 2 for a replacement kit for another water table that had the bucket and a few new toys too.",

It was probably the easiest thing I've ever put together too (with the exception of the water toy that has the two purple pieces). The screws were hiding with the rubber duck in case anyone else is looking for them. It would be nice if the water toys snapped into place. But she enjoys moving them around. The plastic tub seems a little flimsier than the other step 2 products I've had in the past. The drain plug is a solid plus though and overall it's a decent table for the price. Just a few design flaws that bother me more than the kid.",
