It took several months and emails to get the company to respond to the claim so I decided to buy from another company rather than try again.",

It worked well enough, but after a while one of the batteries died in it, and positioning the Wiimotes on the pad could be fussy. This on the other hand is a dual holster that holds them securely. The batteries certainly last long enough for a few hours' play. This one I can recommend.",

We now use this one because the other died, and this takes up less space. We also leave the protective cases on half way and still plug them into the charger. In the end the real test for this will be battery life, will these last for 2 plus years like the last on did? We will see.",
