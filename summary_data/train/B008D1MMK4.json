Before I decided to just get it I was concerned that it wouldn't be the best for quality because of the low price compared to others. I mean it is going to hold my $900.00 projector about 6ft in the air... BUT I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. Was pretty easy to install and love the adjustability. Only issue I had was the arms that connect to the projector were a little finicky to adjust right, but I have an older projector and the mount points are not in the best position. Over all I would suggest this one, and price was great!",

I had my fun trying different variations of the bracket. It is not hard to figure out. Comes with a ton of hardware to make it work with whatever you have. Easy to adjust where you need it and hides cables really well. Very durable and sturdy.",

After tightening down the adjustments, there still could be some movement, but honestly, once you get it set up, nothing shouldn't be touching it allowing to to move.

If that piece fails, and some reviews show it has; your entire projector comes crashing to the ground. No catch, no safety, nothing.",

If you dont have lens shift I would probably suggest getting a projector with better fine tuning ability. This will move in all directions but very hard to fine tune. For that I give it 4 stars",
