Keen has a really great wide toe box design for many for their shoes and boots but unfortunately these do not have that specific design. It's a real subtle design but one that makes it extremely comfortable for those with a wide toe area. It would be nice of Keen to mention this in their description for the different shoes. It almost makes a form fit around your toes area. The Presidio shoes are an example of this. Other than this problem for me, they are the usual Keen sturdy hikers. I'll wear them for shorter hikes or walks only.",

I could always depend on them to be a comfortable and supportive shoe for hiking/walking; I've logged many miles in them. The most recently ordered pair however, were a HUGE disappointment. The sole is so stiff, it feels as if I'm walking on a concrete platform. I thought I was getting a leather upper, and was dismayed to see that the interior of the boot has the words \"guaranteed waterproof\" written all over it (translation \"vinyl\"). I wondered if Keen is still the same company it's been, or perhaps a change in ownership has taken place?",

Not wanting to get a blister under my toe nail, I returned the boot and replaced it with a size 8. In hindsight this wasn't a good decision as the boot stretched out quite a bit, such that my foot slipped around so much I got a blister. Bottom line is the length of the shoe was probably fine but the width was too loose in the bigger size when the shoe loosened up.",

      "text": "This is my second pair of Targhee II hikers, and what I received is *not* what was pictured in the Amazon listing OR what I own. The cut is different, there's no top lace anchor, the toe guard is shorter, and the ankle opening is wider. The photo on the listing is identical to my original Targhee IIs, but the pair I got looks like the Targhee III, which is a cheaper model. This will be the last time I buy something like this from Amazon - I'd rather go straight to the manufacturer, even if it's more expensive. At least they'll get it right.",

I work in a warehouse and walk about twelve miles a day so needed a pair of boots that would be comfortable, provide ankle support and last for a while. There was zero break in period which was fantastic. These boots are lightweight and very comfortable. If I have one complaint it is that the laces are just a tad too short. I like to double knot them to make sure they stayed tied and the laces are about two inches too short to easily do this.",
