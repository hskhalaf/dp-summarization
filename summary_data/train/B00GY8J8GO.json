It snaps together quite firmly when you're assembling it, but it is much easier to install since it is seatbelt based rather than 'latch' system. It still provides the side impact of the regular car seats for kids as it has the upper 'wings' but is much more lightweight and great for a spare. It's still really big for traveling though, so you would have to either send it on its own in oversized luggage or you could remove the upper back and just travel with the seat booster.",

Head/neck support area could stand to be modified to facilitate better sleeping positions (at least from a parent's perspective); children have no complaints about the cervical/neck component/area, and they have never expressed development of a sore neck from the way they have to sleep.

You can move it easily between vehicles, there are 2 cup holders that can be hidden away, and the back height is also adjustable for a very tall child which I appreciate having birthed two very tall children.

After much consultation between my son and myself, we realized that the \"extra\" strap is to be used when the unit is used as a booster seat - WITHOUT THE BACK on it.

This uses the vehicle's seatbelt and does not click into the child restraining systems. This seat is a high back booster. Very easy to remove from the vehicle since it's not attached. You should be familiar with your state laws regarding child restraining.",

Added up over time I could use those extra minutes spending more time writing reviews on Amazon.",
