But as another reviewer pointed out, your headboard needs to be very high in order for the lamp to be elevated above your head while reading. As pictured, the lamp hangs several inches below the hooks which are draped over the top of the headboard, so on a standard-sized headboard (one high enough to allow your pillows to be placed upright for reclining), the bottom of the lamp falls below one's head and into the pillows, rendering it useless. Cute lamp, good price, needs more work on design.",
