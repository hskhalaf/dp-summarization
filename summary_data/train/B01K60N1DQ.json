      "text": "Purchased this unit after hurricane Maria and it has been an immense help this past month. It's practically dummy proof, we power phones, tablets and can sleep at night with a fan (in the tropical heat). I am also able to run a load of laundry in a 170 watt portable washer!. It's also lightweight enough to take wherever I need to power something, so I don't worry about how to carry it up the stairs, so thumbs up. I also purchased the extra warranty but haven't heard anything from those guys after trying to contact them, so the jury is out on that part.",

My dad suffers from sleep apnea, and the Phoenix helped him sleep well at night. I believe the Renogy Phoenix is very convenient given the fact that it provides multiple out ports and it provides power both in AC or DC format. Overall, it is not cheap generator but I recommend it, J. Moreno",

As it is, I've kept the original packaging (which also has a handle on it) in order to keep the cables in one place with the charging unit. Not a big enough gripe to subtract a star.

      "text": "My family and I use our Phoenix Generator when we vacation at our rustic, electricity-free, running water-free cottage in Ontario, Canada. Our cottage is a 20 minute boat ride and another 30 minute drive to the nearest town/conveniences. Having the back-up of the Phoenix has drastically eased our minds in the event of an inevitable emergency. Our Phoenix has proven to be durable, dependable and extremely user friendly. It is certainly a treat to be able to charge our phones, inflate air mattresses and use CPAP machines, without the guilt of harming the environment. I highly recommend this product to any nature enthusiast looking for a lightweight, powerful and clean way to stay charged!",

The PV input cable that came with it appears to plug into to Renogy 100W solar panel I also purchased to go with it. If there were one improvement I would suggest is an integrated box (preferably removable) to store the cables that come with it. Since it is meant to be portable, this would help to keep all of the needed components together.",

I haven't had a chance to charge it via solar yet, that is my next step, but for now, I'm a very happy camper.",
