This battery has three prongs; my HPB18-OPE 18v batteries have only 2 prongs. I did notice this difference in the pictures, but believed the description stating they would replace them.

This is harassment that needs to stop. I\u2019m not selling out my integrity for $30, so quit asking me to remove my fair and accurate review!!!! The product description is completely inaccurate; these do NOT replace black and decker HPB18-OPE! I wish I would have read the other reviews first. Look at the comparison picture and you can see the extra prong that prevents it from fitting in my weed whacker and hedge trimmer.",

These batteries have over double the amp hour capacity of the Black&Decker batteries, Topbatt @ 3600 mah vs B&D @ 1500 mah, this gives the tool a much longer work time and power, all at roughly half the cost! They charge on my original B&D charger and I am using them on the Blower, Hedge Trimmer, and String Trimmer. Note: B&D's Lithium Ion 20 volt batteries are not compatible with the 18 volt tool line so this is this is great way to upgrade your tools performance, Wish I had found these sooner!",
