The charging pad got hot enough to discolor and put a shine under the phone. Charger still works and phone but apparent lack of internal heat regulation on the charger allowed enough heat build up to discolor the charging pad. Do not use with rubber case covers and discount the value of thermal protection.",

The product has a relatively small footprint and it can fit pretty anywhere. I wanted this product to charge my new AirPods and iPhone XS. So far, it does what it\u2019s supposed to, it wireless charges my AirPods case and phone. Unfortunately it warms up my phone and AirPods case too much. It\u2019s a very noticeable thing. I am not sure if this is normal or not or if it will be a detriment to the batteries.",
