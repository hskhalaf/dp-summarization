Then my dad tried it and pulled his hand out yelling that it was scalding and too hot. Temperature appears to be an individual preference. I have noticed that if you wait a half hour or so after the light is green the temperature seems cooler. If you like hot use as soon as the light is green, otherwise be patient a little while.",
