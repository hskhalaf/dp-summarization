      "text": "I wanted an iPad case that was the total package when connected, making it into a laptop replacement, and this case more than satisfies that requirement. I love the full-size keyboard and the fact that because the two when joined are rather heavy, I can easily strip the iPad right out of it for regular usage. Also, I received this january 20th, and with only occasional use (which is what I intended it for), have only charged it once right after I got it. Still on its first charge cycle and it now April 28!!",

I only put it in if I'm going to be doing significant typing. My only real gripe is that the right-hand space bar is temperamental. If I don't hit it just right it either doesn't insert a space, or inserts 2. Why didn't I return it? Because this was the second one I bought and the first one usually couldn't make the blue tooth connection. I didn't want to return another one.",

The keyboard folds up into a slim package on the back of the iPad, so that with a Smart Cover on the front, my iPad is protected from blows from all directions.

It's also really expensive, in itself and compared to other keyboards out there -- keyboards which DO protect the screen.
