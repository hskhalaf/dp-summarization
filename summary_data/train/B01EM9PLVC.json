The ear cooling technology was good but that\u2019s really the only good thing about it, the surround sound wasn\u2019t as good as I believe it should have been. Was really underwhelming and imo opinion really not worth the price, go and buy the Turtle beach stealth 600 or 700 it\u2019s around half the price and just as good, it\u2019s even wireless. Returned the product and got a full refund.",

Sadly though, since Windows 10 build 1903 it has been limited to stereo PCM, making the surround modes ineffective. Essentially it is now as much use as a chocolate fireguard. Turtle Beach are aware of the problem and have done nothing to resolve it. They haven't even attempted to write their own driver to replace the generic MS one.",

I've currently bundled the headset with my Astro a40 TR Mixamp and this I find to be the best combo so far! If the TAC had the option to be able to tweak the EQ settings manually via the software then I'm sure I'd use the TAC with the headset instead of the Mixamp from astro. Overall solid product, but could use a little more customization on the EQ.",

Well worth the extra bit of money, I had trouble finding any information on this product and if it it does actually work so hopefully this will shed some light for someone! Great seller!",

While the rotating hinges seem to be metal, the headband is plastic, and broke at the attachment point. Additionally, shortly after purchase, the volume wheel stopped going to \"100%\", instead going to \"100% left channel\" when pushed past 98%. The control layout is worse than competitive Sennheiser headsets, which put the mute switch in the microphone stalk, and the volume on the other earpiece. The sizing is poor, unsuited for larger heads or hats. The earpiece covers seem un-removable for cleaning, and lastly, while the drivers deliver decent sound, the headset itself is unduly heavy.",

Like an audio mixer that connects to the headset to adjust the volume. The headset is good for those with hearing loss or wear hearing aids just like me.

My only problem, was that I couldn't hear footsteps or direction or the footsteps in H1Z1 KotK. I currently use the Turtle Beach Stealth 500P and that is significantly more clear as to sound quality, and direction in which the footsteps are coming from. On PS4 however, the headset performed phenomenally. 5 stars if you're going to use it on there. However being a mainly PC gamer, not being able to hear footsteps very well in a battle royal game is crucial so keep that in mind",

As for the sound it's great unless you tend to use the tactical sound card then go all in. Microphone from what I'm told sounds crisp no issues with the mic whatsoever. It's pricey of course, however I always put out if the price is good and the quality is good.",

Stay away from this headset as I see many more people having problems with it as well. Not to also mention the very limited options of volume control and muting. That\u2019s it.
