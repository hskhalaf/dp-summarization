      "text": "This high chair is weirdly designed. The base itself is sturdy but the frame for the seat is flimsy. The joints connecting the frame are loose and riveted so you can\u2019t simply tighten them. The chair part sits onto a plastic piece that is connected to the base and one of the plastic pieces won\u2019t click into the base so it sits crooked. Also the tray doesn\u2019t sit level, the whole frame leans forward when the tray is on. Purchased for my two year old daughter to accessorize her baby alive doll. The pattern is cute and matches her stroller that was purchased separately. Im not pleased with this purchase considering the price and the flimsy awkward design.",

It\u2019s not a typical buckle or velcro. The seat cover makes the baby not sit up, it\u2019s an incline and the baby falls out. It appears the seat cover may be too small for the chair making it impossible for the baby to sit in the chair properly.",

Im probably going to crazy glue it because its very annoying. The tray table slants so the food slips right off, cheap plastic. The whole thing is pretty cheaply made tbh:( got it for my 4 year old for her birthday, i mean we kept it because it said baby alive, other then that i probably should have returned it. I would definitely recommend getting a wooden one for your baby dolls.",
