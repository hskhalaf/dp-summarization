There is NO WAY I would put these in my ears. I don't know what's going on here, but it's not good. Buyer beware!",

Save your money and either buy the blue version or a different brand because these are a complete waste of money which is sad because I know own 100pairs of completely useless earplugs",

    "description": "Did you know that the first foam ear plugs were \u201cbarrel and blunt\u201d shaped and made of polyvinyl chloride. While these ear plugs achieved noise reduction ratings as high as 29 decibels, the dense foam could be challenging to roll for proper insertion as well as fit and the coarse surface of the ear plugs could feel rather abrasive against the thin inner lining of the ear canal. Foam ear plugs took a quantum leap forward with the advent of polyurethane ear plugs as this material offer a significantly enhanced user experience with low pressure foam that was easy to roll, tapered tip designs that more were more comfortable, provided high protection levels, silky smooth surfaces and certified noise reduction ratings as high as 33 decibels. With the HEAROS Ultimate Softness Series, you can experience the highest levels of protection, comfort, fit and ease of insertion of any foam ear plug available. Upon touching the extraordinary softness of these foam ear plugs you will immediately recognize the premium nature of the product. Thanks to HEAROS proprietary foam formulation these ear plugs roll down and \u201cslowly recover\u201d giving you plenty of time to properly position them in your ears. So whether you\u2019re using the HEAROS for noise reduction or hearing protection, you now can have complete confidence that you\u2019re using the best ear plugs for your ears. The ear plugs have been tested and certified to provide a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 32 decibels. HEAROS foam ear plugs are to be used for all noise reduction and hearing protection purposes.",
