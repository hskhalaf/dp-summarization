      "verdict": "Inov-8 expands the range of choices for runners in the X-Talon series by introducing the 225. It is built for the fast runner for fell or mountain running. The shoe stands out in the mud, grass, and rock. Obstacle course racers also get another very solid option in this shoe. At a very reasonable price, runners can get unbelievable traction, excellent responsiveness, water-repellent coverage, and decent arch support. Running on rugged and extremely challenging terrain should be quite fun in this shoe.",

      "text": "Ran my first cross country in them this morning and they were great. Really grippy on the slippy mud, secure on compacted gravel and comfortable on the tarmac. Some reviewers advised getting half a size larger due to the toe area being fairly small - I did not find this to be the case after I followed this advice and wish I hadn't - I got a 9.5 but a 9 would have fitted much better. My feet are definitely not narrow so you might want to order your actual size and see if they are too tight for you and exchange for a bigger size if required.",
