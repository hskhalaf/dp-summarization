Everyone should have one, I even have had friends order the same product....but now a replacement bag costs half as much as the $60 I paid for the whole thing. I am disappointed that the replacement bag cost is so unreasonable, when it only lasts for s few uses.",

To suck up the pine needles I only use half of the vacuum attachment. I find that if I use both pieces I don't get as good suction. But for dried leaves it's great.

I'm getting too old to be risking a fall by going up on the roof. The blower has several speeds which is helpful sometimes when you don't want to use a single high speed that most other units come with.",

I find this new one to be awkward and super heavy - perhaps this is due to the metal impeller but it will make you make you work hard to get the job done. Switching from blowing to vacuuming is also more cumbersome than on the old one (many pieces have to snap together and they don't fit well). They (0pd and new)seem to have the same amount of power to blow or vacuum. If you are a small or older person with limited upper body strength this may not be a good choice for you.",

If you have a pile of leaves, you pretty much need to pick each leaf one by one off the pile. You spend more time pushing the leaves into the chute than vacuuming.

It's got alot of power, blows the leaves like you wouldn't believe. It's pretty light. I'm not very big (130 lbs, 5'3\" ) and I think it easy to handle. The kids use it also. I'm so glad I went for the electric, the gas ones are heavy and too expensive, plus I'd rather just plug in and go.",

I tryed it with a 10v cord after I used it with a 12v and instantly felt the power drop. The vacuum system work well( not great with wet leafs)as long as you only have leafs it won't handle pine cones well which you shouldn't try to shred anyway. I cleared my wet drive way in no time with this compared to my old battry ryubi blower. I'm really happy with this blower and if you can deal with the power cord you won't be disappointed.",
