She would eat half of one, or bite it off, then just spit it out and then throw it away, no bueno. Days of half-eaten pellets sitting in her bowl. I thought she wasn't hungry but it was the ingredients, she doesn't like soybean oil or other things inside the cheaper pellets, she has a very delicate digestive system. She gets sick from sugar or bad treats so I have to be careful. This is more expensive for sure, but she eats a whole bowl in one night!",

It's not good to switch food on them; their digestive systems don't handle it well. Mazuri used to be extremely hard to find: not online and not at a local pet stores. We had to special order it from a feed store in a 20lb bag. We ended up wasting most of it, because it should be used within 6 weeks of opening for maximum nutrition. However the 20lb bag did only cost $18, so this price is definitely more per lb, but much easier to get and currently available through Subscribe and Save.",
