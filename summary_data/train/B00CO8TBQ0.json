The only suggestion I have is that you buy your own beatsink and thermal paste. With a Hyper 212 Plus and Arctic Silver 5, this thing rarely reaches 50\u00b0C. For the price, this is very good.",

The others are usually about 52-54\u00b0C which is acceptable in a local room temperature of 37-38\u00b0C! Am about to try a better Conductive paste when it arrives from the US. My pc runs 24 hours non stop every day on essential work and has to be both fast and reliable, the 4700K achieves the speed I require.",

I have to say it is much faster than an equivelent AMD, so the choice is yours - pay the extra get the extra performance or pay less and get average performance.",

    "description": "Style Name:Version with fan\n\nIntel's 4th gen processor codename: Haswell offers superior performance over the previous generation Ivybridge by up to 10% clock for clock. This astounding performance boost results in performance improvements in multi-tasking, encoding, gaming and multithreaded applications. Intel's 4th generation processor has improved PCI-Lane 3.0 bandwidth which helps further boost performance of latest generation 3 graphics cards for the ultimate gaming experience.\n\nFor overclocking enthusiasts, Intel's 4th gen CPU has improved memory overclocking support, with up to and beyond 3000MHz possible with the very best memory kits. Memory bandwidth is critically important to Haswell compared to previous generations. High frequency memory performance significantly improves encoding, gaming and benchmarking tasks.\n\nThe biggest leap in Intel's Haswell processor is the on-board graphics which is now up to 2.6x faster than previous HD4000 found in the Ivybridge CPU. What this means is these latest processors can actually play the latest games in HD with low/medium settings applied.
