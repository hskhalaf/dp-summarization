We normally wear the booties; however, they are dangerous, inconvenient, and do not last long. I love the Tidy Trax and my customers think \"they are neat.\" In my case the between size ended up being the smaller option of \"Kc rather than\" L.\" Better that they stay on my feet than come off all of the time. I do take them off on stairs and ladders and the customers understand. Can't recommend enough.",

    "description": "Size:JAMAZON.COM\nKeep dirt and debris where it belongs with Tidy Trax \"Hands-Free\" Shoe Covers. These lightweight, durable, and flexible covers quickly slide over your boots or shoes to envelop dirty soles and help keep floors clean. Ideal for gardeners, construction workers, or anyone who works outside, these shoe covers eliminate time-consuming cleanup and make it easy to go in and out of the house without making a mess.\n\n\n\nEasy-to-Use Shoe Covers Stop Dirt in Its Tracks\nWhether you're a gardener or contractor, you don't want to track your mess indoors. Thankfully, with Tidy Trax shoe covers, it's quick and easy to prevent tracks. Simply insert your grimy shoes toe-first into the shoe covers and push your heels down. The covers' molded fingers firmly grip your shoes and keep them in position. To take off Tidy Trax, step on the heel kicker and lift your heel--there's no need to bend over or sit down to take them off or put them on.Durable, Easy-to-Clean Material\nTidy Trax lightweight, sturdy shoe covers are designed for daily use. They're made of molded EVA foam and won't scratch or harm floors. The extended heel kickers are reinforced with heavy-duty TPU plastic, and the inserts are molded fingers that grip your shoes to help them stay in place. To quickly and easily remove mud and grime from your Tidy Trax, grab a hose and give the shoe covers a blast of water. For dried-on dirt, clap the covers together to loosen and remove the debris.\n\n Find the Perfect Fit\nTidy Trax sizing is determined by \"shoe length\"--NOT shoe size. To find the shoe cover that fits you best, measure the sole of your shoe from heel to toe, and then compare the length to the Tidy Trax size chart. Tidy Trax come in 12 convenient sizes that approximately fit men's shoe sizes 6 to 14 and women's shoe sizes 4 to 11.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nOne pair of Tidy Trax Hands-Free Shoe Covers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nTidy Trax are the amazing HANDS FREE shoe covers that allow a person to go indoors with dirty shoes on without leaving a single messy footprint. Not only do they eliminate making muddy tracks, they also eliminate the need to bend over to put them on or take them off. They are lightweight, durable, and wont mark or harm floors. Tidy Trax can also be used outdoors to keep nice shoes from getting dirty. The tub-like design helps keep the dirt and debris inside while walking indoors. This also works to protect clean shoes from getting dirty while walking outside in the elements. The rubber fingers are what holds Tidy Trax to your shoes. They flex just enough to let you in but are strong enough to hold on extremely well. The heel kicker on the back is what allow you to remove your Tidy Trax without bending over or using your hands.
