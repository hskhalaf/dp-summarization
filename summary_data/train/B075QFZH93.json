I don't anticipate having to use it now that i have the three charging cables, but i have it attached to my keys in the event it ever is needed. it also fits snug when i tested it out.",

Sometimes it will charge correctly, but other times it will only slow charge (I am using a fast charging USB plug btw, so it is definitely the cable that is the issue). The other issue is that it's not a very tight fit into the port. It comes unplugged easily, and wiggles a bit while plugged in (which concerns me, as I don't want it to loosen/damage my phone port over time). Overall, the cord itself seems durable, but there is a bit of false advertising regarding the charging speed. And the loose fit is a real deal killer.",

      "text": "Gone through a number of these USB-C cables in the recent past and there are soooo many cheap ones out there, even ones that look good. Got some that looked like quality, but lasted about 10 connect and disconnect cycles. The problem was that the vendor (wasn't on Amazon) refused to give me a full refund, even though all 3 cables I bought ended up in the trash. I'm using one of these cables right now that's been connected a lot of times and still works perfectly. There's a difference between junk and quality. In this case, it wasn't the price. Highly recommended so far!",

      "text": "The cable appears to be of good quality and I like the built-in elastic cable wrap that comes with it. Only complaints are: - This is not a \"Turbo Charging\" cable - at least not for my Motorola Z2 - and other third party sellers have managed this capability, but not this cable. - It's a little stiff and does not conform around objects on its own - it requires some force. Otherwise, charging time is faster than many other cables I've used, and at this price point, they're a good deal that will NOT be returned. Thank you.",

I was going to return them however I found they were still useful at a slower charging rate and to transfer via cable to a computer.",

I tested another of the cables to see if one of them was \"bad.\" But both cables charged much slower than the original cable.

Very flexible and \"snaps\" into the phone when fully inserted. Would buy again and would recommend.",
