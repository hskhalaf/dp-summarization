When you use the brush attachment as it heats up drying your hair the plastic part of the brush heats and expands and falls off the main unit and makes it useless until the main unit cools by the next day and then the same thing happens again. The only solution is using heavy duty rubber bands to hold the brush to the main unit and they regularly wear out. Hopefully Conair will read this review and solve the problem",

However, the biggest problem by far is the noise. This dryer is LOUD. Loud enough to wear earplugs! After a few week of use it got even louder. Sounds like a plane taking off. Very annoying and it will keep me from buying this product again.",

It is usually the only thing I need to fix my hair, no curling irons or straightening irons, unless I want to do something extra special or different. My one complaint and the reason for not giving it a 5 star is that they do wear out after a couple of years and have to be replaced. But they aren't too expensive. And I would be lost without mine!",

Unfortunately, in under one week of use, it sounds like something internal (can't be seen) has come loose and is banging when the dryer is turned on. It has gone from a normal hairdryer roar to sounding like a lawnmower, which is quite disconcerting when being used beside one's head. Like many others, I use this kind of dryer to straighten my hair; unfortunately, the brush attachment falls off s soon as the dryer warms, rendering it totally useless. Sorry Conair, this dryer is a colossal fail.",

But the dryer is very heavy and the brush (not round) is huge. It may be fine for someone with long hair, but not for me. I tried it several times, but it was just too clumsy to manage. I ended up not bringing it at all. This will end up being given away.",
