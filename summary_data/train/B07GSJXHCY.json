Guess what, my lovelies? Two-weeks into my ownership with some light mall walking in these bad boys and the sole started separating from the uppers. I've kept wearing them, now at 8 months, but I've had to use contact cement to try to keep the soles from looking super sloppy. Still, they just don't look great--almost as if some Chinese sweatshop kids put them together. Probably because they did. Disappointed!!",

If you are someone who hates a \"dirty\" white shoe than choose a different Frye style. Frye Walker tennis shoe line has an awesome solid white shoe. Has a consistent white finish. Fits very well and extra soft feel. An amazing shoe too.",

I'm not crazy about leather laces but that can easily be rectified when needed. They did come with white wax covered laces to change up the look. These are my first leather fashion sneakers and I'm pretty impressed. The price is great for what you're getting. Totally worth every penny. Highly recommended.",

The leather is high quality and takes a bit to break in, but the shoes are comfortable and built to last. I did switch out the laces with something thinner and blue to add some contrasting color for fun and they look great. The shoes are a little more brown in real life than they are grey in the photos, but the color is a rich blend of grey-brown.",
