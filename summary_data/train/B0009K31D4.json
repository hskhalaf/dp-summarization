Pieces fit together easily and gears turn without a struggle. The kids are able to take everything apart and build their own jungles without a breaking the pieces or becoming frustrated they are stuck together. There are enough pieces in the set for them to play and build their own stuff without a fight over parts. Toy encourages imagination through engineering everything with the gears to move together. If you have kids under 5 I highly recommend this!",

He is always playing and intermingling his gears and making what he likes to call his Gear cities. I have done a lot of research on toys and this has been an awesome find for me and my family. I definitely recommend purchasing the gears for your little ones because not only are they safe but a learning tool for them.",

They can also follow the instructions to create using a plan or just free-build. Either way there are hours of enjoyment from this product. The addition of the monkeys and vines really enhance the experience. Parts are durable and easy to use. With very little instruction even young children can begin to build.",

Monkeys hang from their hands or tail on the palm trees, vine, or each other and can even move down the length of a spiral building piece when the gears turn. Newcomers to these gear-shaped blocks may need to refer to instructions the first time they play with this toy\u2014especially for details on how the palm trees fit together. The manufacturer\u2019s targeted beginning age is four years old, but we recommend starting at six after observing younger children having difficulty constructing the palm trees and inadvertently knocking them over. The 103 pieces include the building platform, gears, cranks, palm tree components, vines, and monkeys. --Cristina Vaamonde\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThere's nothing like monk eying around to get creativity flowing!
