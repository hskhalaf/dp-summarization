Assembly was simple enough, and the starter pulls easily and has started first pull every time. For a no-frills, budget mower I couldn't ask for more.",

The one thing that detracts from it is the difficulty in adjusting the height of the cut. I like to raise the deck for that last cutting in the fall and in order to do that I will have to remove the wheels and move them to another set of holes. Other than that I have no complaints at all. It is light and easy to push and starts on the first pull every time. Very satisfied.",
