I bought this set as a gift for my son and love the welded handles, which eliminates the issue of handles that become loose and need constant adjusting. The set cooks and heats food evenly and the pots are incredibly easy to clean - just put them in the sink (even if still hot), add some soap and soak for a few minutes and they wipe clean - even stuck on food! I highly recommend them!",

When i opened the box, I saw that the cookware looked exactly as pictured online. I am very pleased, except for one thing. The inside of one of the lids has a lot of small brown spots on it after using it to cover a pot that I boiled potatoes in. This did not happen to any of the other pot lids that I boiled food in so I don't know why this happened. The warranty is for a lifetime, however the warranty does not cover spots that come on the cookware after using.",

The chemicals given off by traditional teflon was a no-no for the little ones in the household. As promised, this set is fully stainless-steel. No teflon, no non-stick coatings, no chemicals added to coat the cooking surface. This does result in some changes to my cooking: need to be patient and wait for pans to warm up, need to cook at a slightly less intense heat level, and often add a bit more fat to avoid quick burns. Very satisfied overall. The quality is superb, the pots and pans are durable and well made, but overwhelmingly heavy like some sets.",

Especially if i hand wash, i see some kinda purplish colors on the interior of my saute pan and frying pans. I need to do some research on how to fix that. Other than that, i just love it.",

      "text": "I purchased these pots in September. I tried to be very careful, cooked on low heat, washed by hand. Nonetheless, the pots burn and stain very easily. After just a couple of uses they looked like old, worn pots, with burn and stains that I cannot get out. I am very, very disappointed with them. I have been pleased with other Cuisinart products, so I am especially disappointed about these.",

      "text": "This is the first set of stainless steel I've owned. They are way better than non-stick. I feel like my food is so much cleaner since it doesn't have the possibility of teflon pieces in it. I have not had any problems with food sticking, but I still use a non-stick for eggs. These pans will boil water on medium heat in about 10 minutes. The only downside is that they get horrible water spots on them if you don't dry them right away. They also get some spotting on the inside from food, but I would tend to think that's normal. Overall, they are a very nice set and I would recommend them.",

It is a very sturdy, nice looking mirror finish stainless steel 18/10. I have had no problems cooking on it and things sticking, it is easy to clean with hot water right after cooking. It is, however; hard to keep highly polished unless you dry it so there are no water spots. Scrambled eggs were no problem, fried eggs are more challenging. I would highly recommend this product, save your money and buy Cuisinart over the other pricey brands.",

I keep my set hanging on a rack so they don't get scratched and it is an attractive addition to my kitchen. Even though my family is grown I still do a lot of cooking. I do not put mine in the dishwasher even though the information states they are dishwasher safe. Right after cooking, I put hot soapy water in them and put the lid on, which makes them easy to clean.

It takes some getting used to in terms of gauging the temperature so you don't get the pans too hot and cause burning, but once you get the feel these pans cook beautifully! Foods cook evenly and quickly. I am now going to look for a bigger frying pan to replace the old non-stick skillet.",

Very low heat must be used in the skillets in order to prevent sticking. It would be nice if the set came with another pan and one less skillet.

It would not stick if you cook with moderate to low temperature. slight outside discoloration after few uses which does not bother me. This is replacing my Calphalan cookware as the non-stick turned slightly brown and looked weird after about a year of use. I kept the Calphalan lids though because they are glass which is definitely better than metal top lids of this Cuisinart set.",
