      "text": "I had a late 2013 MacBook Pro in superb condition, I handled it with utter care since they discontinued that design, so I cleaned it every once in a while so it looked like new. Today I routinely tried to remove some strain from the monitor with light movements as I successfully did multiple times before, and apparently the cleaning liquid partially dissolved antiglare coat. Nice move, I paid 20 bucks to ruin my screen. I would recommend to keep this liquid away of antiglare screens, although the description says it's okay to use it for that purposes and marketing images got MacBooks all over.",

I also love that the spray can be twisted so that it doesn't spray (my other cleaner didn't have that).",

Honestly I'm not sure what's more annoying, fingerprints from little kids near the bottom or the streaks this product leaves all over the screen.",

I spray the solution on the microfiber 3 times and wipe on the screen in a circular motion. Then I use the dry side of the microfiber to dry and buff the screen clean. It does not leave any streaks for me. I highly recommend this product. I purchased a second bottle for my parents.",

This would be a 5 star product for me with an exception that the bottle does leak if at all tipped over. The bottle fell over on my desk and 3/4 of the bottle ended up leaking out.

Even used it on my wife's MacBook air and she is super fussy but she was very pleased that her screen was spotless. The rug you get with the spray is also very good. The trick is to spray on the rug and wipe gently i don't spray on the screen directly. I hope i don't damage any screens but so far it's amazing..",

I worry a bit about using the solution anywhere else on the device, such as the keyboard, due to the presence of water.
