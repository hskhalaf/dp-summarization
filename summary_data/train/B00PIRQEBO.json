The big advantage of this new one is the long charge life from the Li-Ion battery, so we can take it away for several days without needing the charger (two 2-minute brushes a day each for myself and my wife).

You need a conversion plug to use this with a conventional 3-pin socket and even then the plug gets loose.

      "text": "I have used this toothbrush a few weeks and it is still on its first charge. So the battery life is excellent. The normal setting is too fast so I always only use the sensitive setting. The timer every 30 seconds is a little annoying but some people may like this. If one has still got one's wisdom teeth and a mouth which is not terribly big you may need to navigate a little in the back of your mouth. I keep hitting the back of the brush against other molars. My last braun lasted about 13 years so hopefully this will do the same.",

      "text": "This is the first electric toothbrush I have owned and I am amazed at the results. When I first used it, I couldn't believe just how clean my teeth felt. The design of the toothbrush allows you to get into areas that would otherwise be difficult to reach and as it's a circular rotating brush, cleans the entire area of the tooth. It's also very smart and lights up when you apply too much pressure. I bought this December 2017 for \u00a330 which at the time was much cheaper than in local retailers and it continues to work great. If you are thinking about making the change, don't hesitate like I did. You won't be disappointed!",

Have loved using this toothbrush and would recommend. My only complaint and the reason it hasn\u2019t had 5stars is that when I was first using it obviously brushed harder or different to my older toothbrush\u2019s and cut my gum and was painful to brush over for a couple of days. Now that I\u2019m used to it it\u2019s ace!",

My only dislike is the on off button - the same design as my old model - easy to turn on but very difficult to turn off. Maybe its becasue I am in the 70+ age range and my fingers are not as strong but it does take awhile to turn the brush off.",

Also has warning light for low battery, and unlike previous models, it gradually slows when battery goes low, rather than suddenly cut out. Good battery life, only needs a charge once a week.
