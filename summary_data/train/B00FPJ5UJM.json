They are super light, very sensitive but absolutely fantastic and they work just fine. I just had to convince my 4-year-old who is fascinated by the touch-activation that they are not toys. Three settings are in the pictures. For the price, Nothing really can't beat this duo. If you are looking for reading lights, something sturdy that you would be turning on and off often, these may not be for you, otherwise, they are great.",

I used 6W IKEA bulbs and I can tell you with two of these on our nightstands we do not need any other lighting in our bedroom. Bottom line: Great value for money.",

And of course, the touch control is convenient as heck. I am giving it only 4 stars because the screw on piece that connects bulb to the base was chipped off upon arrival.
