I\u2019m a long time user of Method products, and while I usually gravitate toward the ones that are clear and scented with fruity things (cucumber, tangerine, etc), I bought into the marketing for stone countertops. And they GLISTEN. Shiny, shiny, shiny in a single wipe down. My only complaint is that it sometimes has an overwhelmingly chemical scent right after spraying (almost noxious and ammonia smelling) but I\u2019m willing to live with it because I\u2019ve come to trust the brand and its ingredients).",
