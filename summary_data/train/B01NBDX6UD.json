Thule does sell the adapter (Thule 889-1) but it is not sold in the USA. (Not sure why). You can purchase the 889-1 adapter on amazon.uk but it will cost about $22 at current exchange rates.",

      "text": "So I went to the Thule website and fitted my car with a bike rack. The Thule Pro Ride Rack was one of 3 recommended racks that were supposed to fit my factory crossbars. Upon trying to mount the rack I quickly discovered that my crossbars are too wide for the mounting brackets. I have contacted Thule and they are working on a solution. Short of altering the brackets or finding larger ones this rack will not work. The rack appears to be well built and sturdy enough but I wish they would be more accurate as far as the fit goes. My crossbars are about 2 3/4 wide.",

      "text": "Rack arrived on time and no shipping damage. Rack is great! easy to setup and use. Rack arm is a breeze to switch sides. I take them off after use to avoid sun damage, and they are easy to take on and off. Locking mechanism works really well. Many of the parts on it are replaceable should you ever need to replace something. The only drawback of this type of rack is where it holds the bike frame, on some mountain bikes there is very little room under a water bottle cage for the arm to clamp on. So you do have to be aware of that when buying. It was a tight squeeze with my son's MTB.",

I emailed Thule to see if they sold adapters, but no luck. For a rack that costs $200 you would think the system could adapt to standard cross bars on Japanese SUVs. This is a badly designed mounting system.",
