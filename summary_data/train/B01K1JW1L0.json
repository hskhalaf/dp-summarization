The desk itself is big so make sure you have the measurements and the right place for it. Cable management was easy with the pre-cut holes. The top is a rolled mat on-top of the wood desk which makes your whole desk a mouse pad. I will buy again.",

It also wobbles out of control, even though I tightened all the screws, it's just poor quality made in china junk.",

Barely putting an pressure on the desk and moving the mouse causes both monitors to wobble big time. I even tightened the feet as much as I could like someone else mentioned and the table is against a wall. It's really unfortunate because the table and mouse pad seem really nice but even typing this is causing my monitors to wobble like crazy...tightening the screws on the feet until they were stripped didn't fix the issue either.",

Solid steel, thick MDF, and worth every penny. It is a bit kid looking, but all wires fit cleanly in the cable management system, and you will end up with a clean desktop with a lot of working space. Oh and the mousepad top is really clever and a great unique feature.",

    "description": "Color:BlackGaming takes center stage in AROZZI arena-the all new gaming desk. Its huge 14 square feet (1.31 sq. Meters) of rock solid surface and custom mouse pad to cover the full space liberates you to game with new intensity. Arena is a completely new design, developed by our Swedish design team with gamers to maximize play and comfort. The 160cm (5\u2019 3\u201d) width allows for three large monitors to envelop you in the game environment. The 82 cm (2\u2019 8 \u00bc\u201d) depth gives you a huge field of play for your mouse, keyboard or other devices. And it all fits cleanly thanks to arena\u2019s unique cable management scheme. Arena's use of high density, solid construction materials means that gamers will have a stable, placid surface to work with allowing for lightning fast responses and comfort. The customized mouse pad covers 100% of the surface and adheres tightly to the desktop with special materials. The substantial all-metal base supports it all firmly and is user adjustable for height, further enhancing comfort. The arena has a myriad of other features which show the careful attention to detail of AROZZI Swedish design team and their immersion into the needs of gamers around the world. Those features include the design of the custom mouse pad which has a microfiber cloth surface which is water-resistant and machine washable. The mousepad\u2019s edges are stitched and the pad is 5 mm thick to maximize user comfort. Finally, the whole mousepad weighs an impressive seven pounds (3.2 kg) which together with the non-slip underside means it is impervious to any random movement over the surface. Arena is available in five attractive colors to suit the tastes or needs of any gamer, red, blue, green, white and black. Finally, arena is designed for easy transport since the desk top and frame are divided into three sections and fit into packaging easily transportable by package couriers and can be readily shipped to the homes and offices of end users around the globe.",
