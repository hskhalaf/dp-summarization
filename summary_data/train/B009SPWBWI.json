The size of the scoop part is perfect - it's not too wide (a problem a friend had with a different grapefruit spoon purchased on here). They cut the grapefruit nicely without cutting my lips. My friend is returning hers and buying these instead! My only complaint is that I'd have prefered to pay half as much for only 2 spoons. I don't really need 4. But you can't beat ten bucks!!",

She eats half a grapefruit every day. When I showed (and demonstrated) my brand new, shiny, sterling, two-sided serrated spoon \u2014 guess what she's been using ever since?",

These spoons sounded like good ones to me from the reviews others had given them. Even though they may be slightly more expensive than others at Amazon I am very pleased with them. They are a heavier stainless steel and won't bend when you dig into the grapefruit. I would recommend them to others.",

The tines are curved inward, ever so slightly, and catch on the inside of my upper incisors. MANY moons later, I've opted to edit my review. I don't take anything back, but want to relay that I've discovered so many wonderful uses for these grapefruit spoons! They're perfect for seeding cantaloupe and honeydew, and are great for scraping/scooping a little ice cream out of a tub. Wonderful tool to de-seed an avocado, too. 4.5 stars (if i could)!",
