It gets so bogged down that you have to wait like 15 minutes for it to connect to the internet and get all of your alerts and blah blah blah before the processor is even ready to complete a task like streaming. Once it's ready though, I never have ANY problem streaming and playing games unless I happen to have poor internet connection. I love the size and portability (plus compatibility with all of my Android devices and favorite apps). If you're going to get a tablet that's not Apple, this is the one.",

The only downside is ,that it needs a bigger battery because if you are playing new title games the battery only last around a hour, but browsing the web it will last six to seven hours. I like the 8 inch screen and the front firing speakers. The pen to draw or paint with is cool, but I never have even used it. I like how you can set the CPU to run at what ever speed you want.",

Pros: Best bang-for-the-buck tablet on the market, Super-fast, responsive, clean, powerful speakers, stylus included, works everywhere with Wifi. Cons: The power and volume buttons can be a bit tricky. I get around this by having a notebook-style case that covers the screen and magnets hold it on. Once I close that cover, screen turns off. When I open the cover, screen turns back on. All the volume controls can be reached in the on-screen menus Other thoughts: Get a protective case, and a full-glass screen protector. You'll thank me the 1st time you drop the tablet (and the 2nd, and the 3rd....)",

I received a new one because apparently the first wave of tablets sent out had a chance to turn into incindiary devices, and now my new tablet's touch screen is nearly completely unresponsive unless I am using the included stylus.

An xbox controller and OTG cable works good as well, but some games behave incorrectly without the official controller. Plus the wireless, and headphone functionality of the controller are very useful. Kind of wish they made a 10\" version, but this size is great for maintaining portability.",

Trying to gamestream with my alienware 17 with an nvidia 880m is a hassle to say the least. I have a dual-band router just for gamestreaming and i have never had any luck at all with gamestreaming to the nvidia tablet. And my computer hardware is more than enough to run anything at 60 fps.

It's a nice and light, good sized tablet. I don't think the fact it's shell is made of plastic is such a drawback (I saw this in another post). The processor seems slow, since load-times are laggy. It doesn't measure up with Apple, by any means. For the price, however, it's a decent little email/gaming tablet. I hope it lasts longer than my ASUS Transformer (1 warranty service after screen died, and has died again after 12 months, or so).",
