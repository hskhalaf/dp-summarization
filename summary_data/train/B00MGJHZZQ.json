      "text": "I bought a Small costume for my 3 year old who was 39 inches 5 months ago and is probably at least 41 inches now. The description said age 3-4, but Small is actually 4-6. Definitely way too big on him, but he loves it and I rolled up the legs and arms. Not sure if the smaller size would have fit him anyway since it goes to 39 inches and this one starts at 44 inches. So darling, but I just wish he didn't fall right in between sizes.",

      "text": "The toddler costume fits like 3t, and its roomy enough to fit warm clothes underneath. Problems:1. its toddler size so there should be easy diaper/potty access, no? 2. The hats a spec to small for average toddler heads, but still looks cute. 3. The fabric (esspecially the red vest) is ridiculously thin, but that was expected. My son loves it tho, and thats all that matters, thanks for making him happy for such an affordable price!",

DO NOT GET SMALL FOR 3-4. I guess if you are looking for that age you are SOL. Small is for 5 to 6. Way too big for my 3 year old. Medium for 6 to 7. Toddler... I don't know what it fits. I can't send it back now since my son tried it on and won't take it off. I am going to hem it.",

Again, very thin material so you\u2019ll have to put some newspapers or something for the backpack to puff up. My boys love it though. I ordered the 3t/4t and it was too short for them. If you child is tall order up. Very cute though.",

Also, the material is very thin and cheaply made. I don't think this costume could be washed and worn a second time as it may start to fall apart.

      "text": "My three and a half year old daughter saw this costume on one of the shows she watches on youtube and was just obsessed with it and had to have it... she hasn't taken it off in 2 days! she absolutely loves it! it fits her great and she is 40 inches tall. There is definitely a few inches of room to grow. She loves putting things in the backpack and the floppy ears on the hat. Definitely worth the $20 (even though I have never spent that much on a costume before!!!)",
