I ended up getting the Bose as well, for the sake of the noise cancellation. For riding in a noisy car, the Sennheisers are good, but not for office noise; they work primarily on lower frequency noise. The ability to push a button to hear what someone is saying is useful. With noise cancelation turned off, the sound quality is adequate. They are no match for the Sennheiser HD595, but hold their own with the HD280 pro. The passive noise reduction from the HD280 pro is nowhere near as effective as the active noise reduction from the PXC450.",

In order to block out noise I have to bungee cord them around my head (okay, I actually use a headband) which gives me a headache after a while. I cannot figure out how to adjust them.",

Also, I actually prefer being able to change the batteries, not like some that have rechargeable batteries built in were when your batteries run out you can no longer use them.

Noise cancelling headphones don't work in certain kinds of noise, and a flight taking off or landing, they just make the experience worse. For the rest of the flight? They reduce engine noise just enough so that it's not annoying. Best investment for a frequent flyer.",

They are heavier, they are better made, they have a great feature that allows you to press a button to hear people speaking to you. They use up the battery quicker. I would say twice as fast as the Bose. Overall I like them.",

The noise cancellation is 95% as good as the Bose on the lower end frequencies, but these also cancel a bit of the higher frequencies, such as a bit of voice as well. They don't cancel voice, but they reduce the volume considerably, and the Talk through feature works wonders, and that is what sealed the deal for me.",

      "text": "This is my first foray into high-end headphones, noise-canceling or otherwise. I've only used them for a few hours, and can honestly say this is the best sound I've ever experienced. New notes are cropping up everywhere, I listened to everything from metal to classical and everything sounds great. The fit is decent, they are snug but not too tight. I imagine they could be considered bulky but that's not very important for me. I've yet to see how they break in but so far quite pleased.",

      "text": "I had some initial concern about these head phones after reading other reviews regarding the noise cancelling feature. I agree, the noise cancelling feature on these headphones is not as good as Bose, but the music reproduction and durability of manufacture more than make up for that. These headphones are a bit bigger and bulkier than the Bose product, but I like them better. I own both these Sennheisers and the Bose \"Over-the-Ear\" model and I much prefer the Sennheiser product and its construction. The Bose just seems flimsy by comparison. However, if you are more interesed in a complete blotting out of all ambient noise than you are in better music reproduction, go with the Bose.",

I love the TalkThrough function. I even use it in one of my classes, I'm in this huge lecture hall where I can hardly hear the professor, so I'll pop on the headphones and TalkThrough and I can hear my prof so clear.

They come with a travel case that packs the headphones quite flat, about and inch or 2.5cm thick. I also found I could carry them fairly comfortably around my neck for short periods (eg walking through the airport), and the removable cord means no tangles when leaving your seat on the plane for necessary breaks.
