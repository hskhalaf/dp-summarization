      "text": "This bag is the perfect size for my 10' Bic Ace-Tec and will definitely provide the protection I was looking for during travel and storage. My only complaint is that, prior to packing/shipping, someone wrote measurements on the reflective material in a blue sharpie marker which is super annoying for the price I paid for this bag. It doesn't change the function, but attention to detail and respect for a new product would've been appreciated.",

It has grab handles and tie reinforcements to maneuver and secure to your boar or vehicle. Nice velcro closure to allow the fin to fit through. Enough room for paddle.",

Survived a 500 mile round trip strapped to the top of my car (at interstate speeds) no problem. No signs of wear. Use it now to store my SUP during the off season. Edit: I also added some extra light straps around it to keep it from flapping on top of the car. This probably also reduced wear on the bag.",
