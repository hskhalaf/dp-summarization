I squeeze and squeeze after baths, hang upside down to dry, and give different toys \"breaks\" so they're not submerged nightly. Doesn't matter. I'll pick one up and shake it and you'll hear the water slosh around. I'm going to dry them out and glue-gun the holes next. It defeats the purpose of a \"squirt\" toy, but I'll take that over a squirt of mold in my kids' faces any day.",

We put about half in the bath and leave the other half out of water so she can play with them separately. The only downside is that water gets trapped easily in the toys, so you have to shake them and squirt the water out a little more once bath time is over. Not very time consuming, but important to do to allow them to dry and avoid mold from forming.",

      "text": "I would be very good at squeezing any excess water out of these after bath time and they still were able to grow mold. My 11 month old was squeezing them and the bath tub was filled with little particles. I cut open one is the toys and it was filled with mold. They should make these toys not squeezable and just little bath rubber toys.",
