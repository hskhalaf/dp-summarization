      "text": "Not a bad tent and the price was very reasonable. It was also easy to set up. The top of the tent is basically a screen mesh (not solid fabric) with a rain cover attachment. Therefore no heat will stay in the tent and any outside wind or draft will blow directly through the tent. Not the best situation for anything other than warm summer nights. I'd like to do some spring and fall camping and this thing might keep me dry but it's basically like sleeping out in the elements. I should have spent a few more bucks and got something that I could really use!!",

This is a great tent for the money. I would say it really is best suited for one person and gear. If you are over 6' tall, it will be a tight fit.",

I would have gave it 5 stars but I believe the three person claim is a bit exaggerated. It is awesome for two people that's why I purchased it. You could sleep three in a pinch however",
