      "text": "I needed to replace a off brand Korean made off brand tabloid scanner used predominately for black and white drawing scans that are often up to 11\"x17\" size. The 4700 was about the only brand I found in my price range, that was capable of 600 dpi scans. The software it comes is miserable, hence the 3 star review, but once I got past that and just worked with the scanner it seems to function okay. I just wish I could get it to work better with my combination of Windows 10 and Photoshop CS6 but it does get the job done.",

And I still cannot find a manual that describes what the different scanner settings do. It's not in the online documentation. That said, it's a good, fast scanner. If you're scanning a lot, you'll need Adobe Acrobat DC too, because sometimes it randomly turns images upside down and on their sides. It's easy enough to fix in Acrobat. Create the file from the separate images, then edit using Organize Pages. If you need something for casual scanning, buy something easier to use.",
