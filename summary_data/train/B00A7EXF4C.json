I probably took it out 12 or so times total. Yesterday I blew it up and noticed another leak in the middle compartment. It wasn't even on the bottom, where there would have been a possibility of being snagged on a rock or something. This is an incredibly poorly made kayak. you get what you pay for.",

There's tons of space, the seats are comfortable, and it inflates in just a few minutes.

      "text": "We inflated this kayak in our living room, but never put it in water, can't comment on it's actual use. It seemed to be quite good, everything it was described to be. But for us, planning a car trip to Mexico, it was too large and heavy, time-consuming to inflate and too difficult to deflate, just not practical for us. If we were staying in one place and didn't have to inflate/deflate and pack it up all the time we would have kept it. Seems like a very good value, love the concept.",

I left them inflated overnight and they held air fine. I'm 6 foot tall and there is plenty of room for me in the front or back seat of these, the material seems very heavy duty.

Tips: * Buy longer paddles * Tape down the upper seams which are sharp * Use the tail fin! It greatly aids maneuverability",

They sit very low in the water where the seats rest making them hard to paddle. The load is therefore not spread out over the length of the kayak. In our case the plastic insert on the paddle broke on the first outing. If you just want a flotation device to putz around a small lake they will work and are then easily stored. If you want to travel any distance on the water I would not recommend them.",
