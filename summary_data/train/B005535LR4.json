I decided to give this wheelchair a try and it changed everything. She loves her wheelchair, her spirit soars when she\u2019s in it. The wheelchair is completely adjustable and so well engineered and can perform on versatile terrain. If your dog has limited or loss of use of one or both of their back legs, this wheelchair is a must. She\u2019s now 14 and we walk an average of 2 miles per day.",

The holes in the metal should be punched through otherwise the wheels slip up and down. That was the scary part. I've never purchased a product with adjustable height that didn't have holes, this has just indentations.",

The great thing is that this wheelchair is fully adjustable and very good quality. I would recommend this product.",

It has given our doggie great mobility after having become paralyzed in the back end. Even though this is one of the less-expensive models out there, I'd recommend taking a serious look at is. It's returnable, so if it just doesn't work out, you can get a refund.",

The first chair they sent was obviously a return as the screws had been stripped but they sent me a new one the next day so he could get mobile immediately! Awsome product! It is heartwarming to see him active again!",

(Has to be returned within a month). Product looks real sturdy and durable.",

If you have a tea cup or puppy this is not for you. The only positive is the price. It's significantly cheaper than most wheelchairs. The wheels are also plastic so it's more for grass.",
