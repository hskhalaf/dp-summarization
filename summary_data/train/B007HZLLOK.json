It is controlled by our iPad, iPhone and Galaxy S3 Android. You can play games with it, you can film with it and watch back what you tape. There are a lot more games for the 1.0 version and hopefully they will migrate across for the 2.0 Drone too. It's easy to fly, easy to control and robust. This is definitely the gadget of the year!",

Video paayback on your control device is clear, very stable and responsive. I agree with some other reviews I would have liked to get the power extreme model but cant see how they charge nearly 120 quid more for it. If you are wanting but are unsure of the outlay trust me its worth it, just dont tell anyone what you paid for it ;-)",

    "description": "Undoubtedly the ultimate flying toy, the AR.Drone 2.0 represents the latest development of Parrot's world renowned high tech quadricopter, that is easily controlled by Wi-Fi using a smartphone or tablet. It features a high definition camera with a video recording facility, plus flight data sharing, a patented piloting mode, and an innovative pressure sensor for increased stability at any altitude. Parrot\u2019s outstanding AR.Drone 2.0 offers just about every possible option on the enthusiast's wish list, and can even perform 360 degree flips on command! \n\nHD 720p CAMERA: AR.Drone 2.0 is now equipped with an High definition front camera that will let the pilots see exactly what the AR.Drone 2.0 sees just as if they were in the pilot seat. Download the free AR.FreeFlight 2.0 application (available on the App Store and the Android market) and take control of the AR.Drone 2.0 in a split second. The user-friendly control interface will appear over the video feedback streamed straight from the AR.Drone 2.0 with no latency thanks to its self-generated WiFi network.\n\nThe automatic stabilization system of the AR.Drone 2.0 will ensure an image of high quality, whether indoors or outdoors even in light wind conditions. Whether on a Smartphone or a tablet the users will see a clean, crystal clear image right from the sky.\n\nRECORD AND SHARE: AR.FreeFlight 2.0 also lets the user record video and pictures as he is piloting the AR.Drone 2.0. Simply press the record button to start and end the recording and use the dedicated photo/video section of the application to watch what you\u2019ve shot right after you have landed. No cables, no SD card, no PC required. Everything has already been sent and sorted in your smartphone/tablet so that can watch your performance instantly. And for users interested in shooting a large quantity of video without using their smartphone/tablet memory, a USB plug is located inside the AR.Drone 2.0 for easy USB recording. Shoot as much as you want and share easily on Youtube or Picasa once you are done thanks to the embedded sharing options of the application.\n\nTHE FLIP: A unique acrobatic move available exclusively for the AR.Drone 2.0. Press a button and launch this impressive barrel roll as you are flying. The embedded navigation system of the AR.Drone 2.0 will automatically recover so that any new pilot can enjoy this new move!\n\nABSOLUTE CONTROL PILOTING MODE: A brand new and exclusive piloting mode patented by Parrot only for the AR.Drone 2.0. The Absolute Control piloting mode will make the life of all beginners easier by only using your device position as a point of reference. The result is simple: whatever the direction the front of the AR.Drone 2.0 is facing you\u2019ll just have to tilt your Smartphone is a direction to see the AR.Drone 2.0 fly toward it. A beginner pilot can now become an expert in 5 minutes.\n\nHIGHER AND FASTER: The AR.Drone 2.0 provides a unique stability thanks to its embedded sensors and navigation system. Any movement not solicited by the pilot will be automatically corrected by the AR.Drone 2.0 to maintain a perfectly still position in the air while you are not controlling it. Push it, put it in windy condition (up to 15 m/h), and it won\u2019t move an inch until YOU decide to make it move. Thanks to its new pressure sensors the AR.Drone 2.0 will grant this automatic stability even further by making sure it remains stable whatever the altitude. You\u2019ll have no excuse not to try your most daring pilot tricks high in the air!\n\nA 12 month Parrot manufacturer\u2019s warranty provides cover for defective parts and workmanship, subject to proof of purchase, but clearly does not include damage in use.
