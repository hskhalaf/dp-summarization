The 15 watts per channel is more than adequate for listening to music while I work and if I choose to crank them up, the sound remains clean without distortion. They won't shake the house with deep bass but Micca specifications indicate frequency response down to 60 Hz and that is probably as good as you will find without a subwoofer.",

With crossover installed, they are much warmer, very very nice and easy to listen to by comparison. I'm running an Onkyo amp with Yamaha 8\u201d sub. 100hz crossover between the mb42(x) and sub balances very nicely.

      "text": "This is a great center channel speaker! I retired an 8-year-old Polk Audio CS1 because dialogue often seemed muddy and hard to understand. Replacing it with this Micca made such an astounding difference. Voices are now sharp and clear even when soft spoken. What's more, music sounds better too. It mates perfectly with the rest of my system: Pioneer Andrew Jones front towers and subwoofer, Polk Signature surrounds, Onkyo rear surrounds, Yamaha AV receiver. Surround sound is now near perfect. Don't think twice. Order it now!!",

Back to the speakers....These are great bookshelf speakers... that are an excellent investment, and you can tell the quality of the company by the quality of their products...even the way they are shipped...solid box...tightly packed inside...sturdy box...they are shipped in. I am on Amazon's email waiting list...I hope these speakers are back in stock, and offered again real soon. The cost at about $80.00 for the pair...in my opinion...are an excellent investment for your home stereo system.",

If you are using for background music or a small office or bedroom they can be powered by as few as 15 watts per channel. If you want more, please connect to an amplifier with at least 30 watts RMS or you will experience distortion at medium and louder volumes. If you really like bass you will need to pair with a subwoofer or two and will need to manage the signal so the MBs are not pushed below 80 Hz.",

They are more efficient and a have a tad less harsh sound than the Club 3's, but if one has the amplifier power (at least 40 to 50 watts per channel into 8 ohms resistance) my choice of the two is the Micca Club 3 speakers. The bass from the Club 3's is much better than from the Micca MB42X speakers and they sound like a speaker double their size when supplied with sufficient amplifier power. Both are very good speakers for their price, but I prefer the Club 3's over the MB42X speakers.",

I have a pair of dayton B652 that i did some modifications on and i think they are much fuller and present a wider soundstage.

      "text": "I'm not an audiophile by any means but these sound FANTASTIC to my ears. I hooked them up in the living room, at ear level and far enough apart to get a good stereo effect going, as per the instructions. They're currently hooked up to an Audio Technica LP120 turntable and also my TV. Music comes through very crisp, clear, and powerful at high volume. The sound fills my small living room and the volume can go much higher than I have it set at. Bass and treble seem well balanced, but you'll want a subwoofer if you want more bass. I live in an apartment building so subwoofer is out of the question for me.",

      "text": "After being disappointed with the Sonos Play:5 (2nd gen) these MB42x speakers coupled with a Griffin Twenty Amp (see link below) and a Chromecast Audio means I am very happy. Also I used an old Onkyo 8\" powered subwoofer connected to the sub out of the Griffin Twenty. I am probably the only person not happy with the Sonos Play:5 2nd gen, but I found the Sonos iOS app lacking especially when using Spotify, issues with signal drop occurred (not as bad as airplay though) and the sound quality wasn't worth the Sonos price tag. With my new setup I can get whole house audio, that has better separation with fuller sound and use the actual Spotify app in iOS.",
