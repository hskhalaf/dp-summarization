A word of caution, if your honey is massaging the spots you can't reach and isn't gingerly, it will stain sheets! So make sure there's a towel under you or have the stain stick handy!",

So now I have this bottle of massage oil on my hands, and I've been using it both for some light couple's massages with my other half and for post-shower skin hydration. The smell is stronger than most oils I've seen before, but that isn't a drawback to me. It's not overpowering, but it allows my skin to maintain a mild, lavender scent for the rest of my day, and I love it. Will definitely purchase again!",
