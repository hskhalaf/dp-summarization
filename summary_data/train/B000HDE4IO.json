One of the best parts is the height it reaches. I'm rather tall so my vehicles are on the lift fairly high. My old jack would not go up this high so this has been a huge plus. Would highly recommend it!",

      "text": "I purchased this through Amazon. Besides being 100.00 cheaper at Amazon, the jack is top notch. I did make a modification to it which is why it only got 4 stars instead of 5. I installed swivel brackets from my floor trans jack instead of the rails they give you which in my opinion are totally worthless. Transmissions come in all sizes and shapes. The swivel brackets are featured on the higher end jacks costing more. They should also be on this jack. Other than that the jack is excellent.",
