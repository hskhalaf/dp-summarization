Took less than 2 minutes as you just have to pop the wheels in. We washed it before putting food in it but it didn't have a strong plastic smell or anything like that. The wheels don't really roll, they drag unless you apply pressure on the container as you push. This isn't really a problem as ours will stay in one place but the wheels are a nice touch. We got our pet's name in a vinyl decal which was the perfect touch!",

I can't store any packaged food/snacks in either of them because the smell absorbs into the food. I have sent two emails to the manufacturer with no reply. Could be because of the current virus situation, probably. Would like to resolve this, however. It's too bad. They have good products, from my experience.",

My one complaint is they are designed to stack, but getting to the food in the bottom container requires me to either move, or hold onto the top container. For my purpose, they are not ideal. It\u2019s nice that the larger unit rolls since it tends to be heavy. Both are easy to snap close which keeps the cats and our dog out of the food! Overall- I really like them, but need better functionality out of the bottom unit (a way to scoop without moving the top container)",

I use the larger container to store my ferret's pine pellet litter, and the smaller one for various supplies (litter scooper, bags, etc.) These containers are basically what you'd expect; they get the job done.

The latches barely latch shut, and they are at the natural carry/handle location, so it's really easy (even being careful) for the latch to slip open and spill the contents of the container. This is especially problematic for the smaller container that you MUST pick up at some point even if you generally move them around on the wheels. Given the loose fit of the latches, I am skeptical about the claim of these being airtight. I would not recommend for long-term storage of anything perishable (including cat/dog food).",

If you look at the small video you can see that that when I close them they do not close as I expected there\u2019s no snap or click to show it\u2019s closed it just flaps about",

By the time we get to the middle of the bag, he usually loses interest in his food as is not fresh anymore, I\u2019m happy to inform that he is still eating like day one!!!",
