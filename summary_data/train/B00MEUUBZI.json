It puts something light in my stomach, gives me energy, and keeps me hydrated while I work out (of course you've got to keep drinking water throughout the workout, too). I love it!",

Breads baked at home are improved with chia as a thickening agent. Knowing this is organic adds to the pleasure. Anthony's Organic Chia Seeds is a superb product!",
