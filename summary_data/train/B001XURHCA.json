We bought this commode and liners and have had great success. We have rubber runners across the floor for misses along with a pee pad. It is not because of a lack of quality. He also needs a note above for his peace of mind. There is an assembly video that helps get this assembled quickly. We have not used this over the toilet but if it comes to that I would not mind making another purchase for a second.",

Have not purchased liners for that reason. No odors if the lid is in place. No complaints whatsoever. Also the price was right. Some have mentioned trying to fold this commode. From what I can tell it does not fold. It simply comes apart for storage. One great advantage is that the commode can be raised higher without compromising the stability or safety. Due to its lightweight construction, it is possible to carry this around the house to the various rooms.",

Now we don't have to. I had fallen many times, but now that I have this I haven't fallen. It's sturdy, to be able to use the arms to rise up and the ability to rise and lower it up to 23\" is GREAT! I would recommend this to any one that needs aid in rising. Also, the color isn't bad. It's a grey color which is nice.",
