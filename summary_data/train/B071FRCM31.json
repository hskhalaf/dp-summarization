It keeps the cabinet less cluttered, and does the job reasonably well. The arms that hold it on the door extend from the body -- probably so it's smaller for shipping and packing. Unfortunately, that makes it a little bit insecure if you open the door too fast. It's not a big deal though. All you have to do is re-extend the arm that fell off and it's good again.",
