With tax laws getting more stringent and more complex by the year, even TurboTax isn't as intuitive as I'd like it to be. For me, I'd like more instruction on certain things, but overall, it has worked well for my needs. The software itself works great. The only thing I've noticed is that if you need go backwards, it doesn't always seem to save the choices. To be sure, i frequently \"Save\" from the drop down choices.",
