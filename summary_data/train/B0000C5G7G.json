This way I can work on my low kicks without needing another person. This shield can take the hardest kicks with no problem. Because it is so thick, I never have to worry about my foot making contact with the pole. The shield is firm and does not give much at all. But it is not hard enough to condition the shins much for muay thai roundhouse kicks. I expect it to last a very long time.",

There are lots of straps, loops and handles on the back so numerous ways your can mount it or hold it. I can practice straight punches, elbows, knees and kicks no problem. It's not as hard as a standard Thai pad, but still stiff enough to make enough noise to annoy the neighbors. Can't speak to durability yet, but so far seems like a well made product.",

This pad is very sturdy and has very good construction, stitching and materials. I had a coworker hold it while I delivered a few hard kicks and it took the abuse. He felt it a bit through the pad but I am 280lbs and throwing a very hard kick. The only negative is the pad is quite \"soft\" and there is a lot of cushion, shin conditioning will not happen from kicking this pad IMO. I am going to buy another one because I was so impressed with this one.",
