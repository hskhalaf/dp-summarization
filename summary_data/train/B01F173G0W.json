The stainless steel filter does a great job of keeping grounds out of the brew, while letting some fine material and oils through. The oils and fine particulates add a very nice body to the coffee. It is super easy to clean. My only complaint is that the vessel seems fragile.This is a great addition to my Aeropress.",

Plus, it's cool the way it looks like a scientist's beaker. It's been quite a conversation piece.",
