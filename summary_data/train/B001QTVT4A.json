      "text": "It works ok, but it's not great or amazing. It works about the same as if you use a colander, and are patient with the colander, and let all of the water drip out slowly. It does not work better than that. If you're too impatient to wait for the water to fully drip out of a colander, then maybe this is for you. Otherwise, this is not a magic bullet, and it is not better than properly/patiently using a colander. Overall I think this product is over-hyped. On the plus side, it is also a very large bowl that is good for storing a large salad.",

I don't think anyone expects to still be using a plastic kitchen appliance 6 years after purchasing it with active use. That is the proof to the quality of this product. It is hardened plastic that does not bend or break if it falls on the floor. The stopping mechanism is a mechanical force to slow it down so there isn't anything to break there. I am very happy with this product's performance and highly recommend it! It is a great price and lasts forever.",

The reason is because the two previous units eventually locked up and refused to spin any longer. This one looks a little different from the past ones I've purchased, so I'm unsure of whether they have fixed that quality issue; only time will tell. Mind you, past units did last for several years so I feel that I got my money out of them. This unit was more expensive that the past unit I purchased; hopefully that means they put more into the quality of the unit.",

Seems like it would be more suitable for institutions that use larger quantities of salad. Anyhow, I decided to return it and continue using the Ikea spinner until I can find an inexpensive substitute. The OXO has a good build quality but seems too large and expensive for the typical family.",

You have to actually wait for it to stop or use the brake before you can spin again. This is a pain.

Some people even used the spin cycle of their washing machine to dry lettuce. Our easy-to-use Spinner transformed the tool into an everyday kitchen essential.\n\nNearly 20 years later, we revisited the Spinner to make some updates while keeping the top features and original inspiration: a children\u2019s top. With a modern design that complements contemporary kitchens and an improved brake that stops on a dime every time, we think you\u2019ll love our new spin on the classic design. Dry salad greens with a simple press of the soft, non-slip knob. The non-slip base keeps the bowl steady on the countertop, and the updated built-in brake button stops the Salad Spinner for unloading.
