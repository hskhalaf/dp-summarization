Most do not have enough power to spin the blades inside the head never mind actually trimming a nose or ear hair. This guy is the exception to the rule. I love this trimmer as it is the only one that works as expected. This spins at least twice as fast as my Remington and Panasonic trimmers did. No issues cutting any hair anywhere. The Panasonic and Remington are now resting in the worthless trimmer junk pile (trash).",

I don't understand why this has such high reviews; frankly its a waste of money because it's just not durable.",

I almost didn't buy it because it looks huge compared to the ones they typically sell for women. I think if anyone tries it, they will really like it. The difference is amazing.",

      "text": "Some reviewers claim the light is useless and I couldn't disagree more. My last one of these I decided to replace another brand I had since the 90's without a light and when I got this I thought no big deal, but having that light is a real bonus to help you see what you want to cut. This seems well built and is heavy, but not too heavy. It just feels solid and really does a great job. My old one must have been pulling for years because it hurt a little when I used it, but this new one is sharp and cuts without pulling. A very pleasant, pain free experience and you will appreciate the light!",

It's easy to hold, simple to operate. The light is a nice touch. The best part - the lifetime warranty is real. Eleven months in, I had an issue with the cutter. I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement. I'm back in business. They were friendly and helpful. You never actually know how these warranties are going to pan out but in the case of this trimmer, you get exactly what was promised. I highly recommend this product.",

The LED light is kinda useful and something I didn't know I needed on my trimmer until I used it on this one.
