To be fair, I am a mid foot striker and maybe they would be different on a run but I was worried about turning an ankle such was the softness of the ride. Size 11.5 fit true, uppers felt good, not too tight. The shoe is unbelievably light, I mean like ultra light racing shoes.",

By the time I was in the second stride of the first run with these shoes, I knew I had made the right decision. I'm looking forward to getting many more runs out of them.

    "description": "Skechers GOrun Razor 3 Hyper Running Shoes The Skechers GOrun Razor 3 Hyper is a versatile, lightweight fast trainer/race day shoe. Ripstop Mesh Upper Designed to be lightweight and supportive, the Skechers GOrun Razor 3 Hyper Running Shoes feature a translucent mesh upper. The translucent mesh allows cool air to permeate throughout the entire upper to increase ventilation and to reduce an uncomfortable heat build-up; creating a perfect environment for your feet to thrive in. Perforations within the fabric increase airflow allowing you to remain cool, dry and comfortable at all times. As well as this, the upper is also highly durable and has been constructed using ripstop to reduce the risks of abrasion. The ripstop mesh reduces wear and tear to increase overall durability and gives you a long-lasting running buddy. The upper has been constructed using a seamless, non-stretch upper which reduces the risks of chafing and irritation so you can go further for longer in complete comfort. A moulded heel counter ensures a stable and secure fit whilst 3D printed upper graphics support the foot to ensure a comfortable and secure fit. Completing the upper is a pressure-reducing lacing system which locks down the midfoot whilst still providing a comfortable fit. The lace-up front with nearly weightless reinforced eyelet secures the midfoot to reduce in-shoe slippage so you can enjoy distraction-free strides. Hyper Burst Midsole Light, responsive and comfortable, Skechers have used their signature HyperBust midsole technology in the Skechers GOrun Razor 3 Hyper Running Shoes. This highly responsive, ultralightweight and long-lasting midsole compound provides ample cushioning and has excellent rebound properties that propel you on race day. The midsole works to actively and efficiently absorb shocks before they can reach the sole of the foot, this reduces potential injury and you strike down on unforgiving terrain. As well as preventing impacts from reaching the fo",
