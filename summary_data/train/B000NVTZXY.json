I got so spoiled by how light and compact it is even with lenses that when I use my brother's Canon Rebel XT series, I hated it because it is so bulky and heavy. The Olympus may not be the best for indoor shots, but in Outdoor, it really shines even for high-speed shots like Airshows or sporting events. I've had the two kit lenses and never really needed more (I would like to get a macro lens). For the price, performance, and value, you can't beat this!",

    "title": "Olympus Evolt E410 10MP Digital SLR Camera with 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 and 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 Zuiko Lenses",
    "description": "CL) AA) OLYMPUS E-410 2-ZOOM outfit\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nLife is in the details, and the EVOLT E-410 was built to let you capture all of them. The Live View LCD is an uncommonly cool feature for a digital SLR. And when you experience the ergonomic feel and lightweight portability of this camera, youll want to take it everywhere. Whether the important details of your life are smiling faces or far-away places, youll capture pristine, detailed memories, thanks to a proven Dust Reduction System and powerful 10-megapixel imager. \n\n EVOLT E410 Highlights \n\n Innovative 2.5-inch Live View HyperCrystal LCD The E-410 offers ease-of-shooting and greater flexibility with the Live View LCD. Composing photographs is easier as subjects can be seen on the Live View LCD, which offers a wide 176-degree viewing angle. This enables images to be effortlessly taken from angles that would typically be difficult with a traditional optical viewfinder -- which is still the only option on many competing digital SLR cameras. Interacting with subjects, such as toddlers and pets, is also possible thanks to the Live View LCD, which enables pictures to be taken while holding the camera away from your face. \n\n The E-410s big and bright 2.5-inch LCD display with approximately 230,000 pixels includes HyperCrystal technology, which offers many times the contrast of conventional LCD monitors, and enables images to be beautifully displayed in vivid color -- both in preview and playback. The HyperCrystal LCD also provides a wide viewing angle, which ensures images can be composed from even the most obscure angles. The larger LCD makes viewing icons and text on the cameras menu a squint-free process. \n\n Coupled with the underwater housing, the Live View LCD also makes underwater photography easy, where looking through a traditional optical viewfinder is extremely inconvenient. \n\n Detailed, bright, and colorful photos with 10-megapixel Live MOS image sensor The E-410 is loaded with an impressive 10 million pixels for high-resolution photos. The 10-megapixel sensor gives users the flexibility to blow-up their prints to the large sizes supported by many of todays printers, or crop the image to print only a part of the image that is important to them. The high-performance Live MOS image sensor in the E-410 delivers excellent dynamic range for accurate color fidelity, and a new state-of-the-art amplifier circuit to eradicate noise and capture fine image details in the highlight and shadow areas. \n\n Dust Reduction System for spot-free images Olympus proven Dust Reduction System produces spot-free photos with the exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter. The patented ultrasonic technology vibrates to remove dust and other particles from the front of the image sensor and captures it on a special adhesive membrane every time the camera is turned on. These spot-free photos liberate users from hours spent retouching photographs at the computer or sending their cameras back to the manufacturer to remove dust trapped inside. \n\n TruePic III for image clarity Olympus enhanced TruePic III Image Processor produces crystal clear photos using all the pixel information for each image to provide the best digital images possible for every photo with accurate color, true-to-life flesh tones, brilliant blue skies and precise tonal representation in between. TruePic III also lowers image noise by one step to reduce noise in images shot at higher ISO settings, enabling great results in low-light situations. \n\n Underwater photography An optional underwater case (PT-E-03), five lens ports and a flash housing enable adventurous photographers to capture the delights of the aquatic world down to depths of approximately 131 feet (40 meters). The EVOLT E-410s Live View mode makes digital SLR photography a breeze for both the first-time or experienced underwater photographer. \n\n Easy-to-use, easy-to-handle light and ergonomic design The EVOLT E-410 is extremely portable, measuring 5.1 inches (129.5mm) by 3.58 inches (91mm) and 2.1 inches (53mm), excluding protrusions, and weighing 13.4 ounces (380 grams) body only. The new camera has a classic penta-mirror design that is light and compact enough to comfortably shoot with all day. Beyond its portable size, the E-410 delivers unparalleled ease of use -- from menus that make sense and buttons on the body that are easy to understand and operate, to automatic settings for every imaginable situation. \n\n While the E-410 includes a full range of manual control options to customize your creativity, it also has 30 shooting modes designed to provide the ideal settings for a variety of shooting situations automatically. These include Digital Image Stabilization, Night Scene, Fireworks, Beach and Snow, Underwater, and Candle Light to name a few, as well as an xD Panorama mode (for use with Olympus xD-Picture Cards). Users also benefit from special color modes and the possibility to apply a variety of Black & White filters. \n\n A new high-power rechargeable battery is included with the E-410 so that users can keep shooting for extended periods. Accepting both CompactFlash Type I & II, Microdrives, and xD-Picture Cards, the camera provides a choice of data storage options for enhanced flexibility, and it is possible to transfer image files from one card to the other right inside the camera. \n\n Included 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 and 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 Zuiko lenses The versatility of the Olympus E-System comes from delivering the largest selection of \"Designed-for-Digital\" lenses -- more than any other manufacturer to date. Olympus Zuiko Digital Specific Lenses come in a wide range of focal lengths to achieve the best image result in any given situation, and impress with their spectacular clarity and edge-to-edge sharpness. \n\n The E-410 one-lens outfit includes a compact, Zuiko Digital ED 14-42 mm f3.5-f5.6 Lens (equivalent to 28mm-84mm in 35mm photography) that perfectly matches the imager so light strikes the sensor directly to ensure rich, accurate colors and edge-to-edge sharpness. Its 3x ED Glass zoom lens covers the range most frequently used in everyday photography and weighs just 7.5 ounces, offering users an extremely dynamic, portable everyday-use zoom. Close-ups as near as 9.84 inches (0.25 m) are also possible throughout the zoom range. \n\n The E-410 two-lens outfit adds the Zuiko Digital ED 40-150mm f4.0-5.6 (80-300mm equivalent) Lens, which provides users with greater telephoto power for far-away shots in a compact size. This telephoto lens is smaller than many standard zoom lenses at 2.6 inch diameter x 2.8 inch length and a weight of 8.8 ounces -- a real benefit for anyone who wants to pack a powerful zoom lens without taking up much space. It also has great close focusing abilities, and is able to capture a subject up-close from a distance of 31.5 inches (.8m). \n\n Both lenses are exceptionally compact, allowing unimpeded mobility. They are sized for comfortable handling and designed for maximum image quality at an excellent price. Most important, these new lenses have the world-renowned ED lenses that deliver stunning high-quality images. \n\n All E-Series cameras support the Four-Thirds Standard whereby Olympus and various other manufacturers produce high-quality Four-Thirds-compliant lenses and accessories that are specifically designed for digital SLR image capture. Because the E-410 is part of the Olympus E-System, it is compatible with a large and growing range of Olympus E-System accessories to further enhance personal shooting styles and applications. This includes the full line-up of Zuiko Digital Specific lenses and flashes.",
