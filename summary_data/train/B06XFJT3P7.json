I've plucked them many times, but they come back the same. This lotion exfoliates so well, after a week of nightly use, I shaved and there were noticeably fewer ingrowns. Not gone completely, but improvement! I'm hopeful after a month I'll be relatively free of these suckers. I wonder if I could use this under my arms as well.",

      "EXFOLIATING LOTION FOR CLEAR SKIN: A deeply moisturizing glycolic and salicylic acid body lotion treatment for Keratosis Pilaris, rough and bumpy skin, body acne, scars, uneven skin tone & texture, hyperpigmentation, & dryness. The original KP Exfoliating Lotion, don\u2019t settle for cheap imitations.",
      "SMOOTH SKIN WITH NO REDNESS: Our Keratosis Pilaris treatment has two key ingredients: glycolic acid that exfoliates away surface bumps and oil soluble salicylic acid which unlike AHAs (e.g. lactic acid) can go deep into hair follicles and pores to target the source of KP and acne, reducing inflammation and redness.",
      "EFFECTIVE PH LEVEL: Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHA) and Beta Hydroxy acids (BHA) are very sensitive to pH levels. With just the right pH at 3.5 our KP Exfoliating Lotion allows for more \u201cfree acids\u201d to work on smoothing and clearing your skin, while not being too low to cause irritation.",
      "DEEP MOISTURIZING INGREDIENTS: Dry skin makes your KP worse, so we\u2019ve included these moisturizing ingredients: Glycine Soja Oil is a natural emollient, rich in antioxidants and Vitamin E. CCT is derived from coconut oil and glycerin, leaving your skin feeling silky and non-greasy. Lastly, Aloe Vera acts as a soothing anti-inflammatory and anti-irritant.",
