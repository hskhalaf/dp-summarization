Now wi-fi card problems mean turning computer on and off several times every morning to get internet connection.Software problem or not: it's not fixed,and at over \u00a31k purchase price it's not fit for purpose: I wish I had bought it from John Lewis who I'm sure would have replaced it by now (It's still under guarantee - only 6 months old).",

I bought one from PC world and it crashed a lot. Thought it was a faulty machine so returned it and bought a new one from amazon. Exact same crashing problem. I love Lenovo laptops but I cannot recommend this model. Contacted Lenovo and they told me to do a lot of things, none worked and they conceded that the laptop was faulty and had to be returned on both occasions. Either I'm super unlucky or this model isn't trustworthy.",

Had to go to a local computer shop who sourced it from an international company. Expected better from Lenovo. Was going to order in excess of 100 laptops for work, but will stick with Dell after that rather stupid experience with Lenovo support.",
