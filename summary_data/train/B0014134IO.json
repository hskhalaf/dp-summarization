Better stitches and much quieter. Doesn't rattle and shake around like the Brother. Nicer rolled hem. Yay!! I know a lot of people compare these two machines, I did a lot of research before I bought a serger. Definitely casting my vote for the Juki now.",

I did my research and discovered that it is top rated and very affordable! I absolutely love it. Very easy to thread and it makes gorgeous rolled hems (something that my brother never did). I definitely recommend this serger. And as a bonus it is very quiet. Love it!!!!",

It works great on fat loose weave fabric (I eased it over seams that were about 3/8 inch thick) and also performed great on thin t-shirts, so far so good without changing any tensions. It is light enough for me to move. And the hardest thing about threading was through the needle for the lower strings. 4/26/18 Now I see the problem. The stitches don't hold their setting, I can adjust the tension and it looks great for about 2\" and then the threads get very loose again. Am I missing something here or is this the status quo for this machine. So sad about this.",

In my case,it had threads that had been cut off,presumably to tie the thread on from my cones. I did so only to have the lower looper thread break. That's when i discovered the lower looper is a nightmare to thread. The lower looper threader that comes with the machine is basically useless. I had to remove the needle plate to finally get it threaded. It took an hour to do this. I cannot imagine having to go through this every time i need to thread this machine. I will probably send this back.",

Great videos on YouTube that show how to thread if you're not a person who can figure it out from a diagram like myself.",

My mother was a seamstress her entire life and gave me my first sewing machine when I was 12, so I know a bit about sewing and machines. I am super-happy with this machine and shipping was quick!",
