      "text": "Out of fairness, I\u2019ll re-review after wearing three times to allow time to break these in. Shoes come bagged - not securely packaged in box or cushioning. I wear an 8 regular. Ordered 8. They are a tad wide and a tad too roomy - will have to wear really bulky socks, especially if they soften up and become more flexible. Inner cushion is adequate, but may need to add arch support. They are very stiff - even for new shoes - but this will hopefully change with use. Definitely want to wear padding (nice socks) that extend above top edge of back of the shoe until it loosens up.",

      "text": "I purchased these shoes because the description states \"Arch support and cushioning for ultimate comfort.\" There was no arch support and in fact there wasn't even a liner in the shoe so cushioning was not there. The front of the tongue is plastic and it digs into the front of my foot. I wore these around the house for a few days to see if they would get more comfortable, but I just couldn't wear them. I am returning them for a refund and have purchased a different bowling shoe that has more cushion and better flexibility.",
