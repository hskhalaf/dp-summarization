I also have a Windows 8.1 Lenovo Yoga 2 10.1\" tablet I was able to pair with and the tablet can run Google Sketchup, so as the Disto takes measurements it transfers the measurement directly into Sketchup, so I can draw a floor plan at the same time I'm measuring- I just point a mouse in the direction the next line should go and take the measurement and it draws the line at the exact length it measured. It is a lot more efficient than sketching the room on paper, measuring everything and jotting it down in pencil, then taking that to a PC to draft. Made accurately estimating my square footage for flooring a breeze!",

Want square footage of a room: turn unit on, hit the square button, measure one wall, the measure the second wall, and wala! It gives you the square footage of that room! Small, comes with a belt loop and a carrying case. Easily fits in your pocket. Gee, I sound like a salesman! Great tool. Wish I had this years ago.",
