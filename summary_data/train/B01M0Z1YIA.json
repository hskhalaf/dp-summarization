      "verdict": "The Nike Air Max Thea SE is undeniably stylish which can be bought without breaking an arm and leg. It is loved by heaps of users as it goes well with lots of casual wear. It doesn\u2019t scrimp on comfort since the proprietary Air bubble in the sole shields the feet from impact.The common setback presented by many is it comes with a narrow width which can get a bit cramp if you go for a true to size. Going for a half size higher is recommended by most.",

      "cons": [
        "A narrow-footed reviewer said this Air Max Thea variety looks great, but the sizing option is very small and tight",
        "One reviewer mentioned the back of the heel caused blisters",
        "Less than a handful of reviewers said the upper is stiff and hard as plastic, and quite snug around the top of the foot which they find unpleasant",
        "Few reviewers noticed that the upper creases easily towards the forefoot"
