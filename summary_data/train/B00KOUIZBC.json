Take the time to make sure you're getting the right model, it can be tricky since the model is the same for quite a few different versions of this unit, and vendors are not always clear about which one they are offering.",

Another thing that is noteworthy is that the keyboard is fairly well spaced and reminds a bit of the Macbook's keyboard. The keys feel a bit cheap, but well, this is not a Macbook obviously.

Battery life is incredible, and given how lightweight the operating system is, combined with the SSD, the processor feels much snappier than a similar-specced computer would with another OS.

The screen leaves something to be desired, specially for off-angle viewing. And the build quality is indicative of the price point. The keyboard is pretty abysmal. I would really like a chromebook that doesn't compromise on build quality, specially the keyboard. Add to that a quality ~11\" touchscreen display. Put a Core i3 or one of the new Core M processors in there along with 4GB or 8GB of memory. And you have a chromebook that you will want to use. The Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga Chromebook 11e delivers on most of this I think - everything but the processor.",

Everyone pretty much gives the same comment; Acer cannot fix the problem and it's quicker and cheaper to just buy another Chromebook. So I'm out $300.00 on this Chromebook and had to purchase another one for about the same amount. Unless you have unlimited funds, I would suggest another manufacturer besides Acer.

Inconvenient for a basic pc user that likes to browse over ten tabs and keep all her bookmarks; chromebooks won't allow that without exchanging battery life and all the memory. New user- 5 tabs open, 1 app: memory usage is at half way and will progressively increase. Main user with all my bookmarks and 10 apps: exchanges five hours of battery life or with ten tabs open, pc will easily heat up and whir; memory usage availability: a consistent 5%-1% and battery life of 2-3 hours.",

For 200 okay. Without flaw in screen probably would have been okay with product and would have adapted to lower resolution screen. Is fast however - can't compare to Celeron processor or 2 gig memory as compared with I3 that I have with four gig memory. Frustrating that product goes out with obvious screen defect.",

But of course, most hardware is moving in this direction and soon nothing will offer any measure of freedom, despite the inherent capabilities of modern hardware. These things should be rented rather than sold - it would be more honest. My advice: Find a real computer while they last, and find it somewhere other than Amazon!",
