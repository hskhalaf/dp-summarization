Original review: The ethernet ports stopped passing traffic after 24 hours of operation. Updated firmware, reset the device twice. It only recognizes DCHP clients on the wired ports, fixed IP devices disappear. UPDATE: Suddenlink has their head up their ass and we don't have internet, but I had the modem connected to the WAN port. Disconnected that, and the rest of them work now. SMH",

I recommend naming the bands differently. When they are named the same, your devices will have a tendency to connect to the stronger but slower band. By naming them separately, you can ensure that your compatible devices connect to the 5 ghz band. Even with this setup, older devices like a 2ghz chromecast are visible on the network.",

The configuration menus were basic and took some deciphering to get right. Performance was lacking and constant disconnects unlike any other product I have bought. Price was reasonably the same as other brands, but I chose this one as it was in stock and faster delivery. NEVER AGAIN. This brand is definitely off my list of things to buy again and all the people I talk to with will get a negative review of this device and brand. I will stick to a more stable brand I have used in the past.",

I researched on google, and found out this is a very common issue with this router and there is no fix. Would\u2019ve love to keep this, because of sleek look and incredible WiFi speeds but if there\u2019s no connection it\u2019s worthless.",

The router was really painless to set up, everything worked on the first try, and the connections so far have been reliable and fast. (Although I have not attempted to measure them). There are no complaints so far - I'm happy with the purchase.",
