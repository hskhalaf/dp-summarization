      "text": "These headphones were just fine when they worked. Bought these in August 2016 used them occasionally and by February 2017, they didn't work properly. Sennheiser sent me a replacement pair under warranty. Very good service however, I used the replacement sent even less than the original and now in August 2017, they don't work at all again. Both Pairs looked brand new when they stopped working. UPDATE: Sennheiser replaced the second broken pair with a newer model after mailing the broken ones back. I highly commend the customer service as they stand behind their product. Adding a star to review to make 3!",

There is some noise cancellation but it's not perfect. The jack is straight, and has no elbow. Probably my only complaint as I use it with a PC.
