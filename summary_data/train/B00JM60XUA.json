Now it won't recognize jpg images loaded onto a USB stick, which is what I've always used it for. I've tried 4 different sticks, including a brand new one, and it just sends error messages: \"all files unsupported\". One time, for one USB stick, it showed me images but the wrong ones. I'm disgusted that I spent $400 on a product that didn't even last 4 years. And that's not with heavy use, either. I used it probably 3-4 times a year. It wasn't a daily thing. Pathetic.",

It's not running hot when it happens, and it shuts down anywhere between the first 30 minutes to 60 minutes of operating (almost every time). When I turn it back on, it works fine. When I spoke to tech support at AAXA, I was told to keep using it and see if it stopped turning itself off...(really)? Also, the speakers that came with my Super Bundle Pack (paid more for this), started making crackling noises the first night we used it! I've had to use other speakers when using it.",

Ambient light was an issue before with the P2, however the 450 pro keeps a clean and visible picture even with some lights. The bluetooth functionality is great with the soundbar.

The only downside is the tinny sounding speakers, although I didn't have much expectations in that front, and do have another portable speaker for that purpose.",
