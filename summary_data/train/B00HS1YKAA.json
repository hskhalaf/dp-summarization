Also found that medium frames if you're not careful when putting them in the wire frame can fall through the bottom. Was able to remove the handle and hook up a power drill. It does what it's supposed to do, just have to pay attention to what you're doing",

Don\u2019t tip the extractor upside down without putting tape over where the ball bearing sits. It does need to be cleaned before use, but super easy to do so- outside. Very easy to use all around.",

A couple of sticky arms later we got it put back together. We now have a clamp on the shaft to keep it together. It is extracting the honey but I think it's a pretty crappy piece of equipment. Had I seen it was from China I would have never purchased this. Spend a little more money and get something better.",

The split top is a little awkward, has to be held down while spinning to avoid annoying rattling while spinning, but that's pretty minor. Good value, overall, for the price. I would recommend.",

If you have the mechanical ability of a 6th-grader, you may have to make some minor adjustments (due to in-transit knocking around), tighten some bolts, and put a couple of drops of oil at the gearbox crank and shaft.

It works reasonably well given the price, but if you aren't prepared to tweak this thing a bit to get it working - you may want to spend a bit more and get one that's a bit sturdier!",
