      "text": "Very disappointed with this plantronics bluetooth headset. Even with the smallest ear tip adapter, I cannot get a secure fit. Yes, if manually pushed into place with my hand, the sound is terrific, but then that is hardly hands free. (And the second I let go, it practically falls out.) None of the reviews I read addressed this issue. Secondly, the volume controls are poorly designed - must go all the way up to go down and vice versa. I did find that comment in a review, but thought if it was as excellent as described otherwise, it would be worth that small inconvenience. Sadly, for me, it is wasted money because this headset will never be used.",

I was constantly powering the unit Off and On. I still have the headset but now the On/Off switch is loose (caused by overuse from problem described above) and many times I miss a call not realizing my headset is on in my pocket.

I can also double tap the frontwards button and say \"open weather, radarnow, calculator- etc.\", and the app opens up.

You don't even know it is there. - With that saidm there is nothing that STAYS in your ear better. - The sound quality is excellent on both ends. - You can answer a call by just saying ANSWER. No buttons to hit at all. - It talks to you/ No guessing at cryptic light flashes to know if your battery needs charging. - It's small but rugged and well built. Plantronics has been my favorite for headsets for awhile... This raises the bar. If you are looking for a winner, I have NO complaints about these at all.",

The problem with all bluetooth headsets is that they easily get lost or left in pockets that go through the laundry. The first quality headset that is waterproof and/or has a beeper when your phone gets more 5 feet from it will get 5 stars from me. With that said, this headset has done the best job of balancing quality, price and portability that I have found so far. As a result, every time I feed my headset to the washing machine I go back for another one of these!",

There was a lot of static during my phone conversations. Also the bluetooth would announce \"answer\" or \"ignore\" on an incoming call. It does not announce the phone number that is calling. I would always have to look at the phone to see who's calling. I understand that Vocalyst service will announce the phone number, but why pay extra for a feature that should be built into the bluetooth? I returned this bluetooth, and I will stick to my Jawbone bluetooths from now on.",

It is very lightweight and extremely comfortable and i don't even need to wear the over the ear piece. I also like the fact that I can listen to my downloaded music thru it.

Also, the lack of an around ear piece may be a problem if you don't have large ears. Overall, this is a fantastic device. It does its job well.",

Seller, in adherence with HDD policy indicated that there is nothing they would do as the 30-day limit had expired. Expected more from the product but also from the seller.

Others can hear my conversation from the Bluetooth as well as the person I'm talking to can hear the noise and others in the background over me. I chose this to have more range, clarity, volume, block background sound, the great rating, etc. I have had other Plantronics devices that I enjoyed but needed a smaller one so I chose this one for the reasons I stated above. It did not meet my expectations. My state is a required hands-free device state so I must endure until but I am not pleased. Thank you for the opportunity to voice my dissatisfaction. Ouida C",
