We followed the directions exactly as they stated and the top stuck to the bottom, I managed to get it loose and found that the glass had melted and run over the side, nowhere in the directions does it state how long to continue the heating process once it glows orange, in my opinion this kit was a waste of money, the directions are useless and I believe it is of poor quality. I do not recommend this kit for anyone.",

Kiln paper does not protect the kiln and now kiln has gouges in it as the paper fused to the bottom of kiln. The glass is substandard compared to my friend's true Fuseworks kit. The glass cutter does not score properly unlike the one that came with my friends (real Fuseworks kit). Buyer Beware.",

      "text": "This is not a Fuseworks kiln in spite of the description. There is no Fuseworks logo labeling, the surface and inside textures are very rough compared to Fuseworks and it takes more than twice as long to fuse in a 1200 watt microwave. I have a Fuseworks and it takes 2:30 to fully fuse. This one takes 4:30-6:00 minutes in a strong oven. In addition the material is much rougher, the top center hole is wider and the inner grey material is thicker and rougher. It will work however, because of the long fuse times and I'm sticking with my original Fuseworks.",
