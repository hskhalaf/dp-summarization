They declined to comment on the study, which further confirmed my suspicion. I will no longer be repurchasing. If you also care about ingesting these heavy metals . . . you shouldn't either.",

Other than that, I really enjoy this product. Flavor is on point, I can drink this with water or almond milk, it blends perfectly in a hand mixer as well as a machine mixer.",

I recommend adding honey or agave nectar or if smell and taste aren't what you concern yourself with in regards to protein powder.",

Con: It is very staticky and tends to stick to the scoop, container, your hands etc. However it's easy to wipe up.",

There is always a mess. I will not be buying this version again and am disappointed I fell for such a clear marketing scheme.",
