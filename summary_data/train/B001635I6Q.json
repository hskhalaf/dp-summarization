I do wish the screw installation was more traditional (defined holes that the screws easily go into) vs. this manufacturer's method of having you just poke a hole into the plastic. I am anal and want all the parts as close and tight as possible and their installation method doesn't guarantee that. Not a big enough deal to take away any stars though.",

It was really easy to put together, but as other reviews said, the table top is textured so you would need to put something underneath a paper to color on it. I knew that when I bought it though, so that's why I still give it 5 stars. The only thing I would say contrary to another review is that a smaller adult can sit on the supported end of one of the benches, however, it is not a comfortable fit. Overall, great product, very satisfied.",
