The multi firing modes opens up a world of tactics that was never available for backyard laser tag before. Charging a room? Shotgun mode. Running for cover? Burst mode. Laying down cover fire for friendlies? Pistol mode. Behind and need a snipe to get the kill? Missile mode. I've put in so many hours with my 12 year old playing with these. The neighborhood kids have all asked their parents for sets to get an army together.",

There are 4 team indicator lights (blue, red, green and white) on each gun to determine which of 4 possible teams you can be on. The green light stopped working on two of the guns after maybe playing 7 times... I called to get them replaced and Amazon sent me this two pack for free (hence why I gave 4 stars and not 3). I will write another review in the spring to see how they are holding up.",
