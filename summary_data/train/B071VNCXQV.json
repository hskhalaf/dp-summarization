      "text": "Nice set. Good figure selection. Build was repetitive, building the legs 4 times. But set looks great assembled. Legs are locked in place at the center section, so the legs aren't as poseable as they could have been. And the cockpit screen was not hinged, which I personally hate in models. Sides of the cockpit aren't held in place by enough studs, so they come lose too easy when the screen is not on the model. But otherwise, a very nice set.",

Sadly when we opened the first bag we noticed it had 2 Kai heads and helmet, but it was missing his entire body. Then we had Nya's body but no head, mask, or helmet. That's as far as we got as i didn't want to waste hours trying to put something together that might be missing more pieces. Not to mention that the box was missing normal lego information on the box like the number of pieces, which is typical of knock off legos. Im not convinced we received an authentic lego and sent it back.",
