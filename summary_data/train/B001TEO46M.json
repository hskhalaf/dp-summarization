I was very disappointed with this order.",

The only reason it fit my dog is because he is a hairless chinese crested.It also does NOT come with a top hat. Overall the SIZES run SMALL so if you normally get a size SM for your dog I recommend getting a MEDIUM.",

I had to reorder him the medium. I would just caution anyone who orders this to really consider the sizes. Usually Midnight has no problem wearing a small, but not in this case.

The tux itself is well made and beyond adorable, love all the details. Also, make sure you know this does NOT come with a top hat despite what the description says in the features section.

Unfortunatley, I got a medium thinking that would work as he was only 4 months old and I went by the measurements, but with his broad shoulders I had to go with the large - which was a little to big but at least it closed when it was on him. I would suggest this to anyone that is planning on having their dog as a part of their special day. The price was good and it was delivered faster than it was estimated to be.",

I ordered an XL just to be safe, it was a little big but we just pinned it back and it worked fine:) (see my photo). He only needed to wear it for a short amount of time, but the tux looked like good quality and he looked handsome so it served its purpose :)",

Neither one of us thought we were one of those people, but a week before the wedding we saw this dress and thought maybe. Then the dress arrived and we tried it on our 15lb Jack Russel Cindy Lou. It fit perfectly and she looked amazing. That was it.... she was in the wedding and what a hit she was! Excellent quality. As pretty as it looks in the picture. Did a fantastic job. Built perfectly for a dog to wear without getting tangled up or tripping. Well worth the price.",
