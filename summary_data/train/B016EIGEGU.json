The short video I made showed crisp colors, focused well on near and far objects simultaneously, and no significant distortion. Although I overlaid the original sound with a music track, the microphone picked up just fine. I would give 5 stars, but I feel I should try a few more uses before completely endorsing it.",

Also be sure to purchase a micro SD card, the camera can handle up to a 128GB card. Also keep in mind that you cannot transfer pictures via the USB/power cable, you have to transfer your media using the micro SD card.",
