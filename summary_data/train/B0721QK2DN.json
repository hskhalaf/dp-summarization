There might be more \u201ctop of the line\u201d stands, but this one is working well for me. The price was good and the quality is great. My saxophone has a place to safely rest instead of just resting it agains the back of the couch in my practice room. This is a good item, you will not be disappointed. It does what it is supposed to do, without costing a lot of money.",

My playing seemed to get worse and worse. Turns out it wasn't me. My sax had twisted, due to the weight of the instrument causing a shift in the body and bell. This also shifted the pads, leaving gaps for air to escape. I have folded the stand up - never to be used again, while I await the repair of my instrument.",

But I put it in a bench vice and slowly squeezed/bent it to fit my alto more snugly. Otherwise, it works. It\u2019s made from good material, it\u2019s just that it wiggles a little when you place your sax in it. Not a lot of movement. Just a little. I\u2019m sure i could drill a hole and make a tightening screw to fix the wiggle. But the more i use it, the more I\u2019m ok with it. If I played shows every weekend I may want to buy a nicer stand.
