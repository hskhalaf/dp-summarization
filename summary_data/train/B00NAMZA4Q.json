My family member has Sonos I thought this would be a comparable option, I was wrong. Worth the extra money to get Sonos App is not user-friendly at all, and I still can't figure out how to use it through my computer.",

No audible distortion even when played loud. It works well with my desk top as well as lap top. The software setup is a bit tricky. The booklet that comes with it tells you to find the software on the Polk web site. They don't have the software there. When I called Polk they directed me phorus.com. That works but it is designed for many different speakers making the setup a bit more difficult than is necessary.",

I find the bass a little weak for my taste, but otherwise it's a room-filling, satisfying full sound with negligible distortion (to my ears anyway). Performance-wise the Polk Omni 2 is a small notch below the Bose and Denon offerings in the same category, but those are typically $100 more. I bought the plug-in (standard) version, which came at a really good price during the holiday sales, so can't complain about the cost, but I thought the truly wireless (portable) version is a little pricey.",

The documentation online says there's a utility app which allows you to adjust EQ, but I searched the Android and iOS app stores and could not find it.
