With that said, it really depends if you\u2019ll be giving it heavy use or even to high output. I\u2019m simply using this to connect a Technics turntable to powered bookshelf speakers. For my needs, it works fine. It could have more kick to it but then again it\u2019s quite inexpensive so know that before purchasing.",

      "text": "This unit worked fine for about three hours -- I was initially very pleased. Then the left channel began to output excessive static/rumbling noise that increased from intermittent to eventually continuous. To troubleshoot I switched cables, tried plugging the unit into a different amplifier, and tried a different source. The left channel issue continued. When I tried to contact the manufacturer for help I was ignored (they even deleted the first trouble ticket I entered at their web site and have ignored the second). There clearly is a quality issue with the unit. Fortunately Amazon's return policy took care of Pyle's poor manufacturing quality control. Amazon had halted shipping this unit but I see it's available again. Buyer beware.",

We had a belt-drive turntable, but I needed a phono preamp to get it to work on our recording equipment since the turntable was a stand-alone without one. The PYLE-PRO PP444 was the perfect solution. It hooked into the equipment effortlessly and performed perfectly. Be sure you ground the unit to the turntable as per set-up instructions.

    "title": "Pyle Phono Turntable Preamp - Mini Electronic Audio Stereo Phonograph Preamplifier with RCA Input, RCA Output & Low Noise Operation Powered by 12 Volt DC Adapter (PP444)",
    "description": "This electronic preamplifier stands up to the test and will provide you with serious sound performance. The PP444 is perfect for bringing your studio equipment's phono-level output to a more suitable line-level output. It'll take your audio signal, amplify its strength and prepare it for further processing by your receiver or amplifier. Preamps technically provide voltage gain to your desired equipment and are key to assisting the signal source, whether it's a turntable, musical instrument or microphone. The ultra-low noise audio conditioning circuitry allows the preamp to boost audio to levels that are more manageable for various types of audio equipment. You'll find it easier to adjust the recording level volumes of different sources from microphones and instruments alike. You should position your preamp close to the source to reduce unwanted noise and interference. Preamps can sometimes come built into the stereo equipment, but if that's not the case, the PP444 is an easy install, wise choice and great addition to any musician or producer. Take your sounds and audio production skills to the next level with the PP444 Preamplifier.
