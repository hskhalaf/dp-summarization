No biggie, it happens - you sometimes have to try on a few even at the department stores before finding the right ones. Biggest problem with these is they ripped after a month along one of the rear pocket seams, and it appears (at least on quick review of this site before heading to a client's office) that I dont have an option to return them because I'm a week past the 30 day purchase mark. A bit disappointed considering they only got worn 3 times in the last 5 weeks.",

Clearly these jeans had a quality issue, perhaps it was known, perhaps not. Either way, it is an issue and it happened twice to me. I will find a pair elsewhere. Other than the issue, these fit very well. They didn't stretch out easily and held form Well. I enjoyed them until they broke.",

I have the same results on every pair on Levi\u2019s that I buy. This has been happening for the last 5 years or so. Never had this problem before then so something has changed in the manufacturing/quality department. I do not recommend these jeans to anyone until they increase the quality of there products.",

I like these mainly because of the slightly stetchy material and the near horizontal entry front pockets which prevent my two phones and wallet from slipping out while sitting down. Not the thickest material but it's not stiff like the commuter Levi's I used to get instead.",

However, these 569s come with a slightly slimmer leg. Most of all they are also mid rise jeans the belt line is considerably lower then they used to be. This makes them fit tighter around the butt, top of the legs, and causes \u201cplumbers crack\u201d. I have tried several of the Levies different styles and it looks like I am going to have to look else where for jeans that fit my needs. Or my other option is to keep sewing up the holes in my old 569s hahah.",

They are not 'skinny' jeans, but they are tight on my thighs and ride up my butt as well. Quite disappointed as I purchased the Kale color which has a nice, dark, deep indigo shade. The material was also noticeably thinner than my older pair. Serious company mismanagement Levi's. Why change a style people like and are accustomed to? Just go ahead and make a new style if you want, but don't change the existing styles! I'm returning these ASAP back to Amazon.",

The jeans said the correct size on the tag inside and the label on the back. So beware if you order these, you may be sent the wrong size.",

Vintage Light is made in Cambodia, while Crosstown-Stretch was made in Pakistan.",

The newer ones need time to break in or you can buy a size up or go with a more washed/treated pair which won't last as long but are already broken in. That's what I needed to do. Love them.",
