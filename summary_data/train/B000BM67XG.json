I imported last year's data in less than a minute and I had my return completed in less than 1 hour. This includes capital gains/losses, dividends, and AMT calculations. It doesn't get much easier than this. Yes, you have to download updates. The IRS is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores. The alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it, but wouldn't that take at least as long?",

After filling in the data from my 2005 1099-R form, the program informed me that these monies were taxable in 2003 not 2005, and that these data would not be included in my 2005 return. I could not find a way overide this problem. Also, there was no apparent way to directly contact H&R Block to find out how to fix it. After wasting a couple of hours I now have to trash the taxcut software and spend more money to purchase turbo-tax, which from prior years experience is relatively bug free.",

Their link doesn't send you to a working page so you can't download the update. So you're stuk. Since my tax return is so simple, I'm gonna check around and see what other software is available.",
