I do wish it had lights and more musical options but overall this is a big win for containing a crawling and busy baby. A+.",

The baby loves walking around playing with the toys and is consistently entertained. Highly, highly recommend this!!",

The construction is simple and it's well made. There's several interesting toys on the table, and room for a child's food or bottle if you wish. Also there's a sturdy loop to attach your other toys to. It does occupy a fair amount of space.",

It gets caught up on an edge in the base, which stops him in his tracks. So, overall, the concept is good, but they just didn't test it to ensure that its design stood up to real everyday use.

Would definitely recommend. The only thing is we don't leave her in it too long since it's not good for the development of their feet for walking. So we put her in it maybe twenty minutes total a day. She loves it though. Totally satisfied with his purchase.",

Finally we gave it away, and then we bought this one for our third kiddo. This one sadly, seems a little lower quality than the original. One of the toys broke off within the first month or two.

Easy to clean, the seat insert removed to be thrown in the wash, everything ends can be stored down with ease. I don't find the noises annoying, and you can attach other toys to a few locations to add something new if you like. Has held up great so far, so I'd say it's pretty durable.",
