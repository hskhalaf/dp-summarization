The lotion itself is thin, but full of moisture. Silky-feeling, not 'creamy/greasy' feeling like some heavier lotions, which is great for use in the morning and putting clothes on right over it. Feels like it actually helps my skin over time, rather than just a nice scent/temporary fix. Will order this as long as they continue making it!",

Best of all, it has a fabulous fragrance, slightly herbal, which I love as I dislike flowery or sweet scents. I consider this expensive, however, and only hope the price does not soar out of my range. Highly recommended!",

It has a light, fresh, clean scent that is good for both men and women. It is not too thick, nor is it thin and watery. It feels good on the skin. I was so happy to find it on Amazon, because to my surprise it is expensive on the Peter Thomas website. Thank Amazon!",

Great long lasting lotion that leaves the skin feeling smooth, but not oily. Another plus is that it does not have a strong sent, so it does not compete with any perfumes or oils I like to wear. :)",
