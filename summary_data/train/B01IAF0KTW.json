I gave them only 3 stars because the uppermost strap is not adjustable and is actually quite large. I wear a medium width and have an average arch, both top and bottom. And while you do need a little \u201cgive\u201d when stepping, the strap is simply too large. When you\u2019re not walking, there\u2019s a huge gap between it and your upper arch, making them look like a poor fit. If Clark\u2019s made this adjustable with a little Velcro like they do on so many other shoes/sandals, I\u2019d buy them again in a minute. For now, I\u2019m returning them.",

She hasn't walked about much so can't attest to that aspect. The lining is also ideal for feet that perspire. Sizing was fairly accurate. My Mum would usually wear 9W but fortunately opted to go with the XW. This is consistent with the other Clarks she purchased. All in all you get quality and an attractive fit.",
