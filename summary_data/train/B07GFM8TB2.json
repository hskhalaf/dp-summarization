There were additional side pockets in the underlayer fleece (which is detachable, but I always kept it attached to the shell layer). The two layers zip together so it feels like a single piece, but you can access the under-pockets easily. I wore this for skiing and snowmobiling in -5 to 20F. I wore a silk base layer and a second Dri-fit top underneath and was always warm. Highly recommend.",
