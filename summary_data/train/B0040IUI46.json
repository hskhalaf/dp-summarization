I need both and the signal kept going in and out even standing beside it. I'm somewhat tech savvy and tried playing with the settings but never got it to work with a stable signal so I bought a motorola instead that has simultaneous dual band. Sorry but not cool guys - where's the transparency!?",

The speed is faster and the range is stronger. My recommendation is to get a separate router and modem that way as technology changes then it will be easier to keep up with it and replace.",

This is a pretty basic thing to customize, so for those looking for particular capabilities that you would have in a standalone wireless router, please double check that this can support the functions you need. Had I known about the limited customization capabilities of this device I would have probably purchased something else. Otherwise the modem works fine with Charter cable service. The wifi also seems to work, although I haven't put it through its paces.",

Good modern look and does not take up too much space. 2. Signal strength is good throughout the house. 3. Easy to setup Negatives: 1. Slows down after a few days. I end up power cycling the unit and that has seemed to help. (need to check if this is a known issue with some way to resolve it)",

We had to relocate the unit to the second floor in order to get the best possible coverage (such as backyard deck), which was not a problem because there are cable outlets everywhere. Setup was easy. Mother-in-law has had this product for 6 months now and I have had zero calls from her for help with it! Woohoo!",

I contacted Arris customer care, assuming since I bought it in May 2015, it would still be covered under Arris 2 years warranty. But to my shock, based on product serial number Arris said the warranty had expired in July 2014 itself!!! Meaning this product when it was being sold on Amazon was already almost 3 years old. Now I understand what Retail Packaging means....Wasted $127.40",

I called them up, selected the service tier, read them the mac address, it restarted.... they auto pushed 3.3.1 then restarted again... and it pulled down 100+ Mb first try over the 5ghz band no problem.... I didn't have to make any setup changes whatsoever... I would add that the modem was brand new, on 3.1.0, but had firewall enabled with all firewall options including ip flood protect disabled... so it looks like finally all systems go (even for people who only know how to plug it in) on the SBG6580 with Comcast.... enjoy...",
