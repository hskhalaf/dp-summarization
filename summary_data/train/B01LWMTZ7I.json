Maybe other kids can master it but for my son, who already struggles with confidence issues this was a huge fail. He ended up crying every time he tried it, I had to take it away eventually because it was causing too much stress. Will probably opt for a small trampoline.",

I chose this product to help strengthen several skills & muscle tone things we are working on with a pediatric physical therapist. This toy is not disappointing in sneaking practice into play. The foam block squeaks with each bounce (great sensory feedback). The LED lights...took us a little while to figure out. They turn on when the handle is dropped, rather than with bouncing, but still super fun for younger kids. Jumping skills, and using both feet together, along with core strength, ankle/foot strength, and sensory processing needs all being met with this toy. Excellent value for the price (especially compared to \"therapy marketed\" products).",
