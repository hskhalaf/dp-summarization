Unfortunately, I can't recommend it if you want a beach wagon. it gets stuck on the sand and is even less convenient than carrying everything by yourself. I had to return it but don't get me wrong, for everything else I believe is a competent product.",

Would be easier and more efficient than folding and opening and reloading/unloading my supplies in the parking lot each time. I use to carry my craft supplies to and from my after-school classes.
