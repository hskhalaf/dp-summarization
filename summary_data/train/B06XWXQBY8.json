She uses them mostly for nighttime because they make her hands feel secured while she sleeps, as she\u2019s been having some tendon and arthritis issues in some of her fingers. The only drawback is that they come in grey and it\u2019d be great if there were other color options, or at least nude, so they\u2019re not as noticeable. Given my other comment, it would be amazing if there was a version of these to use during the day that could get wet.",

He went to the chiropractor once and it help a bit, he couldn't lift anything heavy or else it would hurt. After that he was in slight pain for two months, we bought a few things to ease the pain but it didn't work until I order this for him. He said it helped a lot, the swollen has gone down (from my perspective). I will buy more if he accidentally rips or damage it. Thank you",

My hands still fall asleep and wake me up at night. I ordered the medium because I measured and normally wear a size 8, but the gloves didn't feel like they were tight enough.

Who would have thought decades of professional photography would take its toll. First tip buy a size smaller, I bought medium, it was very hard to but on, but once on the relief starts. This glove seems to have a tighter weave, hopefully that means the compressibility will last longer.",

I've tried wearing other types of gloves and hand wraps, but I immediately noticed improvements on the first day with this glove. ~10% of the glove is spandex, so it provides a nice stretch and compression around the individual joints of each finger, thumb, and hand. This individual compression helped tremendously, and is something the other gloves I'd worn did not provide. It won't cure arthritis or carpal tunnel, but the amount of relief it provides relative to the cost more than justifies the purchase.",
