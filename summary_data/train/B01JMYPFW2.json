I bought the \"used\" option from the Amazon Warehouse deals, which was much cheaper, and there was only slight damage to the packaging that isn't all that noticeable and is the type of damage items are prone to during shipping so it was a great deal. I recommend checking to see if there are \"used\" Amazon Warehouse deals on the items you buy so you can buy them much cheaper, because this is my second time buying an item with that method and the \"damage\" on both items was barely any damage at all.",

My daughter has to prop it against the wall to play with it. The baby beds do not clip in well to the cart either so they slip off easily. This set is probably less frustrating for a child 5 and over.",
