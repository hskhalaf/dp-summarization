Combining the two products works well healing the more persistent irritations. This is an effective ointment that has a pleasant, clean fresh scent. I will definitely purchase this product again.

You won\u2019t likely need to replace it during your infants first year. It should be something that every parent keeps in their home as it can also be used to treat scrapes, burns, eczema, psoriasis and other irritants of the skin.

So when he gets occasional diaper rash or a little case of the runs where he needs multiple diaper changes in a very short period of time, he gets irritated from the frequent wiping. A+D has been the best product for his tender bottom.",
