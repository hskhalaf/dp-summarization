If I could change one thing, it would be for the bra to have a smooth front as the lines show through some shirts....all in all, not so bad as I rather have the lines show through than have my boobs spread about making them (and me) look even bigger.",

It does not dig into my shoulders and the underwire doesn't poke my ribs or press super tightly. The band is so smooth and soft and eliminates back rolls!! HUGE PLUS. Only con, the underwire does creak slightly upon first wearing it. It's not as severe as other bras I've had, but it's still there. I just have to say, for large breasted girls, it's TRUE to size, so comfortable I can sleep in it, and a very decent bra for support.",

It looks good under snug shirts, even with the barely noticeable seam. I count this one as a win and will be ordering another!",

      "text": "I was looking for a new bra and after reading reviews I gave it a try. I really like the fit and my only two drawbacks are 1-the pattern can show through fitted clothing and 2- just a little more protection from the cold would offer a lot more confidence. I like the fit and the color though I just have to be careful I don\u2019t get too cold wearing it in public",

But the band was so small I couldn't even clasp it. If I had to guess I'd say it was more like a 32 or 34. The straps were also really short. And I usually have my straps tightened way down. Its like they took a small bra and just put larger cups on it. Other than that it was nice looking and felt like good quality. I really wish the sizing was more accurate, because i really wanted this bra to work.",

The problems with buying bras online though is you have to actually wear it and use it to see if it works... and then cant return it when it doesn't. Bummer",
