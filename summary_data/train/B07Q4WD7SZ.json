I also love the fact that i could install the tubing first then break areas of the line where i most need the mist to install the T units. My neighbors were amazed with my work today. They all inquired with me on where to purchase the units. Another thing i love is the fact that the T units rotate to angle the mist either toward my house or away from it depending on which way i have the tubing hung. I have attached a short video please enjoy this womens handy work.",

The 2nd issue I had was the fitting for the outside faucet didn\u2019t fit..... if you run into that problem go to Home Depot and purchase and adapter size 3/4 in FH x 3/4 in MIP (tapped 1/2 in FIP). Give it a try you can\u2019t go wrong. The price is worth it.",

The directions didn't mention anything about the misting length, I just read that when I came to leave a review. I also bought a 10' extension hose and wish I had bought one maybe that was 15'. I would highly recommend these for anybody who is considering misters. Thank you!!",
