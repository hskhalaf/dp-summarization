It came with wheels but since I don't have the option of moving it I didn't attach the wheels. But I did put it together all by myself in about 10 minutes with two sleeping babies in the next room.

FYI the direction you hook the bags in unit matter. My OCD was activated because the empty bags didn't line up evenly, but a simple 180 rotation of the bag had everything lined up nicely.",
