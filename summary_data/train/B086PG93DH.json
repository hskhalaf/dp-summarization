That's with listening to music, steaming and browsing on the internet. The camera is good quality. Well worth the money, you won't be disappointed! P.S.

There are great reviews out there for the functioning of the phone and my daughter was delighted with it, but the customer service is non-existent if you have a problem. Unfortunately she dropped the phone and almost two months later Realme have been unable to send a replacement screen to their UK repair agents. The only way to contact Realme is via an email to a Paris office and they have not responded to my messages. The UK repair agents, I believe, are trying to do what they can but continue to wait for parts and official repair instructions. Avoid.",

As a telephone, the loudspeaker and microphone are good and clear. The battery lasts me about 2 or 3 days and charging takes about 30 minutes max. Contrary to reports, I have not experienced it heating up The Realme overlay is not bad at all - very easy to get used to and allows as much customisation as I want. The only difficulty I had was in obtaining a cover for it - gel cases are easy come by but a full cover is hard to come by.",

You may be losing out slightly on camera tech compared to most top end flagship phones, but still a great camera. The screen is great and having a 90hz refresh rate for this price is amazing. Easy to use and the realme UI is great. Headphone port is there which is a bonus. Couldn't recommend more for anyone who wants great specs but at a budget price. Won't be beaten in 2020",

Pro's - Price, screen quality, battery life, camera, power (in this price range) Con's - Plastic back/body The only negative is that the body and rear is plastic rather than the usual aluminium/glass of the more costly alternatives.
