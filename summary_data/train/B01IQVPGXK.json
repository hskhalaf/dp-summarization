One option is bundle up the wire and make a wad of wire that looks awful or cut and solder the wires witch weakens the string. The instructions say i can link 10 strings, thats a lot of extra wire to mess with. Brighttech should shorten the pig tails and make this product better..",

I was pleasantly surprised that they are VERY bright and give a great vintage look. We loved them so much, we ordered another set. The wire and plugs are made out of very rugged wire. These are quality for sure!",

      "text": "I've had 2 strings of these up on my patio and love them. They have a nice warm light that puts out the right amount of light for the area. This string has the bulbs placed every three feet where other strings have them every two feet. This was a concern to begin with, but where I strung them it became a non-issue. It is heavy-duty outdoor cord - good for leaving out all year long but does add a little weight when hanging (each string is 7-8 pounds). I've added a photo with the lights just before dark. There's a light on the house near the door that is a cold white which you could use for comparison.",

UPDATE: I got a two sets of these lights, and then also got these dimmers (Leviton TBL03-10E Tabletop Slide Control Lamp Dimmer)  Even though the dimmers are for interior use, the area I have the lights outdoors is mostly protected. The dimmers work pretty well with these string lights although it is not a complete dimming (about 1/3 the light intensity of the full-on). There is no noticeable hum from the lights with these dimmers, but outdoor sounds (gentle breeze in the leaves, etc) may mask that if there is any sound.",

The devil is in the details... while Brightech accurately describes the size of the lights and length of the strands - admittedly, I should have read the fine print. To achieve the look shown in some of their promotional photos, you would need to overlap and stagger 2-3 strands. I have two longer strands purchased from another company, and those lights are 18\u201d apart - compared to 36\u201d for these. I like the other ones better. 3\u2019 is too wide apart for me.",

      "text": "These lights are a great addition to our patio. I joined the 48' and 24' strands. Knocked off 1 star because when I joined the 2 strands together, there was double the amount of space between the lights of the joined sections. Brightech should really be able to space the lights properly to be able to join together without 6' of wire. I highly recommend the dimmer, which I purchased. It is great to be able to have it well light when needed and then turn it down as needed. Plenty bright at just 1 watt. I wish the bulbs were shatter resistant, instead of glass but overall very happy.",

They replied quickly and said I could purchase more of their bulbs at 8 dollars/bulb to replace and they would be warrantied... The string itself seems sturdy, they look great and low wattage bulbs for night time use however, a word to the wise.. the bulbs are VERY FRAGILE - several broken after 2 months of use - a small bump against a porch or railing will break the bulb. Seems strange that they would be so fragile for outdoor use. Out of the window for return :(",
