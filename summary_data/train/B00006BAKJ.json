Its signal range was also very short requiring very close placement to any radio device. I was a little skeptical of the molded wire when I first saw it that was until the mini-jack end started to slide out and finally rendered the device useless.",

In addition, it's really easy to accidentally turn on the iRock. Since the on/off button is located on the front of the device, it often turns itself on when being transported.

Southern Atlanta is problematic due to a 100,000 watt radio station at 88.5 but this is unusual. Apparently there is a bad design in the product that makes the wires leading out unstable and fragile After about 3 months the right channel stopped working, and soon I found myself constantly fiddling with the unit to try to get it to re-establish contact. It gets old pretty quick let me tell you. So if you wanna buy something that will last only a few weeks, you're making a great choice.",

      "text": "It works but the output power isn't high enough to really useful especially if you live in an area where there are lots of radio stations. If you move more than 10-15 ft away from the FM receiver, you will start to get static along with the signal. Alternate solutions to consider are the 900Mhz devices that include a transmitter and receiver. But of course those devices generally cost more.",

    "title": "First International Digital irock! 300W Car FM Modulator",
    "description": "irock! has taken an insightful leap sideways in its approach to wireless audio transmission with the 300W Wireless Music Adaptor. This device allows you to play audio from MP3 or portable CD player via a wireless link to any FM radio within a 3-10 metre range. It connects to the audio output or headphone jack of mini disc player, laptop or a good old audio cassette player. The combination of an MP3 player with a powerful memory and the irock! provides a formidable portable music collection that can be used in the car, through a home unit or anywhere there is an FM radio. Requiring no software and operating on one of four frequencies in case of interference from radio stations, it is recommended that it should be within three metres of the radio and as far from the audio source as the cord allows.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe irock! 300W wireless music adapter lets you listen to any portable music device over any FM tuner and speaker setup, without a clumsy or constricting cable hookup. It's the perfect way to simply and efficiently listen to MP3s, CDs, minidiscs, and other formats in the comfort of your car or living room. Just plug the irock! 300W into the headphone jack of your portable device, tune your radio to one of four preselected frequencies (88.1, 88.3, 88.5, or 88.7 FM), and crank up your tunes. The irock! 300W's operating range (limited by FCC regulations) is 10 to 30 feet, depending on environmental conditions and the quality of the FM receiver.\n\n The tiny (1 by 2 by 3 inches), lightweight (2.5 ounces) irock! 300W is powered by two AAA batteries (not included). It features a simple on-off switch on the front and a red LED that lights up when the unit is on. It comes with a six-foot flexible antenna that folds into the irock! 300W to protect its plug when not in use.",
