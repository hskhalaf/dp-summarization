      "text": "I bought this for my 10 month old granddaughter. She plays with it all the time and squeals and laughs, so I gave it 4 stars for that reason. It slides around and she isn't walking yet, although she is standing, so I put it on the carpet hoping that would keep it from sliding. She still was able to push it over or push it around, which would cause her to fall. I could just take the legs off, but she likes to pull up and stand, so instead I put it between two chairs up against our book shelf, so now it is a more stable.",

It is lightweight and she pushes it if she rest her body on it over the carpet so I can imagine it slips much easier on wooden or other floor material. I work long hours and my husband is a stay home dad! And this has been a lifesaver for him! Would definitely recommend keeping in mind that it may slipped if baby pushes it to stand!",

It\u2019s so refreshing that it doesn\u2019t have obnoxious squeaky kid voices talking or singing loudly every time the baby moves something on it. Just fun jazzy music/ drums sounds and other instruments, and a voice that calls out a few numbers of she hits the number keys. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s fun and cute. But it DOES slide around easily because it\u2019s so light weight. So you need to keep it next to a wall so if baby pushes on it and it slides, at least the wall will stop it",

I left the legs which my son loved playing with more than the board but the corners are so sharp, and he's not that coordinated but advanced I was afraid he's injure an eye.

Definitely one of the most enjoyable to listen to and most played with noise toys in my house!",

It was great when he was just learning to stand up and he still uses it sometimes now even though he's starting to walk. I saw that some people said that it slid around too much or that the baby would flip it when they pulled up. We didn't have that problem, but we had it on one of those puzzle piece foam flooring things, so I think that helped with traction.",

      "text": "Really fun features on this play table, which my son has loved from age 8mo to now at nearly 11mo! There\u2019s a center \u201cbook\u201d with a \u201cpage\u201d you can flip to totally change the sounds that the table makes. On one page, the buttons on the table mostly play music; on the other page, the buttons play words and sounds. The downside of this table is it doesn\u2019t stay up super well with stronger babies, but I wedged ours in a corner and that has helped :)",
