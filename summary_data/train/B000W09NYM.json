      "text": "As a Pilates trainer, I've purchased many brands & styles of Pilates Magic circles. When I purchased this model (which says Aero Pilates on the handles) to match up with other Magic Circles from Stamina (my other circles say Magic Circle on the handles) I was seriously disappointed. I purchased 5, and none of them have any resistance to them. They appear oval, not circular. When you press on the handles, the magic circle compresses almost 100%. I don't know if this is a different Stamina model, or if the production quality has simply gone down dramatically. There are other Magic circles on the market that provide better resistance - this order is being returned.",

My mother is doing physical therapy and finds this to be a great tool during her sessions. She took this one in and her therapist pronounced it authentic after inspecting and doing a side by side with the ones they have. Besides that vote for authenticity of this product, the ring is pretty firm and well constructed. Lots of versatile uses for both exercise and rehab.",
