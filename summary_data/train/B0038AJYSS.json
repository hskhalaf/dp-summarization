There are a variety of little activities to keep the little ones engaged and distract them from wanting to play on my computer, at least for a bit. They can learn animals, letters, and a few other simple things. My 2 and 5 yr old were equally entertained by it.",

My grandson loves his dog, Scout, so I'm sure he'll like the Leaptop, too. What I like is the fact that it is easy to use and holds up well under toddler abuse. The activities also hold the young people's attention for much longer than toys usually do.",

They both like the feature that says their names when you turn it on, and it gives it that personal touch. As far as graphics go, it's pretty basic (no color, animation is really simple), but for the price it's a fun toy overall. I think it's a good toy in the today's society especially because almost everything we do in today's world is on a computer, so I think it crucial that kids learn and are familiar with computer functions from an early age.",

Cons: My only complaint is that there shoud be more variety in e-mails, blogs and songs. We should be able to download more to the computer than we can now.

That being said, if you know this about the product, I don't think you would be disappointed. It is fun and does entertain my 15-month old. He knows a lot of words and speaks about 25, partly attributable to the repetitive nature of these types of toys.",

I love that you can have it say her name, and also have the correct spelling. My daughter's name is not spelled the way it typically is, so that was a big plus! I love the little messages you can customize, and the fact that you can pick what songs that it plays. My daughter took to this toy right away! She loves it. It is our car toy. It is super easy for her to figure out (where some of the toddler laptops are not so easy). Thanks leapfrog for making another fantastic product!",

I am passed the allow return policy window and Leapfrog has only given me a suggestion to clean out the battery compartment and insert new batteries but this has not helped.
