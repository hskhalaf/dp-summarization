      "text": "I cannot stress enough, if you build a surround sound, you need to start with a good center channel speaker. This one is amazing. Good weight, good build quality and amazing sound. On my system I'm running r26f's as front surrounds, r14m's as rear surround and the r25c as the center with a 10\" Klipsch sub as well. The r25 was the last speaker I got in the mail and it made all the difference when I replaced the old Sony center speaker that was still hanging around from my rookie 5.1 system. IMO Klipsch handily outperforms Bose systems that are twice the price. Buy this speaker with confidence.",

      "text": "I recently installed this R-25C to match their R-15M bookshelf speakers. I have had JBL over the years and decided, for recent Fathers Day, I would replace them. Both my surround speakers remain JBL. The R-25C has a little better clarity in a much smaller package, which is a nice plus for my movie watching. My Denon AVR-S910W, handles my complete system. These Klipsch speakers have been a nice upgrade and highly recommend for a small room like mine, 10X12. I mid size room would be 12 X 18 in my estimation, which these speakers would work just fine.",

Both were purchased by the same seller and the entire process went as well as can be expected. This center speaker is a big step up from the basic Polk speaker that I replaced. I can honestly say that if you purchase this, you should be extremely satisfied! I really love the way this sounds, especially when playing Blu Ray DVDs recorded with Dolby Atmos. Voices are crystal clear and in my opinion, the sound is amazing, even while playing any DVDs. Totally and completely satisfied with this purchase \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

I figured if I loved my older model the next step up would be even better. Boy was I right. This is by far the best center channel I have ever heard. Very clear audio that makes it sound as if the character on the screen was actually in the room with you. The golden cones look very elegant and the provided grill looks very sleek as well and attaches very easily. It also removes easily, but not so much as to worry you about it randomly falling off.

The sound is very clear for movies, video games, etc. I have no complaints at all....Klipsch definitely knows what they are doing when it comes to speakers.",

      "text": "I've always had big big center speakers. The trouble is they usually weigh BIG too! My shelf under the display is 5' long tempered glass with a weight limit of 50#. Over the past 5 years I've seen it develop a sag from the weight of a 42 pound center speaker. And I can't simply flip it over to straighten it out due to the fixtures in place that hold it. So I sold that ($1199 Retail Price!) speaker and bought this Klipsch. I'm not interested in timbre matching, it's overrated as far as I'm concerned. While I lost some audio quality, I didn't lose all that much IMO. Sounds great, looks good. What else does one need?",

      "text": "It has awesome sound. Crisp and clear. So far it works exactly as I expected... actually it is a little better than I was expecting. I went to best buy and listened to the floor demo they had on display. They wouldn't price match, because the one I purchased was not sold and shipped by Amazon. Nonetheless, the Amazon sale price and shipping was significantly less than what Best Buy's sale was. It arrived in the same box as the R-15 M bookshelf speakers.",
