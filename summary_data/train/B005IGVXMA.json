The seller stated it had never been out of the box, well he should have looked because there is something wrong with the focus. All pictures are out of focus and the lens does not retract when turned off. I owned one of these cameras in the past and loved it but I dropped it on ice and it was not repairable. This purchase was refunded by Amazon. Do not buy anything from this site.",

      "text": "This camera seemed like a good purchase until the lens cover stopped opening/closing and the camera was inoperable. I got it fixed - covered by warranty as it was only 6 months old. It worked for about 2 outings and then the same thing happened. The other disappointment is that the pop-up flash is right where you hold the camera so often times the photo needs to be retaken while holding the camera in an awkward manner. Im sure there are better options.",

I have a Nikon D80 for family photos and local use, but the Coolpix S8200 is perfect for trips and activities where I don't want to worry about security. Great detail and response time. The 5-star rating is based on compact design, ease of use, portability, and photo quality.",
