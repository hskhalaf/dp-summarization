I am also bringing 12 shirts, 8 underwear (I will be adding more now), 9 socks. Furthermore, I'm bringing a laptop, charger, mouse, mouse pad, hygiene stuff, portable charger, water bottle, adapter, inflatable pillow, and a few more stuff. All of it fits here. Here i am putting a video i recorded before i was done packing. I am leaving in 2 days, and im glad i was able to pack everything i wanted and then some more here. I hope this helps!",

This is a roomy pack that is comfortable to carry. It seems well made and very sturdy. It did take me some time to sew in a velcro piece for my patch because the material is thick but it worked well.

If wearing any jackets or coats it would be impossible. Otherwise, the design is good and I've numerous molle packs attached to it already. Shoulder straps are suitably-functional.

The weight amount could not have been more than 15lbs in the bag, but on my second day of traveling the stitching had already come undone on two parts of the right shoulder strap making it very uncomfortable on the right side. This was very frustrating as this is supposed to be a tough built outdoor type of backpack and didn't even last two days.",

      "text": "I took this bag out once to go hiking. And failed. The zippers broke right away. There was no back support on it. Threw back pack straps dug into my arm pits. It wasn't a great back pack. Although the only good this that came from this was the little Fanny pack that I turned into a nice first aid kit. And the two pouches work good for my bug out kit. Thee actual bash holds a lot of things but I would now recommend this to any buddy.",
