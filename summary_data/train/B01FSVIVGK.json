Everything is covered in mold and or rusty almost as if it was submersed under water which it has not. I didn't take anything out as the kit weighs 3 times what it should telling me its full of water. I have to believe its years of condensation and widespread temperature change..Nothing is salvageable so the entire kit needs to go into the garbage. What a shame",
