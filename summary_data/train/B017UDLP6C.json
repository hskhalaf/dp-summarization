It has scratched the bottom of the cabinets because of the height issue. Also, the plastic piece that covers the filter on the dirt container is surprisingly flimsy and hard to unlatch.

You can\u2019t leave this thing unattended without it messing up your house, so you might as well just vacuum!",

I was in touch with ONE person who really cared about my problems with the product. When we got to the point where he could make the decision that's best for us he informed his supervisor and they offered 3 workable solutions. I went for an upgrade to the newer version and we love love love it !!! A big \"Thank you!\" to the customer service team for your straightforward help !!!",

Granted it occasionally gets itself into a situation where exiting becomes problematic but we are learning to deal with those furniture configurations. I have found that confining it to a specific area or room is generally the best way to utilize it's talents, though with 3 Labs there is always plenty of work to be done around the house. Very impressed with the battery life. Getting 120 min. runs before needing a recharge and having a remote is a big plus. So overall I'd say we are quite pleased!",

We haven't tried some of the features such as the remote timer or the mop function, but will update the review once we have. It is important to set up the room properly so bObi doesn't get stuck, but that is a minor hassle compared to not having to vacuum.",
