However, it's been a month and like a lot of other earbuds I've had, the charge doesn't last like it did in the beginning. I used to get several hours out of them, now 30mins and the case isn't charging either. SkyBuds customer service, while friendly, not helpful at all. Basically \"too bad\" response. I can post a dozen similar scenarios of the photo posted in this review.",

They fit really well in my ear with their 'locking in' kind of design when fitting in ears. They're comfortable enough to wear all day, if the battery would last that long. The app is nice, to see battery percentage remaining. Cons: I wish I could use the left earbud independently of the right. I'm only getting about 2 hours of play time from the battery. The \"Skydock\" is constantly disconnecting and \"not in range\" notification. The Bluetooth range isn't as good as some, but as good as most.",

While I've only used them for a few phone calls, the microphone seems to work well. Battery life has been good, exactly what I expected. Overall great product.",

With Skybuds, we are dedicated to transforming the on-the-go listening experience by making portable sound not only convenient, but also exceptional.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nSkybuds best address the three pain points associated with earbuds: 1) Connection: Skybuds pioneer the use of Near Field Magnetic Induction (NFMI) technology creating the strongest, most reliable connection available on the market; 2) Battery Life: Skybuds have best-in-class battery life with 24hrs of on-the-go listening; and 3) Fit & Comfort: Skybuds are ergonomically designed to comfortably sit in users\u2019 ears, providing a perfect fit and locking in exceptional sound quality.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nBreathing life into Skybuds and transforming it from a mere idea on a sheet of paper to a physical product has been incredibly rewarding. Every user comment and note of how Skybuds has become a necessity in his/her life drives us to dream of how we can further introduce change to the portable audio world.",
