The ice is soft initially but we bag it and put it in the freezer. Everyone loves the way the cubes look in their drinks and once it\u2019s in the freezer it\u2019s better quality. It\u2019s continuously making ice when we have it on. I use bottled gallon water to fill it and it\u2019s quite easy to clean. I recommended it to my brother n law to use as his ice maker quit working on his fridge. Now I want one for my 5th wheel.",

And its perfect for eating ice!! I am obsessed with eating ice! Plus it says you can put any liquid other then water in it to make flavor ice. I haven't tried it yet but I will eventually",
