I like the compromise between eco consciousness and affordability. ***However, the quality control on these diapers is terrible! About 1/3 have the leg gussets glued to the main part of the diaper. You have to carefully peel them off and it leaves little pieces of torn plastic either on the gusset or--far worse--on the inner lining where the rub against baby's skin. A few were so bad that we tore the inner lining trying to open them. I would NOT buy this again.",

She has never had a diaper rash nor skin rash since using this product. The absorbency is great and i'm satisfied knowing I'm using a safe and quality product on my baby. I recommend these diapers to all my friends and they have all been happy too! The wipes and diaper cream are great too!",

Other brands I've used include: Pampers, Andy Pandy, Up and Up (Target brand). At the end of the day, I've been satisfied with these diapers as far as size and leak protection goes. My baby is on the smaller side so these were perfect size wise. Enjoy1",

The wetness indicator is located awkwardly far back on the diaper, so it can't be relied on. Not a big deal, but worth noting.
