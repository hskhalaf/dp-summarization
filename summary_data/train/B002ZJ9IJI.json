Under each drawer there is a recess of 1/2\u201d. I cut out two pieces of plywood, one for each drawer, and mounted it with some Sheetrock screws. Problem solved. Now the drawers don\u2019t bow under the weight. Aside from that issue, this is a well made cabinet that presents very well. It matches with any espresso or black finishes. Happy with the purchase!",

The drawers pop open when you push one closed so I have to double check that they are closed. Minor inconvenience. I was most concerned about price so I guess I shouldn't complain too much.

The only thing I would say that is negative about this piece is, I cannot figure out how to make it fit standard size file folders rather than legal. Oh well, I bought legal file folders.",

Not enough to say the color is all wrong but if one is expecting a jet black color they won't get that with this item. Laying the pieces out and using he instructions is beneficial in putting it together. Took about 3 hours as a solo project. It does scratch easily and the top extends out further than I expected so that is why I took a star off. It's still nice.",
