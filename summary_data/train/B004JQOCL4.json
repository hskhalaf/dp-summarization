I switched to a multifunction Brother printer/scanner/fax a couple of years ago, and when I found it won't communicate with Windows 10, I realized that I hardly ever used the scanner function. I have files of paper that I just never got around to scanning, because it's so inconvenient. The other night I scanned a whole folder of papers from last year while watching a Rachel Maddow segment on my computer. Desk is all clean! Still have another couple of files of paper to go.",

Support from Visioneer was helpful but they said battery was out of warranty. I would have expected a better battery from a portable scanner.",

At most 6 minutes a week. However the battery needs to be charged by the third week. If the battery becomes depleted it does not work even though you use the power cord until the battery is partially charge. I considered buying a new battery but did not want to spend money on a new battery only for the same thing to happen.",

The software worked at first but seems to have trouble detecting the scanner recently. I haven't looked into the problem yet, but it's not a knock on the scanner itself.",

    "description": "MOBILITY: EXPERIENCE THE FREEDOM OF TRUE MOBILITY. SCAN WITHOUT A COMPUTER, CABLES OR SOFTWARE\nWhat is mobility? It means easy-to-use technology that is flexible enough to use anywhere you are, untethered, fully compatible with your world and gear. It means information at your fingertips, integrated devices, small in size, high in performance, all the while being affordable and reliable. Until today, scanners have been, at best, portable. They were small and easy to travel with. But now it is time to think about mobility in a whole new way. Introducing Visioneer Mobility, the first truly mobile scanner that lets you scan anywhere without a computer, cords or software. You can even scan to your smartphone using the USB cable that came with your phone.\n\nFreedom from cables and software. Scan at 300 dpi to JPG or PDF format--anywhere.View larger RELIABLE AND EASY TO USE\nVisioneer Mobility is a small color scanner that is powered by a rechargeable battery. No computer or power connection is required to start scanning. Simply turn on the scanner, select one of three file formats (color PDF, black and white PDF or color JPG), and insert your document. Your scanned items are saved to an SD memory card (2GB card included) or a USB flash drive. Alternately, if you attach the scanner to a smartphone, your scans are saved to the phone's internal memory. Visioneer Mobility takes only 10 seconds to scan a full page at 300 dpi, and you can scan 300 pages per charge. With Visioneer's AutoLaunch technology, scanning begins as soon as documents are inserted into the scanner.\n\nOPTIONAL WIRELESS CAPABILITY\nMobility can also scan your documents and wirelessly transfer the scanned JPG files with an optional Eye-Fi card (not included) inserted into your scanner. Eye-Fi is an SDHC memory card that has built-in Wi-Fi. It stores the images on your card and uses your wireless network to effortlessly transfer these images to your computer and over 25 online destinations such as Evernote, Picasa, Facebook, Shutterfly, and MobileMe. Don't run out of space on your Eye-Fi card with the Endless Memory feature that automatically makes space when your images have been safely delivered.\n\nNUANCE PAPERPORT AND OMNIPAGE PRO\nMillions of professionals rely on PaperPort to save time and money by transforming paper documents into searchable digital documents. PaperPort combines the efficiency of document management, the convenience of superbly scanned documents and the power of creating PDF files, to bring a new level of operational proficiency to your organization. Nuance OmniPage Pro Provides a precise OCR and layout retention solution, quickly turning scanned documents into editable, formatted text. The text can then be used in virtually any word processing, desktop publishing or web publishing program.\n\nNEWSOFT PRESTO! BIZCARD\nNewSoft Presto! BizCard is the ideal tool for helping you stay in touch with your worldwide contacts whether their business cards are printed in English or a pan-European language. Presto! BizCard quickly and easily converts the vital contact information on business cards into a convenient, searchable, digital database that can be easily synchronized between PCs, notebooks, PDAs and PIMs.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\nVisioneer Mobility Cordless Color Scanner, recharging/data cable and AC wall adapter, 2GB SD memory card, carrying case, DVD with manual and bonus software.\n\n\nMOBILITY AT A GLANCE\n * Scan documents, receipts, photos, business cards, plastic ID cards\n * Scan to smartphone, SD card or USB Flash Drive\n * No computer required to scan\n * Scan 300 pages per battery charge\n * With AutoLaunch, scanning begins as soon as you insert the page",
