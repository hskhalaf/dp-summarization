      "text": "This is a good overall printer that is versitile and produces good prints. But... As others have pointed out, it goes through ink cartridges quickly. This printer has the advantage that it uses multiple ink cartridges. if you run out of one color, you don't have to replace them all. But, this also produces the perception that it is always about to run out of some color. So, Buy backup cartridges and have them ready. This printer requires FIVE cartridges. Which are generally purchased as three seperate retail packages: * Black 564, * Photo Black 564 * Cyan-Magenta-Yellow combo pack 564. So you should have backups of all of those items.",

When it works, this printer really does a whole bunch of things and it does it well. I never had any problem scanning documents or pictures. The print out quality is excellent and crisp.

This printer has problems with paper feed and ink usage. It will feed several sheets of paper at one time. Sometimes the ink will just squirt out causing a big \"blob\" on the page. It wastes a lot of ink and expensive photo paper. The wireless network was very easy to setup but after many hours of effort, I still am unable to get the bluetooth printing to work. It just says the device is paired but not connected. Nothing I try can get it to connect.",

It doesn't get any easier. Quality is good for a home user as is the speed. Since it has a sleep mode, I just leave the thing on which saves energy as compared to my habits of use for the former printer I had. Two thumbs up for HP.",

I had to call again for assistance in downloading software - another two hours!!! I nearly sent the printer back, but finally, after several tries to make it work, it is now working as it should.",

      "text": "I did a lot of research on wireless printers. Among the other features I was looking for were double-sided printing capability, scanning and copying (didn't need to fax). Overall, I'm very happy with the printer. The first picture I printed looked great, and printed pages look fine. My only complaint is that it takes a while for a page to print (seems to be at least 30 seconds from the time I press print until I hear the printer printing).",

Also, it doesn't print a white border on photos...all are borderless.",
