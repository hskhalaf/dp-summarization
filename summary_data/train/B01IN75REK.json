I love how it is versatile because you can change the height of both the bottom and the top rack and the hanging pole can be moved forwards or backwards. As someone who doesnt have any skills or experience assembling things, this had great directions and was easy to do. Would definitely recommend.",

They are definitely not as sturdy as previous similar shelving that I have bought. Casters are also very cheap.",
