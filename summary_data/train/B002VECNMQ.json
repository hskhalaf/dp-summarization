      "text": "These work well provided they will not tip over. The piece on the bottom is what detects the water and while it is detachable, if kept in tact with the rest of the unit, it needs to be standing upright. For instance, we had one placed under our sink and luckily I noticed that it had been tipped over before we had a leak, but in general it is not a very good design. It does work though. Our main drain backed up and one of these little guys started going off as soon as the water started to back up onto the floor.",

It should be placed vertical up, as the sensor/end-points are at the bottom. Double sided tape should keep it from fliping over on its belly or back which will defeat its purpose. FirstAlert can think of providing a double sided tape instead of screws. Near sump-pump and other locations I pulled the extension cord out and put the sensor ends to the floor/surface with a wooden block on top so it stays in place. I placed the alarm itself on a shelf.",

These can catch condensation problems before damages begin. The only flaw I see, is that I can't daisy chain the probes together. Our blower units are about 4 feet wide with 2 drip pans. I'd like to put probes in 3 locations. If I could buy a sensor and purchase leapfrog probes, than this product would be perfect.",
