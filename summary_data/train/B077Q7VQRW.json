      "text": "An appliance repairman told me that the worst thing you could do for a self cleaning oven is to use the self cleaning feature....the high heat ruins the appliance. I have used Carbona laundry stain treatments for years and they are fabulous. So, I thought I would try this product for the stove. The label said it was safe for self cleaning ovens. My stove had not been cleaned for a while. This product has NO SMELL. Left it on for 4 hours. IT WORKED MIRACLES. VERY LITTLE ELBOW GREASE NEEDED. OVEN IS SPARKLING. THANK YOU CARBONA..GREAT PRODUCT...GREAT PRICE. WILL BE BUYING MORE. YOUR GRILL / OVEN RACK CLEANER WORKS GREAT TOO.",
