      "text": "My sister did her science fair project in middle school on this stain remover. She tested a few others with hard dried on stains and Zout did the best on every stain. So now years later I still use this as my stain remover and it still works just as well as ever. My most amazing story with this remover is when my son stained his paints a very dark brown on light gray sweats. The stain wasn\u2019t treated and went through the drier. (That\u2019s the death of a stain, sending it through the drier). But I sprayed it like crazy with Zout and sent it through the wash again anyway and the stain came completely out! Amazing!",

Not only is he a very messy eater, but his hygiene is not so great, which means we frequently have stained stinky clothes. I have to admit that I was starting to go slightly crazy, but this stain reliever and Lysol laundry sanitizer have been life-changing. I feel confident if it works for our issues, it should work for almost any stain.",

The t-shirt I used it on is now worse than it was with the stains on it. As you can see by my picture, it took the color right off my shirt.

LUCKILY, I had an almost empty bottle of it, so I have been forced to open the cap of the new arrivals and pour into old bottle - quite frustrating so I am lowering my star to 4.",
