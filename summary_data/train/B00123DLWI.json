This product did not totally remedy the situation, but our seats are cleanest they have been since we purchased the boat. I used a soft brush.",

I, then, used Babe's Boat Care spraying directly on seats and using clean white cloths/towels, then a bar scrub brush. This worked great. I just bought pack of white washcloths and when one was dirty, I used the next and so forth. Then took the small hand bar scrub brush purchased at the all things a Dollar store to finish the job. LOVE IT!! My seats were gross, heavily covered top to bottom and overdue for cleaning. Definitely buying again and again.",
