      "text": "I went to a neighborhood party and they had the Blazin Watermelon Tap... Everyone loved it! The only problem is you need to order two, so you have a watermelon on standby. I just ordered 3 more and will bring as the perfect party gift. Bring a watermelon filled with vodka with the Blazin Watermelon Tap and tell them to keep the tap as a gift. TOTALLY COOL. And FYI, the crappy plastic ones dont work and they leak precious vodka all over. Cheers, you will thank me :-)",

      "text": "Shank is too short - I get that they want to give \"maximum extraction\", but I spent an extra 10mins thinning out the rind of a large pumpkin enough to fit both the stabilizer and nut on the inside. Once I did, the 'wall' was too thin and after 10 pulls the tap started to break thru the hole! Good thing I used a 'test pumpkin' with water first. I got a second pumpkin, went to hardware store and bought a larger (but thinner) washer to better stabilize -- we'll see how it goes! I'm sure they won't re-cast the shank, but it's just too short...maybe it will work better in the summer with watermelons!",

Despite this, a major leak started after only a few people used the tap. My pumpkin punch drained onto the floor during my party and got all over the rug. I had too much punch in the pumpkin (and in my brain) and couldn\u2019t transfer it to any other bowl...so it kept leaking and distracted my guests as they continuously tried to fix it. This was a nice idea but I wouldn\u2019t use this particular product again.",

It needs a longer threaded shank and a stand off type of screen/filter to keep the flow going if there is any debris in the melon. I would have had better luck with a larger melon and mounting the tap higher than the smaller round melon we had to use.",
