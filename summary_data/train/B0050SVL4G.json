      "text": "Bought two of them to go at the ends of our dining table and couldn't be more pleased with this product. My 11 year old son had them assembled within a few minutes while I was at work. I applied a few coats of Minwax stain (use pre-stain wood conditioner) so that it would match the table I built then the next day wiped them down with boiled linseed oil. They are beautiful, very sturdy, and highly functional. Could also be used as a coffee table if the dimensions suit you.",
