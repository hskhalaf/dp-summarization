      "text": "Overall this product is really great but I'm giving it a one star due to the fact that I plugged it into my htc u11 to test it out, only listening to music for about a minute, then out of no where when I go to unplug it I almost burnt my hand from the jack being extremely hot. This is a serious hazard for burning or even exploding so I don't believe anyone should buy, it may be a defect with the one I bought but that doesn't mean it can't happen to others so be careful.",

The volume \"slider\" worked and the play/pause button worked. The entire build is very cheap and I doubt these headphones would last long.",
