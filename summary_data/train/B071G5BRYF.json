Simply double the bungy around the cargo frame and then hook both ends to the inner rib of the Kayak. Same for other side. Simple wrapping as instructed and your boat will slip out withing 10 feet of pulling. Other than that five stars. And price is spot on.",

I rolled my kayak (120 lbs) over some rough terrain and it handled well. It\u2019s also light weight enough that I keep the cart attached to my kayak while transporting the yak in my truck bed. I just make sure the straps are tight enough. The straps come with a ratchet. I had to add some foam to the contact area because the existing foam pads aren\u2019t big enough and the exposed bar contacts my yak. Other than that I\u2019m very happy with it overall.",

This definitely makes transportation so much easier and was well worth the price.",

Update: 9/15/19: Finally tightened each spring bolt so that the carrier will not collapse. But at least now it works for me.",
