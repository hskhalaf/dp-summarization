Being that this is the retail model it only carries a one year warranty. All the units I have installed are crapping the bed shortly one year after installation. If you want the five year warranty you better purchase from a distributor. No one will help in this matter as they pretty much shut the door in our faces. DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!!",

I have been troubleshooting it's connectivity for several weeks now and have determined that the internal wifi adapter just blows. I'm pretty bummed out though because their app is great when the thermostat is connected to the wifi and it's convenient to use, but unfortunately it has serious issues connecting and staying connected to the wifi.",

      "text": "Thermostat has been installed for 8 months. In the past, my electric bill has been considered an efficient home. Over the past few months I\u2019ve noticed my bill continuously drifting up. My December bill was twice as much as last year. Turns out, the thermostat always uses heat strips to heat the house by more than 2 degrees. According to Honeywell, this is a \u201cfeature\u201d to ensure user \u201ccomfort\u201d. Not efficient at all! Has probably cost me $1000 extra in electric this year. Honeywell has a serious flaw in the software and acknowledges it. Better off buying a Nest or Ecobee.",
