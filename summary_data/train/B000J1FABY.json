If I turn the bass up and mess with treble and mid then it helps out some. But it\u2019s still not enough.

Installation was pretty easy but sound quality was better on the original, almost 20 year old, Honda original speakers. Wouldn't recommend unless you're only looking to spend the less mount of money possible just so you can still listen to your car stereo!",
