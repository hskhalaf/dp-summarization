Although the Husqvarna is brand new and all the controls are mounted by my hands, I like my old Ariens better. I live in Vermont and we have a LOT of snow. The Husqvarna is underpowered for a 24\" auger, unless the snow is very light. My biggest complaint is that REVERSE is really SLOW. As a result, I usually have to drag the machine backwards manually which is a pain. However, for the price I paid it is not a bad machine so far.",
