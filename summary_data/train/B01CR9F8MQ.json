Due to the sole design, with a circle spot allowing for quick turns and directional change, they are especially great for dance related classes such as Jazzercize and Zumba. Ryka only manufactures women's shoes, so they are designed for the female foot. I've gone through all the big name brands, starting with Reebok, New Balance, Nike, and many more. I have no interest in surfing the brands any longer, as I've found the perfect shoe for my profession.",

I had tried and returned about a half dozen shoes before finding this one. The extra strap at the midfoot gives added support to my arch area where I had some tendon repair. Great shoe, lightweight, flexible, but extremely supportive where it needs to be. I'll be ordering this one over and over.",

I tried three different inserts- even doubled some up to take up the extra room, but nothing works. My feet are killing me after 15 minutes. If I could find a place that carries them I would try a smaller size but I have only found them online. It's too bad. I loved these but I won't buy them again after this",

I bought these to help me from falling and hurting myself while working out, and having a nice looking shoe that I can go out and do errands in as well. These are by far the most comfortable and supportive shoes I've found for supporting my ankles. I would definitely get these if you have weaker ankles like me! Plus they look great in person.",

This one is very small and is in fact recessed, so instead of allowing you to pivot on the ball of the foot, it grips, negating the whole point. My knees hurt more after wearing these.",

It does not seem like it's coming apart yet but I will update this review if that iccurs.",

Actually the top portion was 'clunky' where the ties laced through the gray artificial leather and the shoe would not lace tight enough for me. I have narrow feet but had on a thicker sock to try these - I ordered a 9.5 but found my toe was touching the end so I would have needed a 10. The shoe looked better in the photo than in real life -- too young looking for me and too many straps.",

Very stylist looking shoe, I ordered size 8.5 and even after adding extra thick foot bed I have to wear extra thick socks to take up the extra space. I think I could have ordered an 8 instead. Already worn so can't return.",
