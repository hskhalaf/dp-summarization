Doesn\u2019t cope well with them and to stop the motor getting clogged I recommend a 50amp in-line fuse /breaker which Tripped often while in the weeds which saved the motor from possibly burning out. Also one more thing, reverse is practically non existent, but this seems to be a common problem with trawling motors.",
