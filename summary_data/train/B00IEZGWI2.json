This monitor gave me the refresh rate to prevent ghosting in shooters. And the colors for my immersion into rpg's. So far I haven't had any issues with it. I use dual monitors and this one is for gaming. The stand isnt adjustable but my chair is, so thats not a problem.",

The Displayport connector helps the computer display the 4K picture at 60 Hz, which makes it very fluid - esp. so in games.

Some of the more expensive monitors don't improve on this enough for the huge price difference. Others in this price range only do 30fps at 4K which is not great for use as a computer monitor.

This model does have great stats for a very good price but BOTH monitors have the problem described in other posts of \"going to sleep\" or never really waking up when the PC is turned on. \"Check Signal Cable\". We tried different cables, different outlets, different outputs (the PC has 2 video cards) and different power strips. Since this problem seems to have been around for a while per internet posts and Samsung keeps shipping them out anyway we will be replacing these with something other than Samsung monitors. Good stats and a great price do not mean much if the units are this problematic.",
