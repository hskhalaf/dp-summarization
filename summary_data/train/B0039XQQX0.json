I used this receiver daily for gaming, movies...you name it and never had a problem. Though I did call customer server way back in the day and they were terrible. On the down side you can't update the firmware without taking the receiver in for service, I could never be bothered. A electronic that gave me great performance for so long and without any issues I can't knock. Good bye fine lady.",

I replaced a 5-yeard old Pioneer receiver with no HDMI passthrough and I was looking at other brands but based on all the positive reviews I found for this unit, I decided to get it. I was not disappointed. The only change I made to the settings after running the auto-setup was to give the sub a bit more bass. Other than that, it completely changed the sound of my home theater setup and I was able to take out several cables from my setup and run just one HDMI cable to the TV.",

Because of the way it so accurately calibrates your specific types of speakers to the distance from the microphone (that is supplied), my surround hasn't ever sounded better. Even the learning remote it comes with i found far easier to setup than other learning remotes and its basic setup is very logical. I love this thing.",

I plan to upgrade those as well. The preset sound modes work great. My only problem so far is finding URLs for internet radio streams, you have to enter the precise URL for the online stream to listen to internet radio, which I've not found an easy way to locate. The receiver comes with a few preset URLs, but I listen to only about 3 of them.",
