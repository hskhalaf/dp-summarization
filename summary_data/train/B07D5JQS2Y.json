But the gel strips becoming less sticky over usage is my biggest problem. I haven\u2019t used it since because it won\u2019t stick to my abs without me holding it, so I\u2019ll have to look into cleaning them now to get a good stick again.

It only feels like you\u2019re getting shocked and the directions were not very clear on everything. I waisted my money on this product. DO NOT BUY",
