      "text": "Excellent and a must for any herper interested in reptiles or amphibians of eastern North America. I can't love it yet because so much of the taxonomy is waiting for the DNA work-ups so taxonomists can define relationships better. The last change from Elaphe to Patherophis shook me up good. On the positive side this printing touches on the invasive species but there are many more of them than shown. Soon they will probably be enough to justify a Peterson Guide of their own. I would recommend it highly if you don't have an older copy. But if you have a recent printing skip this one and wait until they have the taxonomy straighten out.",
