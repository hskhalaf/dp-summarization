      "text": "Compact, powerful, light. I use it with the 16-50mm pancake so it is extra portable. I toss it in my bag whenever I leave the house. It does extraordinarily well in low-light settings, perfect for indoor gatherings, dusk activity shots, catching lurkers in the shadows and whatnot. Downsides include resistive touchscreen (unless you're into early 2000's throwbacks), and relatively speedy battery drainage, but neither are sources of deep feelings of regret. The wifi/app stuff/selfie-mode is gimmicky but on its own it is already an excellent camera. If you're thinking about getting one, you should probably do that.",

It has the capability to take some amazing pictures. I am NOT a professional but I love to play around with photography. It is also super simple to share photos. I have learned the best way to get some of the cool in this for this camera is to buy used off Amazon! Cut the price in half!",

We also love that we can upload pictures straight to facebook from the camera. It takes a little time to get it figured out, but for the quality of pictures it takes.. totally worth it! And if you just want to use it for a very basic camera you can do that quite easily. This camera has a lot of great features that you can take advantage of if you choose to.",
