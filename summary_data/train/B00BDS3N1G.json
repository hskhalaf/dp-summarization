On the other hand, the only reason why I give this two stars, is because the tablet was like new when I got it. Impressive for something that's used.",

Now when I attach the charger to my surface it initially signifies it is charging by the light, but then three seconds later it will stop charging (without me touching it or moving it in any way). Microsoft's new supposedly innovative charger connection does not seem to be very durable.",

My biggest complaint would have to be the speakers. I dont know what they were thinking when they made a $1000 device, and put 50 cents worth of speakers in it. I was skeptical of Windows 8, but its right at home on a tablet. The desktop feels like an ad on though. Overall its a great experience. I'm glad I purchased one. I might even be in the market for an RT soon!",
