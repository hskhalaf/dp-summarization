It's built nicely and I heard many sounds on songs that other headphones masked. I don't wear headphones that cover ears for long (as I think the ear gets warm, uncomfortable and start muffling sounds) but this felt good on ears and kept sounds crisp for the 30mins to an hour when I do wear headphones. I am not an audiophile and yes some songs especially older ones might not seem that much different but newer better bit rate digital songs sound awesome.",

Excellent build quality, quite comfortable for this style of phone. As with all speakers/headphones, you're advised to take them for a test drive first (if that's practical).",
