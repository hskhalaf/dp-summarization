They are long and substantial, more than adequately covering the lap, wash and dry very well, and the snaps are easy to use and stay closed. (We did also purchase some with velcro and that quickly fails, rendering the bibs useless.) I do not pre-treat these bibs and we have had no staining, plus the backing truly renders them waterproof, or at least if the terry gets wet the person wearing the bib does not. Thumbs up.",
