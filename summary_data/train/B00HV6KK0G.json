I wanted to be able to capture professional looking photos. To be honest, my first day with this camera, I fell in love with it. I couldn't put it down. It's so easy to navigate and there are so many features! I'll let the photos speak for themselves. The zoom is fantastic. The photo of the bird attached was taken 50 feet away. The clarity is amazing. I highly recommend this camera for someone who is considering to get a DSLR but cannot afford it yet.",

The WiFi is also very easy to set up for transferring images to other devices. It doesn't come with a dedicated battery charger... you charge it like you would your cell phone by plugging the USB cable into the phone. Images taken and the long end of the zoom are predictably not very sharp when used hand-held.",

Learned to hate it, but it broke anyway, so I'm moving on with my new research to locate a better brand. I would not recommend this to a friend or enemy for that matter, Rick",

While using Mobile view finder the Mp used while taking pics is whatever they are on your phone and not the max for the camera. However, the picture quality is nice and the 21X Optical Zoom works great! Will update after my beach trip but so far so good!",

I would have given it a 5 star rating except it has an alternate plan B mini USB connection which requires an adaptor compared to every other mini USB device and cable I have. Yes it comes with a short adapter cable, but since when is only one of those adequate? Otherwise a great pocket camera with excellent function with remote use or not.",

Really like the long telephoto lens and the clear picture it takes. Handy neck strap on the case makes it easily accessible on walks. A really nice camera with a lot of features this old guy is still learning about. Great for photographing deer and birds. Recommend this combination of camera and case, the case is a snug fit but very protective.. Transfers pictures to computer easily and the clarity is amazing on computer screen.",

With a 21X zoom, I was able to take great pictures of areas we couldn't get too close to. No regrets with this camera. Loved everything about it! My daughters also loved the look and feel of it with the white faux leather. It feels good in your hands and cleans up easily. I recommend it 100%!",

The only shortfall I've noticed is that if a picture is modified on the camera (red-eye removal, cropping, filters, etc...) it reduces the picture size to 5 megapixels. I mostly post-process pictures, so this does not affect me very much. The built-in editing tools do what they should and do it well.",

    "title": "Samsung WB350F 16.3MP CMOS Smart WiFi & NFC Digital Camera with 21x Optical Zoom and 3.0\" Touch Screen LCD and 1080p HD Video (White)",
    "description": "The WB350F is the perfect companion for photo-sharing enthusiasts everywhere thanks to its next-generation NFC and Wi-Fi connectivity. Equipped with Samsung\"s brand new \"Tag & Go\" technology, the WB350F can connect to smartphones by simply touching the two devices together. Once paired, users have access to a host of intuitive features which make sharing images fun and simple. Photo Beam instantly transfers images being viewed on the camera to the paired smartphone, while with Auto Share, images are backed up instantaneously, as they are being taken. Using Mobile Link , photographers can select which shots they want to copy over to their smartphone, making it easy to organize the contents of the camera. Also in Remote Viewfinder mode, smartphones can be used to control the WB350F, allowing photographers to enjoy greater shooting freedom. In addition, this camera is capable of uploading original photographs directly to Dropbox.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCapture vibrant images--whether your subject is far away or up close--and share your pictures easily using the Samsung WB350 Smart Camera. Featuring a retro design with a modern touch, the WB350 contains a 16.3-megapixel sensor along with a 21x optical zoom and a 23-millimeter wide-angle lens. Wi-Fi capability makes it simple to send photos and videos or upload them to Facebook or Flickr.\n\nThe 16.3-megapixel BSI (backside-illuminated) CMOS sensor requires less light than conventional sensors.\nView larger.\n\nThe Hybrid Touch User Interface offers two options: use the 5-way button or touchscreen. View larger.\n\nAll your photos and videos are wirelessly transferred and safely stored on your computer. View larger.\n\nUse Remote Viewfinder to frame a group photo or zoom in and out using your smartphone. View larger.\n\n16.3-MEGAPIXEL BACKSIDE-ILLUMINATED CMOS SENSOR\nThe Samsung WB350 Smart Camera is equipped with a 16.3-megapixel backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor that needs less light for proper exposure and quick focus than conventional sensors. This allows you to take properly exposed images in low-light situations. \n\nCOMPOSE SHOTS ON A 3-INCH HYBRID TOUCH DISPLAY\nOn the back of the camera is a brilliant, 3-inch LCD display that lets you compose and review your photos comfortably and accurately. The display has a hybrid user interface that lets you use either the five-way button for menu navigation if you prefer traditional controls or your fingers if you prefer touch controls. \n\n21X ZOOM WITH WIDE-ANGLE LENS\nWith the WB350, you can capture the moment just the way you remember it--whether your subject is up close or far away. Snap a mural that takes up the side of a building, or a field of wildflowers that seems to stretch for miles, using the WB350's 23-millimeter wide-angle lens. Even when you can't get close to your subject, the 21x optical zoom allows you to capture every detail. \n\nWI-FI CONNECTIVITY FOR EASY SHARING\nThanks to built-in Wi-Fi capability, the WB350 makes it easy to post pictures and videos --along with comments--to Facebook, YouTube, Flickr, and other sites. You can also email files to friends and family members or use the Group Share function, which allows you to send images to up to four people simultaneously. The camera also comes with 2 GB of free Dropbox online storage or 50 GB if you also own a GALAXY smartphone. \n\nFULL HD VIDEO RECORDING\nThe WB350 captures lifelike video at 1080p Full HD resolution. The camera shoots video in the H.264 format, which allows you to record for longer than cameras using MJPEG video. \n\nSAVE PHOTOS IN REAL TIME WITH AUTOSHARE\nWith Samsung's AutoShare feature, you can send photos instantly to an NFC-compatible smartphone or tablet--just as you're shooting them--over a Wi-Fi connection. This makes it easy to back up photos and share them wherever you are. \n\nSAMSUNG LINK TO CONNECT WITH OTHER DEVICES\nThanks to Samsung Link, you can connect this camera wirelessly with other nearby Samsung Link-enabled devices and share photos and videos or upload them to your web storage service. \n\nPHOTO BEAM TO SHARE PHOTOS WITH ONE TOUCH\nLike other Samsung devices, the WB350 features Photo Beam technology, which makes it a snap to share photos. Simply tap the camera on any NFC-compatible smartphone to automatically share whichever image you're currently viewing. \n\nTRANSFER FILES WITH PC AUTO BACKUP\nSaving photos, video clips, and more to your computer is easy with the WB350. Just select the PC Auto Backup function, and the camera will wirelessly transfer all of the files on the camera to your PC or Mac. \n\nSEND FILES USING MOBILE LINK, EVEN WITHOUT WI-FI\nBased on NFC technology, Samsung's Mobile Link app lets you select and send photos or albums to a designated smartphone or tablet, even when you're away from a Wi-Fi hotspot, and without having to send the photos as a text message or an email. The app also lets you manage photos on your smartphone and save the changes automatically to the camera. \n\nREMOTE VIEWFINDER TO CONTROL CAMERA AT A DISTANCE\nWhen you connect the camera to select smartphones, you can use the Remote ViewFinder app to turn your phone into a viewfinder. You can control your camera from up to 30 feet away and preview images, adjust camera settings, frame the scene, and tag the shot location--all from your phone. When you need to take a group shot with yourself in it, Remote ViewFinder makes it easy. \n\nSMART MODE FOR SPECIAL EFFECTS\nTap the smart mode button to take advantage of numerous special shoot modes. Action Freeze mode lets you capture a high-speed scene at a sporting event, while Rich Tone can be used to create surrealistic photos with vibrant colors. \n\nDUAL CAPTURE TO SHOOT PHOTOS AND VIDEOS AT ONCE\nThe WB350's Dual Capture feature lets you snap photos while simultaneously shooting Full HD video. Record a soccer game while also capturing frame-worthy stills. \n\nFULL MANUAL MODE FOR CREATIVE CONTROL\nPut the WB350 in Full Manual mode to take complete creative control of your pictures. Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority settings allow you to experiment with shutter speeds and depth of field, such as when you're shooting fast-moving images in low-light settings. \n\nRETRO DESIGN WITH MODERN TWIST\nInspired by vintage camera designs, the WB350 is notable for its elegant, flowing lines and luxurious leather-like feel. The WB350's compact and lightweight body makes it great for easy, on-the-go shooting. \n\nPRODUCT DIMENSIONS\nThe Samsung WB350 Smart Camera measures 2.56 by 4.47 by .98 inches (H x W x D) and weighs .48 pounds. \n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nSamsung WB350 Smart Camera, lithium-ion EA-SLB10A/WW battery, USB cable, power adapter, wrist strap, and quick start guide.\n\n WB350 SMART CAMERA\nAT A GLANCE:\n * 16.3-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor for low-light conditions\n * 3-Inch hybrid touch display for intuitive operation\n * 21x optical zoom with a 23-millimeter wide-angle lens\n * Wi-Fi capability to post to Facebook and other online networks\n * 1080p Full HD video recording\n\nThe WB350 captures lifelike video at 1080p Full HD resolution.
