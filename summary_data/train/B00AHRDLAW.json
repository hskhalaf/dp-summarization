I measured this one, and it is only 14 inches across, meaning it is only 28 inches around. It's labeled as XL, but it's size is more of a medium. Too bad it's too late to get my money back!!",

The material didn't particularly impress me. I'm not convinced that a larger size would be more comfortable. The band is thin and unforgiving and the top lacks any contouring whatsoever. Perhaps I would wear this if my goal was to eliminate the ladies all together, but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone more busty than a \"b\" . . .",
