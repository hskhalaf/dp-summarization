I'm sure now with the continuous jams, other feed mechanisms are now out of alignment. DO NOT buy from this vendor if you want or need customer service after the sale. I doesn't exist!",

In comparison, I have an 11-year old HP 4000 duplexer which never misses a beat, runs like a well-oiled machine, and has jammed maybe 2 or 3 times in it's entire life.
