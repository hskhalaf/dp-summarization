Also the cord is removable, which for a wired controller means that damage to the cable is no longer the death of the controller but just a replaceable part. Finally, underside of the controller has two extra buttons for serious gamers. All in all, it's a great buy for the price.",

I thought this was just because it was an old controller (I owned mine for about 1 year), so I bought a new controller. Here I am one month later with the EXACT SAME ISSUES.

I ended up having to do this because I wanted to use a shorter USB cable. It takes all of 15 seconds to make the modification.

But the LB/RB RT/LT and Dpad buttons don't have this issue though. They press quite nicely actually. The overall quality is great if it wasn't for those stiff buttons lol Anyway, good for the price and it's good to have at least one wired controller if you game as much as I do.",

The cord length is good for where I sit, though I do wish a longer option was available. The only drawback to this controller is that it doesn\u2019t have a port for the standard Xbox headset. It will, however, work with most gamer headphones or earbuds. I was able to use headphones that didn\u2019t work with the standard wireless controller, so bonus? Depends on what you\u2019d rather use, I guess.",

I have had this for only 2 months and the wire port on the controller is already loose and will stop working in the middle of games. The buttons are cheap and the spring on the Y button has already broke. The plastic itself is thin and cheap feeling. This is literally the worst possible controller you can buy, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! It broke just after the convenient 30 day return window too, just to add insult to injury. 1000 thumbs down!",

Very long cable for sitting almost anywhere in the room and playing, and the controller itself is very comfortable and feels almost exactly like a genuine Xbox One controller. One thing I didn't like is that the charger input on the controller has a little bump, meaning you can only use the Micro-USB cable that comes with it, as different ones won't be able to fit. This isn't a problem in normal use, but sometimes when on the go I want to use a shorter cable, but can't.",
