The other one actually sucks up paper, but he didn\u2019t seem to care about it. Many people commented on kids struggling to push this one and hold it upright but my nephew had no issues. It does seem to be difficult to stand up on its own after a kid is done playing becsuse they aren\u2019t careful about standing it up, so it ends up laying down a lot when not used. I highly recommend for young kids becsuse he couldn\u2019t get enough of it.",

He loves pretending to clean so we thought this would be perfect (he has a broom that he carries around all the time). The thing I noticed right away was the hinge between the blue and the white portion of the vacuum is really awkward as it doesn't and he'll often get jammed up when the vacuum bends at the hinge as it doesn't come low enough he he often keeps pushing with the vacuum tipping over and him falling with it. He likes all the other aspects of the vacuum but never walks around with it which I assume is because of the awkward hinge.",

The ability to pick up blocks is a cool feature, but on the hard wood floors, it makes loud popping like noises when being moved, which may not be too annoying if it weren\u2019t being played with for an extensive amount of time. I do not like how there is no option to lock it in an upright position. It pretty much can flop over and bash baby in the face at any time.",
