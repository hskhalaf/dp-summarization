I can\u2019t e press how disappointed I am because it was to go in a new bedroom.",

      "text": "I love the cool crispness of percale. When the sheets arrived I washed them and hung them outside to dry something I have been doing for 50 years. They dried nicely with minimum wrinkles. The fit on my mattress is very good and the bottom sheet does not come untucked. Sleeping on them they were cool to sleep on (I am a warm sleeper so this is important to me.) Compared to sheets I have from the 70's and 80's these were a little thinner but not too thin. Pattern is really pretty and I am glad I purchased 2 sets.",

I have washed them with scented detergent and used scented fabric freshener and left them hanging outside for 3 days to air, but they still stink. I febrezed them, but that did not help either. I am going to rewash them, leave them hanging outside for another week to get rid of the repugnant odor. I don\u2019t know what the manufacturer added to the fabric to produce this awful odor.",
