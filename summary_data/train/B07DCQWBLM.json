It's not flashy by design so if you wanted to put it next to your TV and turn off the LED it would just be another piece of equipment. The exhaust is straight up. Thinking about porting it out the window. It doesn't heat up the room until the hard core 3d games which is nice, If you've ever had a heavy duty graphics card you'll be familiar with this. Water cooling is very effective and quiet. One whole side of this is a radiator.",

Usually tech support has been helpful, but I've discovered that the 24/7 technical support they promise doesn't exist. They do not work on weekends and apparently don't work late into the night either. I've been waiting for 2 days for a response for a driver that I need. They don't have the driver on their website. Very aggravating.",
