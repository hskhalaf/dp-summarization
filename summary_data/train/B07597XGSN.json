Sure from a distance it might look like a quality birdbath but up close it looks like cheap plastic(resin) which it is. I actually paid $37.50 for the birdbath on 4/23/2020 the price is now at $42.50. I wouldn\u2019t spend more than $25.00 for this. Bottom line this isn\u2019t going to last long with how poor the quality it is.",

Sometimes up to 4 or 5 will be in there at a time! Other birdbaths are not as deep, which make those nice for smaller birds. My cats love watching out the window too! Definitely recommend this one! We have had some pretty good wind gusts. I put some sand/ small stones in bottom to give it some weight before attaching the top. No issues!",

I especially like how light weight it is, allowing me to tip it over slightly to drain it for cleaning. Last month, we had a terrible storm with high winds. I was able to easily lift this bath and put it in a place away from the storm. This bath is a beautiful addition to my back deck, which is my refuge. I highly recommend it.",

I have used this product for several months now. It has not blown over at all! Not even during violent thunderstorms, when other objects went flying. And, I did not have a need to put in the ground stakes. This product looks great and is easy to put together. Due to how little it weights, it is super easy to empty and clean.

We filled the stem with sand and have placed rocks around the base, which sort of took care of this issue...would have returned it but too much of a hassle. Buy only if you have a level concrete slab to place it on.",

It is shallow enough for bird bathing as well and I have seen many bees taking drinks as well.",

Of course I never saw any birds using it so I don't know if it is actually toxic. But I would never drink from a container made of the stuff. It's very light and has to be firmly anchored. I used rocks but the racoons still toppled it several times and the last time it fell the basin cracked, which took care of the toxicity concern. I don't recommend it.
