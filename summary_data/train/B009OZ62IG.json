It would remain at 48 F for an hour until it was apparent that this machine was defective. I guess buying this is a 50/50 gamble on whether or not it will actually arrive in working condition.

I have made blackberry sorbet, peach sorbet, and chocolate ice cream using my own recipes, but following their guidelines.Perfect every time. The only unclear item in the guide book is the use of the pre-cool. It simply cools the machine so that you don't risk warming up your already cooled mix while waiting for the machine to get down to temperature. This is important in my house in the summer as we have no a/c. The machine is easy to clean. The instructions are pretty clear. Go ahead and indulge yourself and buy this machine. You will be happy you did (not to mention weightier).",

The ice cream is good right when you remove it, but not hard at that point, so more like soft-serve. It's good an hour or two later, but then it just gets harder and harder each day it's in the freezer. They need to come up with a way of changing the blade shape or increasing the speed of the blade's rotation in order to whip air into the ice cream to give it a fluffy consistency. This is a problem with all these home ice cream makers, but for this amount of money one would expect a better solution.",

I'm gonna get fat. I did allow it to stand upright for 24 hours after receiving it. The professionals that shipped it placed it on its side in a larger box when it clearly cautions against placing it in any direction other than top up. Those that have mentioned it being loud, not working in auto-mode, return it. There's something wrong with your unit. This machine is quiet, easy, and churns delicious ice cream.

It helps to chill the ingredients before hand to make the process faster instead of depending entirely on the machine. Weather and room temperature affects the time it takes the machine to freeze and aerate the ice cream. Good ice cream is at least 40% air in the ice cream. That's how ice cream scoops easily. Otherwise, it'd be a solid chunk that wont come apart. So far, mixture comes out consistently. I like that I know what I put in to make the ice cream. 5 egg yolks.",

Second, on the first and second batches (I didn't make any more), after the \"add mix-ins\" alert and mix-ins are added (not many, and not large pieces), the machine sounds like a motorcycle revving in the kitchen non-stop and the paddle stops turning. The ice cream was alternating between \"frozen yogurt\" and \"gelato\" on the display, actually reversing back down a couple of times. I'm trying one more time before buying a different brand.",

I did not need to do all the steps you see in the videos. I just put all the ingredients in the Vitamix and turned it on for 7 minutes. While that was running, I pre cooled the Breville. I was able to put the mixture right in and start the ice cream. Delicious!! I have not tried Gelato yet.",

Even after light use - once every week or two max - the product quickly reaches a point where it just cannot \"churn\" effectively. If you don't mind a huge cost per serving, buy this product. You can get very innovative with homemade ice cream. Just plan to purchase a replacement every so many operation cycles. Otherwise. Settle for store bought ice cream. No matter the price, it will be MUCH, MUCH less expensive.",

It had to go into our freezer for a good hour to be really ice cream and not soft serve. But it is so easy to use and it makes the right amount for desert for 4. Have not tried anything other than ice cream, no sure how gelato will be. We will try it next",

My only issue is that the ice cream when it\u2019s fully done (hardest setting) is soft and you have to leave it overnight in the freezer before you can really eat it. The other thing is that the metal container is sharp on the outer edge and when you\u2019re scooping out the ice cream after you make it it cuts my finger little bit every time",
