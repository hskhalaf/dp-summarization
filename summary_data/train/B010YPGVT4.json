      "text": "This flag barely lasted me a year. Upon taking it down for the winter, I found one of the plastic hooks snapped, another on the verge of breaking, and then as I set it down, about 20 small balls popped out of the pole near where the hooks connect to the aluminum pole. This spilled all over the floor, and there are probably some still hiding from me - a bit concerning given how a baby could find and swallow them rather easily. I'm disappointed in the product and wonder how the company responds to such reports on their products. Not sure if they'll stand behind this.",

Adding another star for Customer Service. I received my replacement parts and added two more stars because of the great customer service.

After 2 days of windy weather, have not had to untangle the flat, so it seems to be working. Flat attaches via 2 clips, one at the top and not adjustable, and the other anywhere on the pole you want. If you have a good quality flag, the clips are difficult to fit through the holes, and you'll need pliers to get it hooked up, but that problem is the same with every competitor.",
