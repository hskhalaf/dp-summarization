After the first few moments of swinging then getting in and out several times I felt confident it would support my weight without issue allowing me to enjoy relaxing in it. The only con in my opinion is I felt the mosquito net support lines included are a little short. Easy enough to replace with some longer 550 cord. Overall this hammock is an excellent deal for the price!",

Only issue was one of the hammocks arriving with torn (mis-cut?) loops for hanging the mosquito net. Stitching them myself was easier than exchanging, so no big complaint there. Also super easy to hang! Loved the easy, dummy proof, loops running the length of the strap.",

They have a lot of loops so it is easy to adjust the height. I recommend testing the height & laying in it the first time before running the guide lines for the mosquito net. The hammocks may stretch a little when you first put weight on it. Also, I highly recommend using a sleeping bag when camping and not blankets. Always make sure the netting is above your sleeping bag before getting in the hammock. The pockets are very handy. Would definitely buy again.",

Also, make sure you find a tree with limbs that extend out, or the netting will just bunch up and fall into your face. Good hammock, the pictures show that it will fit two people, but I do not think that two normal sized people would be comfortable sitting it in.",

      "text": "Pretty lit, went up a couple 14ers over the last few weekends. I bought the recommended tarp/fly for it and stayed dry during hard rain in the mountains. Friend bought this hammock off of my recommendation and it worked well for him. In the cold make sure to use a thick sleeping pad or a blow up one like I used was perfect. The mosquitos could only glare at me from a safe distance away and the few spiders couldn't get in.",

They had no trouble setting them up, and the straps that come with the hammocks are durable. We bought separate tarps for each one to help with insulation and protect from moisture. Great product!",

I thought for sure the net would rip when if flipped, but to my surprise not even a tear, not the net, stiching, or anything. The zipper is of moderate quality if anything that could be better, but that's it. Also, those plastic carabiners in the picture, have been updated. It came with 2 very nice metal ones, they seem heavier duty than the ones you buy at cabellas or Walmart. For 25 bucks, very worth it. Oh ya, and double and triple stitching on everything.

Also, before this, the mosquito netting bunched together. The video suggested \"putting some sticks in it\" to keep it stretched out, which is lame and of course didn't work at all--sticks popped right out. Next hammock won't have mosquito netting--despite being a great idea, it seems too fragile and hard to pull off in reality.",
