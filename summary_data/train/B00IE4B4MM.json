It is so light weight when strolling it's like a Zero turn lawn mower.lol and plenty of room below the seats to put diapers & a few shopping bags.

My kids are age 2 & 9 months and they fit great, My 6 year old nephew sat in it with my 9 month old, a little heavy, but was able to still push it through Disney. The only thing I would change is that I wish the head cover covered more.",

Chicco customer service is full of snarky, unhelpful jerks. The stroller shipped to us and it was broken. Chico acted like they were doing us a favor by sending us a replacement stroller that fell with in the product warranty guidelines. I should have spent the extra money and purchased the Maclaren",

      "text": "This is one of the few double strollers I have found that fits in hybrid trunk. That is what makes it ideal for our family. It is a little tricky to unfold, but folds up well. It does not steer as well as our BOB but it works well for trips to the zoo. My daughter loves that the seats recline and this works well for having having a baby and toddler. The storage under the seats are large enough to hold a big diaper bag.",

The wheels makes it really easy to push no matter how heavy kids are. The seats recline back far and the storage baskets have a nice amount of room the only downside is the canopies dont go that far down and the stroller is a little heavy to carry other than that this is a great stroller.",

It takes up about half the space when folded as our Chicco tandem stroller. This is a great stroller for traveling when you are tight on space in your vehicle. My only reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it had 2 drink holders and the canopy was larger. It does not block the sun, so pack sun hats and sunglasses.",
