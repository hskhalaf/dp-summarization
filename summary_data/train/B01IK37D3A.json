We flew it twice with a great experience both times, but the third flight was a completely different story. Within seconds of lift off, it immediately shot high and took off with no response to the controller. We stood dumbfounded and watched it for at least a quarter of a mile until it was completely out of site. We read up more and learned this might be a defect. We reached out to the Company by email last Sunday but no response so far. Very disappointed- we also purchased extra batteries and charger anticipating a long and enjoyable experience with this drone.",

Cons: When battery is low some commands are not receptibles. Camera video was a little bit wavy. To switch the baterry you have to dismount camera and unscrew camera's mount.

There were no buttons being pushed and off it decided to go. Nothing I pushed had any impact on the behavior of the drone and it flew off the field and over the water. You can guess the rest.

It hovers nicely, though it is prone to slight drifting... this is the only criticism I have of the unit, but again, the small amount of drift is still rather remarkable for a drone in this price range.

The video broadcast to your mobile device is relatively low latency (good) and low quality (to be expected). Controls for the drone are pretty good. It's pretty easy to fly/control, but it doesn't do great with even minimal wind. The quality of the HD Video which is recorded on a MicroSD is the only disappointment here. It's pretty low quality and highly impacted by the vibration of the drone (there's no rubber vibration dampeners on the camera attachment for example). Anyway, it's fun, feels relatively sturdy, and you're not really going to do any better for $100!",

      "text": "This drone is uncontrollable outside. Even a breeze that is virtually unnoticeable by human perception dramatically affects maneuverability of this drone to the point that it's of no use - on a considerably calm, windless, day. The point of purchasing this thing was to have aerial photos/videos of our trips when we are on vacation. That's an impossibility with this drone. \"Trimming\" (right, left, etc) does absolutely nothing meaningful to correct the constant drift. It WILL NOT HOVER in place. Two hour charge for 10 minutes of flying, ok video at best, and a whole lot of doing nothing useful. Sending it back.",

One piece of advice I'll give is that if you are using it outside, then there should be little or no wind. Since this is my first drone, I don't have lots of experience, but the drone drifts in the wind - so it's better for novice users to be sure the weather is calm. Overall great experience for me and my 5 yr old daughter.",

Also, I lost it up in the tree tops of northern NH, where it sat for a few weeks, exposed to the elements, until the leaves fell and wind brought it to the ground. Not one piece was missing from it, or broken off. I was very happy to find it, and impressed! I do have some trouble navigating, and it seems to drift away from me, but I suspect that is user error, not the drone.",

I always use the blade guards as the drone will harmlessly just bounce off a wall without doing damage. I don't bother with the camera to extend battery life and picture quality is not great. It's taken quite a beating and keeps on flying. I wish the battery life was better. It runs out in less than 10 minutes. It does tend to run hot so let the quad cool down when changing batteries. The altitude hold feature works quite well considering they're using barometric pressure instead of GPS.",

      "text": "We bought 2 drones and they worked OK initially, with the exception that the charging capability is dangerous and can result in a fire. The chargers do not shut off automatically and you have to babysit them to ensure over-charging does not happen that will create damage. They even come with a warning that not removing batteries from chargers may result in battery damage and a fire. After a couple weeks of light use, the drones both refused to pair and became paperweights and i returned them.",
