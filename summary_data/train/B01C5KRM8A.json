Anticipating the arrival of this watch, I must admit that I'm extremely disappointed. As I opened it, I instantly noticed that this watch was used. Obvious scratches. Even the face had a small scratch on it, covered by a transparent sticker face protector that too looked used. I refuse to pay $350+ for an obviously used item. I didn't even try it on. I sent it back immediately.",

They are all the same design and the same size at 44mm case diameter. I'm rather curious as to why the gold BOLD model is presented as a women's style and the other two as men's. (Actually, I'm quite OK with whatever they want to call it and with whoever wants to wear it.) It just seems to me that the gold BOLD model is quite as handsomely masculine in a sophisticated sort of way as any of the Movado BOLD collection. Enjoy!!",
