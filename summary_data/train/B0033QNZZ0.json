      "text": "Probably the most economical of the coolants meeting the needs of VW and other European cars. I don't know if it carries the VW specification which requires testing and certification, but it's essentially the same as Pentafrost. I don't remember if my research showed that it was equivalent to G12, G12+/++, or G13 but it was one of those. Basically if you have a European car including diesels from the 1990s through 2015 or so, this is excellent stuff to use. Does NOT contain 2EHA (2-ethylhexanoic acid) which is what's in Dex-cool and dex-cool compatible HOAT and OAT coolants that eats gaskets and causes issues.",

Some of the reasons to buy. 1) This is a 50/50 solution, so it is pre-mixed, no need to add water. Just pour into your coolant reservoir. 2) Recommended by Mercedes as their choice of coolant 3) The price is cheaper than the local retail store.",

I have a Chrysler Sebring and found out the hard way (replaced water pump) that this is the antifreeze for Chrysler vehicles. It's a little pricey compared to the other brands but trust me it's worth it.",

    "description": "Size:1 GA| Style:G05| Configuration:ConcentrateThis item contains a bittering agent. Valvoline ZEREX G-05 antifreeze coolant is a long life, fully formulated, ethylene glycol-based fluid suitable for passenger cars, light trucks and heavy duty vehicles. The formulation is designed for both gasoline and diesel engines. Its lower-silicate, reduced pH, phosphate free European technology protects all cooling system metals, including aluminum, from corrosion. ZEREX G-05 is a nitrite containing coolant designed to protect diesel engine cylinder liners from cavitation. It contains deposit control additives for protection from hard water deposits and scale. The ASTM and other test data shown on this sheet reflect the high performance corrosion inhibitor package. When diluted 50% with water, ZEREX G-05 protects modern engine components from winter freezing and summer boil over. A 50% to 70% concentration range is suggested for optimum corrosion protection. ZEREX G-05 is compatible with other premium brands of coolant commonly available. It contains a high quality defoamer system and will not harm hoses, plastics or original vehicle finishes. It is also suitable for use in Cummins Deere, Detroit Diesel, Mercedes, MTU, CAT, Navistar, Isuzu and Yanmar diesel engines. ZEREX G-05 is approved by Ford North America for newer models.
