I\u2019ve been using it for about a month and it\u2019s only gotten worse. The pegs at the top get loose despite frequently tightening the nut. It\u2019s nice not having a bar to step over but that\u2019s about the only thing I like about it. I\u2019ll try to upload some pictures soon.",

During installation it was VERY difficult to line up the latches so the bolt used in the locking mechanism would lock the gait into place despite following the directions & using template. The latch mechanism is very poor & NO longer works at all. For the past few mo. latching it has required several attempts & once latched, the bolt will POP OUT of place w/o any contact w/it! We know what to look for now & we check the latch every time we walk by the gait b/c so often it has been found to unlatch itself! Please don\u2019t buy this UNSAFE baby gait!",

How well it fares in the weather is yet to be seen, but it seems sturdy and fairly well-made. DO NOT rely on the templates that come with it. I used them and regretted it. You\u2019re better off using it for the hinge side, Then hang the gate with the fasteners on the other side, and mark the wall where they need to go. The template will have you drilling holes that are about a half inch too far over.",

But please be aware; it was a BEAR to install and get all the connections to line up properly so the gate can function. And there is NO nice easy close like it shows in the video. It has to be pretty much slammed to close. With that said it would be very sturdy and hard for kids to get through. But if I had it to do again I would not buy this knuckle-buster.",

It\u2019s very sturdy, I was pleasantly surprised because I found it for under $20 and thought why not. I could put a lot of weight on it and it will not budge. I no longer fear my child will fall down them. We love North State products and have 2 of their super yards. They deliver great quality.",

I did use the templates and pulled them taut but I was reluctant to put more holes in my wall or post. Ultimately I took the assembly fittings off and it works very well.
