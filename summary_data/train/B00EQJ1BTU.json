I didn't get it. You would be better served by a 'real' NAS from HP, Dell, etc, a Synology Linux-based NAS, or a DIY Linux box. This thing brought me nothing but pain, wasted time, and lost data.",

But, if you were unfortunate enough that yours survived past three years before it bricked (as mine did), you are seemingly SOL. Don't expect any longevity out of this expensive piece of hardware.",

I connected it to my Linux-based video server, and the two work like a champ. I set it up in a RAID configuration, and have protected storage. Prior to my purchase, I looked into cloud storage of various types, and found the cost to be prohibitive. For the one-year cost of off-site cloud storage, I am able to purchase a server that I can use for many years. I am quite pleased with the purchase!!",

Very few situations need a Write Cache (ZIL).",

In FreeNAS it is frequently necessary to go to multiple pages in the user interface to accomplish common tasks. On the plus side, it's small, quiet, looks good, and of course runs ZFS. There are plenty of online resources to help get up the learning curve. Wish there were a 6-bay unit - that would be perfect for a 4+2 RAIDZ2 configuration.",

The motherboard is the part of the unit that's gone bad; am currently haggling with asrock for a replacement since iXsystems wanted to charge me a $130 fee to diagnose the issue first (buying the spare parts to do the diagnosis myself cost less).
