This might sound a little crazy but I found a perfect work-around for this problem. I place a panty liner over the part that goes against your face and spritz that real good. The fabric remains completely dry, my eyes get the moist heat and the added padding seems to make better connection with my eyelids too. The head is more than adequate to heat up the panty liner on setting 5. Very pleased with this purchase it gets nice and hot.",

A timer can be set up to 30 minutes so no need to worry falling asleep with the mask on. The controls were easy to use, instructions are not needed. You will need a USB power source as a wall adapter is not provided. I used my phone charger and that worked perfectly. I wish the cord could plug into either side of the mask, but I guess this might be a little too picky. Overall I like it!",
