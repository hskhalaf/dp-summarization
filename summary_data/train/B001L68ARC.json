This causes little particles of food to get trapped in all sorts of crevices unless you clean it *very* carefully. I've even cut myself on the edges when I wasn't being careful. Just filing them down would improve the product a decent bit. Overall, it is obvious that very little care and attention went into making this chinois.",

It's got 2 layers of a very fine stainless steel mesh, with a supporting structure that helps to discourage denting of the mesh. But- it is NOT easy to clean- especially by hand! Our dishwasher died and we have not yet replace it- and while I am confident this would clean beautifully in a dishwasher, it was pretty hard to clean by hand. Still- I am very happy with it, and plan to make some lovely clear stocks! Honestly, though- a one-layer very fine strainer would probably work fine, and is a lot easier to clean.",

For yogurt I needed to also use a cloth, but I still preferred it over a normal strainer due to the capacity.",
