After the battery died the light of course went off. Once it was fully recharged, the blue indicator lights on the back were all lit but I could not turn on the light. They have been on for two days but I still cannot turn on the light. It did not leak as far as I can tell. It seems electronic. What a shame since it was doing a great job before dying.",

Unfortunately during the 4th dive, the on/off switch malfunctioned and no longer able to turn it off. Tried draining the battery and allowing to dry out completely but still locked in \"on\" mode - guessing its a malfunction of the mechanical switch. Bought 6 months ahead of dive vacation so no chance to return. Big disappointment - wish it had worked.",

      "text": "These are for underwater work but I don't see why they couldn't be used in open air. Overall great units. Average battery life that we have been getting is about 10-12 hours which is nice, Depending on the amount of ambient light that is available then the adjustment of low-med-high works pretty well. There are times that where you need full power and then the image gets washed out or you go with medium and then the image is too dark. Part of the learning curve with underwater photography I guess. One other thing, a little silicone grease on the threads and o-ring on the plug that you remove for access to the charging port is very very helpful.",

It was basically no help in the 30 foot depth we dive at. I cannot say if it would help at deeper, darker depths.",

Not sure where the manufacture comes up with 1500 lumens when next to another manufacture's 900 lumen light it is not as bright. Not sure who's is correct but the 900 is definitely brighter then this unit. I'm sure I could not recommend this unit.",

It would appear the water entered the light via the cap that covers the USB port used for charging the light. I had that cap off, charged it, even lubricating the O ring before replacing it, water still was able to enter the light. The light is junk now. Avoid this product!!",
