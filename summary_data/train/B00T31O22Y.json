I've had for a few months, worked really well in the beginning, then it started leaking dirty water from the bottom of the machine. I would have to clean up behind the machine..Then the sprayer stopped working a few weeks later. Figured I'd just keep using by spraying cleaning fluid with a independent sprayer and just use the rug doctor to vacuum up. After doing that fro a few weeks, rug doctor got louder and lost suction. Now I have a fairly expensive piece of plastic. Not sure what I will do next. Fairly disappointed .",

This one is the best. Compared with the Bissell SpotClean Pro, which was our last model, it's most sturdy, easier to clean, and has much more powerful suction to get the cleaning fluid (and ... other fluids) out of carpet and upholstery. I'm really pleased, and recommend it highly.",

This is easy to use, cleans the messes and not cumbersome like a full size Rug Doctor. Some complained about the noise, but I didn't find that a problem. I want it to work hard and that's the price we pay. If you are a pet owner, I suggest buying a black light flash light to accompany your cleaning to really spot clean. I feel like my floors are super clean and that makes me super happy.",

I also used it to clean a 7 year old microfiber couch and it looks almost new again. Perfect for spot cleaning and upholstery. Canisters are easy to clean out as well. The clean water one doesn't dry out real well because it only has a small hole in the bottom. The dirty canister washes easily and dries out quickly.",
