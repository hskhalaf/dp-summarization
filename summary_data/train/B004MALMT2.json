Plus they're not very expensive and look nice. Really my only complaint is the little hole in the bottom. None of mine leaked out of the box but I think they need to determine a better method of sealing it or producing it without a hole. I don't believe Kitchables has a hole and it's kind of ugly. You can see a weird like pyramid at the bottom of your glass and it looks like glue from a hot glue gun basically.",
