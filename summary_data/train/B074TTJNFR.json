It makes collecting money more organizing and efficient. At the end of recess and lunch the students bring me to safe and I lock it with the key. Having that feature ensures me that throughout that no students can open the safe and take money from the safe.",

This is a light weight box, it feels like plastic but I understand it is aluminum. There are 2 bill slots and 3 coin slow in the upper tray. The bill slots have a lever to hold bills in place, perfect for outdoor events and wind. If you need protection for low risk transactions, this works great. It could also work as a safe place to keep medications if young children are in your home. It\u2019s not going to stop a motivated thief but it isn\u2019t really for that.",

Some of the graphics on the front look like they are functional for locking but really the only two functions are the lever to open the box and the key hole to lock/unlock it. Two keys are provided to help insure one is not lost. The inside has a lift out tray for holding money and space underneath the tray for extra bills or papers. Yes, this is ideal more for yard sales, fundraising, etc. but I may keep our petty cash in it and hidden away for quick access when I need cash in hand when not in use for those purposes.",

The easy to grasp handle, the smooth rounded corners, and the holders that keep your money from blowing away. The only flaw is that if you put change in the holder and tilt the box, change is scattered all over the inside. I found some gray foam that I was able to place in the lid and that helped, but I think the company should have did that and not me.",

No, this won't stop someone from stealing - it is easy enough to take off with the entire box. What it will do is put a barrier between cash and others while helping keep things sorted and secure. Easy to carry, nicely made.",
