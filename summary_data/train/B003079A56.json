I never knew the temperature so often my shrink wrap didn't shrink up enough or if too hot burn right through it. It also comes with 2 nozzle attachments to assist in your heating needs. This gun allows me to control the temperature up to 1100 degrees. It also lets me know when the gun reaches the correct temperature. It looks quire large, but is really rather light weight. I really enjoy using the heat gun and it keeps things simple and professional. Cheers an Vidimo Se!",

There are two fan speeds, with independent heat settings. It has pop-outs near the base of the handle to let it securely stand on a workbench or table for hands-free use. Quality is second to none. This is probably the best choice if you are planning to use it frequently and are looking for a long-lasting tool.",

The digital temp gauge makes sure it's right where you need it for any type of application. Yeah, I'm a girl and I love my power tools. The only thing I would change on this design is the kickstand. It would be much better if it were bigger and on the front guard part of the handle to make it easy to set down safely on any flat surface, but even then I give it 5 stars because I like it so much.",

      "text": "I have only used this heat gun a couple of times but I love the two speed blower and the adjustable heat range. To adjust the heat range just push the up button or the down button and it changes the temperature fifty degrees real simple to do. This helps eliminate the chance of burning something that you just want to warm. I think this this is going to be great to defrost a freezer.",

The bottom line is that it works, but its not a miracle worker. You still need to scrape, but you get a feel for the technique quickly (mine scrapes easy before it bubbles). I debated on getting the \"Silent Paint Remover\" , but the $400 price was too risky with the stories I read about the bulbs going out.",
