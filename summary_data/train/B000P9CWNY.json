I go back and check, and sure enough, nowhere in the description does it say anything about being refurbished. When I pay $400 for a mixer, I expect a NEW $400 mixer.",

I do not like how loud it is and it sounds like it is laboring when mixing small batches. It is Not a good mixer in comparison to the 1st mixer I have from kitchen aid, (the tilt head) . I wish I would have sent it back right away. I would buy a second tilt head before I buy another mixer like this. For the money and the extra capacity, I do not think it's worth it. Save your money!

This type has a bigger motor and does not have the hinged top that gets weak and breaks on the smaller ones. This has taken a beating and still runs like new after years. My wife loves to use this. It did take her a bit of getting used to how to seat the bowl, but after she got used to that, it has been great in all respects.",

We had out last Kitchen Aid mixer for over 20 years before the motor failed. KitchenAid no longer means quality.",

The standard one shipped with the mixer does not have as many tines and is kind of limited in usefulness. Update Aug 3 2019. Sad to say but this mixer is now just a bad boat anchor. Way to many issues with this mixer and now again it's back to a no start issue. I think this one was made by Yugo cars. Will be buying a older modle hobart A 210 something in that range. Will not be buying Kitchen Aid again.",

I was used to hand mixers all my life, so having something that can run the job while I do other cooking or prep work is almost like having another person helping in the kitchen. The silver finish is elegant but not overpowering, goes with anything.",

Since we had this model before, we now have two sets of everything, which is good. I also recommend getting the kitchenaid beater with the scraper blade, its a must!
