If it lasts another couple of years then it will have been worth every penny. And yes \u2014 the text for the start button has rubbed off. The other text hasn\u2019t vanished.

This toaster is nice to look at and isn't too big, as are many of the other models on the market. I love the 'quick check' feature - let's you check if the toast is done, mid-cycle. Also, the bagel feature really works - unlike my previous toaster! And finally, the 'just a bit more' button is great! Sometimes, toast needs 'just that bit more'! Overall, i am quite happy that i bought this toaster - a big improvement over my previous model.",

You just touch a button and the bread goes down into the toaster and comes out by itself with a little beep to let you know it's up. Also has a just a little more button that allows the bread to toast a bit longer, but not enough to burn. All in all I think this was a very worthwhile purchase.",

Love the various options: toast, frozen, bagel, and this one is great, \"a little bit more\" You get perfect toast every time and it lets you know when the toast is ready. It automatically lowers the bread. So, there are no levers to break. It has pversized slots for large artisanal bread. Get this one.",
