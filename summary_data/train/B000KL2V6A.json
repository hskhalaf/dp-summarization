I usually have suggestions for improvement, but this seems simple, well constructed and hard to improve upon. I would buy it again and recommend it to others.",

The weight of this tool is perfect for trail work. I maintain 12 miles of the Appalachian Trail with dozens of water bars to keep cleaned out. This is the perfect tool for the job.",

I've now had this tool for over 3 years now, with pretty frequent use, and it stands the test of time.

I was looking for a somewhat lighter axe and thought the fiberglass handle would make this one lighter. I didn't feel a big difference in weight - this one weighs in around 8 lbs., but at least you don't get splinters with this handle like you do with an older axe. Great axe overall, and I'm glad I bought it.",
