The material for the bench is really flimsy and not durable. The other issue is the assembly tool that comes with this product is poorly designed. It's really difficult to fit the tools under the bench to tighten the rods that anchors the bench to the body. One of the tools that comes with this product has a sharp edge and it cut me during assembly. The other safety issue is that the stainless steel anchoring pin was lose during workout. We definitely don't recommend this product.",

Still doable for decline press and such, but it's not the most ideal setup.",

It does require assembly, and is pretty solid if you put it together correctly (advise to get a ratchet wrench and a crescent wrench for a speedier assembly). Use it mainly for sit ups and hyperextensions right now. Doing sit ups your head definitely hands off the bench, but I'd imagine most benches are like this. I like that it can be folded, but it isn't enough where I can slip it under our bed (we have a low bed though), but I can put it next to my desk and it isn't obtrusive.",

I took it to a steel place and had them drill holes in the pin and put clamps on them so they lock in place. The other issue is the lack of ease when changing the position of the bench for a different workout. It takes a while because i have to line the holes up just right for the pins to fit in.",
