The splint is designed simply to hold the foot in a right angle to the leg, whic h greatly reduces morning pain for those suffering from plantar fasciitis. And this allows the inflammation to lessen and healing to occur. Once the belts are adjusted, it takes only seconds to put it on and take it off. I experienced no problems sleeping with it on.",

I've bought cheaper night splints, I won't name names, but they didn't work at all. I've done everything I've been advised and tricks I've researched. I can't rate the pain relief until I see a significant difference then I'll come update this. **UPDATE** These really do hello relieve pain in the morning. Awkward and hard to sleep with at first, but once you work-it-out they're wonderful! Highly recommend.",

Ordered women Med & wear a 8.5-9 ref width. Still plenty of room for larger shoe size & width. It\u2019s summer in SF & not too warm to wear at night but our temps don\u2019t get too high. Based off cost & results I\u2019d recommend trying this therapy as it\u2019ll give your foot the support you\u2019ll need during sleep - when sometimes your foot tends to bend or flex too much or in weird positions.",

If you can only wear it part of the night, my podiatrist said to put it on in the middle of the night so you can get at least 3-4 hours wearing time before actually getting out of bed and putting your feet on the floor.",

      "text": "I've had constant pain from my Plantar Fasciitis for 7 MONTHS. The first night I tried this, I woke up without ANY heel pain at all. I continue to use this nightly and am still waking up without heel pain. Since the plantar fasciitis tendon needs to be stretched to be fixed, I am able to adjust the angle little by little to stretch, and increase the range of motion. I would caution you against increasing the angle too quickly. I would highly recommend this to you if you are having pain from you plantar fasciitis.",

One volunteered to loan me his splint and I only tried it because he went to all the trouble to bring it to work. After the first, night I noticed a difference in my pain level but still wasn't convinced. After three nights, I had relief for the first time in months. I am back to hiking again. I decided to buy my own splint so I would have it in the event of a flare up. I love having drug free relief.",

Fits good for both although probably a tad big for me but staps are easily adjustable (my toes have plenty of room). Not really a walking boot. Best used at night.
