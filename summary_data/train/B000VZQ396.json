Shortly after receiving my new case, I loaded it up for an upcoming kayaking trip. When I opened up the case I noticed \"something\" shoot off. I didn't give much thought to it at first...but then I saw the back of the case, the hinges appeared to be cracking. There are cracks running through portions of the hinges. The \"something\" I noticed from the corner of my eye is a large chunk of the hinge. I am HIGHLY disappointed in this quality of this case.",

      "text": "I ended up not using this for my travel because it is too bulky for what I needed but I kept it because it is super sturdy, closes securely and makes an excellent holder for anything that I want to keep secure and enclosed. It does pack neatly but watch the size you choose because it does take up space. I really needed a smaller size and in the end that was the one that I used. I did not test its \"waterproof\" claim but I can attest to the fact that it is very secure and sturdy. I think it could very well live up to its claim of waterproofing.",

The case is built incredibly and manages to still look quite attractive . The Pelican 1010 Micro Case is truly a beast and it being water resistant is just a plus! Would highly recommend if you want to protect small expensive belongings from water, dust and major impacts, just as long as you don't mind the extra bulk of the case.",

    "description": "Color:Yellow/Clear| Style:Micro CaseThis water-resistant, crushproof case is ideal for rugged activities. It will keep your expensive GPS, cell phones and other electronics and documents safe and secure.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nANATOMY OF A PELICAN MICRO CASE\n ULTIMATE EQUIPMENT PROTECTION\n For over 30 years Pelican has built a reputation for manufacturing the toughest cases in the world. As a matter of fact, we invented the category. Over these years we've seen our cases used for some fairly crazy activities...and important ones too.\n\n Pelican Micro Cases are created for your smaller items. Micro Cases look and function in the same way as the larger Pelican Cases, but are designed to protect your cell phone, iPod, camera, and other small items. Many of the cases are water resistant and crushproof, or impact resistant to provide maximum protection for your valuables. These cases will get your gear from point A to point B in the condition it's meant to be in: intact and functional.\n\nSTRONGER BY DESIGN\n Pelican Cases are made with a proprietary combination of homo and co-polymers, using an open cell core and solid wall construction, which is stronger and lighter than a solid core wall. Stainless steel pins are used in hinges and handles.\n\nWATERTIGHT\n The secret is the tongue and groove fit with a polymer O-ring acting as a waterproof seal. Some models come with the Automatic Pressure Equalization Valve which balances interior pressure, keeping water out while making the case easy to open.\n\n LINER FOR EXTRA PROTECTION\n Your valuables should be protected on the inside as well as the outside. Pelican Micro Cases contain a shock absorbent liner to minimize damage to contents in tough situations.\n\nMICRO CASE COMPARISON\nModelExterior Dimensions (Inches)Interior Dimensions (Inches)CertificatesAutomatic Pressure Equalization Valve10105.88 x 4.06 x 2.124.37 x 2.87 x 1.68IP67Yes10156.68 x 3.88 x 1.865.14 x 2.64 x 1.37 Yes10206.82 x 4.75 x 2.125.31 x 3.56 x 1.68IP67Yes10307.50 x 3.87 x 2.436.37 x 2.62 x 2.06IP67Yes10407.50 x 5.06 x 2.126.50 x 3.87 x 1.75IP67Yes10507.50 x 5.06 x 3.126.31 x 3.68 x 2.75IP67Yes10609.37 x 5.56 x 2.628.25 x 4.25 x 2.25IP67YesCertificate IP67 (1 meter submersion for 30 minutes)\n\nMICRO ICASE COMPARISON\nFull Use of Your Electronics: i1010 and i1015 Micro Cases feature a specially designed external jack allows you to listen to music on your device while providing full protection from the elements.\n\niModelExterior Dimensions (Inches)Interior Dimensions (Inches)Compatible Phone/Electronics ModelsSpecial Featuresi10105.88 x 4.06 x 2.124.37 x 2.87 x 1.681st or 2nd generation Apple iPod, Nano, and Shuffle * Lid organizer stores earphones\n *  Active sport double-end tie down strap features safety stripes\n * Easy open latch\n\ni10156.68 x 3.88 x 1.865.14 x 2.64 x 1.37 * Apple: iPhone, iPhone 4, iPod touch\n * Blackberry: Bold/Curve/Storm/Pearl\n * Nokia: 5800/5530/E63/E71/E71x/E75/N97 Mini/N79/N78\n * Motorola: Droid/Cliq\n * T-Mobile: MyTouch 3G, G1\n\n * Built-in cable manager\n * Active sport carabiner secures i1015 to backpack or belt loop\n * Easy open latch",
