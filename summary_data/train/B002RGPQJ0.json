It is a full-size kit, perfect for all but the youngest children. I highly recommend getting this set, rather than a \"child's\" set, if it's affordable. Yes, the cymbals aren't great, but they get the job done. I don't have any problem with the heads; they're fine. All in all, just a great kit.. Buy it.",

While it doesn't have quite the sound of an \"adult\" drum set, it does not sound like a toy set either. Set up wasn't too bad with the help of the dvd and now he likes to move around and tweak his set to his own liking. I wholeheartedly recommend as I searched long and hard for just the right set. He will eventually upgrade the cymbals as he has already started looking on amazon for new ones, but for now those are ok too.",

If you're just starting out on drums, like me, buy this set, see how you do, then upgrade if need be. Do they sound as good as a $3,000 Tama set? Of course not. But for <$200, they're a steal.

In his excitement, my 9 year old tore up a box and inadvertently scratched one of the skins of the drums. It looked like it was going to tear. I immediately contacted the seller and we had a replacement part within days without questions. Great customer service!",

For the money, to have all the pieces together for a started set was incredible. Everything felt solid and heavy duty. The drum skins seemed plasticky, but sounded fine. I would recommend this as a full size starter set. Definitely watch the 10 min video first to get familiar with the pieces.",

The included instructions are black and white and no good. Drums are awesome - high quality. When played at night they are a little loud, but who likes neighbors anyways?",

      "text": "This is quite possibly the best gift we've ever given our boys. I initially purchased another set from Target but it was too small for our 8 year old. This full sized/adult set is perfect for our 8yr old and 11 yr old and will last for years. It took us about 2 hours to set up but it is a great quality and looked so magnificent under the Christmas Tree. I would highly recommend. I almost kept the other set to save about $100 but I am so glad we spent a little extra for a set that will last them much longer.",

I followed the online installation video, which was very helpful..but the pieces in the boxes arn't labeled, so it would take me a few extra minutes to make sure I was using the right piece. Other than that, definitely worth the money:)",

The packages arrived in a timely manner, the website provided detailed instructions on putting things together, and they sound good. I think this is a great price and a good starting drum set for anyone learning to play! Thank you!",
