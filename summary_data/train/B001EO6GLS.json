      "text": "This product really works for occasional anxiety for my dogs. When we need to travel or have company, I simply put drops on a biscuit about an hour before, and they calm right down. This has also worked for my cat. I have used this for calming my lab during fireworks, as well as overall excitement during tent set-up while camping. This seems to be safe and reliable product.",
