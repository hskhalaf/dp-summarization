      "text": "We have purchased two collars and three leases from EzyDog. They are so well made. The martingale collar is perfect for controlling our GSD when she sees a squirrel while walking. It stops her from bolting, and she cannot escape from her collar. We do not use metal choke collars on any of our dogs. The width of the collar is perfect. She loves to swim, so the collar has been exposed to water and washed several times and it's still looks great (no fading or fraying). I wash the collar and leash in a lingerie wash bag and air dry. Love EzyDog's products.",

They allow for a looser day-to-day fit without the risk of the dog slipping out in an attempt to chase a squirrel on a walk. ;) I also like that it works well for leash training when it's higher up on their neck. I bought two of these, one to replace my dogs current one that has just gotten old and dingy, and one for our new 9 month old puppy. They are made really well and the colors are vibrant!

First of all, it's martingale style, but it doesn't tighten too much.It has a quick release buckle, which is not common on these collars but is essential for safety. My dog is young and mischievous,and I need to be able to release the collar if he gets caught on something or during play with another pup. The collar and hardware are of superior quality, and are the right width and weight for a medium dog. My only concern was the length of the collar which seemed on the short side. Fortunately, it fit my dog at its longest possible adjustment, because the next size sounded too long.",

By far the best design and quick action martingale I have ever used. Well made and am impressed by the material and slide action. Advice Fits well around the neck of my Aussie pup. Please not a collar for training should fit around neck, where the mom dog would check her own pup to train. You don\u2019t have your dog wear a martingale too low. Never crate a dog with any type of training collar. In fact never crate your dog with a collar.",

Pretty sure that was a fluke as these collars are not cheaply made. Still very pleased with the overall performance of this collar.",

Because of the ability to adjust the slack, my 5 month old Dachshund got this caught around the bottom part of her mouth and eventually it made its way into the back part of her mouth. Thank god I was home and it was only there for a few minutes. I dont even want to think what could of happened if no one was home for several hours.",

Also love the extra loop for tags and how it is opposite the loop for the leash. Allows me to easily clip their tags on and off with a small carabiner when I go to dogs parks or other places where tags are needed. Very happy.",
