We used this on a large lake in GA, which is flat. It was super easy to get into and to drag onto the shore. I am not confident in my 'water skills', but this was easy to maneuver. It moved and steered well. The only difficult thing is getting it on top of the car. Maybe this will take practice. My son said he could do it, but I think it definitely requires 2 people.",

I just ordered a wheel set for kayaks to ease this process. And I ordered a rack to facilitate hanging them out of the way in the garage.",

This kayak has met and exceeded my expectations. It is extremely sturdy, maneuvers well and the price was fantastic In fact, our friend could NOT believe how much we paid for it. He spent far more for his single kayak. The only issue I had was that it is still very heavy as most kayaks are. We just bought the wheel trailer and now that issue is resolved. I highly recommend this kayak as it is stable even with a family of 4 on board.",

I got a few compliments on the quality from some local kayakers, but it definately looks like a rental. The back support is a plus, the only thing i might change would be to get a longer paddle, it is very wide for the one it comes with.",
