I've since switched her over to Digestive Advantage which seems to do better. She now has normal poops about 4-5 times a week. So there's one relieved mommy here, no pun intended haha.",

The boxes also have coupons for $1 off their products so I can save $1 on their other stuff WalMart still has in store.",
