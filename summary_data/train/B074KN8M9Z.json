This is better in every way from the old model - easier to clean, better burners, better (although thinner) grates, better arrangement of the burners (they moved the large to the outside, so big pans and handles don't interfere with the controls). What more can I say? We've had it for a month, cook a lot, and love it!!",

I don\u2019t know why anyone would spend the extra money for a Profile. This unit seems just as nice and seems to have all the same features.",
