It comes with several attachments as well. This pump filled and deflated the Big Marble HD towable tube fast and it didn\u2019t struggle at all. This is a great buy. My only complaint is this pump doesn\u2019t have a light anywhere on it that shows it actually is charging but I can overlook that because it performs at such a high level. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase. Hit that helpful button if you find this review helpful.",

This pump is much more powerful than my previous pump, lighter/smaller in size, and is rechargeable so I don't have to worry about replacing the batteries every time I need to use it. It filled up my queen size air mattress in about 1 minute. I don't know how many times I could fill the air mattress before it needs to be recharged, but I certainly had no issues filling one air bed. The largest size nozzle fit in the air bed perfectly.
