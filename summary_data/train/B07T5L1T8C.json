I get medium tops more often than not, and sometimes will even go for a large if I want a top to be long enough to wear with leggings. For this shirt, however, I read the reviews and decided to go with a small in 'Steel Blue'. The small is perfect! It's still very roomy yet it doesn't look like a giant bag draped over me. It also passes the butt-covering test, which is a complete win for us tall girls! I will be wearing this with leggings and have already ordered it in more colors. So much better than some other brands of tunics listed on here!!",

I'm a stay at home mom, so I'm usually in my lularoe leggings and one of these shirts. Comfy but cute! I do think it runs a tad big, but due to the cut and material, there is wiggle room either way on sizing and so they still wear perfect.",

      "text": "I was happy to receive it and see it was large, flowing, and long enough for the leggings I wanted to wear it with. However, it was thin enough to be see-through, at least in white. Also, after wearing it a couple of times , I saw it had developed a noticeable imperfection right in front.It appears the fabric was scratched or snagged, not enough to make a rip but it's ugly enough that I'm downgrading it to exercise clothes. I blame the thin fabric. I did follow all the washing instructions and can't remember catching it on anything. I'm holding it in the photo",

Maternity clothes are so overpriced too. This top is great because it's really long, really flowy and I love the pink color. It hides my post-partum belly perfectly and I feel great in it. I highly recommend this top for Mamas or anyone looking for oversized or long flowy tops.",

They are nice and breezy, fit loosely without looking baggy, and they add enough cover for leggings or \"skinny\" fitting pants/bottoms. My only complaint is that when the lighter colored shirts (blue/gray etc) gets water on them they show the marks after the water dries until you wash them again. The dark shirts (brown/black) don't have as much of this problem (perhaps because the darker color covers the marks up making them less visible).",
