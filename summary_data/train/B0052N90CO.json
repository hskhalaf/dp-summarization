Something like this could easily get a student through their band years and more. With any reasonable care I assume this would last and be playable for a long time.",

The sound and action are both good and I have been playing it almost and hour everyday. I have a music background but have never played brass before so I do not have a comparison. Some reviews said they have sticky valves but that has not been the case with this particular instrument. I love it.",

If you buy this instrument, make sure you keep an eye on the valves and send your instrument back if you see issues early on, otherwise you'll be stuck with an unusable piece of junk like me.",

Tone and sound quality is really good, slotting in the upper register is loose and can be a little tricky, but can be decent with practice. Finish quality is superb and valves got much better after a few months. With any new horn you should always give it a little while to breakin. No comparison to my pro level Besson sovereign or King 2280, but an incredible intermediate and hobby horn. Large bore big sound.",

My embouchure was off as my lips tended to not wrap snugly around the horn mouth piece. 20 years later, I decided to pick up the euphonium to motivate my kids towards instruments.

The case is very sturdy and has held up well to my kids riding it like a horse. The only difficulty now is to transition from the treble clef (horn) to the base clef (euphonium)!",

      "text": "I rate this horn only three stars. Initial inspection revealed no apparent defects. Upon further review, I found that the slide for 2nd valve was loose and would slip out from either vibration or air pressure while playing. The spit valves are aligned poorly, just glad they do not leak air or spit. Overall tone is good from low notes to higher range. As a student or practice horn, I would give it a passing grade. Amazingly light weight...The gifts are s***. Pros might be amused, but no. For what I need, economy and lightweight, it'll do.",

      "text": "Very well finished instrument with free-moving pistons. Excellent case. The sound is certainly good enough for the amateur player - compared to something like a Boosey & Hawkes it's about 10% of the price and for the average bandsman that makes it a steal. The tuner that comes with it doesn't seem to function but that's not important - I have another anyway. Really good buy.",
