These were the 2nd pair I tried and was very impressed right away with the quality of the sound and the volume. The bass was not too punchy and sounded just write. The tweeter was very clear and had good volume too. Overall, I am very pleased with these as replacement speakers.

These speakers have very natural sound, the kind you can crank up and still listen to for hours.

      "text": "I powered these speakers with an amp in my 2019 tundra. Anyone who is in my truck tells me that the sound quality is so nice and clean. I was looking for a nice set of speakers that would not break the bank but also not sacrificing sound quality for a cheaper set. I am really happy with these.",

      "text": "purchased these based on bass response reviews. Disappointed. Not nearly the bass of the original speaker. Will most likely have to replace again with better quality. They're good for what they are, just not what I'm looking for. Then again I have separate tweeters so there's simply too much high freq and not enough bass for my taste",

      "text": "I run these 6x9's on a Rockford Fosgate \"power1000 25 to life\" amp. Unfortunately the first set only lasted for 13 months, on 75 watts of RMS power. Their RMS rating is 125 watts, but I guess they are over-rated by 50 watts, the left crossover had smoked and burnt out. They are cheap, so maybe just buy them for their low price and see if your amp doesn't ruin them.",
