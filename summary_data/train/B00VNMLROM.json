It took less then 5 minutes to prepare and cook them with no mess. They are adorable cakes and 1 mug mix made exactly enough for 1 set of 4 cupcakes. I used milk in the mix, it suggested milk or water, and they came out great In about 2 minutes!",

We've made cupcakes, mini pancakes, and muffins and they all turned out great. So much better than an Easy Bake Oven. Highly recommended.",

And I love it because I don't have 3 dozen cupcakes sitting around my house. It makes 4 miniature cupcakes. We just used a bisquick cupcake recipe I found online. We followed the instructions that came with the cupcake maker and the cupcakes turned out great. Of course you have to supervise your little ones, but she had a great time using it and the cupcakes cook in 3-4 minutes, so she didn't lose her patience during that time.",

Read many reviews, so I knew the cupcakes would be tiny, but not as tiny as they came out, and they continued to stick to the liners each time unless you spray a little cooking oil. Actually they came out better without the liners. Overall, they were not interested in making them again.",

One box of cake mix goes a long way. Her mom mentioned that they make about half a box and save the rest of the mix for another time. So far they love it. It also comes with the mini cupcake liners!",
