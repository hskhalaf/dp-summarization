      "text": "I purchased this to supplement my 2 year old circular inflatable lamp of which the current models claim 70 Lumins. The new one claims 90. The new one is at least 1/3 dimmer than the old lantern thus would actually be around 40-50, around half of what is claimed. Exaggeration is one thing but misstating a product's capacity by 50%, is a lie in my book. Back it goes and hopefully this review will prevent others from making the same mistake and wasting time repacking and sending it back.",

Easy transport as well. They were stored in the top of the sleeping bag pouch and made it through baggage with zero issues. Compact and easy to use! They would charge them on the dash of the car during the day and use them at night. Never lost strength.",

They light up a whole room as a few large canndle would. Great to hang from a tent. They hold their charge for days when not in use. They turn off and on with a little switch on the top. They fold up and take up very little space for camping. Very durable, I highly recommend them!",
