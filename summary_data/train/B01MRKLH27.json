It's not perfectly clear, but it's more clear than the silicone product I had been using. I love the fact that the TPU is so thin--it's almost like it's not even there.

It looked horrible, you could see the tape through it. Yesterday, after about 3mo of having it on there, the keys started to become discolored (poopy brown) on the keys I used the most. So, I took it off. And I'll be darned if that stupid sticky tape now won't come off. I'll try to use alcohol. But, seriously. Not a great experience overall.",

I cannot blame the keyboard protector for this, though, but rather the tight tolerance of the MacBook Pro, leaving almost no space between the keyboard and the display when the cover is closed, hence the five-star rating above, even though I am dissatisfied about this.",

It\u2019s amazing how much it reduces the sound from the keys. This is the second one I bought, and if I lost this one, I would buy another.

The cover just slipped over the keys - it isn't sticky like I was expecting and you can barely tell there's anything there at all. And I was expecting that it was going to be thick and annoying to get used to, but again, I can barely tell the difference. Highly recommend this product.",
