I can\u2019t tell you how many hours I\u2019ve wasted convincing myself not to get a professional-grade money counter like this one. It does in seconds what would normally take me 20-30 minutes (not counting time wasted losing count or making an error). Seamlessly devours whole stacks of bills, never missing a single one. If jammed, stops immediately leaving the misplaced bill(s) unharmed for removal. Love the counterfeit detection on it as well. Been working great so far for almost a month. No problems with display. Very aesthetic exterior design 10/10",

      "text": "Overall I'm very happy with this machine. It will occasionally jam, but most of the time it's a result of the quality of the bills and not the machine itself. The trickiest thing to using it is the way to load the bills into the feeder - the way that the diagram shows seems to jam more frequently for me, so I ended up loading smaller quantities and leaning them toward me (instead of away) and it's been working fine. For the price, this machine is a great buy!",

Right out of the box it counted very accurately but if the money was \"bowed or slightly folded\" and facing the discharge point, it would rain money which is cool but not great everywhere. This isn't covered in the manual or online. Countless experiments proved facing the money the opposite direction stopped it.",

If you need one, this one is great. P.S. It doesnt automatically detect the value of your bills, it just counts the number of bills put in it.",
