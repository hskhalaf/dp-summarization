Oh darn. :) You know you're getting older when the utensil you're using hurts to use. This scoop is awesome. it's comfortable in your hand and has weight but isn't too heavy. Best part? it cuts right through hard frozen ice cream like a dream! Don't even need to run it under water of any temperature! So easy to use you'll have a bigger bowl of ice cream than you meant to get! and no hand pain!",

First off, the scoop itself is only a 1/4 scooper size - meaning that you can only scoop out about a fourth of the ice cream. Secondly, it's very difficult to use with hard, good quality ice cream like Ben & Jerry's, Haagan Das, etc., because you really have to crank down hard to get the scoop to cut through the ice cream. I always damaged the carton using this scoop. My suggestion is to find a good and sturdy half-moon sized scooper if using the good kind of ice cream; OR, wait until the ice cream is half-way melted (yuk!) and then go to town on it.",

It is shockingly hefty and has a good weight to it. We bought it to replace one of our old scoops that fell apart. A week after this one arrived, our other scoop died as well. it is highly likely we'll buy another one of these as we've really liked it. You always need to have more than one ice cream scoop!!!",

But NOPE. This scoops it out with ease. I just hate it took me so long to listen to him. :)",

      "text": "This ice cream scoop it very comfortable to hold. If the ice cream is hard, it\u2019s nice to have an ergonomically friendly handle to grip on to because scooping hard ice cream requires a firm grip. I noticed some reviewers were displeased that this scoop did not produce rounds scoops of ice cream. I actually prefer this type of ice cream scoop. If you want round scoops of ice cream, you simply keep on scooping or rolling until a round scoop or ball of ice cream is formed. But with this scoop you also have the option of creating flatter scoops. I like having that option.",

IMO, the mechanical styles do not last so the solid type is better and this is the best I have used. The design of the metal scoop surface cuts through the ice cream (frozen solid) with ease. The handle is a bit big and I would hand wash this only. I would recommend this and buy it again.",

Because the handle is thicker, it is easy to hold onto it while using some force to scoop the ice cream. After a few scoopings, I run the scoop under warm water so that it continues to work well well in the ice cream. It is definitely worth the money. The last scoop you'll ever buy.",
