I feel the blue exhaust hinges take away from the sleekness of this laptop, but that's just my opinion. Touch screen works well, but the screen itself sometimes has a vibrating effect that could annoy some. I like the ports in the back but the power cord tends to fall out of the port a lot, as it isn't very snug when plugged in. Battery life is going to be a knock but when in power save mode there really isn't any issues. 5/5 worth every penny.",

I got it for around 1000$, 8gb RAM, 256 SSD, GTX860 2gb VRAM, and it is one of the best value for money gaming laptop out there; add to it the quality and great design and I would say it is THE best. some people have complained about screen flicker but that never happened to me, thankfully. I definitly recommend it to anyone even if not for gaming use, it is an overall great machine with very fast booting/loading times at a great price.",

I ordered a new USB3 adapter for $20 and to my surprise, the connection jumped up to 307Mbps (my max). Get rid of your original and upgrade for sure. Well worth it!",
