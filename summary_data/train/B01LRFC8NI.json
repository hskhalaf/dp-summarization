The silent switch on the side barely cleared the cutout, and the twelve microphone holes on the bottom didn\u2019t line up at all (holes were about 2/3 covered by the case). Not the smartest design as they could have just used two long cutouts on the bottom instead of trying to use precise holes. I would\u2019ve included a photo but it\u2019s impossible to take one with my only camera (phone) while the case is on! Doh...",

So, the fact that I\u2019ve dropped it about 20 times; and my phone hasn\u2019t even gotten a scratch is awesome. Now, I got a clear case so I don\u2019t know anything about how the colors look, but I\u2019m very satisfied with this case! Would definitely order again!!",

It is also difficult, if not impossible, to press the on/off button on my i-phone.

Also, the case is not completely transparent. There are tiny white dots dispersed across the inside surface, presumably to stop the \"watermark\" common in clear cases. However, as a result of the tiny dots, the case looks milky and isn't clear. This case is a great, cheap way to protect your phone against dropping, but it isn't clear and the speakers are obstructed. I hope this helps someone. :)",

There is a clear lip around the screen and the camera area which allows for the phone to be put on flat surfaces without risking scratches. Will see how well it holds over time in terms of durability. You get what you paid for: The little holes at the bottom don't quite line up with the speaker.",
