I had this in a 10ml bottle and loved it, that's why I decided to purchase the 30ml bottle... after trying to figure out for the longest time why there's such a difference I compared the ingredients... turns out they exchanged the sweet orange with blood orange and dont know what else, but this one stinks! Will only buy directly from edens garden website from now on (compared the ingredients listed on the 10 ml bottles, they matched the listed ingredients on website)",

After adding a few drops I noticed right away that it was different than my usual oils. It was very yellow like olive oil and it clung to the sides of the diffuser. After the water had run out, the inside of the diffuser was very oily and yellow looking. For that reason, I would not recommend using it in a diffuser.",

The smell of orange is very strong and relaxing and just few drops are enough to make everything slippery and ready for massage . Less than 1/3 of the bottle was enough for whole body massage , dough I wouldn't recommend massaging intimate area with it . Otherwise I recomend the product for couples who wants just romantic relaxing massage",
