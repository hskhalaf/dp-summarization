      "text": "Bought these in part because I saw reviews or question answer mention it had good arch support. Under the arch is actually the thinnest, weakest part of the sole, where it comes off the ground between the ball and the heel. The sole isn't quite rigid enough to provide any support in this area, and in fact, I can feel where the sole hits the floor at the end of the ball and start of the heel as slight lumps under my foot. Besides this, they are fairly comfortable and easy to adjust for a custom fit. I don't dislike them. I just wish they had better arch support.",

I have narrow to average width feet and I felt like they kind of looked like clown flip flops even though they were the correct size. I'd definitely recommend them for someone that is looking for an incredibly comfortable/ orthotic type flip flop, but maybe a darker color.",

I understand needing traction but not practical for wearing on certain outdoor surfaces. Very difficult to clean. Can\u2019t just dust/scrape of or quickly wash.

Second, I love Clark style so I hoped these would be comfortable for all day wear at the park and beach when vacationing. They didn\u2019t disappoint there either! Wore them right out of the box and was so happy...no blisters. And finally, I wear a 9.5 ladies and have wide feet so I was also concerned they\u2019d be too narrow. Not an issue! Couldn\u2019t have fit better and if there are more colors, I\u2019ll buy more!!",

All that, and they look good, too! (By the way, the silver ones look great with blue jeans.)",

I wish I hadn't spent the money on these and just bought more of the quilted reefs instead. Two stars for the style, though. I got the nude color and the shiny part above the foot is really cute.
