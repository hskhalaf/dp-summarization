It gets clogged up very easy. Only works when I am pulling it backwards. If I push it forward it doesn't cut the grass. It chews through cord, I have to replace the spool at least twice per mow. Just a small front and fenced in backyard. The electrical cord (sold separately) is SUPER annoying, makes the job so much more difficult. Buying a cheap gas mower for the next time I have to mow. At least I have an alright weed eater though.",

I like that it doesn\u2019t use gas or a battery. Some people might not like dragging an extension cord around, but I prefer it. I don\u2019t expect much obviously because of the low price.

It requires you to go over the same spots a couple of times and even from opposite direction if the blade bends the first time over.

It is very easy to use and lightweight, which is very important to me. I have only used it once but I really like it and I think it is going to be just what I wanted. I used to say, why doesn't someone invent a small, lightweight mower that is easy to use, and here it is.",

      "text": "It died on it's second use. Normally this wouldn't bother me as I know a warranty will cover the product, but going through the warranty process has been an awful experience. First off, the warranty information is out of date, the product is not warranted by Spectrum like the manual states. When trying to navigate through the Black and Decker website, it is non-responsive and there is no clear area regarding warranties. I am also used to being able to send back a product when faulty, but in this case they require that you go to a service center, which is 20 miles away. This will be the last time I purchase any Black and Decker products.",

I like the telescoping handle - you can have it the height that works for you. Using it is kinda like vacuuming your carpet. The only bad thing is that there is No Way to leave the unit on - you have to squeeze the handle the entire time.... Hence 4 stars rather than 5.",
