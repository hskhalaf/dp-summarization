As soon as I saw the damage to the bark I wrapped the tree with this wrap and crossed my fingers that it would allow the remaining bark to reattach and that is would protect the remaining material. Fast forward to this spring and the tree is doing great. The wrap held up all winter and the deer apparently do not like rubbing on this wrap so no new damage.",
