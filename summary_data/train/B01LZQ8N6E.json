      "text": "From the moment I picked these up from the box I realised that this may be my last pair of headphones. I probably wouldn't need anything better. I'm not expert at headphones but I decided to treat myself after owning a pair of hd 598s for just over 3 years. What an upgrade. The sound is so much warmer and less fatiguing to listen to. The build quality is what you'd expect from German made headphones. I just can't recommend these enough. If you are considering picking these up, I highly suggest that you just get them. A great investment that will last you for years to come. Glad I jumped off the Sennheiser bandwagon to try something different",

      "text": "As mentioned in a previous review, I purchased these as upgrade to a pair of Grado's 325I's. The Grado's were great with certain types of music but the treble became harsh and incoherent when music would get complex and loud. That problem completely disappears with the Amiron's. They can handle anything thrown at them and retain clarity in the treble and the low end. The jump from a \u00a3300 pair of headphones to a \u00a3500 pair is definitely easy to hear and worth it.",

      "text": "Really wanted to like these - They look great, feel pretty comfortable, and the price is reasonable. However (used with a Chord Hugo TT DAC as source) I was immediately aware of an unnaturally brightly lit sound. Not balanced sounding at all. Very forceful and \u2018shouty\u2019 in presentation. Just couldn\u2019t relax with them. Ideal however if you like a very fast, punchy bass and dynamic presentation. Not a good allrounder, but probably ideal for Metal and Thrash etc. These could have been something very special if the sound was better balanced. Perhaps if there\u2019s ever a Mk2 these might be worth another audition.",

The headphones are exceedingly comfortable (I happen to be exactly a setting 3, so perhaps if you\u2019re caught between headband settings it could be a little less so), to the degree that you almost forget to wear them. The included cable is about a mile long, so I have swapped that out for a shorter one that\u2019s a bit more practical. Sound quality is phenomenal as you would expect for the price tag.",
