You are supposed to plug in your iPad to play games and do lessons, but it's no fun without the keys making sound. After unplugging it and turning it off and back on, it started working again. Overall, it's tons of fun with the games and ways it teaches you to play. I just hope we didn't get a lemon.",

      "text": "Nice keyboard, will work with what I bought it for, however, did not come with a power cable. If anyone knows how to get one sent to me please let me know. Song choices I've wanted to play are very limited as every time I search the app I either can't find what I'm looking for or it is for 88 keys. They are also about 3.99 each. I'm undecided about returning this product for a Casio with songs already uploaded. Looks slick and it's convenient to be able to hook up my tablet/phone.",

Still, I can't find any info on how or what exact power cord to use. Don't want to put the wrong type of power source and ruin the piano. Guess I expected more. While the product might be great...I can't use it without power and I didn't order it to be used with batteries.",
