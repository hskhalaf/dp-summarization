I've been getting more and more clients interested in it so this is my 3rd set of these cups. I also have a set of four large silicone cups from this company and two 40 pump cup sets from Karea, a small Haci set , and a biomagnetic/acupressure set. The silicone cups are very versatile and great for rounded areas like legs. CUP ON!",

With these, I learned, that all cups aren\u2019t equal and you get what you pay for. Even while gliding people complain that it feels as if it\u2019s cutting into them and is not pleasurable. During a stagnant usage it even creates a deep line that looks close to a cut, and a temporary but painful stinging/burning sensation at site where cup was latched to skin. Other brands I\u2019ve used did not have this effect. Love cupping but these bring pain into it which isn\u2019t supposed to be there.",
