This seemed like a close alternative with good reviews. It didn't disappoint. Kids loved it. They said it was just like MK. Heard them both say they actually thought it was better. For reference, they are 7 and 11. They had no problems figuring the game out. They put the disk in and started playing right away and had a blast.",

Even though I was wanting a \"fun\" and \"light\" game to take a break from BLOPS II and BF3, this thing left me feeling mostly \"meh\" by about the second hour into it. They could have done so much more to polish it up a little - and even on the fastest setting, the racing isn't intense at all. Not even a little bit. Buy another racing game if you want fun AND playable.",
