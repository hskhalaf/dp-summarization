The tongue is glued to the sides, effectively making it act like a tight sock that will tear if one isn't careful getting the shoe on the foot. I guess it would be an okay shoe IF your foot is VERY skinny. I was also disappointed to receive my shoes all laced up tightly meaning they were returned by someone else. It is always problematic buying shoes online. Don't bother with these shoes: save your money for better shoes.",

Cons: some people in the review complain about the gaudy color, but there\u2019s plenty of colors to choose from so I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re complaining, you will have to wear thin athletic socks or no socks since the shoe has a liner akin to an aqua sock.
