If you wish to attach a hose, you have to fiddle with the connector and hose to get it attached to the unit. It has a small clear tube that has to be connected to an inside nozzle which requires quite a bit of fiddling and hand strength. Also you need a screw to get the hose attachment mounted, and it's not included and no indication on size or type, which was maddening to find something that would work. For the cost of a penny or three, the damed screw could have been included.",

The water catcher is easy to dump and the buttons are easy to understand. I also purchased a 3 year warranty so I will be set if the dehumidifier decides to crap out on me! So far so good....",

Air quality is noticeably better now and all musty smells are gone. This machine is easy to set up, move around, empty and it's also pretty quiet. When the fan is set on turbo, it's no louder than a box fan on high speed. Much quieter when fan speed is set lower. The first couple days I was having to empty it several times a day. Now I only empty it once a day since the humidity level is much lower. It operates perfectly, exactly as described in the description. It was delivered on time and in excellent condition.

All you hear is a quiet fan. oh!, then i realized it was on Turbo mode so i switched that off and laughed some more that anyone could leave a bad review for loudness. After my histerics, i think i could hear the gentle grasp of a coconut husk from a European Swallow over this machine.",

It fills completely up about 3 times day and keeps the air at the setting of 50% humidity. I do not use the auto drain functionality, but instead manually empty the water container. It is very easy to use and automatically stops running when the water is full. It is louder than I expected, so I turn it off each night to sleep",
