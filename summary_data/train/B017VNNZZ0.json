So glad i found this. Very sturdy. Very comfy!! Great padding-- something I was looking for. And very roomy while still slim. Very lightweight which is important for me for the times my husband isnt around to carry it",

Every time I tighten the straps, then pull to check the tension, the straps come completely loose again. This seat provided great comfort, easy to install, and lightweight, but just not worth the risk of my child\u2019s safety.",

We have never been able to firmly secure this rear facing and had to use it forward facing in a variety of vehicles. 2. The straps do not have much slack and I'm not sure it will fit my 2 year old for very long. 3. The straps are very difficult to tighten and loosen.",

      "text": "We purchased this carseat on Prime Day for our toddler to use when she is with her grandparents. It was easy enough for my wife to install and our daughter appears to be comfortable in it. It doesn't take up any more space than her infant seat did. The instructions that accompanied the seat were clear and straightforward. We installed it using the seatbelt path as the Latch hook method didn't produce as secure of a fit as we would have liked.",

      "text": "Very comfortable but too big for a smaller sedan. At least width wise, we aren't able to fit it next to two booster seats. It does seem more expensive (north of $100) than models with more cushioning. Wouldn't recommend if you have limited room other wise a nice choice if the price falls below $100. No problems installing, standard design with anchor straps etc. would rather have less width than the two useless cup holders.",
