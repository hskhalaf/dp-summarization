Yeah, not good to be a coffee addict and have serious stomach problems! Tried Puroast and almost too flat of a taste. This has been great for her. Good flavor and the ability to drink multiple cups without the issues that other brands have. Only issue I could mention is the bag we ordered and got was 'best buy March 2017' at the end of March 2017. But, we have half a bag left and it's still fine. I'm sure a fresher bag would taste even better.",

To keep that from happening, I was recently researching low-acid coffees to purchase and this coffee was on the list! Wow, I had no idea! So, I ordered some and enjoy it just as much as I did before. It really is one of the best, if not THE best, whole bean coffees I've ever had. Smooth, not bitter at all, wonderful aroma and the taste - so good!! (And it's less expensive than Simpatico, which was the other brand I was debating about buying.) Definitely recommend!",

My favorite is ground very coarse then use old fashion percolator, the percolator reaches temperatures that extract flavor from the beans that drip makers dream about plus paper filters rob you of so much flavor !!",

      "text": "I purchased Don Pablo Subtle Earth Coffee because my doctors (more than one!) recommended that I switch to a coffee with low acidity due to concerns with reflux and irritation in my esophagus. I read the reviews, checked the prices, and researched low acid coffees to find the best for me. I have become a big fan of organic coffee and products that support small growers through fundraisers I have sponsored at schools. So...no brainer! I purchased Don Pablo, ground my beans for the first time in years with my 35-year-old Krups grinder, and was pleasantly surprised: delicious! I have a new morning coffee!",

I used a Kalita Wave 185 to test and there was absolutely no gassing when doing the initial pour. It was more like looking at the top of a chocolate muffin.

While this bag was really compressed, there was no static in the grounds. Honestly, I will buy this again and again. I really cannot believe how good this coffee is! Plus, water process decaf and certified organic. Win-win in my book.",
