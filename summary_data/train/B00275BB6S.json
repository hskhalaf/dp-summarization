It's in great shape! I have saved a lot of money on paper towels. I don't use it for washing dishes. (I use Starfiber Scrubbies) I use Skoy cloth for counter tops, table, sink, appliances, stove, etc. The photos show it just taken out of the washing machine for the third time.",

So only get this product if you have lots of beverage spills or water spills in your household. Can be cut in half and used as a dis cloth, I suppose, but I'd rather have a sponge as a dishcloth.",

Had I tried this brand first, I would have known to rate the competitor brand less than the 5-stars I gave them because Skoy truly deserves the 5-stars for this product. These cloths have much a softer texture than the competitor brand, which I prefer. I've been using one cloth in the kitchen for almost one month now with no real signs of wear yet and still odorless! The competitor brand started to fall apart after three weeks of daily use, revealing a mesh material sandwiched in the center. I microwave the cloths as directed once a day.

I am disappointed because I did not see anyone else state the same experience. The counter looked and felt clean, but if it requires using paper towels after each use it completely defeats the purpose of buying these. I was ready to buy several more, but after seeing what color residue came off- looks like I will need to continue using paper towels:(",

Best part, you can wring them out with a one-hand-squeeze. When they get a bit grungy looking, they make great house cleaning cloths - sturdy yet pliable enough to get into small corners and spaces. Completely washable. ( Tip: Dry flat so they can stack and lay flat in the drawer with the others for neater storage.) Love them!",

They soak up water on kitchen counter, around the bathroom sink, and I'm using one with Lysol spray to disinfect items from the grocery store/deliveries. I even used one to soak up water from tofu that I was pressing before frying, and it worked like a dream. Easy to clean too - throw in your dishwasher, or hand wash with soap. Great purchase!",

I mostly use them for cleaning counters, but they work great on dishes too. I like the colors in this set, they camoflog stains better than ones with a white background. The flower pattern is very basic, but so worth the money verses the pretty patterned ones I was paying $5.95 each for at the store. They are easy to wash, just rinse them well or throw them in the washing machine and let them air dry.",

Nice large size for wiping down counters. They rinse well and dry fast if you hang over faucet. They don't smell moldy. I've washed them in washer several times. They are showing some wear, but still going. I'd guess one of these cloths will outlast at least a dozen square sponges.",
