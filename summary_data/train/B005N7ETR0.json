Even if I just treat one small spot on one article, it will make the whole load of laundry stink. The smell also stays in the washing machine and will make the next load have a scent (even if I don't stain treat anything).",

I like the idea of pressing it down on fabric, rolling the cleaner on the stain, washing it as normal, hanging garment to dry and finding that \"presto\" the stain is gone. So easy to use. No ruined clothing. Way to go OxiClean!",
