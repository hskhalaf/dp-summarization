After 1 week I noticed my leg swelling has dramatically reduced. I recommend taking it with a warm glass of milk. I'll continue taking this brand and gradually cut down the dosage once my swelling is completely gone. A wonderful product all around.",

Bio Schwartz: 1350 mg of turmeric x .03% ( 3% of turmeric is curcuminoids, the whole reason we consume this product) + 150 mg of turmeric extract = 190.5 mg of curcuminoids. So 190.5 mg per dose x 30 doses = 5,715 mg of curcuminoids in one bottle. Amazon Elements Turmeric complex: 400 mg of curcuminoids x 65 doses = 26,000 mg of curcuminoids in one bottle. So a 5,750 mg bottle vs a 26,000 mg bottle is a no brainer. They're relatively the same price, both contain 10 mg of piperine, and the Amazon elements even has 140 mg of ginger root while the Bio Schwartz has no ginger root at all.",

However, when I received the product, the bottle says that each capsule is only 500 mg dosage and one has to swallow 3 capsules to hit \"1500 mg\". This is purely a misleading, money grabbing, deceitful practice. AMAZON should ask this company to stop this misleading claim and hence cheating with no shame.",

I've decided to try Turmeric, and 2 weeks after I started to take Turmeric Curcumin, the pain started to go away and the inflammation on my hands was finally over.

No box outside the bottle. 2. Plastic bottle was warped and clearly made of cheaper plastic. 3. Moisture pack inside is different. 4. Label front and color are subtlety different. 5. Capsules inside are Of different color and smell. Also checked with Bioschwartz. They did not change packaging. Tumeric supplements are known to have dangerous contaminants if not sources well. Not taking any chances with my health. Now I am subscribing directly from Bioschwartz. Also contacted Amazon customer service; gave me some BS about frustration free packaging.

Also he has noticed an improvement in his joints and hip. I also began taking it daily with him for neck pain and I feel this has helped with my condition also. I would highly recommend this product.
