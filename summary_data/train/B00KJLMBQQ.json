Charging light stays at red even though it should go to blue after about 2 hours. In my infinite wisdom, I thought maybe I was just using them wrong, and totally forgot about it. Found it again a few months later and tried again and I wind up with the same results. Bought a Jaybird X3 recently, and have had no issues (other than it not being water proof).",

I honestly don't know what could be done about that. In full disclosure, I do sweat a lot and it gets hot where I live so maybe not an issue for most.",

Set at the same volume level on my iPhone 6+ the sound is perceived to be lower on the Plantronics.

The best part is that they DO CONTINUE TO WORK after they become soaked with perspiration. First headphone I've had that continues to work. Easy to pair, easy to operate, battery will last for at least five hours with continuous play.",

I use them mostly for the gym, running, and riding my bike. They fit well, sound OK, and hold a decent charge. Occasionally, I had issues with them connecting to my iPhone or losing the connection. Yesterday, they died..stoppped pairing and now they won;t run on. I decided on the PowerBeat 3 Wireless despite the 2x cost b/c of 1)Longer battery 2)Better sound 3)Tighter Apple integration For the money, these are good headphones, but the occasional bluetooth problems can be frustrating.",

They stay in place well since the connecting band is light and they employ ear hooks. The only negative for me is that they make my ears sore in the contact area after about an hour or so. I would buy them again though for this type of headset.",

It is a good thing when cycling but not when you're in a gym which plays its own music. It stays better than jaybirds though.

I do use it with my iphone. The microphone is not the best (hence 4 instead of 5 stars). People do hear background noises. However, I can hear the other party loud and clear! As a music headphone to hear songs from iheart radio etc, the music quality through the headphone is AWESOME! I do highly recommend it.",

The two biggest issues I have with Bluetooth headphones when I'm running are they're either uncomfortable or the ear buds keep coming loose and fall out of my ears (especially when I sweat). These BackBeat Fit set have neither of those issues. Once you put them on, they don't move at all...they stay in place and they are so comfortable. Seriously, if you're looking for a great pair of Bluetooth headphones, get these! They are worth every penny! Otherwise, you'll spend lesser money on headphones that will just end up being replaced anyways.",

Moisture is not a problem. They are NOT noise cancelling or noise isolating - which is really good if you're an outdoor runner and need to be aware of your environment.
