      "title": "Great study tool",
      "text": "Awesome detail in this book. It's to-the-point and explains things very well. My only complaint so far is that I do wish they included explanations to the quiz answers. Also, if you're serious about passing this exam, download an IOS app called \"Real estate for dummies\" . Not sure if they have it for android but probably. It's $10/ month with a 3 day free trial and has HUNDREDS of quiz questions ALL with explanations and they guy is actually pretty funny and keeps it interesting. Good luck!",

      "title": "Not worth it",
      "text": "The book does not say which content is for what license. There is a different need for salespersons, brokers and appraisers, but I have to figure out what it is I need. The book does not explain the answers for quizzes. It claims there are sample tests, but those tests repeat the questions I got earlier at the end of chapters still without explanation. The biggest problem is that I don't know what I need to study. Also, some questions are out of nowhere - there is no mention of that content in the text. This book is a waste of money.",

Honestly, don\u2019t recommend it as it\u2019s very general. Find a book specific to your state.... that\u2019s what you\u2019ll be tested on.",
