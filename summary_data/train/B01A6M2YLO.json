They actually have weight to them and use really nice leather. Definitely some good bang for your buck. Really good color too",

Main issue I noticed is when you\u2019re driving with the way you position your foot near the accelerator/brake. That\u2019s when you really notice the padding on the back of your arch above the heal. I\u2019m hoping over time as the boot gets broken in that the padding gets worked in.

Something about them they just don't really secure to the foot correctly and you find yourself really tugging on the laces to get them to feel like they do--but they don't and if you step wrong on a stone or piece of lumber you will fall off your boots and twist an ankle.

But these are heavier than one would think. I wore them to work once and that was pretty much the end of it for me. These are actually heavier than an old pair of leather work boots I have which simply amazed me. If you don't mind the weight, these are pretty nice though.",

It wasn't even the leather squeezing into the boot; the sole of the shoe itself is too small which causes it to dig into the sides of the bottom of my foot. Definitly go a half size up if you want to try them anyway. Definitly getting a refund for mine, though.",

      "text": "I love these shoes. This is my third pair, each lasting about 3-4 years of constant wearing. As someone who lives in a snowy climate, it's great for those cold snow covered mornings. Feet never get wet, but still get a bit cold (not sure I can fault them for that though since they'll be surrounded by snow for 30 minutes cleaning off your car). Also look great as a normal day-to-day \"shoe\". However, if you're looking for something to go running in.... obviously not the shoe for you. You want something durable and waterproof. These guys are for you in my opinion.",

Will update in a few months with lasting quality.",

I can see specific areas (about one or two per boot) that become darker when exposed to water which I assume are where it gets in. They are located along the crevice between the shoe leather in the front half and the rubber sole, and can probably be spot treated with some kind of water proofing material. Also, the faux leather 'cuff' around the top of the boot is pretty thin and may split eventually since my heel rubs pretty hard against it when I'm putting it on.",

I have high arches so no matter what brand I buy I put my arch supports in place. These are replacing some Red Wing boots and so far so good. The Red Wings lasted a bit over 2 years after getting sent back for warranty repairs within the first year and then I performed the same repair again myself six months later. So, if these will last two years at a quarter of the cost of the Red Wings it's a steal! I hope they are warm in the winter. Will know soon.",
