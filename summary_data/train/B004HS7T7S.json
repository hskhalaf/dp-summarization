It takes some practice but, read and follow the instructions carefully; hold the yarn taunt, turn the handle at a moderate speed, carefully watch for potential errors to be able to fix immediately, and DO NOT try to back up. The results will be a perfectly knitted project in a fraction of the time that it takes to hand knit. If you do all this and have repeated problems, you may have received a defective product.",

I can hold together two or three strands of fingering weight yarn to get a blank that will give me skeins that match (or at least go together). I also thought I could use the machine to quickly use up bits of yarn from other projects and make hats. I'm still sorting out what weight works best. So far I think that is in the aran, chunky, bulky range. Bottom line: easy to get started using, may take some time to figure out what works for you.",

Although one hat was too light weight for warmth, I\u2019m using slightly thicker yarn now (occasionally two thinner yarns held together), and having so much fun that I\u2019ve (unfortunately) started buying yarn just to make more hats. Using this is a great break between more \u201cserious\u201d projects. Easy to learn, easy to use.",

Cons: Hooks break easily, the stitch drops continuously when making flat panels and even though the instructions say any thickness yarn is ok.... I wouldn't go too thick it will break the hooks. The machine seems to be made of cheap plastic personally it's not worth $198. All in all I don't regret my purchase my 15 y/o old loves it, we've had the Addi for about 3 weeks and she's made 12 hats so far.....so it was worth it.",

This is my first completed project. :) UPDATE: I mounted mine on an old shelving board so I could use it from the couch or in bed. Left handed users may find it easier to use if it's placed/mounted with the crank wheel facing you and the digital counter facing left. You'll have a good view of the needles to ensure the yarn catches properly and the crank will be closer.",
