They come out of the dryer in terrible shape. (no care label attached). Go for something more expensive with some polyester, perhaps stain resistance. Strings are good and sound and sturdy, but the front is not satisfactory for wearing in retail environment without ironing, and probably starching. Cloth seems very absorbent. I'll use them for window washing.",

I embroidered it, then washed it and it came out great. Yes, it is cotton and needs to be pressed. But for anyone who actually uses an apron when cooking, you will understand why cotton beats polyester every time. For anyone who is embroidering, I used Terial Magic as the stabilizer and it worked perfectly. My one and only complaint is that the neck band is not adjustable. But for this price, I can get over it. I will be purchasing many more.",

And since all-cotton aprons are getting harder to find (most commercial aprons in this price range are a bit roomier, but usually 70/30 or at best 50/50 poly/cotton), if you want something to dye or paint (or dye or paint in--so it will get satisfyingly stained with your efforts), this is an excellent choice. If you want a cooking apron, the poly blend options are probably a better choice, as 100% cotton gets dingy quickly, even with bleach.",
