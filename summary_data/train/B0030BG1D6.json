Bag is very poor, needs a better design so it doesn't spray very fine dust, dust mask is a must.",

I'd say you'd need to be wearing coveralls and a cap and possibly a mask.

As a blower it works great as well, has a \"focused\" tip that you can remove to make the pattern wide. This has been great for cleaning out the garage and driveway. Great product with a METAL impeller, at a bargain price.",

There is a narrow cap attachment for a more direct hit of air when needed. They could have charged a lot more money and it would have still been worth it! Great product!

      "text": "Good thing I ignored the few negative reviews. This Blower/Mulcher is great. I am pulling leaves off of woodchips and the variable speed is perfect, I can set it so it pulls up the leaves, but not the woodchips. One negative Nelly said it would not suck up wet leaves, probably true, but it did get old leaves in areas I have not raked in 3 seasons. The assembly was very easy and the blower is very powerful. Also it is a Mulcher, it will mulch the leaves so they do not take up much space in the bag (bag was very heavy duty and worked perfectly). Great Buy for $45",

After a couple of years the bag actually disintegrated like cardboard. The only place you can purchase a replacement bag is at Greenworks - for $27.00. If you buy this blower, order 2 or 3 extra bags. That should last the life of the blower/vacuum. As for me, I'll stick with my old Toro. The bag is still in good condition.",

But that's inherent to the way it works, not a product problem. Superb product for the price.",

We'll say that again - our entire product line will never release an ounce of carbon emission into the air. 4 Year Warranty - Double The Industry Standard. When looking for lawn tools, we know you're thinking about quality. You're looking for something that will get the job done and get you back to your weekend. That's why GreenWorks backs every tool with a full four-year warranty - we know our products will perform at the highest level and always be reliable. GreenWorks high quality products are manufactured to last. That's why we back every product with a warranty that's twice the industry standard. We'll provide all the power you need without polluting the air or forcing you to keep hauling your gas can to the nearest station (especially in the middle of a mow). No more tune-ups or maintenance. No more emissions. Fifty-four million Americans mow their lawns every weekend, according to the EPA, using 800 million gallons of gas each year. Along the way, homeowners spill more than 17 million gallons of gas while refueling. That's equivalent to the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. It's time to move beyond clumsy, harmful gas-powered mowers.
