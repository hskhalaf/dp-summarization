Available for both men and women, this low-top shoe from Blake Mycoskie\u2019s sneaker brand obtained positive ratings as an excellent everyday go-to shoe from most buyers for its lightweight, stylish look and colors, and affordable price.\u00a0Although stiff at first that a brief break-in period is needed, the TOMS Cabrillo shoe is still noted by most as overall comfortable on foot for everyday wear. Its flexibility is worth noting, too. However, minimal foot support can be expected.",

However, I was able to insert a dr. scholl's arch support and it ended up being in the right spot. Debating whether to keep these or not. UPDATE: I wore these around the house for a few days and noticed the tongue is very stiff and puts pressure onto my ankle. It only happens on one foot, so it may or may not be bothersome to you. However, given the stiffness of the tongue, upper edges and the arch issue I have decided to return them.",
