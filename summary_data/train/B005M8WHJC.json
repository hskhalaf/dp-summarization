This means, you'll need thicker socks if walking on snow as you'll lose some heat through the thinner sole. What I love: clean look. low soles What I don't care about: fizzy yellow stitching (classic Martens). not breathable.",

      "text": "These boots look great,they broke in quickly, and are quite comfortable. They fit as expected. They slip on wet floors and I bought them for work so this sucks. Additionally I think the right boot is a lemon as the tongue will not stay center ever, and the sole came away from the upper, above the stitching, after less than a week, ( few drops of super glue fixed that issue but the tongue always falling to the side is annoying). They look good and feel good. I might buy these again but not for my work. Cool cheap boots.",

They do a much better job of keeping my feet dry than sneakers, and seeing i work inside the sole is good enough. But I do wish for a better arch supporting foot bed. Overall pretty comfy, fit well and have broken in fairly well. Decent enough.",

    "description": "The tobias features a sleek silhouette chalk full of doc's iconic dna in a lighter contemporary style\n\nEasy, casual and perfectly classic, Dr. Martens reinvents a favorite with the Tobias boot. In fabric, this understated offering boasts a secure lace-up closure and the classic contrast-stitched Doc Marten midsole for tons of appeal. A grippy sole grants you safe passage wherever you take yourself in Tobias.\n\nDr. Martens is the stuff of legends. It all began near Munich, Germany in 1945 when Dr. Klaus Maertens injured his foot in a skiing accident in the Bavarian Alps. To make walking easier during the healing process, he designed a shoe with an air-cushioned sole. Using old rubber tires, he constructed soles that had air trapped within closed compartments. He showed his prototype to his engineer/inventor friend, Dr. Herbert Funck, and together they decided to develop and produce the shoes. Not only did the shoe solve the doctor's immediate problem, but it also started to sell well in Germany. By 1959 the two decided that they needed a company to produce and distribute the shoes, then called Dr. Maertens, in other parts of the world. At first, many manufacturers rejected the concept of an air cushioned sole as a short-lived gimmick. However, the R. Griggs Group, located in the village of Wollaston in England, decided to go along with the idea by creating the first work boot with the revolutionary sole. On the first of April 1960, the first cherry red eight-eyelet work boot was produced and named 1460. To sell the brand name better in England, the name was anglicized to Dr. Martens. The range was branded AirWair and the rest is history.\n\nSee more",
