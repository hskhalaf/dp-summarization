Only one issue - you can't poll an up to the minute or 5 minutes for current conditions. That is Extremely ironic for a weather app! Even an hour is unacceptable. It just makes no sense at all since there's Radar that is up to within 5 minutes real time. Hope their techs read this, I'll try again to email. They fix this and it'll be then a Perfect weather app. Then they'll have earned 5 stars.",
