I actually cut \"V's\" into the bottom of it to give it a serrated edge so I could rotate it into the ground and cut through small roots but even then it was very difficult to use, and being made of soft metal, my \"V's\" would get bent now and again (should have made them less deep)--and I had over 200 ground-cover plugs to plant. A small spade will give you better results.",

As to be expected the \"digging\" portion fills with soil that can get stuck (my soil is heavy on the clay), so the solution is just to have a stick of some variety to \"poke\" the clump out. Thank you for the awesome tool! I look forward to many seasons with it.",
