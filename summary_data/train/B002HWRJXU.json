I am a habitual YouTube user and my Digital Entertainer Live helps watch all my favorite videos and songs. Being a stickler for organized files I find it difficult to name files because the device won't support Unicode. It seems I can't name my files in other languages!!

I have a PS3 and use PlayOn to stream a variety of sources like Hulu and Netflix. The output from this device is far worse than the PS3s using the same source (Playon). I even called netgear support to confirm that I had the latest firmware and that the device was setup optimally. Basically for SD output it is acceptable for HD output it is unacceptable.

The VuNow service is totally useless because I have had nothing but problems accessing the server despite having had customer support by someone with a weird name who could barely speak English. Because of this, it was definitely not worth the money-I returned it for a refund and got much better results with a 10.00 DVI cable hook up from my computer to my tv.",
