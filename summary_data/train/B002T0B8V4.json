Its about a foot taller than what I expected so its a little hard to fit in my van however the extra length does come in handy. Highly recommend.",

Already familiar with Magline quality, it was a clear choice, absolutely no regrets. Some assembly is required but if you have some basic hand tools, no problem. There was a minor manufacturing issue but a brief email to Gemini customer service and a replacement part was promptly sent and worked perfectly, A+ customer service. The hand truck converts to platform in seconds, is heavy duty throughout and unlike similar products, there are no plastic parts at stress points, should last for many years.",
