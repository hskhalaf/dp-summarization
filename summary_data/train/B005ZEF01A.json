      "text": "Loved that it was unlocked. Bought this phone over a year ago and it has lasted very well. Everything is updated regularly from Google as it is unlocked. Pairs well with T-mobile prepaid plans or any other prepaid on a GMS. Does not work with CDMA chips nor Micro Sims, eg (apple). From people I've know this phone can work in other countries off a GMS chipset from a local carrier. Will repeat business when the phone eventually gives out. Perfect for the price. Love the fact that it comes without many apps on it. Didn't need to root it since it didn't come with a ton of Ad-aware or advertisement from the actual company bought from.",

I purchased this unlocked version of the device since I use AT&T and have have not been disappointed. Not only is the screen beautiful but it's very responsive. Ice Cream Sandwich runs extremely smooth on the phone as you would expect. I would highly recommend this phone to anybody who wants the best Android phone on the market. The price is realistic compared to other devices without a contract. Not to mention that when you buy the phone out right you don't have to renew a contract to be stuck in.",

Being able to replace the battery at need is a plus that saved me during a recent trip to Asia. My phone was camera, GPS, and source of information for the whole day. Dead battery? No problem: grab the spare one and replace the dead one. On a Nexus 4 you gotta plug it in and, honestly, I don't think I would enjoy holding in my hands both the phone and a USB charging pack while I am walking around and using the phone constantly.",

It's so convenient and intuitive, and it just feels very well constructed, and high quality all around. The only fault that I can find is basically that there is no SD card slot. That's a shame since this was one of the big advantages of Android. But it's so easy to just plug in any micro usb cable and transfer files, that it's not a big deal. The computer instantly recognizes the device. Other than that, it's all pretty nice. Battery could be better probably but that's pretty common. Bottom line: Buy this phone. You won't regret it.",
