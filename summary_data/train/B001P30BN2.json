This bag would hold a circular saw, 3 nail guns of different sizes, extension cord, and air hose. Most likely still have room for the cordless drill. Very well constructed, the seams, strap, pockets, easily hold the weight. My wife is using it for her sewing machine because I complained I didn't have enough tools to fill it. I should have ordered more tools and started a \"Pro Contractor\" business. It is a professional grade bag.",

No wheels on this bag so it's a matter of strength but with the high quality straps, including a shoulder strap, it's not a difficult task for the average man or woman. I'm buying another one, but the smaller version, just in case! For the price, you can't find a better bag.",

I'm able to carry it with the shoulder strap. But the original strap, had diecast hooks. Needless to say, they broke. I replaced the strap with a stronger one I had from a different tool bag.
