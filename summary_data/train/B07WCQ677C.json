This trail-optimized model is welcomed because it offers confident traction, a secure and waterproof wrap, and steady underfoot experience. On the other hand, the stiffness of the platform and the restrictive upper are criticized.",

I'm a size 9 and opted for a 9 & a1/2. As many seemed to suggest a size up. So I was a little apprehensive that they may be too tight. But they are actually a very good snug fit. I will update this. If I find any faults after a few months & miles in them. Currently very happy with them.",

I do a lot of walking, all sorts of terrain, and a pair has yet to see a year without being replaced due to the sole grip wearing out. However they are comfortable for an all day hike. Not suitable for really heavy weather as they are just trainers, however will deal with most the UK throws at them.",

I\u2019m not sure why, but they\u2019ve made this shoe much narrower than previous versions - both sole and upper. Now it\u2019s unwearable for me. Materials feel cheaper too and the sole less \u2018grippy\u2019. I still like the lacing system, hence one star. But it\u2019s a very disappointing end of an era that means I\u2019m in the market for a new shoe, and Salomon have lost a loyal customer who has spend \u00a31,000s with them over the years.",
