The MuVo Slim is definitely one of the best products out there. The slim and lightweight design is perfect for carrying or putting in a pocket while exercising and the 256 MB capacity is more than ample to store enough songs for numerous workouts. If you're looking for a portable MP3 player that is smaller than any of Apple's options, this is definitely the best product on the market.",

Then it stopped connecting to the PC. The worst thing about this player is the battery retention mechanism is REDICULOUSLY DELICATE and was begining to fail almost immediately. Why do these product engineers use a TINY sliver of plastic where they should use spring steel? I expect better from Creative Labs. DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT!",

On both occasions, the battery \"puffed up\" (making it very difficult to remove from the casing). Since a replacement battery is around $35, it's not worth replacing it for us.
