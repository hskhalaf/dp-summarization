      "text": "The picture clarity is awesome. It works well with any HDMI input including Chromcast. The only reason I gave a 4 star and not 5 star is because this projector does not have audio output. It has only an audio RCA input. If you need to connect to external speakers you will have to connect the source of video to external speakers. If you use an HDMI input like chromcast, you probably need to buy HDMI video audio splitter (around 25$ on amazon) to stream only video through projector and audio to your speakers/sound bar. Hope this this helps.",

The unit provides the ability to shut off the lamp instantly and then turn it on right away (with the use of a slide panel) without having to wait for the lamp to power up or cool down. That is a really nice feature that has not been available on other projectors I have used. It has great tools also that allow you to easilly adjust your image when the projection is off-center. Overall... great projection unit",

      "text": "Our last projector was an 81P. We used it 4 hours a week for more than 12 years with maybe 1 re-lamp. Then had to replace due to greening (burning of the UV lens adhesive due to age). The 3,600 lumen vs the deteriorated 2,000 was no comparison. Even the older people in the room made first time statements that they could see all of the wording on the screen. Colors during dark and bright house lighting are nothing short of excellent. Well worth the purchase and less than 1/2 what was paid for the 81P 12 years ago when it was new. Thank you.",

There are a few things that I would like to mention that I like about this Epson. First, it has a switch that can project the screen sideways instead of having to be right in front of where you are projecting. Next. it is easy to enlarge or make smaller by another switch. Third, you can easily adjust the legs or height of the projector for use. Overall, I would say, \"User Friendly\".",
