We've had this wok for about a year and although it has taken the same punishment many times, it remains spotless. Frequently she will leave it black and I have assumed that the wok is ruined but after a 10 minute soak in hot soapy water, the deposits wipe away and it looks like new again. Highly recommended. Update: We've now had the wok for 5.5 years. It's still the same, no problems at all after using daily over that period.",

Concerning this wok, I've fallen in love with grapeseed oil (vs olive oil) because of the higher temperature rating but an eye still needs to pay attention to what's going on inside the wok.",

The bottom does and will get scratched, but not to the point that it ruins the wok, and besides it just shows that you are really using it.

But it requires a bit of pressure to get rid of all the white and rainbow stain. I would give it a 5 star if it was highly nonsticky when seasoned or heated properly. Sometimes food stick.

Well, it is a beautiful pan but again like many say the food sticks and no matter how much oil you use it still sticks. Seems to only be with meats and tofu. It\u2019s a mess to clean and I end up cooking the meat in another pan which makes this useless! I don\u2019t recommend! Waste of money!!",

It didn't get hot enough, leaving the stir fry kind of soggy and mediocre. Next I tried it on my portable single burner convection stove which heats up to approx. 580 degrees F. When I saw the avocado oil start to smoke, I added the stir fry. It turned out perfectly.",

I thought I had, but my first use of it resulted in much sticking. I decided to \"season\" it with coconut oil and have, subsequently, had no problem with the sticking issue.",

It's not too bad, easy to move with one hand but hard to tip food out of it single handedly. Easy with two hands though. All three handles stay cool, even on a gas stove.",

    "title": "Cooks Standard Stainless Steel Multi-Ply Clad Wok, 13-Inch, Silver",
    "description": "COOKS STANDARD MULTI-PLY CLAD STAINLESS-STEEL 13-INCH WOK WITH DOME LID \nBeautifully designed, the three-layer metal cookware features an interior and exterior layer of premium-grade 18/10 stainless steel with a multi-element alloy aluminum core (along the bottom and up the sides) for fast, even heating and thorough heat distribution. Even more, the brushed stainless-steel exterior resists scratches for long-lasting good looks, whether on the stovetop or hanging from a pot rack. The cookware's solid stainless-steel side handle and opposite helper handle come riveted for strength and feature air-flow technology to help them stay cooler to the touch than typical handles. In addition, its secure-fitting stainless-steel dome lid (complete with its own loop handle) traps in heat and moisture for efficient cooking and delicious results. The cookware can be used on all stovetop surfaces, including induction, and it withstands an oven's heat up to 500 degrees F. The wok cleans up easily by hand or in the dishwasher and carries a limited lifetime warranty. \n\nWHAT IS MULTI-PLY CLAD METAL CONSTRUCTION?\nMulti-Ply Clad metal construction is a combination of 18/10 stainless steel with a multi-element aluminum core that creates a permanent bond of metal, so heat passes through the whole pan body from the bottom up the side walls, not just at the bottom, for maximum cooking performance. \n\nStainless-steel construction with aluminum core for fast, even heating. DURABLE STAINLESS STEEL WITH EVEN-HEATING ALUMINUM CORE\nAs part of Cooks Standard's Multi-Ply Clad Stainless Steel cookware, the collection features three layers of clad metal for high-quality performance and excellent cooking results. The interior surface of the cookware provides a smooth, hard layer of premium-grade 18/10 stainless steel, while the stainless-steel exterior offers an elegant mirror-polished finish for enhanced visual appeal.\n\nBest of all, an inner core of multi-element alloy aluminum comes sandwiched between the interior and exterior layer of stainless steel for faster heating and excellent heat distribution. The aluminum core extends from the bottom all the way up the side walls for total coverage. It's the best of both--durable stainless steel for strength combined with the fast, thorough heating of aluminum.\n\nSTAY-COOL HANDLES WITH AIR-FLOW TECHNOLOGY\nThoughtfully designed, the cookware's solid stainless-steel handles come riveted for strength and provide an open V-shaped design with air-flow technology that keeps the handle cooler and more comfortable to hold when cooking on the stovetop. The long handles on the pans and the generous loop side handles on the pots make the vessels easy to move around on the stovetop or to safely lift and carry, even when full. Though the handles stay cooler to the touch, pot holders or oven mitts are still recommended. \n\nStainless-steel handles stay cool when cooking. OTHER HIGHLIGHTS\nThe cookware's matching stainless-steel lids fit securely, helping to trap in heat, moisture, and nutrients, plus they come with loop handles for safe, simple placement or removal. Another thoughtful detail includes the cookware's scratch-resistant stainless-steel bases, which come with a brushed finish and that can be safely used on any type of stovetop, including gas, electric, ceramic glass, even induction. Oven-safe up to 500 degrees F, the cookware offers outstanding versatility, transitioning effortlessly from cooking on the stovetop to browning or finishing in the oven (not broiler safe).\n\nABOUT COOKS STANDARD\nCooks Standard, located in California, USA, designs and manufactures high-quality cookware products for the home and kitchen. Cooks Standard presents professional and home chefs alike with the highest-quality materials, thoughtful design details, and fine craftsmanship--all of which is setting a new standard for the cookware industry.\n\nScratch-resistant brushed stainless-steel bases.
