In addition to the fact that it is excellent for shooting still photos the instrument also works superbly for shooting moving targets. The recording capability of this camera for video recording renders it way above any other model cameras which I have used in the past, and which possess both these capabilities (video & still photos). The Panasonic DMC-G5KK could be classified as the best amongst the best.",

I never realized how great a picture you can have with a Panasonic with zoom lens. The real bonus is I found this on a one day sale for almost half price. This camera gives you the option to manipulate the settings in so many ways it can be confusing if you're not a knowledgeable photographer, so it also has a automatic feature. one press of a button and it adjusts to give you a great shot in almost any light.",

Pictures come out very clear and the interface is easy to use, even as a novice photographer. It is also light weight and travels well as I have taken it hiking several times. Only this is I would make sure to buy a case for it. It doesn't come with one. It does come with a neck strap, but it isn't the most comfortable thing out there.",

Most of the features on the GX7 are in the G5( viewfinder, tilt LCD, top wheel, HDR, etc). So, I got the G5 for around $350 and figure I saved $650. I'm happy.",

Panasonic did a great job here. I am sure my G1 will not get much action any more. I moved it's superior 14-45 lens to go with the new G5, now I have a perfect camera. The 14-42 kit lens come with the G5 feels pretty cheap indeed.",

The only thing I don't care for in the G5 is that it is made of a lot more plastic than the G3. The G3 feels like it is made better than the G5.

I have shot quite a few images with this camera and it does deliver fine quality. That being said, the kit lens that it came with is still in the box. In my opinion, to obtain really nice images, buy a few primes for this camera and have fun. The Lumix 20mm, Sigma 60, Sigma 30 and the Lumix 14mm are great choices. I have all of these lenses and really enjoy each for their purpose. This camera has taken really stunning images with the Sigma 30mm and an extension tube. Macro shots that really impress.",

As one reviewer said, the zoom ring on the 14-42 lens sticks a bit, so I may invest in the Leica lens. But since you can zoom so much and crop if you like, it may not be needed.

Also I chose the Lumix G5 (and G3) because it has the traditional view finder in addition to the LCD screen. I like to see shots throug the view finder. The Sony Nex6 was considerably more to get this function and I believe this Lumix is every bit as good as that one.",

    "description": "Style:With 14-42mm LensPanasonic 16.1 MP AVCHD Full HD Compact Digital Camera with 3-Inch Touchscreen LCD.What's in the box: Panasonic Lumix G5 Digital Camera with Lumix G Vario 14-42mm Lens - Black,Lumix G Vario 14-42mm f/3.5 -5.6 Asph. / MEGA O.I.S. Lens,Li-ion Battery Pack,Battery Charger,Body Cap,USB Connection Cable,Shoulder Strap,CD-ROM and One Year Limited Warranty.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nPANASONIC LUMIX DMC-G5 COMPACT DIGITAL SINGLE LENS MIRRORLESS (DSLM) CAMERA WITH 14-42MM LENS, 16MP DIGITAL LIVE MOS SENSOR, TOUCH LCD, FULL HD VIDEO, BLACK\n\nTHE G5 TRIPLE THREAT: 16 MEGAPIXEL SENSOR - VENUS ENGINE - SPOT-ON COLORS\n16 megapixel sensor, Venus Engine and Intelligent Resolution Technology reduce noise to produce crisp, clear gradations and true-to-life color.\n\n * The 16.05-megapixel Live MOS Sensor features Panasonic's original pixel-mix technology, designed exclusively to minimize noise generation. The fine wiring results in high resolution and quick processing.\n * \n * A redesigned Venus Engine produces clear, crisp photo and video images. Its MNR (Multi-process Noise Reduction) quickly detects brightness in every part of a shot and its HDR (High Dynamic Range) allows for several pictures taken at different exposure levels to turn into a single composite picture that eliminates over-or-under-exposure. The 3DNR reduces rough edges.\n * \n * Intelligent Resolution technology detects outlines, intricate texture, and gradation thus precisely processing pixel by pixel to render true-to-life color reproduction that is spot-on.\n\n\n\nLIGHTSPEED AUTO-FOCUS HELPS YOU NEVER MISS A SHOT\nContrast AF provides higher accuracy while Light Speed AF locks on to fast moving objects.With contrast AF (Auto Focus) the image sensor controls your focus giving you a greater range to create your crisp, clear images. This is great for recording fast moving subjects like your little leaguer, migrating birds, or your best friend who decided to bungee jump. Contrast AF boasts higher accuracy, especially when shooting with a bright lens. And since you have a full-area AF touch, you select your desired field of vision. Additionally, Light Speed AF quickly locks onto a subject, making it possible to capture even fast moving subjects like your son, the dirt bike rider.\n\nLATEST MICRO FOUR THIRDS MIRRORLESS TECHNOLOGY - SMALLER CAMERA SYSTEMS DELIVER BIG RESULTS\nThe mirrorless, compact, light weight SLR system yield professional results with half the weight and size.Based on the Micro Four-Thirds system, Panasonic eliminates the bulky mirror box and pentaprism found in conventional DSLRs without compromising sensor or optical performance. Camera bodies and lenses are now dramatically smaller and lighter than traditional SLRs, making them more portable so you can take them with you virtually anywhere.\n\nHAVE THE MAGIC TOUCH? GET MORE CREATIVE WITH G5\u2019S LCD SCREEN\nShoot and play back images simply by touching the DMC-G5's rotating LCD screenThe 920K-dot high-resolution LCD rotates 180\u00b0 to the side and tilts 270\u00b0 up and down offers approx. 100% of field of view. This LCD enables dynamic, artistic framing with high-angle shots and low-angle shots. The time lag of image output is minimized by approximately 18% compared with the predecessor DMC-G3 making it easier to monitor the fast-moving subject.\n\n Plus, high-precision touch display immediately lets you to set focus to the subject by just touching it on the screen and you can even release the shutter.\n\n The Level Gauge lets the camera detect the horizontal / vertical angle of view with its internal level working with the acceleration sensor. Photos shot in a portrait aspect will be automatically displayed vertically whatever lens is used.\n\nSHOW OFF YOUR CREATIVE SIDE\nIntelligent Auto and Creative Control filters allow styles like Star Filter to be applied to your photos within the camera.The Creative Control mode has been upgraded in the G5 with 14 creative filters that let you tell your photographic story. Choose from Soft Focus to Dynamic Monochrome to One Point Color or from the original filters like Expressive and Retro. With the new GUI and menu tabs, switching filter effect is extremely easy and is possible to preview via the Live View Switching. If you can't decide, your G5 will recommend the one that bet fits your scene in iA (Intelligent Auto) or iA Plus mode. While you're in iA Plus, adjust your defocusing area in the background, exposure, and white balance.\n\nNEW TO ADVANCED CAMERAS?
