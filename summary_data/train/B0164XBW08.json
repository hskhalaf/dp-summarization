      "text": "We purchased these when remodeling our home and upgrading all fixtures to LED. These were purchased with our ceiling fans in mind. Our ceiling fan is a model which has a totally enclosed \"globe\", not the individual arms with single bulbs. The globe required 3 candelabra base bulbs and these fit the bill for a relatively low cost. They give off light in more directions than traditional \"directional\" LEDs which works well to prevent \"spotting\" on the globe surface, my only complaint is that they are not quite bright enough through the globe itself which is a semi-opaque white.",

I'm very happy with it and I'm surprised how bright the light is compared to how small the bulb is. Perhaps the only downsides are that the \"soft white\" isn't really as soft as it is BRIGHT (did I mention how bright it is?), and the candle fire shape sticks a bit over the top of the lampshade, thus somewhat negating the shade's ability to filter the very bright light. Otherwise, I'm happy for this purchase I made as a... forgive the pun... shot in the dark.",
