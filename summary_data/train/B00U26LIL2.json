      "text": "Very nice one, I prefer the looking of the front, compared to the other models of Ghosts, it's really bigger as well. Unfortunately so big that the the head of the elite, (supposed to see) is barely over the top of the fuselage when sitting, which doesn't seem's very natural. I managed to have a better positioning, by tweaking with the little stirrup for his feets, he's not \"sitting\" anymore, but this looks really better from the front ! The back of the ghost is also a bit \"botched\" compared to the impressive front ! Anyways, as a collectionner, I really like the over-whole looking, it is really nice and imposing !",

Very nice detail in the figure. However when you get to the ghost the plasma guns aren't in the translucent blue like they were on the last ghost. It's bigger that the last one. I think the ghost is fine but the real reason I got this was for the minifigure.",
