The winch is very quiet. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. My only complaint is that I wish the wires that come with it we're about 2 ft longer each which is the only reason I gave it four stars. Otherwise, five stars all day",

I got a dash rocker switch to replace the handlebar switch. This is every bit as good as a winch costing several times more.",

Once installed I did a few small pulls and everything worked fine. The only complaintA at this point is that the quality of the remotes is lacking and confusing installation directions. Wiring was a challenge. Not the clearest instructions . Plus the instructions had several missed spelled words, which I thought was a bit comical lol. Going on a 40 mile ride tomorrow, should find some mud...more to follow.",
