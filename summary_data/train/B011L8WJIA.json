The weight and balance of the razor is perfect. The design is elegant, refined and perfect in form and function. In comparison to the Godfather Safety Razor, this is easier / safer to load, and offers an equivalent shave. The shorter handle makes the razor more travel friendly, sacrificing only a little on the precision and control offered by the Godfather model.",

I usually rely on the reviews, but this one is an exception. Don't be fooled by the high praise of this product, as I believe most of the feedback are shill reviews",

I was delighted to find there was 5 blades included with the product and grateful that they were \"mild\" blades. I have been developing my skill with the single blade and just now (8 shaves done) feeling confidant. Takes some practice but for sure worth it. Less irritation and even with a \"mild\" blade its a better shave. I would suggest this product to anyone, matter of fact I told 2 of my friends after only 3 shaves how amazing it was. Highly recommend!",

Even with the mild blades, I got a fine shave and didn't experience much tugging, plus you can equip different blades easily.

In what I have saved in disposable cartridges, this razor has already paid for itself. My legs are smooth and I feel better about using less plastic and creating less trash for the landfills.",

I like the blade angle and smoothness/closeness of shave with this, but this is a personal preference. Feels good in my hand. It had no trouble with 2 weeks' growth (about 1/2\") the very first time I used it.",
