The wood feels way too lightweight, they have a plastic like quality, almost like MDF. The \"wood\" is rough (especially around the cut-outs) and the joints are not lined up, nor do they look like they would hold up over time. Do not buy! EDIT: I received another pack of hangers out of the blue, I can only assume they want me to re-review the product. After inspection... still awful.",

It did not line up evenly, so I have serious doubts about how long it would last without breaking. This supplier really needs to work on quality control.
