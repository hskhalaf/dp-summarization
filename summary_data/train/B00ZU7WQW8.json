      "text": "Originally got this game when it was free on PSN a few years ago. Enjoyed it more than I thought I would so decided to buy it on disc so that I could add to my physical collection. It doesn't deviate too much from PlatinumGames usual formula, although the combat isn't as deep as some of their other games i.e. Bayonetta. The campaign is fairly short but that kind of works in its favour seeing as though it is fairly repetitive. Fun game all the same though.",

Only downsides were the longevity of the campaign and the lack of coop play, which could have been cool. Also would have been great to play as the decepticons at least once. Despite these minor grumbles I had a lot of fun with it. Will keep it only to play on harder difficulty and to complete the challenges which are pretty tough when you first start.",

Some of the controls are clunky, gameplay is nothing special, plot is dull and the graphics are limited (but in line with the 80s cartoon). That said, it's simple, easy to just pick up and do a mission or 2. Plus every level, there's another character from the series. I won't spoil the surprises, but there's no shortage of Transformers. All in, I'd say, don't pay a lot for this and just enjoy it. If you remember the TV series, you'll love this, if you just want to blow stuff up, but Mass Effect or something.",
