My current setup is as close as I can get to the screen and I'm using a high quality reflective 100\" screen mounted on the wall. The picture quality is fantastic, I wasn't expecting a flatscreen OLED display, but dam this thing does really well. Saturation is great, contrast is great, gamma adjustments and other color fine tuning are available. Latency while gaming is amazing, if you've never played games on a 100\" screen then prepared to be amazed, especially racing titles!

I've compared it side by side with my existing 2150ST, and I've decided to keep the 2150ST, mostly because of some contrast variations, and I think the picture looks better based on some custom settings. HOWEVER.... the 671 is clearly brighter and produces an excellent image. I don't think you can go wrong with either of the BenQ short throw projectors. the 671 is significantly smaller, and definitely something you can take with you as a true gaming projector.",
