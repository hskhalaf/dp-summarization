      "text": "Arrived with 1 bad caster that leaked the ball bearings all over the place because it wasnt pressed properly. Called Vestil directly and got a replacement mailed out. cool - except the replacement was a different style, looks like they must have worked out the problem with a different manufacturing process. New caster was 3/4\" shorter than the others so i had to level it with stacked washers. Now the front caster bearing is failing. China at its finest",

      "text": "The Vestil ECSPT-2448 Steel Platform Truck with 6\" x 2\" Rubber Caster & 2000 lbs Capacity arrived with a good fit and finish. Assembly was straight forward and the removable cotter pin on the handle was a nice touch allowing for easy install and removal of the handle when required. Like so many others stated the packaging was almost non-existent when it arrived. How all the parts got here is beyond me but they did and remarkably with no damage. Had it suffered damage like another reviewer said \"It's a Platform Truck it's going to look like that after a few days of use anyway\".",

Yes the handlebar slips out but I\u2019ve seen that on the $500+ Rubbermaid carts too. But my god, the chemical smell coming off this thing, what the heck! Scary. Unnecessary. Unclear what or why. Kept it out on the porch to air it out but the smell remains. Nothing leaking or anything... just beware. I\u2019m honestly scared of what this thing is made of or where it\u2019s been for it to smell like this.",
