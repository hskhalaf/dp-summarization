I did not realize I would use this as much as I do, and enjoy it so well. It is accurate across the range I can test. (Ice water 32, boiling water 211 - about right for my elevation). Shooting the inside of the oven matches my other oven thermometer. I like it!",

      "text": "I got this, just for fun, on Prime Day. It's an amazing Nerd toy. I've been using it to check the temperature of my grill grate and my cast iron skillet. There's been a heat wave here, so I also use it to check the temp of table tops on the patio and stuff like that. It's extremely intuitive - literally point and shoot. I'm not sure I can say what useful purpose it provides, but it's a great tool... for something.... probably.",
