Their low price caused me to buy them as we approached Christmas because I'm always looking for that thing that other people don't have. I am happy to be the only one in our neighborhood with these because they have created a lot of attention. We had three people come to our door asking \"Where did you get these? They are so realistic looking!\" And they are! They are very cool, but they don't give good light for identifying anyone at the front door. They are strictly for mood and effect. I have put them away until Halloween. These are fun.",

In years to come when they make these smaller I will be a huge. For now they are cool,but when turned off they are kind of an eye sore. Of all the ones out there currently, this has to be top 5",
