This spray made my hair feel silky and on top of that, the smell reminds me of the scent of caramel. I now order this every month. My hair requires quite a bit of product, but it works amazing.

But if I just let it air dry it not only takes hours but then it looks very boring and lackluster. Normally when I blow dry my hair many frizzies around my roots. It\u2019s not cute. This is the best before heat, anti frizz with humidity control product I\u2019ve had outside the salon. And way less than the pricey salon stuff they use there. Love love love this product.",

I did notice a huge difference in the poofiness in my hair. My hair was much smoother and shiny after a few squirts. It even seemed to last into the next day. No residue or stickiness, and it made my hair very soft. The smell is good too, but not like the Kenra silkening mist which is my favorite. I highly recommend using the two products together. Will buy again.",

It does make a difference in drying time i did notice, if you spray a little to much in I do like that your hair doesn\u2019t look greasy like some products. Unfortunately it does not detangle hair and it does not keep it from getting frizzy, and I didn\u2019t notice a difference in smoothness.",

When my hair is still wet, I apply Kenra - I can use as much as I want without it ending up with a greasy texture or appearing greasy. I wish the Kenra line was more affordable. Ordering from Amazon, however, is still cheaper than going through my local salon for this product.",
