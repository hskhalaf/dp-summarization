Gave them the benefit of the doubt and requested an exchange. 2nd combo square also failed albeit by a smaller margin, still unacceptable. I'll pay the same money and get a single head Starrett and buy the other heads over time. A square isn't worth a darn if it ain't square.",

The 4\" square has some spots where their grinders missed due to poor casting quality but overall it functions. Reads square with my other starrett square (6\"). This item was better than the 4\" square but its still no starrett. Even so I still reach for it regularly as its heads and shoulders better than the other knocks I've used and is better than the Irwin combination square. Just be aware that the quality of the item you receive, as is evident by some of these other reviews, may be dramatically different.",

At first I couldn't figure out how to do it--it doesn't come with a manual, nor can one go to their website to download instructions, nor is their reference to a youtube video; what's more they include a a sticker espousing their commitment to quality with their customer service email address for one to contact them, which I did even attaching a photo of my problem and as of today, going on a month now, I haven't heard so much as a peep from them. Very poor--I recommend a name brand you can trust!",
