This is just not acceptable for a shoe that cost this much. Very disappointing. Astral products have always been great for me in the past. All my other Astral products are excellent. First time with their shoes, not good.",

Perfect for mossy rocks in Creek crossings like Yosemite or Yellow Stone National Park. Highly recommend pairing with short thin waterproof socks just because im a sock wearing believer. Love the information printed on inside of box..I ordered the grey and really like the modern look of theses Astral Rasslers 2.0. My dislike is the shoe laces thickness I would have preferred a flat shoe laces instead of the round. However overall perfect for my nerdy needs.",

These have a nice wide toe box, but the forefoot is actually quite narrow. They're very tight width wise on the ball of my foot. I'm giving them to my friend because he wears the same size. Grip was great, quality seems excellent. I like the nylon liner. They just don't fit my feet.",

River rocks are always slippery but these grippy souls will definitely save you some pain and anguish (any maybe some embarrassment too). I'll be buying another pair soon in my regular size to use for kayaking. My only complaint is that the laces are about to break, but it's partly to blame on the harsh metal clips that keep my Frog Togg waders from sliding up my legs.",

That\u2019s always the problem, isn\u2019t it? Small companies make products that fit their CEO and no one else :/ Since it\u2019s a water shoe, there\u2019s not a lot of cushioning. You\u2019re going to be happiest if you wear a neoprene or thick wool sock (or both), and probably an insole if you intend to hike very far. That means adventure boaters and canyoneers will need to invest more energy in fitting than strict whitewater kayakers.",
