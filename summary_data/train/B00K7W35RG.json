      "text": "These boots are a big disappointment. I was really hoping for a nice pair of winter work boots. The first issue is the sole is quite hard, it gets even harder in the cold. This makes them very uncomfortable and slippery as there is no give. The other problem I have with them is that they are not warm at all. It says 400 grams which is what the last pair of boots I had was, my feet are freezing. I am not a fan of these and feel like I wanted a lot of money on boots that definitely do not do what I was hoping they would.",

The foot bed in these, are hard like cheap boots. Only padding is what you add. The original inner soles aren't the greatest. No loop at the back to make putting them on easier. The shoe lace grabber and D-day rings that are on other Carharrt boots (and many cheaper brands) are not present on this version. Initial impression and after a few days of wearing them, I can find nothing to really justify Rhett highest price, other than a brand label.",

Nice features too - insulated, waterproof, soles have good grip and overall, they look pretty good. As for a sizing reference, I wear 10.5D in sneakers (Nike, UA, NB, Asics - sneakers typically run small) and a 10D when boots fit as expected. ... and these do. A perfect secure fit while still having some wiggle room thanks to a larger toe box. All in all, a solid boot that is very comfortable. Thumbs up!",

But after that it got bad again so I switch back to my old boots for 2 days then switch back and they were good to go again.

Although these were decent, I feel that they should last longer and they have a few significant short comings. First thing I noticed was the steel toe would smash the sides of my feet. Then after a little bit of wear, the waterproofing went out the window. Laces tore in like 3 months (not that big of a deal) and they just all around seem lower quality than they should be for $150. They get the job done, and I\u2019m not mad I bought them, but I\u2019m not buying them again.",
