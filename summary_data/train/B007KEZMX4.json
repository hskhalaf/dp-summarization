I recently purchased a second Roku for our home, a Roku 3, after reading about how fast and smooth the operating system and apps all work, but I have yet to notice a perceptible difference in speed using one over the other. If you are looking to save a few dollars on a Roku, buying this model will provide a nearly identical experience to a newer one.",

The first two nights using the PC, the picture quality was poor, the size format was wrong, and during the movie Windows kept popping up and sometimes the screen went black. And then there's all the noise from the PC's fans and CPU. The next two nights, I moved the Roku from our bedroom to the living room, and the difference was amazing. The movies looked almost as good as satellite TV, the whole screen was filled, no interruptions from the system, totally quiet and smooth. We will definitely be getting another Roku for the living room.",

This one came after we left and we never actually got it but ended up giving it to someone there. I'm sure the Roku player itself is fine.

But this is definitely the way to go if you have an old TV that has composite inputs and you want to use it for streaming channels/services. Why send a good TV to the landfill if you can retrofit it with one of these?",

Saving over $1200 a year is nothing to scoff at. We now have only the internet and subscriptions. It is an adjustment at first getting rid of cable but we ALWAYS find something to watch. Roku essentially turns your TV into a smart TV. I like how you can use the Roku player to search by actor, TV show, or movie to find all available ways to watch. There are lots of ways to watch free shows on free Roku channels with some research and patience.",

Easy to setup, even for grandparents and tech-novice parents. Great gift for the individual who only wants to stream movies, and does not require any physical storage space on the unit.

They must be rebooted frequently and movies tend to lag or take forever to load. This is a good product that the manufacturer has gotten sloppy with.

I havent had any issues with the product overheating or glitching. Streams Pandora and Netflix perfectly no issues. I do wish the device came with some kind of hook on the back to be able to hook up on the wall or some 2 sided tape to stick on the back TV but it's fine as it is sitting on the table next to the TV. The device also doesn't come with an HDMI cable so you have to buy one separately.",

Purchased this as a gold box deal and truly, it is a great value. I don't have the fastest network (old \"G\" wireless router), but the Roku has streamed flawlessly. Highly recommend and I really like this little box.",

This device allows me to watch Netflix without burning out my laptop (which is how I was watching before) and view my Amazon Prime shows and best of all, rewatch any missed Downton Abbey episodes on the PBS channel. And there seem to be more streaming channels everyday! The only reason I don't give the Roku 5 stars in because of occasional freeze-ups, but those seem to have mostly stopped since the latest software update. I also wish their system of entering txt to search was less cumbersoome, but that is a minor complaint.",

      "text": "I thought it was one of those too good to be true products, I am glad I was wrong. I am going to buy one for each TV so they all sync. If you ever say nothing on TV to watch you are not looking hard enough. The product is easy to use and program. Most of the stations are free, some you pay a subscripton fee if you want it. There is enough free programing to watch so you don't have to pay for a channel. If you have good streaming to your computer you will not have a problem using your computer and the boxes at the same time. Well worth the money.",
