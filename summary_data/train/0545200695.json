      "text": "I am a CASA and bought this for an 8 year old boy I am mentoring. Overall, it's a good book. I like the format, different mix/type of problems, and large fonts. However, there are a couple of things that could be improved on: 1) Some assignments should be explained and given examples of how to do them. For example, when you ask students to \"Round 7 to the nearest ten,\" there should be an explanation of what that means and how to do that. 2) Instructions for certain activities are just too long and wordy when they can be shorten and simplified.",

The variety of activities and puzzles put some \u2018fun\u2019 into math drill. (Authors were definitely creative!) The number of problems is not too many per page. This keeps it from discouraging the student. This series is terrific for summer review - to keep kids remembering g what they learned during the school year. (Buy the grade level they just finished.) I am a retired teacher, and I buy these for my grandchildren and they like them!",
