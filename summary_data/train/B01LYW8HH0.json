I was paying a lot for it from sellers like this, who jacked the price up because of demand. Please be aware that the new Kerastase Discipline line is very similar and really good. I switched from this to that, and it\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to pay 3-4x the price to get something that\u2019s hard to find now.",
