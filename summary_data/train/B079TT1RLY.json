Give it the love it deserves and you\u2019ll have that beautiful picture quality to be thankful for. I use mine for streaming shows, movies, and playing video games.",

The only downside is that it doesn't get as bright as some of the other backlit LCD TVs. That can make viewing a little difficult if your room is very bright. I was worried about the often mentioned issue of screen burn-in. After a year and a half of ownership, I have noticed absolutely no burn-in issues whatsoever. I'm guessing that it could still happen if someone watches static pictures and television icons for excessively long periods of time.",

Dolby Vision and Atmos quality is quality like I have ever seen. This TV will just get better with content upgrade to 4K HDR/Dolby Vision streaming. The only thing I wish was better was more apps to download to the TV with more streaming services. Really hate that HBO GO App is NOT on this TV. Overall, this TV still gets 5 stars, because the picture is so life changing. Entertainment to the max!",
