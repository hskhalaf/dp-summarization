I bought these in December and they didn't fit my vehicle and I just installed them into another car this past week. These are by far the best speakers I've ever purchased for a car. The highs, lows and bass are awesome. I can only assume that the one star reviews are from people who don't have a stereo that can push the power needed. If you have a decent aftermarket stereo, buy these you won't be disappointed.",
