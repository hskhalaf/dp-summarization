No, it's not a simple, automatic thing. It takes some knowledge of how to best process these backlit images. But with a little bit of patience and experimenting, the results can be pretty amazing.",

I have an iPhone which has a decent camera. The camera was able to pick up the photo content, but it was absolutely impossible to edit from negative to positive. The app had the feature to edit saturation, vignette, add frames and add stickers, but they did not think to include the option of converting a negative film to an actual positive one.",

See the two attached images (darker = with the sun glasses) They sell neutral density filters on Amazon and Ebay (\"neutral\" means neutral color), but they're generally expensive. I did find a set for $18. So I'll try it with those. So this is a great idea, except that it doesn't work because the light source is too bright.",
