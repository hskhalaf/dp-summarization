      "text": "Wonderful! We needed a base for a 9ft freestanding umbrella where we occasionally get fairly high winds. Even though the base is plastic, it is attractive and well designed. More importantly, the shaft for the umbrella is metal and sturdy. The inserts to allow adjustment to keep the umbrella standing straight are adequate and well thought out. We had two stands previously which failed to keep the umbrella straight due to insufficient weight and quality. Even though this is a recently received product, we are confident that it should be the last umbrella base we will need.",

Do not see how the umbrella is going to tip over. Overall workmanship is better than other umbrella base which were rated 4.5 or higher. This one is of different class and the manufacturer has made attention to detail and whatever they have put together is well thought out. Highly recommend this product after weeks of futility with other mediocre umbrella bases.",
