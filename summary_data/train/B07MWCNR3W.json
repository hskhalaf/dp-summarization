My one slight issue is that the right bud dies slightly faster than the left which is bizarre but is apparently a common problem with these. I can still get through a whole workday without having to charge them and the case holds a charge for the buds as well.",

The charger case is slow to charge the earbuds The charger case has to be charged every 24hrs(maybe less) but it's dead on me all the time. If the ipods didnt have a glitch where they go max volume when it switches songs I would have stuck with them... I'll be looking for other ones",

It has the regular wear and tear scratch on the pouch so u can see it has been used the charger seem to be new. The charger works because it charges my phone. I don't kmow about the sound cancelation, battery life or sound quality bcuz It did come on for me to test it. I'm jus so disappointed in this product.",
