Unfortunately, after 1.5 weeks of washing with this twice a day (always followed with moisturizer), my face broke out worse than it has been in probably 6 years. I stopped using it immediately and even after two weeks the break out is still healing. Also it dried my skin badly, no matter how much lotion I used. Glad it worked for some of you! But it didn't work for me!",

It took a while but I found SAPO Organic Bamboo Charcoal Soap. By far the better charcoal soaps. I use it in the shower instead of shower gel. Great lather and the bar doesn't melt to nothing!

      "text": "I originally purchased this for my boyfriends cystic acne that he gets and its really improved his skin! I tried it on my dry skin and some spots where I had eczema and it's worked wonderfully. The bars don't last very long with everyday use if you leave it in the shower, so I would recommend placing it in a container when not using it.",

Not only did this work on her arms, she uses it on her face too. I am amazed at how much of a difference this has made! I have purchased this multiple times. Each time the soap is the same. Smells great and works great!",

I have also noticed almost immediately after I started washing with it that my pores have shrunk and my (adult) acne is now completely non-existant. I use this soap with a gentle brush with just enough pressure. I buy this soap in a 4-pack.",

I keep the soap in a covered dish, but it still melts too much when in use and not in use if even a bit of water gets on it. I'd say that because of this, this price is not worth it. But it is decent, though.",
