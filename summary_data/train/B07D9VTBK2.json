It doesn\u2019t weigh down my skin, and I it moisturizes beautifully. I\u2019m glad I found this! I also got the Castor Oil and have rave reviews about that for my feet and hair! BTW, no one paid me to say anything. Lol",

Because this grapeseed oil has no scent this a great carrier oil for whatever perfume you use... after you shower squirt some oil in your hand then spray your scent into the oil and apply to your skin. No more need to spend money on scented lotions or bath oil. If you rub a bit the left over amount in your hair it will help with fly-a-ways and your hair will smell heavenly all day. PS. If you have oily skin and have had breakouts when you use coconut oil, try this oil instead. Grapeseed oil much less likely to cause breakouts than coconut oil.",
