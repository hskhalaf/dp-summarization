This item pairs up with the actual BoxLock Box, where packages are securely placed via using the BoxLock to scan the incoming package and unlocking the lock to allow the courier to place the package into your box. Then once the courier locks your BoxLock, it\u2019ll send you a push notification stating package securely received. Now of course you\u2019ll have to download and install the BoxLock app and register your account. Then pair the app to your BoxLock via Bluetooth/WiFi. This is how you\u2019ll will receive package secured delivery notifications.",
