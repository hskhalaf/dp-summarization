Today I added a small LED strip behind the platter just for fun. I am loving the sound of my old LPs again. I am 67 years old and have been collecting LPs since The Beatles first hit the american shores. The Ortofon cartridge brings out sound I didn't even know were there.",

      "text": "This is one great turntable. The design is geared towards the vinyl enthusiast. The belt driven platter is designed to eliminate any motor noise whatsoever. It's a thin loop that rides the outside of the platter, duvet by a small DC motor. (older belt driven turntables have a belt that rides the motor spindle to a hub on the bottom of the platter, therefore transferring motor noise to the platter) The platter itself is a heavy acrylic that is solid as a rock. The tonearm is featherweight, tracks at 1 gram very nicely. I'm very happy with this turntable. It has made listening to my vinyl enjoyable again.",

The sound reproduction is great, the minimalism is wonderful, the price point is outstanding, I hate the belt on the outside. I have found that most of the time despite my best intentions, when turning a record over or picking up a record, I pull the belt (rubber band) off the platter. It isn't the end of the world but very annoying that I have to put the belt on over and over again. Can't the engineers make a little channel on the platter where the belt can reside? It would still look the same but the belt would stay in place.",

Other than that - I'm not sure you could find it's equal for the price or even a few hundred more!... I'm sold on the U-turn Audio brand so far! Sound and construction are superb!

The set up is a breeze but the only negative thing I have to say is the cue lever isn't included that's one thing I feel that should be included but overall this turntable is an outstanding piece thumbs up I highly recommend for all that are looking for a quality set up",

In the process they sent me on the search for this turn table instead of a Project turn table. Buy this baby but make sure you understand this is an audiophile turn table yes belt is exposed no auto shut off not there.

I immediately swapped the cartridge for an ortofon blue that I already had, but the stock cart sounded ok, if a little lifeless.

Personally I'd pick this over the Carbon Pro-Ject due to the fact that it's an all American company (design and production) and absolutely outstanding customer service.",

We did have to get an adapter for it to work with our stereo system. I'm loving this purchase as much as he is!",

It's beautiful and minimalist. With it, I feel as if I now have what Darth Sidious referred to as \"unlimited power!\" Worth the investment. Make sure, however, that if it's being plugged into a receiver that you have a PHONO input (you may forget that requirement due to excitement) or a converter that does just that. Then listen to some Supertramp.",

I didn't know if it was the preamp or turntable so had a repair shop in Chicago troubleshoot it and said it was a bad cartridge. They also recommended the Pro-Ject DCA Carbon. I'm sure not every orbit arrives defective but to me it was worth the extra $100 to buy from a local dealer and the Pro-Ject is an amazing product. Couldn't be happier with it. I wanted to like the Orbit as they're made in America but there's better stuff out there.",
