T-Mobile offers a one year warranty, but you have to send the phone back, wait for a replacement, and go without a phone for the interim period. The charger broke after only 6 weeks, and after 6 months you had to insert a piece of paper between to help the battery maintain contact. Combined with T-Mobile's terrible service, which seems to work very selectively even in metropolitan areas, this phone was almost useless and a huge waste of money. I won't try Nokia or T-Mobile again.",

I charged it (it was about 50% charged already) and reset it and it didn't seem to fix anything. The screen still flickers, and worse, sometimes it doesn't even turn on. Removing the battery doesn't make it work so I just have to let it sit and try turning it on every few minutes until it does. I do like the phone itself (when it works) so that's the only reason I gave it 2 stars. But I guess this is what happens when you order a used phone.",
