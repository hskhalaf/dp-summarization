When I made bread in my original tin that I have had for years, it required a massive amount of non-stick spray to get the loaf to come out so I wanted to try this brand. I was hesitant to put a very sticky batter in a pan with no spray but figured the worse thing, I would have to make a new loaf. When the bread was cooled, I flipped the pan over a plate and the loaf slid right out! There was minimal to no residue on the pan after I dumped it out and made for super easy clean up.",

Only bad thing I have to say would be that it does tend to bow when in the oven longer than like 15 minutes at 450 degrees; I just remember reading that it wasn't supposed to do this up to that temp so wanted to point that out. My favorite thing about this pan though is the fact that it makes left overs from restaurants taste straight off the line all over again! Even foods that tend to get soggy like quesadillas and fries come out fresh again. Love it!",
