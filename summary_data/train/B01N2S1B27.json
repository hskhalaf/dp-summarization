      "text": "I love them. My giant size 11 feet fit comfortably in these with socks. It takes a couple of wears to break them in (and the first wear was pretty uncomfortable for me) but they get comfier and comfier as you go until you're comfortably strutting around all day. They're hella sexy and hella tall and they make a loud 'look at me' clip clop sound when you're walking. I've worn them with tights and skirts of all lengths and they make my legs look GREAT. Can't say enough good things about these boots. I want to get them in flannel and blue velvet when they're back in stock!",

      "text": "So, I searched high and low for these boots, because I fell in love with them online. They were very hard to find, so I was thrilled to see them on Amazon, and for a fairly reasonable price. With that said, I ordered my regular size (6.5) and I literally could not get my foot in. Really strange. My foot is average, not narrow, not wide. It was so small that I sized up to a 7.5 and those fit fine. So, that was my only drawback..... Of course, Amazon makes for an easy exchange, so all is good.",
