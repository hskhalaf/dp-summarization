The right earpiece stopped working. I assume it was just a defective product. I have LSTN's Zebrawood Troubadors and they're still working very nicely, so I chalked it up to bad luck in my case and didn't bother raising a fuss. I'll be giving these another shot in the future, when I grow tired of my bluetooth headset.",

      "text": "I have these headphones in cherry with the nylon chord. The sound quality is great. Detailed high frequencies and nice bass. However, I noticed an extreme amount of noise while wearing the earbuds anytime the cable is handled, rubbed on my clothes. If I tap the cable with my fingers I can hear a thump thump noise. It's extremely annoying and a deal breaker for me. I don't recommend these at all unless you are paralyzed from the neck down since you won't have the ability to move and thus create the noise.",

I love the design, the sound quality, and they seemed like a really durable piece of equipment. I've had mine for a little less than a year now but the left earphone stopped working. I noticed I get some scratchy feedback now if I move the cord a bit, but it looks like they are done for good. I think if LSTN makes some quality adjustments they would have a fine piece on their hands. But this one didn't make it on the long term.",

The entire flight was spent messing with these trying to get them into my ear in such a way that fully created a seal, but didn't muffle the music. I tried every size bud, but couldn't get them to work without jamming my finger into it. The sound quality when not muffled was fine. I'm just glad United Airlines gave out Apple-esque ear buds that did me just fine.",
