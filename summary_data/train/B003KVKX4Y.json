Put on two layers of sealer and it has been fine out in the elements for the past month we have had it. Would recommend it for toddler use (under 6 y.o) and for not any more than 4 kids can use it. IMO, this one looks so much better and fits in naturally, with our back patio than the plastic picnic tables on the market.",
