With this done, you can glance to your side while applying and easily see how much you applied/is remaining.",

The handle when mounted is virtually vertical, 90 degrees, in mid throw, The range of motion is from about 60 to 120 degrees. It is unreachable. The only other mounting option is 180 degrees, handle pointing virtually straight down. The instruction manual is very poorly illustrated. I do not know if I am missing a part (Ido not believe so). The mounting is the same left or right.",

It's a great idea, but the wand comes off too easily if you accidentally bump the wand, e.g. while setting the pack down. That said, I like the way the unit sprays, which is fully adjustable, and it is comfortable to wear. 4 gallons is a good size. If you're covering a large area, 2 gallons goes really fast; but more than 4 would be very heavy to carry around.",

The straps/wand/tank all work very/very well and are comparable to a solo, but the pump is very lacking and without the pump working then the sprayer doesn't work and is to me worthless.

I was able to adjust myself so that it fit my fingers uniformly.Good value for the money spent.",
