Standard, dry dimensional lumber was a piece of cake. They come packaged in a roll-up case that can be fastened with a velcro strap. I saw one review mention something about the run-out on these bits. I wouldn't worry about that. Spade bits, by their nature, are for rough boring. If need better accuracy or a cleaner hole try an auger bit with a screw feed tip.",

I thought a Black & Decker product would be much better. I am outside the return window for Amazon so will try to work with the supplier. So if you buy, I recommend you put each in a drill immediately to check if they run acceptably true.",
