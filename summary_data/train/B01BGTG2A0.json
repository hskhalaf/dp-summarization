I do not recommend getting replacements from Amazon. If you'll start the RMA process through SanDisk they will replace it for the price of shipping it to them (I recommend putting it in a regular envelope with a little padding). A few weeks later and SanDisk replaced each of mine with a larger better performing flash drive.",

Is it unsafe, nope. I transferred 4GB of documents etc and pulled it right out of the slot and it didn't burn me... it was pretty warm. The capacity, speed and form factor are not going to allow for fast heat disipation.... it's a trade off. But the small size makes it super-convenient to carry on a key ring, as I do.",

While the speeds were pretty good (91.6MBps & 9.45MBps read & write, respectively), this little thing got hot so fast that it froze my laptop after transferring about 10GB of data from the laptop to it. I had to remove the flash drive, reset the laptop and wait for roughly 5 minutes for the flash drive to cool down before it started to work again. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, when the flash drive got warm, it slowed down remarkably. Next time I will try the Samsung fit drives to see if they're better.",

      "text": "This is the third 128gb flash drive that I have purchased. I know that some of the memory is used for various reasons but 14gb. I usually purchase SanDisk because I trust that they make quality products. This is the first flash drive using that much memory. I can understand 5gb but not 14gb. This is the first time that I have purchased an Ultra Fit, also. I had a difficult time getting the plastic cover off of it. Then I had a problem getting it out of the usb port. It amazes me at how small physically these have gotten while increasing the memory capacity.",
