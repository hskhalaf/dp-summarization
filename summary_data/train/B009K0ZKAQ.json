Currently there is one betta fish in it, and it's a good size for him. I reduced the flow from the pump using a piece of foam in the intake tub, which keeps the poor betta from being blown around the tank. We clean it as instructed, and have artificial plants inside. We may go with a live plant at some point, but for now it's pretty clean as long as we follow the instructions. Definitely, in my opinion, the best lower-priced home aquarium on the market.",

Liking the two level LED lighting. Size is perfect for an office room. Interesting.. my betta like to lean against the intake flow to rest and sleep at night - seems to enjoy it but I'm keeping an eye on that for now. Took longer than expected for shipping.",

I cant see this costing them more then a couple dollars more to do. The fit and finish of these is great and cleaning them is easy. For $50 these cant be beat.",

    "title": "Fluval Spec III Aquarium Kit, 2.6-Gallon",
    "description": "Color:Black| Product Packaging:Standard Packaging\n\nFluval SPEC is a contemporary looking aquarium designed for small areas such as desktops and countertops. This 2.6-gallon etched glass aquarium with aluminum trim combines style and functionality in one small package. Though small in stature, Fluval SPEC is big on features. It comes with a sleekly designed overhanging LED lighting system, consisting of 31 powerful LED lamps, that arches above the aquarium to provide brilliant illumination for plants and d\u00e9cor. The aquarium includes a powerful circulation pump with adjustable output nozzle and a large 3-stage filtration system that provides more than enough filtration for ultra clean and clear water. It also comes with all the necessary filter media for effective and thorough mechanical, chemical and biological filtration: a porous foam block with convenient handle traps large particles and debris, activated carbon adsorbs unwanted odors, discolorations and impurities and BioMax insert provides optimal colonization of beneficial bacteria and enhances the nitrification of fish wastes. The pump and filtration system are conveniently located in a separate chamber at one end of the aquarium to simplify maintenance. To ensure the well-being of aquarium inhabitants, it is essential to maintain your aquarium. At the very minimum, remove 20% of the water once a week and replace with tap water that is of similar temperature to your tank and treated with the correct dose of Nutrafin Aqua Plus. Regular replacement of Fluval filter media is essential to ensure optimum performance. The filter media should be changed alternately in order to maintain continuous biological activity. To enhance bacterial action, pour a dose of Nutrafin Cycle onto your filter inserts each time you change the media.",
