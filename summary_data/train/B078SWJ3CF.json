I bought the 1 TB Hard Drive and I can't transfer 5 GB without it hanging at 2-3 GB's and just freezes completely (see attached for error). Can't open up Lightroom cause the Portfolio freezes before it fully opens. Every hard drive I have on my computer works, except for this one. 5 years of travel photos loss.

I didn't mind paying a premium, because protecting my data and files was far more important. This is the first time I've had a serious problem and it's an insidious one. After a couple of months of ownership, I am having a problem with it corrupting a file when I save it, with no message or error notice. Come back a few hours later and the file is either missing data or is altogether unreadable and all my work is lost.",

It's unintuitive user interface, because the \"format\" picker is listed FIRST, but it's not obvious that the \"scheme\" picker below it affects what appears in the \"format picker\".

With raw photos increasing in size and 4k videos becoming the standard (8k is overkill - just ask your eye doctor) a couple of these SSDs should be all any hobbyist videographer/photographer should need for a while. (One for back up - not because it will fail, but because it's so small you may lose it)",
