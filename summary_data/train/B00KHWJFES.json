This weight is manageable and can even be used without using extra tie downs. It doesn't blow off. I do wish it was just a little bit larger. My golf cart is lifted and could have used just a little more cover to get the tires covered completely. Still, it's a much better cover than others I've purchased in the past. I would definitely purchase another one when needed.",

I really can't tell the front from the back. I thought I had put it on wrong so took it off and turned it around. Same thing. Maybe it's made to fit an extended roof? Anyway I'll probably just put some bungee cords here and there to keep it tighter. That said, it seems to be very durable and will last for several years. Much better than those thin covers which cost the same price.",
