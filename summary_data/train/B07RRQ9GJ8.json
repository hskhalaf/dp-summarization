When you get down to really using the Galaxy Fit, though, its inaccurate heart monitor and lack of GPS tracking take the shine off proceedings. Considering the fact that you can pick up the Galaxy Fit-e for around \u00a350/$50 less and only miss out on wireless charging, the larger colour display, and a few other minor features, or buy the Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 4 or Honor Band 5 for the same discounted price, it\u2019s hard to recommend the expensive Galaxy Fit.",
