I'm a mother of 2 and car junk adds up really fast. So glad I bought this, it had come in handy. I paid FULL price for this item. Didn't receive it for free or at a discount so this is a real review from an average stay at home soccer mom.",

It also stands up a whole lot better to my kids randomly moving and careless feet than the usual plastic bag does. I wish there were a better mounting mechanism for keeping it in the center (have to readjust the strap every time we have to open the center console) but even with that small annoyance it is a keeper in our car.",

And the ladies in my life enjoy giving me grief about the pink straps. So there's that. The seller includes a quantity of plastic liner inserts.

Hooks are helpful to hold bag properly in place and bags are sturdy to prevent leaks. Entire thing is washable even if there was. Only problem is I have to search bag for any items that flew off my console when braking every few days.",

Grocery bags fit in here just right, which is what attracted me to this product. The hooks and the shape of the product keep bags secure and in place.
