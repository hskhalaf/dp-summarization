      "text": "i was thinking this was the size of a waterpolo ball but it is not. it was my fault as i did not put two and two together as this is a \"splash\" ball for playing \"splash ball\" an easier version of waterpolo for kids. but that was my intent in the beginning to get a inexpensive ball my kids could play with along with myself. not smaller but inexpensive so it could be played with roughly. but i am pleased with this, it has great grip and is perfect for small kids hands. so, i will give it to them and find myself a different practice ball.",
