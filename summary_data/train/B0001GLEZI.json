I recently bought a second one to replace the one I hit a nail with (I'll never forgive myself for that). Surprisingly it still kind of works. I use it for dirty things like plywood and such that I'd rather not use a good saw on. As for replacement blades, they're right here hiding in plain sight. They're $10 - $12 and each one comes with a free handle! Happy woodworking!",

Other than that they seem to last quite a while. There were a few reviews talking about how Irwin doesn't make replacement blades, but it seems kind of pointless to make a replacement \"blade\". You're just buying a blade and you need the plastic handle to hold it. So, basically consider it a disposable blade and forget about reusing the \"handle\".",

The tooth gaps in our usual Hand saws ripped the plastic apart. This. Wow. I have used this knife multiple times a week for two months. The precision is incredible. The flexibility was nice too - allowed us to cut back foam spray along floors or walls to perfection. The flex can make cutting some things harder so note to work around that at times. It just keeps cutting. Not sure how long it takes for the blade to full but at this price it\u2019s already paid for itself and will absolute get another when it does.",
