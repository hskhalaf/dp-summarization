      "text": "I bought this product to replace my old hair straightener while I am at college. I really like it! It doesn't pull your hair, it heats up fairly quick and has a plenty long cord. I gave it 4 stars because I don't like where the heat dial and on/off switch are located (on the inside). I haven't burnt myself but it is just a matter of time, I wouldn't ever pay 200 dollars for this product; however, for 25 it is a really good deal.",
