I have to rub very gently with it or else I get scratches from it - My skin feels moisturized and really smooth afterward! :-) - Be prepared for a mess! This stuff gets everywhere, and when I wash this off my bathroom smells like a cafe on a Saturday morning (not a bad thing) You can basically make this at home if you want to, and I might try it using coffee with a finer grind",

I have noticed a reduction in how visible my stretch marks on my stomach (from pregnancy) are since using it. I use other products as well but I do believe that this one is helping out quite a bit. The only nuisance is trying to get all the coffee grains to rinse down out of the shower. If you miss any it does look like you have some sort of critter leaving droppings in your shower.",
