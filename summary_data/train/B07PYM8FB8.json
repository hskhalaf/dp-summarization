      "text": "My son has had a set of the original Airpods for years, and I've always been a little dubious whether they are worth the price, but I've got to say that they are well worth the price, I am now a convert. They don't block all af the ambient noise, but I think that is a good thing. Sound quality as you would expect from a premium headphone is good. Battery lasts well and are quick to charge from the case. The highest praise I can think to give is that if I lost them tomorrow I would immediately buy another pair.",

The double tap could have been more sensitive, sometimes I have to tap multiple times for \"next/previous\" tracks.
