Its a shame, because it is perfect for my daughter's room, and looks great. Fortunately, since she is in college, it won't be getting much use, so I will keep it. Not sure it will hold up well, but I guess you get what you pay for??? Hoping it lasts at least a few years.....",

And by that I mean one side is super thin but there are big wads of it in some of the corners. One wash and it's over for this balnket. The pattern is appealing.

All fabulous features and benefits. I am very happy that I bought this comforter, because it provides us warmth and looks modern. Know that my husband will remove this comforter from our bed to cuddle with on the sofa in his mancave. .",

Also, weird stitching right down the middle 1/3 on both sides using deep purple, even on the light lavender and the \"grey\" and where the dark purple should look \"smooth\". Looks really strange. I don't think this will wash well because filling is loose inside. I would not recommend if you are decorating and want fancy.",

I followed the instructions on the tag for both washing and drying and to my disappointment, almost EVERY seam started to rip and the black color faded into the white stripes. Don't get me wrong this comforter set is absolutely gorgeous just don't wash it.",

The threads started pulling the second week we had it on the bed. And within a month and a half one whole seam has come completely undone. We have never gotten anything from Amazon of such poor quality. I even bought curtains to go with it and now I need to find a new comforter. My husband has been on workman's comp for the last 2 yrs due to a head injury. Needless to say, I won't be able to replace this anytime soon, seeing how this one was saved for.",

The washer was on the delicate setting and took precautions like we do with our other comforters this product is just poor quality.",
