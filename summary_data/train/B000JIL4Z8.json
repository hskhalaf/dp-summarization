It collapsed under her 100 pound weight, and fortunately I was able to catch her without injury to either of us. It is completely UNSAFE - should not be sold. It is on its way back to Amazon.",

The upper sections un-latch more easily, but the tenancy is to grab the rung and use your thumb to retract the latch as it is hard to move. The result is it would be very easy to have the ladder drop onto your fingers. It is heavy enough it would surly break them if this happened. I have never felt safe or secure using it. Maybe the shorter ones are easier to manage, but I'm cutting this one up and throwing it away before it hurts me or others.",

You cant mess around with it much either, because when struggling with the slides it can release very quickly and pinch your hand painfully if it's out of position. Just sorry I'm past the time limit to return. Stainless release mechanisms would have made so much more sense.",

The beauty of the Xtend & Climb is it raises one rung at a time from the vertical position.

I will agree with some other users here, the pinching and extension of the ladder takes some time to get use to. Be careful where you are collapsing your ladder...i recommend pinch releasing outside on soft ground like grass. The initial telescoping is a bit tricky.",

There's no better ladder that folds up this small! This one is significantly heavier than the 12.5 ft version, so again - get that one if you're a casual user or weighing 200 pounds or less. The lost star is only because the tabs are hard to press in to collapse, this is a fantastic ladder.",
