Recently Roku updated the software and changed it and now it is preventing me from successfully get connected to my VPN connection. Shame on this company which changes the features of the product once you have bought it and when it is working for you. If I knew this would not work with my connetction I would never bought it. When i tryied to contact them I received a message that I was #93 in the queve and it would take 75 minutes to be attended!! Very poor customer service. Be aware, no VPN connection and extremely poor customer service!",

I picked up a new TV, a 50 mile antenna, a wireless DVR and a Roku from Amazon and have never looked back. I get about 60 stations with my antenna from 3 nearby cities and can watch anything else on Roku. Even my local news station has a Roku channel now. It only took a few months to pay the initial input versus a cable bill and now I pay nothing except Netflix at $8/mo. The one irritating thing is that CNN, MSNBC, etc., won't let you stream live programs without a cable account. However Roku has news stations too.",

I want to play Pandora music in other rooms, and that is not possible with my receiver and HDMI audio (which is the ONLY audio output for the Roku 3). To resolve this, I had to grab to additional items:   So with some added installation time and expense, I can now enjoy audio from Roku 3 in my zone 2 rooms.",

Overall, this has been an excellent product. The only think that I noticed is the media player works better by connecting your Ethernet cable directly. The WiFi does work fine, but I noticed that it likes the router to be within about 10 feet. For the price, I highly recommend this product!",

Reminds me of the way websites looked in the late 90's. I fear Roku may not update their apps, at all. It seems perhaps they just release a new Roku and expect you to buy the new version to get any type of update. I love the concept and potential of what Roku brings to the table however, the reality is a bit lacking. I like the Roku OK, but the lack of updates makes me question the business model.",

Unless I missed a link on google or something in the directions on how to get the Roku to stream local files, it's a great device with a ton of available channels, great playback quality, fast streaming (though I'm using the ethernet port, I've tested out the wireless connection) and is very compact. The headphone jack in the remote is great when you don't want to disturb anyone, even though I use a universal remote control. Four stars only because there is no native way to stream files over the local network.",

The movie averaged 8 minutes of straight commercials, 9-10 minutes of movie, another 8 minutes of commercials, 9-10 minutes of movie, etc. Half way during that movie I decided to cut the cable cord. Why didn't I do this years ago? There are soo many viewing options now when I turn on my TV/roku that it is overwhelming. And the best part - some TV series have ZERO commercials, others have 1-2 minutes. Love it.",

I was also intrigued by the headphones which plug into the remote. It has met my expectations and then some. I have not as yet found any use for the USB or microSD slots. The unit was easy to set up and has been completely reliable. I use it connected by (gigabit) ethernet so I cannot comment on it's wireless connectivity. The remote is very satisfactory as regards functionality and range, and the headphone feature works very well and is quite useful.",

Following a long list of troubleshooting with the chat-support person, I was told to send the defective player to Roku and wait another week *once they receive it* to get a new one. I was told I will bear the shipping costs to getting it to them. I gave the person a chance to pay for my shipping of the defective player or I will take my business to the Fire TV. He kept citing policy and I said good day! It's a shame; Roku will fail over customer service; they did for me at least.",

Great, solid product, tons of offerings, much more open source than some other streaming devices. I love it, and have happily recommended it to others. Great combo with the free My Media server as well.",

Same for movie selection, not much quality for free. So I would highly recommend a premium channel with ANY streaming device. I use Amazon Prime and get a great selection of TV shows and movies for $99 a year. Netflix is another option. I also have a PLEX media server and have all my DVDs ripped for instant access.",

      "text": "Wow, what an easy installation, HDMI, Ethernet, and power. I turned on the TV, changed the input, and the splash page for Roku was already on the screen. Course you have go through a dozen set up menus, but, in no time we're watching a movie. Only down side, occasionally the stream freezes and you get the dial spinning around. The Roku indicates the network is working and that it couldn't access any of the Netflix servers. Doubtful about that. The little booklet that Roku provided didn't address freezing up, but, looking at a support page online it says it could be several different problems, including overheating. Otherwise we're happy with it.",

My Blue-Ray player was designed to play disks; the apps were included as a \"free gift with purchase.\" This device is designed for the streaming services. It sets up in seconds and includes a radio-based remote, which allows you to control your device without pointing it -- a great advantage when you may not be sitting in a direct line of sight with the device, or when you want to hide the device behind the television. I also recommend that you purchase a microSD card. It will improve your viewing experience.",

      "text": "I can't believe how high the resolution is on this thing. I can see the pores in people's faces when I watch a movie. I kid you not. We have a very fast network connection, which helps to make the performance incredible. The only downside it how Roku has increased the complexity of the menus. It really bothers me. The older versions were much more simple. Just before a movie, or TV show finishes, it drops down to a small screen in the upper left and shows you other things on the rest of the screen. You have to select it, again, to view the last 30 seconds of the program. Very annoying.",

However, my Roku 2 player that I purchased several months BEFORE the Roku 3 has never caused me problems. I am able to get into the Roku 3 screen to see the apps available, but when I click on an app, only the title screen appears, and I cannot get further in to see the videos available. Needless to say, I am very very unhappy with the Roku 3..",

      "text": "The version 3 fixed all the problems that I had with earlier models (occasional crash, bad connectivity, sluggish menu movement.) This is the best streaming media device on the market right now by far and this is absolutely the best way possible to stick it to the cable companies that have been run so poorly for decades. To me the Roku is also sort of the equivalent of Android to Apple. Its completely open and you can install whatever apps you want including homebrew apps. Everything is totally customizable unlike the very disappointing Amazon Fire TV. With amazon prime, netflix, and Vudu I do not miss cutting cable at all.",
