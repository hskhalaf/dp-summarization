We liked the attention getting red color. The quality is very nice. If you are thinking about these for groceries, they are smaller and lighter than what you typically find at a grocery store. I would move up to a larger size with heavier plastic construction. But if you have a store with tight spaces and small items, these are perfect.",

My boyfriend sanded down the corners (inside & outside) of each basket making more clearing so they can slip easily from each other.",

      "text": "Recently purchased these for my business, and in addition to looking much nicer than the plastic ones you more commonly see, these have a padded grip on the handles that make them more comfortable to carry. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of the stand and sign, not the baskets. The stand I received was not constructed precisely, so the sign holder in the back is not centered and the back legs do not stand straight. The red sign is made out of flimsy material, and mine was bent. With a sturdy stand and rigid sign, this would definitely be a 5 star review!!",
