Our access point doesn't hit downstairs, and doesn't cover the back yard. Two ex7000s, properly configured, cover the entire place with a single SSID. Config. wasn't too bad; be thoughtful and patient. There are plenty of more expensive ways to create a large mesh network. However, I don't think there are cheaper/more modular ways that work as well (e.g. offer as much control without stealth spying features).",

Sure enough, upon reading the instructions, I see that after set-up, this unit creates separate SSIDs with the _EXT nomenclature. Supposedly you can change the SSID, but that still does not mean this is a Mesh system as described. Probably why it was cheaper than the real Mesh extenders.",

When I power cycle the device the performance improves, but usually degrades and needs to be rebooted within 48 hours. The introduction of the device onto my wifi network has also caused the base station to crash repeatedly--something that never happened before I installed it.

I installed this extender in the workshop and now I have a very strong wifi signal in the workshop. I was surprised this worked, I thought it would need to be closer to the router inside the house. The lights on the extender tell you if the signal is strong (green light) acceptable (amber light) or poor (red light). It's green on mine even though there are 4 walls it has to travel through from the router. I'm impressed. Set up on my Mac was easy too.",
