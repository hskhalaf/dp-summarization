This is an ok kit with a variety of items inside the canvas bag but realistically the bag felt pretty empty with some of the additions that counted as part of the 66 items. Some of the quality of the individual pieces could be better quality as well, as some items feel pretty cheaply made. It also could use a few more additions to it, such as a fire extinguisher and tire flat repair. With that being said, this is a decent starter kit for the price and will work in an emergency, but don\u2019t expect high quality items that will last a long time in this basic kit. 3 stars",

All the items listed were present and accounted for and I couldn't think of a more perfect gift for my sis-in-law who recently got a driving job. If I were to fault anything in this kit it would probably be the tire pressure gauge. It is one of the fairly flimsy, cheap varieties that have a notoriously inaccurate little plastic stick acting as the gauge. Since it's not a particularly critical item from a safety standpoint (if your tire's flat, you don't need a gauge to tell you) it's a pretty minor drawback.",
