However, there are some issues when it comes to the shoe\u2019s sizing and durability. It received many comments regarding the sole falling apart after a few months of use. But for those who are looking for a budget-friendly skater shoe that can also be worn to school or work, the Airwalk Brock is not a bad choice.",

Highly recommended.
