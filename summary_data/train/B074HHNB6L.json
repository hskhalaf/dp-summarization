      "text": "I purchased this backpack in preparation for my 19 day trip in the Philippines. It is exactly what I Wanted and needed for my trip. The build quality is great and the added usb worked well for my power bank. The only concern I had was the secure locking mechanism for the largest compartment since it broke on the second day of the trip. Not a deal breaker since the backpack was still quite functional. But to my surprise , CPSZ responded to my feedback and replaced my backpack immediately, free of charge! I am still on my trip but I received confirmation my backpack has already been delivered! Thank you CPSZ!",

I often used my northface jesture bag for a carry on. This one is more subtle and the spaces and pockets for flash drives and harddrives and charges are clutch. Speaking of chargers, it would benefit to get one the size of maybe a laptop harddrive at biggest. The space for it is not that large but i did recommend this bag to a friend.",
