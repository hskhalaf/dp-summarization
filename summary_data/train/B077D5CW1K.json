It works well for my small groups both indoors and outdoors.I do wish the cable between the head set and the device was a little longer but that is not a complaint about the device, just the way I use it. If you wish to talk to small groups, especially if they are elderly or hard of hearing, this will work very well.",

By the end of the week I sound very raspy. Ever since I've been suing this gadget, I can do a full week of school and be fine at the end of the week. It saves your larynx and forces you to talk low and prevents you from straining your voice. It's a must have for for teachers!",

      "text": "Nice compact unit that seems to perform well as a mini amp speaker. The sound is clear and you have good volume available. Setting up the FM radio is a bit potluck as the instructions with the unit don't clearly show what button to press to switch to it and the auto station selection just seems to pick up the strongest signals to programme. Therefore the stations picked might not be what you want or just noise. It might be me but that is what I found. Also you need to remember to keep the volume low when setting up as a speaker as you will probably get feedback as you adjust headstone and unit positions.",

I would not recommend it for speeches due to the tinny sound and lack of anything which resembles a pop filter. It will magnify breath sounds, accidental touching of the device as well. It is not comfortable to wear. It does NOT hold up. I purchased this 4 months ago and the item has had little use. Look at the wear and tear on the ear padding. Spend a few more dollars and get something that eliminates all these issues. Would NOT recommend except for one-time use situations or as a toy for kids.",

My only complaint is the included printed instructions were badly written. I had to waste a Saturday afternoon using trial-and-error methods to teach myself how to use the unit. In truth, I didn't figure everything out. For example, I still don't know how to record my voice onto a flash drive while making a presentation.
