I had read reviews that it was difficult to assemble and parts didn't line up, but I had no problem assembling this and am very happy with the end product. Don't get me wrong, there is some work to the assembly because there are 20+ parts and 100+ screws, so basically it's a giant Erector set! Completed bench is solid and is exactly what I wanted. If I had advice to help anyone assembling this, it would be to not tighten each screw as it's placed. You may need to adjust the parts, so best to do in stages as each is completed.",
