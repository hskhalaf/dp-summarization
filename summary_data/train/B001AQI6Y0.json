If you love hiking or are interested in learning how to climb using ice axes this is a great model to start with. The handle and lanyard help a lot! Spend the extra $10 bucks for these options. Youll be happy especially when you have you gloves on.",

Works good to cut steps int he snow and I've used one of them to anchor down my tent in high winds. I've not been gentle with these axes but so far they've held up great. I like them so much I bought a 65cm set for my girlfriend. If you are going to do climbing up a sheer ice face you may want to go with a technical set of axes but for general mountaineering these work great.",
