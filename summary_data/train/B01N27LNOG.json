      "text": "Quite easy and intuitive to setup. Unlike many other repeaters I've tried, this one is always accessible by IP and not some local host name that doesn't resolve most of the time. It can work in regular repeater mode of the 2 wifi speed channels, and in boost mode using pure 5Ghz to deliver over 60MB p/s file transfers in my tests. It has a gigabit ethernet port to connect to a physical network which is essential if you have other wired machines and a decent NAS. I'm glad I returned the Netgear repeater I only used for 4 hours and ordered this Zyxel immediately as a replacement.",

This is due to some 4 concrete/brick walls. Would this baby do the trick? Due to it's plug/pin arrangement it needed an extension block on the power point in the entrance hall to clear the wall. Alleluia - it worked first time. No problems. The instruction leaflet was adequate, but of course I had an inkling of how to \"plumb it in\" due to the existing Zyxel router. Very satisfied.",
