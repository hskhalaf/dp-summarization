Figured this review will let you know what this chainsaw can handle and how long the charge will last. See attached pictures. All was done on one charge.",

No problems. Probably took a little longer than it would have taken one of you \"hairy-legged\" type people, but that's ok. No oil (other than for the chain), no gas, and no yanking on a rope until my arm wanted to fall off. This is my third GreenWorks purchase...also have their lawn mower and weed-whacker, and am very happy with all three. Good quality stuff. A little pricey, but worth it for no problems. Thank you!!!",

The largest diameter I've cut so far has been about five to six inches. Obviously, the larger the tree, the longer it's going to take to cut, but it'll do the job. I haven't had any oil leak issues and the chain stays pretty tight, even after cutting a dozen small trees. The light weight makes it perfect for me to handle. Definitely happy with this purchase.",

This chainsaw is not too large and, as a woman, found it very easy to use. With a lot of awareness while using this chainsaw I came away with all my limbs attached and unhurt. I especially love that it does not run on gas but is battery powered. The battery charge lasted way past my energy. Judging by past winters, I am sure more trees and branches will come down in the future and feel I made a good investment.",

It is very light and maneuverable it doesn't kick much if you've already bought into this line and have a couple batteries it would be an ideal option. If you're willing to break up a project over a couple of different episodes to let the battery charge in between, this will work great for you.",

This is most noticeable when cutting small branches where maybe only 1 or 2 teeth would be in contact with the branch. By spacing the teeth out, there is less resistance to cutting allowing you to cut through larger branches, albeit more slowly than with my plug in electric chain saw. Not having the cord is probably worth it as I have an extension cord with a repair because of the corded chain saw.",

After about 30-60min of sitting on the charger the indicator would switch to charging and charge the battery, but the life of the battery was still limited. After about 3-4 charges the battery would no longer charge. I have contacted Greenworks, but so far they have not responded.",
