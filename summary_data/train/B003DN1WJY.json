This product is different, it\u2019s much thinner and sort of splatters everywhere when you use it. Not nearly as good as rapid relief. Too bad, I just cancelled my Subscribe & Save because I found the old Rapid Relief at a drugstore, although I assume eventually that too will be swapped out.",

Maybe some people don't mind it, but after using it for awhile, I wish it smelled better. It also seems to linger so I'm constantly smelling it! lol. I'm thankful this product works and if it smelled better I'd give it 5 stars!",

      "text": "Frist, we tried a few other types of these products and honestly none of them worked near as good as the Desitin. Also, getting Desitin in the tub is definitely the way to go. At least for at your 'changing station'. It is so much more convenient to swipe your finger through the tub than it is to squeeze some out of a tube when you are dealing with limbs flying all over the place. We have it on subscribe and save now.",
