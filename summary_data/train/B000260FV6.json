My newest QuietFlow broke after 2 day so, going from the reviews, I decided to try the AquaClear 70 and I am blown away at how much better I like. It's very quiet except for a minimal hum, you can't hear the water splashing into the tank, the stream is strong but not so strong that it moves the sand around and it seems to be doing a great job of filtering my 40 gallon. The cover fits very snug and there is no rattle. Absolutely worth every penny!",

Runs quiet, pushes tons of water, customizable media options, and it's not an eyesore. One piece of advice...if you have a tall tank, get the intake extender(s). You'll want to pull that water from the bottom. Also, a sponge pre-filter is helpful to keep large debris and small critters from getting sucked into the tube.",

      "text": "There are many things to like about this HOB filter. If assembled correctly, you will have a super quiet filter, with great power. I love the media compartment - lots of room to choose your own preference for media. I also like the color. It's nice to have something more subtle than the standard black. Mine is for a 10 gallon betta tank, so I do recommend a sponge pre-filter and to adjust the flow to the lowest setting, I also have driftwood at the water flow to help diffuse the current.",

I was going to purchase 2 110's, but decided I could get a little bit more media space with the 70's. That also goes for total water turnover in the tank. 1200 gph vs 1000. I've been using aquaclears filters for my other 2 tanks for years. Compared to other hob filters, these are the most customizable filters available.",
