The two included with this set are too weak to connect with any other tegu OR the magnetic chalkboard that I planned to store them on! My 4 year old actually said he was sad that he couldn\u2019t get them to work. He likes building cars with the other shapes and the wheels from another tegu set we purchased. With the exception of the rectangles, they all stick to the chalkboard easily! 2 stars because these toys are expensive and each piece should have quality magnets.",

    "title": "14 Piece Tegu Magnetic Wooden Block Set, Tints",
    "description": "Color:Tints\"Click-Clack.\" It's the iconic sound of two Tegu Blocks coming together. Tegu has reinvented the wooden block in a way that brings new life to a favored classic. By safely embedding magnets into each piece, Tegu Blocks become curiously attractive for both kids and kids at heart. Defy gravity and push your imagination in ways never before possible. No instruction manuals or electronics; just toys that demand imagination and inspire limitless creativity across all ages. Open-ended play is endangered, but we're bringing it back. Created with beautiful Honduran hardwoods and safe water-based finishes, these blocks have proven wildly addictive for kids (and kids at heart) and will encourage the simple joy of creating for generations. This set includes 14 blocks in five shapes: 2 Medium Columns, 4 Short Planks, 4 Long Planks, 2 Cubes and 2 Parallelograms. Tegu blocks come packaged in a beautifully designed box large and rigid enough to store the blocks for many years to come. Also, don't miss out on some really fun factoids about the blocks and their origin on the inside of each package. Each set also includes The Tegu Story -- a booklet containing various building ideas and information about Tegu's social and environmental initiatives. There is something magical about watching a child's imagination unfold. The curiosity. The ingenuity. The creativity. Even more exciting is creating a product that unlocks a child's mind. We exist to create experiences that captivate children in safe, natural and innovative ways. At Tegu, this creativity also meets responsibility. Through socially responsible business practices and humanitarian efforts, we are dedicated to helping the Honduran community with reforestation, education and social outreach initiatives.",
