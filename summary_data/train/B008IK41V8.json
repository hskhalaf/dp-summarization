I came across American Crew as it has good reviews from other websites. This particular one (from Amazon) is most likely not authentic as it is way cheaper than American Crew from their website. I still decided to give it a try after reading the mostly positive Amazon reviews. I am not disappointed. It smells good and my skin isn't dry. This 3 in 1 shampoo/conditioner/body wash is my favorite now. Whether it is fake or not, it still has quality and I recommend it",
