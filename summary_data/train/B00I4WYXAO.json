      "text": "I recently bought a car from 2015. It's not the kind that can easily swap radios. The center console would have to change. I didn't want to do that just to add bluetooth music streaming. I already had bluetooth calling in the car. But there was a set of RCA jacks for the AUX connection in the arm rest. Plugged this device in, paired to my phone and worked like a charm. When I start the car it connects in a second. When I shut the car off it stops playing. The only caveat is I have to press play on my phone again when I get back into the car. Impressed with how well this device works.",

My Samsung Galaxy S6 is set-up to play bluetooth music through this system into my car stereo; but when a call comes in, its gets directed to my bluetooth headset... which is exactly what I wanted. (If I have someone in the car, this set-up helps avoid the inevitable, \"Hi, you've got me in the car with another person on speaker\" scenario). If you get a little static, don't forget to buy a ground loop noise isolator... this is a car-specific wiring problem (incl in my Mazda3) but easily solved. I bought this one @",

We were driving along, listening to a podcast, when the unit gave a 'pop' and smoke came out of the device. Considering how little I used this bluetooth adaptor, it failed extremely quickly. It would be greatly appreciated if the seller would contact me about a return/replacement; I hope that my unit failing so quickly is the exception rather than the rule for these devices, as they offer functionality that I did appreciate (for the 6 weeks it was working).",

This leaves you without any volume control for when you get on the freeway unless you turn the whine back up by increasing the car speaker volume again. In short, it can be made to work but it sucks. This could have been prevented by a final test step before packaging and shipping (unless the design is faulty). Lesson for entrepreneurs - preserve your product's and your company's quality reputation instead of short cutting a normal manufacturing process step.",

      "text": "As a previous reviewer mentioned the sound only comes out of one side for whatever reason. I can fiddle with it and it will go back to all speakers but as soon as I go over a bump I lose the sound again. Tried to return the items and they wouldn't allow me since it was over 30 days. Save your money.",
