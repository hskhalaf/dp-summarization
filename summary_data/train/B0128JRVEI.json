      "text": "I own a mobile tan business and have had my maxi mist for almost 9 years. It worked wonders. When it finally came time to upgrade I wanted to stick with this brand and heard great reviews on this machine specifically. Pros- very lightweight, easy to transport, sleek design and comes with 4 guns Cons- seems very cheap quality compared to my last maxi mist machine, very thin cheap plastic including guns. Unfortunately it has a huge problem with \u201csplattering\u201d or spitting the solution, it comes out blotchy and very wet. For me this is a huge problem and I have clients complaining about streaking and blotchiness. Will be returning and upgrading to the nice metal guns.",

The product flows from the gun nice and even (make sure the trigger is adjusted for a light to medium flow). Overall I am happy with how well the machine works, it's not too loud, product distribution is even, and it's easy to clean.",

For me this system has been a complete waste of money the gun clogs after each use, it doesn't spray evenly the solution either barely comes out or it comes out to fast . The solution is also not up to par it gives great instant color but completely disappears after first shower.",

Also super cute color! I really enjoy this product.",
