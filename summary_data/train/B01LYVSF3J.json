      "text": "After hearing that colored overlays could help some of my piano students better read their music, I ordered a 12 pack of yellow transparencies. It was amazing to see the expressions on the faces of those who were helped by the overlays. Even one of my adult students said it aided her reading. The overlays come between two pieces of sturdy cardboard and very thin sheets of paper between each overlay. The package arrived when it was scheduled and in good shape. I will definitely order from this company again. Great product!",

Both said it helped them focus on the printed notes, and track them with their eyes while playing, easier than reading the black notes on bright white paper.",
