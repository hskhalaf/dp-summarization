These shoes from this seller are defective; the cushion in the left shoe is too short, it does not extend all the way to the toe of the shoe. Leaving the toes to hang over the cushion in the shoe... making the shoe uncomfortable. I paid $131.30 for these defective Puma sneakers. The style looks great, but means nothing when the expensive shoes are defective and uncomfortable. I'm awaiting the sellers response. Unhappy and disappointed.",
