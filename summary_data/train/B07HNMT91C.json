But if you want to invest for the long term this is great option. 2080TI GPU should be able to run the majority of video games at 60fps in 4K with all the graphics settings cranked to the max, which is a feat previous graphics card have struggled to match. The rendering in premiere pro with Enabled GPU Acceleration (CUDA) is so much fast than a normal rendering.",

Paired with an i9-9900k, I can set games to max level at 3440x1440 no matter what the game is, and the highest temperature I've seen on the GPU is 65oc. It's not the cheapest 2080ti by any means and is still the same price, or thereabouts, I paid over 12 months ago, but it smashes any game you throw at it, runs cool and whisper quiet. Fully recommended.",

    "description": "Size Name:OC Mode - GPU Boost Clock: 1665 MHz| Style Name:ROG Strix Gaming OC EditionOUTSHINE THE COMPETITIONThe ROG Strix GeForce RTX\u2122 2080Ti teams up NVIDIA\u00ae' s A-list GPU with an elite cast of specialists, setting the stage for epic gaming action. Gargantuan power delivery provides the muscle to push overclocking boundaries, while cooling that' s honed to perfection keeps the spotlight squarely on Turing\u2122' s performance. And with an arsenal of utilities that allow you to customize and tweak this extreme hardware, you call the shots.COOLINGAxial-tech FansBetter, Faster, StrongerTo keep Turing\u2122' s temperatures under tight control, we' ve brought a larger cooler to the table, which necessitates a more powerful and efficient fan that must maintain a whisper-quiet acoustic profile. Axial-tech meets these three design challenges by implementing our latest innovations for fan performance. We' ve reduced the size of the fan' s hub to allow for longer blades and added a barrier ring that increases structural integrity and downward air pressure through the ROG Strix GeForce RTX\u2122 2080Ti' s heatsink array. And we' ve also implemented IP5X dust resistance to seal the fan' s internals from particle ingress to keeps things running smoothly. The new design allows Axial-tech fans to shift more air and spin at higher speeds without increasing noise levels.0dB TechnologyQuiet intelligence0dB technology allows fans to stop spinning when the GPU core temperature remains below 55 Celsius, letting you enjoy light gaming in complete silence. If temps rise, the fans automatically start up again. *To activate 0dB mode, please engage Quiet (Q) bios mode by using the onboard switch.2.7-Slot DesignSink your heat into thisThis generation, our top-end cards adopt a 2.7-slot footprint to accommodate a larger heatsink because bigger is better.
