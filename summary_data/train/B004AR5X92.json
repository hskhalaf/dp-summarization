Only down side---my husband feels like it is too hot, though he does admit it is very comfortable. I don't feel the heat at all so it's just a difference of body temperature and reaction to the foam. We have these toppers on two adjustable twin-long beds and the sizing is perfect. Also have a lightly quilted mattress cover on top of them. Would definitely recommend this topper to anyone who wants a more comfortable mattress and a good night's sleep!",

Still, it's super comfortable, comparable to the more expensive brand-names, and did I mention comfortable?",

I have my foam under a mattress protector so perhaps the extra layer between the skin is helpful. If you are going to use one of these, you will need \"deep\" fitted sheets.",

It is for my elderly father and was a replacement for a twenty year old down cover. I tested it after making the bed and I was very impressed. I noticed no oder that made me want to stick it in another room for three days as suggested. Dad had no problems with the transition and making the bed is now is easy compared to realigning the old down unit. Very nice.",

I've been using it for weeks now, and my body doesn't ache when I get up anymore and I feel my sleep has been more productive. Be warned though, this thing smells for days and you'll need to change the sheets after a few days before the smell level is acceptable. Hope this helps!",

Let it air out for 2-3 days (this also gives it time to expand to the proper size and the smell decreases significantly). 2. If you have a big bed to start, make sure to have a fitted sheet with a slight bit extra give so it doesn't pull off easily",

Four of us searched every square inch of the pad and found absolutely no # stamped anywhere on it, nor were there any packing documents with it. In reading the registration site comments, that also appears to be a common problem.",

Expansion took about 2 hours total at 70 degrees F, so it appears the expansion time on the package is a bit over-stated. As others have noted, memory foam retains heat, so having this on your bed will make thing a bit warmer. It's sized perfectly for our queen mattress (latex foam from IKEA). We purchased the Linenspa Premium Hypoallergenic Waterproof cover to go with this, and it's silent. It's highly suggested to get a waterproof cover to prevent the memory foam from absorbing sweat and such, as it doesn't ventilate like a normal mattress.",

I have extreme back issues and arthritis to boot and I was just praying this mattress topper would do what everyone said it would.... AND IT DID!! It absolutely cannot take away serious back pain... however it has made it so that I can roll over, sleep and lay on my back without waking up 6 million times an evening. Thank you!",

I have continued to experience hip pain during the night since I started sleeping on my new mattress topper, much to my disappointment.

The smell was pretty bad if you like to sleep with your head under the covers. If you have issues with the smell, let it air out for at least 2 days.",
