They \u201cdroppped like flies\u201d and we just swept them up! The camper smelled fresh and we were bug free the rest of the night!",

Spray up high like the bottle says and not too much it can actually make the floor slick if you have tile because of the natural orange oils and you may fall so just be careful and to not use it like regular ole bathroom spray a little goes a long way fairly potent lingers for quite some time.",

Otherwise, I will buy this product as long as they make it!",

The citrus odor is a true citrus scent made from real oranges and not a fake one. It works like a charm. It's a natural smell and works very well.

I like the smaller can, because it doesn't take up a lot of space under my bathroom sink. The small can is also easier to hang on to than larger cans are, for folks like me who have small hands. Finally, the button is a good design, and product does not drip out during or after the spraying process.",
