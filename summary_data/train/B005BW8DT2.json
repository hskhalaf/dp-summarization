I wear a size 13 so shopping in stores is a drag because when I see a wall of shoes and ask what they have in a 13 they point to two or three shoes. I've liked the DC Pure shoes since I was a kid and still wear them however instead of the crazy colors I now just opt for all black or grey ones ;-)",

However, these sneakers HURT! Most skateboarding sneakers I've owned take a full day or two to break in. Two weeks of use later, they still leave your feet sore. These shoes, fit way too tight around the toes and put immense pressure on the pinky toe joint. I should have read other reviews more carefully and bought a pair one full size larger.",

They would be perfect right out of the box.",

Construction seems solid and durable. The sole is a little stiff at first making them slightly uncomfortable. However, after a solid week of wearing them everyday they are starting to break in nicely. They are super comfortable now. I actually ordered the black/green ones as well because the price for both pairs I got was about $20 less here on amazon for each pair than what I could find in a local store. Can't beat that.

These shoes do not have the same quality by having no elastic bands to keep the tongue in place which I thought was standard in the better skate shoes. They came with one set of cheap small laces that looked like they were off a different pair of shoes. Not very comfortable like other DC's and tongue moves to the sides, so I used new nicer laces that I laced through the top tongue strap which helped.",

For the people who say they're \"a bit too small\", its only because they're skate shoes and are packed with padding. For people who are moving from other brands such as Nike, Adidas, New Balance, etc. and buying skate shoes for the first time, I'd suggest going up a half to a whole size. Just know that once you start wearing skate shoes, you'll probably never be able to go back to other types of footwear :D",
