I've enjoyed more the chamomile teas from Eastern europe, they include actual chamomile flowers in their bags, unlike the chamomile dust in these. A lovely chamomile tea should be fragrant, flowery, a pleasure for both smell and taste, this tea has none of those things. Also quality control seems to be an issue at Taylors.... I had one bag spray chamomile dust all over me when I opened the envelope and I've had a few bags open while in the cup, making a less than pleasant cup of tea. have to say, nothing special here, keep looking.",

Pros: - cheap - some of the teas taste okay - not too bitter if steeped too long Cons: - teabag design; if you pull the string too hard/fast, you can rip a hole in the mesh, and if you tear the outer packaging the wrong way you will rip a hole in the mesh - weak flavor on chamomile and peppermint",

The chamomile didn't have much of the sweet floral notes that draw me to it as an evening beverage. The Assam was not at all robust as the packaging suggested. Nothing brewed bitter which normally is a good thing, but in this case may have improved these bland teas. Maybe I had a stale batch, but I will be looking elsewhere for my tea samplers.",

      "text": "The tea in the box of Taylors of Harrogate tea bags I received lack both black tea and bergamot scent and flavor. The box was properly sealed and the freshness date is July 7, 2021, so the flavor issue can't be blamed on outdated bags. I find I have to use two bags and steep it for a few minutes longer to even come close to the tea experience I have with a single bag of other commercial brands such as Twinings or Bigelow. I will not purchase this brand of tea again..",

While it's not really close to a beer it does have a nice malty flavor and the steep provides a rich tea that holds milk well. The foil pouches keep the tea very fresh. When I ran out of these I tried to replace with a grocery store brand Irish Breakfast - it didn't compare. Highly recommend. :)",
