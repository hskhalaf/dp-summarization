The plan was to buy this inexpensive one and upgrade to a nice glass one if we liked having a pendant light instead of a floor lamp. We ended up just using this one permanently. It doesn't look cheap and I like that the cord is in a clear casing. Keeps attention off of it and helps it to blend in, instead of the more expensive glass ones that usually have bulky metal chains. Glad I went with the inexpensive version first, and we are sticking with it!",

For $15 it does the job, though and I just needed it to add some light to a corner of the apartment. I'll do as others have suggested and take a heat gun to the plastic globe piece and fix the shape that way.",

Don't get me wrong, it is attractive enough for my need, a storage area, child's bedroom or dorm room. What I really love is that it didn''t cost a fortune and serves my purpose. I would recommend it to anyone needing instant light in an area of their home.",
