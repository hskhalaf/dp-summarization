The pumps are easy to prime and they really help at minimizing soap usage. Small tip: If using a thick substance like conditioner or lotion, an air pocket may form if you use many pumps at once. I would normally tap my conditioner bottle to continue to dispense, but that's not practical with a wall mounted fixture. We find that keeping the container at least half full helps eliminated this issue.",

      "text": "I love the look and convenience of these soap dispensers. They're easy to assemble, fill/refill and it frees up counter space. My biggest issue is that it's easy for a user to accidentally bump the dispenser and unlatch it from the holder. Since the lid is not tight, soap spills everywhere. If you've ever cleaned up a soap spill, you know it's not easy. This has happened twice and we've had to clean up a huge mess and refill the entire container of soap. I suppose we could duct tape the lid, but that's not very attractive.",

      "text": "This is a decent shower soap dispenser, but not great. It is VERY difficult to prime, especially with thick liquids like conditioner on a cold day. The trick is to depress the pump button, THEN put your finger over the bottom hole where the liquid comes out and release the pump button. This forces the pump to pull fluid in from the storage chamber. Also, it does not dispense very much liquid with each pump so it takes several pumps to get enough. This pump is NOT battery powered which may be good or bad. It does have great feedback, but I'm learning the high scoring feedback is sometimes not true.",

So I don't think this is a good dispenser if you have thick products or even a slightly thick products. It did come out easier with my dr. Bronner Castile soap, but anything thicker than that will require much longer time to get it out. Don't recommend.",

Ready to install but have to wait..... this is disappointing, but no choice now but to wait for their installation strips to arrive. I could get water proof commander strips from hardware store, but that might void the warranty. Just not sure.",
