While neutral runners were positive about its affordable price, it\u2019s lightweight build, and its appealing color schemes, some of them felt that its midsole wasn\u2019t as comfortable. One person even claimed that something was causing some discomfort to the arch of the foot.",
      "pros": [
        "The toe box of the Saucony Breakthru 4 was broad enough for toe-splay, several users commented",
        "The available colorways for this running shoe were visually endearing, some people noted",
        "Most consumers welcomed the price tag, stating that it\u2019s affordable",
        "The lightweight nature of this product gained the favor of its testers",
        "The sizing scheme followed most people\u2019s expectations"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A few testers complained that the midsole was stiffer and less responsive than the previous version",
        "According to a consumer, there was a lump in the sole unit that tended to grab the arch uncomfortably"

I love the look and feel of these. Lightweight and airy. My only knock is that I wish it had just a tad more cushion for the front part of your foot. I pound hard on that area. I run exclusively on a treadmill...9-18 miles per week (depends on how busy I get).",

I wear a Plantar Fasciitis insole in the shoe and have had zero foot problems since I started using this shoe/insole combination. Very comfortable shoe. The bottoms wore well and would be good for a few more miles had I not worn a \u201craggedy\u201d pair of socks a couple of times and rubbed holes in the inside of the heel. I\u2019ll definitely pick up another pair of these soon.",
