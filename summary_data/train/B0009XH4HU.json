This works very well for that purpose. Will be trying it while recording with microphones into my little Sony digital recorder Still learning ways to use it but very happy so far. I love having a battery on board, one less thing to plug in and very good when I'm using a battery powered amp with no wall power nearby. Physically this mixer is pretty small. Very portable.",

The only improvement would be to offer a model with miniature 3.5mm jacks instead of the 1/4\" jacks. This would save having to buy adaptors to go from the 3.5 mm to the 1/4\"",

Additionally, when I use the 9V adapter, I notice an additional high pitched ringing noise.

To avoid spending money on batteries, I went ahead and bought a standard universal ac/dc adapter which was very noisy (loud hum or high ripple dc content). Wouldn't recommend anyone doing this but since I have a background in electronics, I went ahead and opened up the unit, soldered 2 electrolyte capacitors in parallel (one 6800uF, the other 4700uF) across the dc in under the circuit board. Now it's quiet as a mouse.",

      "text": "I picked this up so i could simply send 2 channels in to 1 PA speaker. Bad idea. It makes a scratchy sound at random times, like scratchy pots would when turning them, or like a loose connection would make when wiggling it, but it does it without anything being touched.. (even at low volumes, so i know its not being vibrated) Also, turning up the \"volume\" knobs just 5% of the way gives you about 50% of the volume, then the remaining 50% can be slowly achieved by turning the knob up the rest of the way. All 10 knobs are like this.",

Even when attempting to test the B side, the other side of my headphones provides no sound. If it was true stereo it should be able to have it able to use one 1/4in input. Now I have to purchase all male 1/4 splitters just to see if it'll actually work as intended?? This model needs a heavy revision. Add tracings to the PCB so the stereo channels are actually combined to 4 inputs and 1 output as described!",

    "description": "Dozens of applications for this extremely useful mixer at a very affordable price \n\nThe Nady MM-242 allows you to easily combine mono or stereo signals together and adjust their relative volumes. Ideal for DJ equipment, synths and guitar rigs, studio, stage, the MM-242 is a great tool to have around everywhere. Mono/stereo mode selector switch determines whether all 8 inputs are mixed to both 1/4\" outputs or are preserved as stereo signals, so you have greater flexibility and mixing options. Connect the \u00bc\u201d outputs of this little workhorse directly to your PA or recording device for ultra-clean audio. Eliminate the need for bulkier, more expensive mixers, and take the MM-242 anywhere with you with its 9VDC operation using either a 9V alkaline battery or the optional PAD-1 AC/DC external adapter. \n\nSpecifications\n\nInput Impedance: 50k\u2126\nOutput Impedance: 120\u2126\nMaximum Output: +7dBm\nFrequency Response: 20Hz-30kHz\nTHD: 0.07%\nS/N: -95dB\nNoise Floor: 120uV\nInputs/Outputs: 1/4\u201d unbalanced\nPeak LEDs: light 3dB before clipping\nCurrent Drain: 19mA\n9V Battery Life: up to 35 hours\nPower Requirements: 9V battery or optional PAD-1 AC/DC adapter",
