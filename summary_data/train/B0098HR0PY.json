The fuel gauge is weight based (You hang your tank from it) so it doesn't give a really accurate reading. BIGGEST THING TO KNOW I'd that the temperature dials are technically backwards. Turning them counterclockwise DECREASES the flame. So basically, when you first ignite the grill you are technically at the highest flame output/ temp.",

Reviews that say hole in the middle too big and lp tank falls thru (others that say they even had to improvise parts to cover the hole).. it was meant to have a hole in the middle, it\u2019s for the tank to be suspended so you can see how much gas is left. The tank is suspended on the hook in order to check gas level( added pictures). Heats up fast, very easy to install. Great product",

I held off posting a review of this product because I purchased it at the end of the season and thought the poor performance may have been related to the cold windy weather at the time. However, that was not the case. With temperatures in the 70s and no wind, this Weber Spirit 2 burner grill has been disappointing. With the propane full on and both burners turned up all the say, it takes about two hours to cook a medium steak. The gauge goes up to 600, but I have not been able to get it over 300. With the slightest breeze, the burners go out.",

Has a hanging scale that constantly keeps track of the weight of your propane tank -- i.e., a fuel gauge. This grill is more than I wanted to spend but I won't be buying another for decades.

Cooking on it is great. I was worried that it\u2019d be too small, but it\u2019s actually perfect. You can fit about 8-10 burgers at a time, which is plenty for our needs. I also love that the sides fold down; it\u2019s really efficient with space. The quality is definitely there with this grill- totally happy we got it!",

Also, I've seen some reviews that talk about how hot this grill gets, and it's true. It can get up to 500 degrees very quickly so you gotta be on top of things.

There's good control over the intensity of the flame. According to the thermometer on the cover, it heated to 500 degrees in about ten minutes with both burners lit. Every grill I've had before this one were the $99 specials at the local big box store. This Weber cost 4x as much, but I can see and feel the difference.",

Overall I'm very satisfied with the Spirit E210. My only quibble is that the heat isn't uniformly distributed over the grill surface.
