Unlike traditional laptops, you can't tilt the screen forward, which makes for awkward angles when video chatting or watching movies, etc. I decided to go with Surface Laptop and I won't be going back! I love this computer. Screen size is awesome and display is clear. Touch is sensitive and responsive. Keyboard is comfortable. And the machine it self is gorgeous. Just buy it!",
