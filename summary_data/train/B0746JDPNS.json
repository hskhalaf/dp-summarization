The bag itself for only the 55-210mm lens is a bit large as there is extra room even with the tie completely tight. If you are looking for something to store the 55-210mm lens snuggly, you may want to consider a smaller pouch bag. I can comfortably fit the 55-210mm lens with an extra battery with extra space.",
