Also be sure if you're mounting into a ceiling to mount into a stud. The way you mount this is extremely important because if the mounting were to fail while you're hanging upside down you could be seriously injured. The hammock itself is very strong and very safe to use.",

It is good for cocooning but even so it is too much fabric lengthwise. It isn't stretchy either. As someone who has tried from all the brands here on Amazon I can tell you your best bet is to buy a cotton lycra blend . You have to tie with this kit anyway and its far less expensive.",

    "description": "What Kind Of Fabric Is The Hammock? \nThe Aerial Yoga hammock is made of 5 meters of 40-denier Nylon Tricot fabric, which is the same type of fabric used in Cirque du Soleil performances.\n40-Denier Nylon Tricot is a two-way stretch, when it is banded together like a swing, and when you cocoon inside the hammock \nthe fabric gives just enough so that it feels comfortable for the body and skin. \n\nDoes This Come Pre Knotted On The Carbine? \nNo, it does not become pre-knotted. Our aerial yoga hammock kit include Knot tying guide - step-by-step instructions on making set-up safe and easy to follow.\n\nIs This Stretchy Material? Can Be Fully Cocooned Or Laying Fully In It? \nYes, the fabric does have give, it is a stretchy fabric. It is not like the parachute type of material used often on other yoga style swings.\n\nCan The Daisy Loops Wrap Around An Expose Beam To Hang The Swing Without Drilling Into The Beam? \nYes, you can! The daisy chains are very strong and are able to be used like that. We often recommend that you use the unlooped end of the daisy chain and place it \nthrough another loop after it is wrapped around the beam or pole. As you lay on the swing\nit will cause tension on the loop formed around the beam/pole and hold you in place. \n\nHow Wide Should I To Hang The Swing From? \nShoulder distance is probably the safest and most supportive .\n\nThis Kit Works Perfect For. \nAerial Yoga, yoga swing ,yoga sling ,aerial dance, aerial fitness ,air yoga ,aerial hammock ,Anti-Gravity Yoga, \nUnnata Yoga, Suspension Yoga, Gravity Yoga, Antigravity Yoga, Flying Yoga, Aerial Pilates\uff0c Pilates hammock",
