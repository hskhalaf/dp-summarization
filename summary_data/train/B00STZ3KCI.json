Holy moly, my picky husband likes this and even going to buy me the bottles to store them. haha.. The kit came in good packaging and Scoby was very healthy. The instruction was clear and easy to follow. I used blueberry and peach for 2nd fermentation and they are gggggggreat!. Not only brewing my own saves me money but also I can flavor them however I like it. I'm on my 3rd brewing and Scoby is growing like crazy. I thought of buying another one but didn't need it. I separated them and now I have two jars going. Love it!",

I continue to make kombucha with this SCOBY and it has been turning out very well. I have been keeping my finished product in wide mouth canning jars and I use the plastic wide-mouth caps and store it in the fridge. It is so much fun to experiment with different flavors, ferment times, and different kinds of teas. Highly recommended.",

Especially after putting in for a secondary ferment for 2 days with different flavors and some additional sugar, and then refrigerator for a day. Looking forward to more!

In my pic you see a book, that didn\u2019t come with it. I got that for Christmas and used it but you don\u2019t need both.

There is a little bit of a wait time during the fermentation process, but the scooby grows quickly and you can easily split it into multiple jars and have your own little production going so you have kombuch to drink all the time. Helps if you're organized and can keep track of your days. Really fun experimenting with different flavors. The bottle are kinda small and need to be burped every so often during the 2nd fermentation so you don't have an explosion at the end when you want to taste test it.",
