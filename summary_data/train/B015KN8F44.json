My concerns were unfounded and it is holding up great to daily use and being stored outside.",

This was listed for $49 but Amazon had one w a damaged box for $20 so that\u2019s what we got it for. I do think at $49 it seems overpriced, $35 seems more reasonable. They should sell the ground runner and hose as a kit for ppl who already have the slide. We also have the Little Tykes red and blue slide. Other than color their identical.",

The sprinkler slide attaches easily to the yellow part of the slide and hose. I hang it over the line to dry and fold it after play. I leave the plastic slide out in the yard for dry play and sometimes put it onto the toddler pool for her to slide into.",

      "text": "My 5-yo son had a blast with this all summer. Very durable and easy to roll up and put away. The slide by itself is a great for indoor and outdoor use. The handles will come off if pulled on, which happens a lot. I fixed the issue by putting two extra screws through the handle and have had no problems with it since.",

True, it's not as sturdy as some Little Tikes products but definitely worth it.",

There is a hose which clips onto slide which in theory should supply water to the slide however water cannot travel vertical and the slide stays dry. The product is not a total loss and my daughter has enjoyed hours on the slide. There is some work to do on the design in order to improve quality.",

The nice thing about little tikes is they hold their value pretty well when selling at a garage sale or they are always in great shape when handed down to younger cousins. I will continue to look for the little tikes brand when looking for durable toys for my rough and tumble boy.",
