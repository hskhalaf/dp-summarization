Great zippers, great pouch in the front, great click in/out shoulder strap, great carrying handles. The outter material is also top notch quality. I think it's nylon, but definitely heavy duty. Wasn't thrilled with the color of blue, almost looks lavender in some lights because of the grey accents. I should have gone with the all black or grey. Other than that this is worth the money!",

Would be too large for me as I only take a standard lunch but he sometimes works 12 hour shifts and takes a few snacks with his lunch plus likes to carry around keys, a pager, some medication, lotion, some paperwork, etc. It's perfect for him. The only thing it should have that it doesn't is a cushioned shoulder strap as its heavy with all the stuff he carries around.",

That being said I do wish you could zip the upper compartment open so you could increase the cool area. It needs to be just about an inch taller.

      "text": "I was looking for a sturdy lunch bag with a second compartment on top to keep my personal effects in. This bag met all my expectations and keeps the food surprisingly cold when I throw in an ice pack. The additional side pouches make this a perfect utility/lunch bag for the working man. It is large enough to pack a good sized lunch.",
