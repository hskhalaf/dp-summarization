One more note about this book, is the elements that are shared in it, can be learned from composition for drawing or paiting. However, I have not read the entire book yet, but have gotten through 25% of it. What I was looking for was a tutorial, a book to train me in graphic design. What I found was a reference manual. As a reference manual, it is very good with excellent picture examples.",

This book did exactly that, breaking design down into separate aspects of art and showing lots of examples of it. It helps with getting comfortable with design \"lingo\" too. A great introduction for people who don't want to spend thousands on college courses.",

If you're looking for an general design book to start with, this one is pretty solid. From this you can figure out what topics you want to launch into more in depth. Maybe Gestalt principles are inspiring you. Or possibly the Grid.",
