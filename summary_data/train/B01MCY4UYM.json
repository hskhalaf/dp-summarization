Neither seller nor Amazon have taken much responsibility or seem overly concerned. I'm now stuck with no headphones. However I will say headphones are great- amazing sound, incredible battery life and look great, only negative was I found the bluetooth stuttered a little when walking fast. Further I won't be purchasing from this seller nor amazon for headphones and will now go direct.",

Press and hold the control button continuously (approximately 10 seconds) and watch the LED change from OFF to WHITE to DARK BLUE to indicate Bluetooth Pairing Mode is activated. 4.

Heard about a lot of fake products being sold in Amazon. So select a seller with a good rating, don't go for default one. I went for a UK based seller with high rating, I received a genuine product.

The anc effect is not superb but we notice some effect (there are better options if noise cancellation is important). The sound quality is good and we can easy set it with bluetooth connection with ios devices ( i didn't test yet with other devices). The package is a work of art and it comes with a clean and light case (rectangular shape).",
