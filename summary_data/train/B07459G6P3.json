The glow it makes is plenty of light to see the table top for drinks. The flame flicker goes perfectly with our tiki torches. The sound quality is great and the speaker can get way louder than we need it to. After a week of use I am VERY happy with this purchase. It is perfect for our space.",

These look good and work very well, paired easily, and the sound quality from a small speaker is surprisingly good. (No, it is not an expensive, high-end sound that's loaded with bass, but is quite good. The type of music, or recording, can make a difference in the sound, too.) I have not used these for very long; so, battery life is difficult to judge. But, I'm pleased with the performance and look, and would buy them again. (I bought these to use at a garden party this summer. Note they are not fully waterproof.)",

The speaker quality is average and what you would expect from a small, single speaker. I think it is missing some of the deeper sound that you appreciate when listening to music, but I don't think many people would use a speaker like this to critique the quality of music anyway. The speakers are mountable on a tripod or post as they have a threaded receiver on the bottom. It would be neat if you could network several of these together.",

Cons: Not atpX compatible, meaning that if there is a significant delay between the playing devices' sound and this unit - once the unit it turned back on it looses its Bluetooth connection, so you have to move the speaker very close to the source/transmitter to reconnect then you can move it back to the desired listening position (our experience no more than 12ft with walls/windows/floors, 20ft within sight).",

It\u2019s possible but most of the instructions on YouTube are worthless or unintelligible. Finally figured it out by reading an Amazon review. The key is only syncing a Single speaker to your device THEN turning it off. Next you turn on both speakers and both speakers should sync to each other. It took me a couple times but it worked. Also if speaker sound is too low even at its highest level, volume needs to be adjusted on the device it\u2019s synced to. Love these cute speakers!",

Not overly loud, so if you want to blast your tunes this isn\u2019t the speaker for you. The lights are nice - give some ambiance when sitting at our outdoor table most nights. Bluetooth pairing took about 5 seconds with my iPhone. Easy-Peasy. The light on top is red while charging, but goes out when battery is full. Don\u2019t know how long it lasts on a charge, but I used the speaker for about 4 hours without any issues. Will buy another to pair to iPhone.",

The flame is awful it doesn't look natural, all it is a a bunch of little round LEDs blinking randomly it doesn't look real unless u stand 50 Ft away I purchased it because of the 1500 mostly good reviews and it was a lightning deal for 33 $ don't go by the video of the flame it's photo shopped take my word for it . I will not return it because it's to much trouble . with all due respect I almost believe the reviewers need glasses. THE FLAME IS NOT REALISTIC !!!",

He loves to listen to music while on the boat, fishing, working in the garage, etc. I liked the look of this as it reminds me of the wrought iron on some of the railings in his home. As soon as I gave it to him he loved it. It is much louder than I anticipated and does not sound as \"tin\"y as I had expected. Great buy for the price! Highly recommend. He now travels with it everywhere- I may have to get him a few more so he can leave them: in his car, in the boat, in his study, in the garage, etc.",

They try to promote this as a patio get together outings with friends , but in reality if people have NORMAL voice conversations they wouldn\u2019t be able to hear the music.

It is VERY easy to use, has terrific sound quality (including some nice low end bass) excellent battery life. As a bonus to all of that the flame light effect really looks good. It sets the mood for sure! One last thing of note is that it attaches to tripods so you can take it into the backyard for BBQ or parties etc. All around a GREAT product! Highly recommended",
