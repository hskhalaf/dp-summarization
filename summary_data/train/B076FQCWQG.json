I use with a Takstar SGC-598 mic and mount to a tripod. I used a level to check the holder and the iPhone built in level to verify. I was pleasantly surprised to see the phone mounted perfectly level in the holder. Super sturdy and multiple cold shoe mounts allow you to mount the mic over the camera lense so you are looking and talking to the same location. Makes a nice visual cue to make sure you are looking at the lense.",

This does make it a lot easier to shoot video with two hands in a more natural position rather than fumble around the phone and worry about getting your fingers in the shot. Highly recommend for the price.",

It says it's patented and I hope for the company's sake, it really is because it's amazing. I bought a couple of the LED lights which I'm not sure I'll use. But this rig allows you to hold your smartphone WAY steadier. It's genius.",
