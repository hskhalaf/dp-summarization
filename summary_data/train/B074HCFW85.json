      "text": "Nice woven material that is both thin and very strong. Wont rip. Gifted to my son-in-law who is an avid 'griller'. He has a large gas grill and 2 of these fit nicely, side by side. He likes these very much. Conducts heat well. Prevents food from falling thru the grid. An easy way to grill vegetables without needing additional foil pan. Makes after-grilling clean up a lot quicker. Of course, you wont get the traditional grill marks on your meats, but if that is not a deal breaker, these are nifty grilling sheets.",

Usually I use them to line my baking sheets for baking, roasting and broiling vegetables, grains, sweets, and even fruit leather. They are easy to clean, and I have used the dishwasher sometimes, but usually wash them by hand. They dry quickly, and roll up easily for storage in the original packaging. It was easy to use kitchen scissors to cut two of the sheets to fit exactly to a smaller pan. Very highly recommended! What a great way to limit your use of foil and parchment paper.",

      "text": "I have been using copper grill mats now for over 3 years. I was pleased to find these mats on Amazon. They are of high quality and durability. The price from Amazon is much lower than other brands. I always prepare the mats before grilling with a canola oil spray to keep food from sticking to the mats. They work great! Food cooks evenly, the mats prevent grease or food from dripping or falling inside of my grill (which means no flare-ups), and the mats are easy to remove after cooling for cleaning. I can't recommend them enough!",

I liked the grill-marks on the steaks and everybody complimented me about the great taste. Cleaning was as easy as 1-2-3 as this is a real non-stick and no residue was left on the mat. I also liked the fact that you get more than a single sheet, as I was able to cover the entire lower grate of my weber (I have a big grill for a big family). Very well done (pun intended) and a strong 5 stars!",

Maybe for baking it would be fine, but think about this, when your grilling like, hamburgers, or anything greasy, the grease from cooking burns off or drops to the bottom of the grill. Well, with the Copper Grill Mats, the grease lays on the mats and therefore you are cooking in grease. I will not use them again for grilling but maybe in the oven for baking.
