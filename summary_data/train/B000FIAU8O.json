It has 2 internal elastic bands to secure some items as well as an internal mesh elastic pouch on the inside of the flap you open, and one attachment point for the rear light. It also has 2 elastic bands to secure something on the bottom side. Overall well constructed. Seems pretty light weight for its heavy constructed material. Zippers are well built. I would buy it again. And for this price beats anything locally I could find in this size and construction/function.",

      "text": "I got the large bag. This bag is the best under seat bag I've seen. I have a couple of other seat bags that are smaller and work well, but I needed something larger. This bag just happens to be the perfect size. It fits like it was designed for my bike seat. It has enough room below the seat post strap to mount my clip-on fender with no problem. The nexus clips look like they are high quality, and the rest of the bag looks very well made. The rear mount for the tail light is well stitched and strong. I am very happy with this purchase.",

The bag has clasps that tighten instead of just Velcro. That keeps tight up against my seat and keeps it from rattling or moving. Love the Topeak bags they make a great product.",

I'm now in the process of buying another one of these to replace the cheap one. This bag is worth the money and will hold a lot of bike stuff during rides. Most importantly (to me at least) the straps that attach the bag to the bike seat hold it nice and tight so there is little to no movement of the bag during riding. I ride in Arizona so can't speak to its water resistance.",

I use mine strictly for mountain biking having for less than a year and a half and about 1,600 miles of riding. One of the straps broke once but my wife was able to sew it back together. Last night though when trying to get into it the zipper came apart. After some work with a screwdriver and pliers I was able to get it functioning again but I don't expect it to last long. Will probably buy another one though because it fits everything I need on the trail, is water proof and tucks nicely under the seat.",

I've put sunglasses in here when needed, and the option to expand it an inch or so has definitely come in handy. It is very stable and does not flop around.",

Whilst I don't think it's water proof, you could always keep a plastic bag inside of it to store any of your sensitive goods in case it starts to rain while you're out on a ride. I would definitely recommend this product if you like to ride and need something to hold all your essentials (wallet, keys, phone, etc.)",
