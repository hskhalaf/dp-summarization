We have it set to 46 degrees and it is at 70 degrees.It's actually warmer in the upper compartment than it is in our house so we're just putting our white wine on the counter instead of this refrigerator.",

In less than a year the bottom fridge breaks and now I have to take my wine out and chill it somewhere else. I messaged them hoping to get a new one soon. This should be under warranty. After a couple of days after emailing customer service, they said that they will replace it. I hope that The new one will last longer than a year. 3 stars for now due to their customer service. Hopefully the new one can last longer than a couple of years.",

I liked this wine fridge when I purchased it - it's fairly small/sleek and did a decent job - until it didn't. I have had it for just over 1 year and the top half stopped working. I contacted customer service who couldn't help me since it had been past a year. For this price, I think a small wine fridge should work for much longer than 1 year. Pretty disappointed, I would suggest spending your money elsewhere.",

I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a replacement for their countertop wine chiller-especially from this distributor as it was a terrific price delivered quite promptly. The exact model can be had elsewhere on the \u2018Net with a much higher price and slower delivery time..",
