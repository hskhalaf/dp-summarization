I'm seeing pictures and reviews showing slumped tents and the darn guy line cords are still wrapped up and not used. TIE THOSE BABIES DOWN!

I'd say a realistic number is like 6 people, although we used it for 4 and it was very comfortable. Setup was super easy, even for an inexperienced camper like myself. I didnt really need to read directions, it was self-explanatory. Having an extra hand to help set it up helped a LOT but I dont think it would be impossible to setup on your own. I was able to break it down all on my own. For the size it's pretty compact when all folded up. Def would recommend",

This tent did really well on a camping trip with three days of non-stop rain, it wasn't bone dry, the walls were wet to the touch, but the bedding and clothes remained dry. The tent is easy to put up, when you follow the directions. The directions are stitched in the tent bag and on the tent hub. I would recommend it to a friend. Improvements to the tent: a covered entrance way for when it is raining an access hole for an extension cord hooks or nylon loops on the ceiling to hang lights and stuff",

The big problem is taking it down, getting it rolled up and back into the bag. It takes forever and you really have to mash the fragile components together. Considering this difficulty, the average set-up / take-down is longer then much less expensive (non-instant) tents. Combine this issue with the facts that the tent is not waterproof and has a very high price and I have conclude that Coleman rushed a poor design to market. I\u2019ll probably keep this tent but my next one will be waterproof, non-instant, and half the price.",

      "text": "DISASTER!!! On the third use FAILURE. One of the leg hinges broke for NO GOOD REASON. I never beat it up, threw it around, or forced anything. And there was no good way to rig it. I ended up hanging the broken leg over the frame of someone else's tent just to be able to use the tent for the weekend (since I was 6 hours from home). DISASTER!!!! Also, in the rain, when you unzip the doors, water floods in, even with the rain fly. It is because the walls of the tent lean in from bottom to top. So as water sheds, if your door is open, it sheds inside. Big design flaw. Returning to Coleman.",

There are ground stake loops underneath where the zippers meet. Put those in and one hand unzipping is no problem. Another complaint was that the window flaps don't tie-down and don't roll down all the way. All you need to do is roll the flaps up and tuck them into the screen-facing pocket. No tie-downs needed. I still need to camp in it to give further feedback but I'm super impressed with this tent. Looking forward to many years of use.",
