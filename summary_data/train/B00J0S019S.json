If you were going to the beach or on a hike, this pack would be great, but for amusement parks, just a bit too bulky. Amazon returned item with no problems.",

The last one barely made it 4 months. One zipper would break on the main pocket and I'd just use the other zipper for a bit, but not long after, it would fail also. I would not overload it, usually a couple of 32 oz. water bottles and lunch/snacks for the day. Your mileage may vary. Loved it while new, but the zipper failing issue is enough for me not to recommend.",

This cooler worked fantastic when I first got it. I used it from February to March and it never leaked. I put it away and then I took it out again for the summer and it\u2019s a disaster all it does is leak all over the place. I\u2019m not sure what happened and why it\u2019s leaking all of a sudden but I am very disappointed in this cooler at this point because the bottom is soaking wet Will not hold the amount of cans specified with ice.",

On the downside - it's described as holding 28 cans - 18-20 is more realistic, especially if you want to add ice.. And if you pour ice in over the top, the zippers are not waterproof, so eventually, as ice melts, it leaks out the zippers. Better design would be to have a shorter zipper just across the top. Otherwise use sealed, re-freezable packaging ice, or put ice cubes in zip-lock bags. Overall, decent value.",
