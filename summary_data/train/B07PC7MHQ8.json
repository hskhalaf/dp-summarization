Additionally, it seems hard to maintain a consistent quality of coffee from pot to pot. The $80 pot that I replaced did a much better job!",

We primarily use the glass carafe for everyday use and the single brewer for evening pleasures. I guess they put all their research into single serving brewers and have not worked so hard on the normal coffee maker part. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't buy this model.",

I have no confidence that this coffee maker will last a long time, the buttons will one day stick, and refuse to pop us, and that will be that. We have technology for very good buttons. Keurig has cut corners, but not the price. This was NOT cheap to buy, but evidently was cheap to make. Shame on you Keurig.",

Very frustrating after we have used keurig brand for years without trouble. I think they should stick to making single serve machines because the duo is an epic fail. Also you cant even register the Duo warranty on Keurigs website, they only give the option for their single serve machines. I would definately not recommend this product.",

If there is a down side it's the reservoir is too small if you do a brew and then want a K-cup. Not a big deal but worth pointing out. We have had this for about a month now and it has met our expectations and performed flaulessly.",

You hear the pump working but water reservoir hasn't dropped although i did eventually get around a half of a teaspoon amount to finally dispense. This is probably the worst keurig I've owned",

That\u2019s just poor design and others who own this product have stated similar issue. Also a larger water reservoir would be nice but that\u2019s not a limiting factor for my 3 star rating.",

Only concern is when you turn on the delayed brew option on the pot it heats up the water right then for some reason though it does wait to brew until the programmed time. First few times I was concerned I had not done it right. But it works perfectly. Would recommend this pot for anyone who wants the flexibility this provides.",

Con: The motor noise is pretty annoying but I guess its not all that bad. Also, the water reservoir could have been bigger but I usually only have to fill it more than once a day if I have friends or family over. Overall impression: Great buy",
