A few times I pulled a few things out of the bag and each time I sorta used it as a floating device. It holds air tightly and keeps water out perfectly. This is great even for a festival backpack as it only has one opening so it's nice and secure. Cons::. None! Overall::. Great backpack. It unfolds super tall but when you do 4-5 rolls it makes it small and good looking. I would buy this again.",

The color is perfect, the back pack straps are comfortable, have tried this in mild/moderate rain. None of my belongings on inside bag were wet. When you open box your bag will folded into another plastic bag. I actually kept for another dry storage. See pix below for better understanding. Decent price for any size of these bags.",

Four hours on the river and my phone was completely dry at the end of the trip. My phone was submerged a lot of the time too. One of the best purchases Ive bought so far for our tubing adventures!",

It was nice not to worry about the bottom third getting wet at all, and because it floats on the water, helped take the load off my shoulders, which was nice for a 7-mile hike.",

Its a silly and unrealistic test. when would you ever have your bag submerged in 3ft+ of water for more than a few seconds. Trapping some air in the bag when closing it should help to make the bag float quite nicely until you can retrieve it, depending on the weight of its contents. I took this bag on a 16mile kayak trip where it sat in 2in of water for about 6 hrs and was splashed quite a bit. It kept my camera gear dry as a bone and I was never the least bit concerned.",

But this bag will fit everything else you need to put in it; sleeping bags, towels, clothing...no problem. This bag is very well made, heavy duty, rubberized material and should hold up great for repeated uses in the kayak. When rolled up tight and squeezed, it doesnt let any air out, or if so, its to slow to be noticeable, so it should be very waterproof. Great product.",

I particularly like the phone case that comes with the dry bag. Great idea and several people noticed it hanging around my neck and asked where I got it. And just in case you are wondering, my phone stayed dry too. Thank you and I will continue to use these items on upcoming kayak trips.",

Maybe condensation? Maybe a towel was damp? A small drip leak somewhere? Many factors but I just can pull myself to commit my camera equipment into it for now... I\u2019m returning it but will eventually give it another try. Have a huge fishing trip planned this weekend with rain everyday in the forecast so I\u2019m pretty bummed!

You can't pack a lot in a 10L. I had confidence to purchase a second bag for a friend who needs a Go Bag for emergencies and purchased the 20L.
