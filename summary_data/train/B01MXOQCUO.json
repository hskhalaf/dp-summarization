Dropped the water by about 1/4 cup from the recommended amount. Not soupy at all on the first try (as some of them can be until you get the balance right). Texture, taste, and heartiness were solid. Spice was present, but not strong. This and the biscuits and gravy are now my go to for hot breakfasts on the trail!",

I use these for camping but it's good to have some extra MH in the pantry, just in case of an emergency",
