    "title": "MINILOP 3-in-1 Soil Tester Kits, Moisture Soil Meter Sensor, Sunlight PH and Acidity Tester for Lawn Garden Plant Farm Indoor and Outdoor (No Battery Needed) (Purple)",
    "description": "Plant growth and vigor are often dependent on soil moisture, pH and sunlight. This 3 in 1 soil tester determines whether your soil is acidic, neutral or alkaline, by using it, you can know when to water, control PH level, also indicates which elements are missing from your soil and how much to add to remedy the problem.\nThis soil meter is great ideal tool to help provide a healthy growing environment for all plants. It has 3 functions in one meter - it measures soil moisture levels, light levels and PH levels. Easy to use, just insert into the earth and read.\n\nSpecifications \n\npH Range: 3.5-8 Ph (3.5-6.5 ACID, 7 NOR, 7-8 ALKALI)\nMoisture Range: 1-10 (1-3 DRY, 4-7 NOR, 8-10 WET)\nRelative Light: 0-2000 lux (0-200 LOW, 200-500LOW+, 500-1000 NOR 1000-2000 HGH)\n\nUSE INSTRUCTION: Step 1: Switch moisture/ pH/ light position.\nStep 2: Inset the probe of the meter to the plants' roots about 2-4 inches.\nStep 3: Adjust the position of the probe until the pointer on the dial swing slightly.\nStep 4: After 10 minutes, note moisture/ pH/ light level in the dial.\nStep 5: Remove probe from soil and wipe clean after each use\n\nImportant Tips: \n1. Do not touch the stone or hard rock soil, if the soil is too hard and dry, easy to damage the probes. Copper and Aluminum itself does not belong to the hard material, so if the soil is too dry and hard to insert, you can use auxiliary agricultural tools drill hole and then insert.\n2. Design for testing soil ONLY. Do not be used to test pure water or other liquid, electrolytic response index will be affected, can only be used to measure the soil.\n3. After using, need to clean and wipe the probes. Don't be inserted in the soil for a long time while using.",
