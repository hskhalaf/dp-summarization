The firebox could only be attached on one side because the other side is bent. Because the screws are short and the wood crumbling, even glue doesn't hold them in place.

The only issue I have with it is that it's a little difficult to find gel fuel in the right size can, but with all three burning it creates quite a bit of heat with almost no odor! Putting it together was really easy and do yourself a favor and take the allen wrench and cut it to be able to put it into a drill. Saved a lot of time on piecing it together@!",
