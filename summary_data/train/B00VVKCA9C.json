I have purchashed a Roku device for a seperate tv in my househould and it has a much faster user interface. I feel like Roku is taking on the same marketing strategy as Apple does, with slowing downing older moddles to make consumers purchase the updated model. If you're looking to purchase thise item in 2019-2020, I'd definitely look for a newer model.",

They asked me to speak with the manufacturer, who had me run the set through a series of tests. When those didn't solve the problem, Amazon agreed to swap the set for another one.

The USB slot and the A/V jacks are mounted on the side where you can reach them, but the HDMI slots are in a weird place on the back where you can't.

      "text": "Beware of mounting hole pattern! It claims to be VESA 200*150 and there is really no such thing. TCL Customer service told me this is a \"known issue\" and it is being \"escalated\" but all she could say was \"sorry\". They did answer the phone quickly, I guess that's something. I think \"rigging\" it will be less hassle than sending it back. Only got it yesterday, so can't say much more about it. I like the picture and Roku interface. Love having the Roku and volume on same remote. If you're not ever going to mount it, or you're prepared for some extra hassle I'd say it's a dandy for the price.",

      "text": "when it worked, it was great. The visual quality was good. The sound was ok. But I paid $300 for this tv to work for a year and half. It started not connecting to the Internet. I then tried to call their support team, they blamed my internet even though every other device in the house worked. Just disappointed. I tried to use a blu Ray DVD player but the tv would turn off and on a lot. Waste of money.",
