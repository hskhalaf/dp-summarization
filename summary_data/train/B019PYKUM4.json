Materials used are of good quality, there's a lot of customisation possible but the mount won't stick to anything - be it wood, metal, plastic or glass. At first I thought that maybe I'm using it wrong. But it turns out it's not the case. See the video comparison to the GoPro mount that I ended up buying. Maybe I'm just unlucky, but I bet things like that don't happen with the original mounts.",
