The packaging is beautiful: the bath bombs are individually wrapped and labelled with their scent of theme (like \"lavender and vanilla\" or \"love\") and they come in a pretty and durable box. Even without the packaging, I would recommend buying these: the scents are so strong and so lovely. I can smell them outside of our bathroom into our upstairs hallway. I have used one of the bath bombs so far, and it fizzed up really nicely. They're also a smaller size (at least compared to bath bombs from, say, Lush), but they still fill up and color the whole bath nicely, and they did not stain the tub. Totally recommend!",

I had an Amazon gift card and am going through grief and wanted some comfort measures at home during the Corona Virus quarantine in Oregon. So based on reviews and Made in California details, I ordered this gift box for myself. They are very fragrant upon opening which I like (my master bathroom smells like a spa) but too much for one of my daughters with sensitivities. Just bear that in mind. I have used one and it was wonderful. I smelled floral the next day. I highly recommend.",

She's used 2 of the bath bombs so far & hasn't had any trouble with irritation down stairs. My daughter loves the pretty bombs with the glitters & flowers. The fragrances are light enough to be age-appropriate but they do lightly linger on her skin & she still smells pretty the morning after a bath.",

As someone who has sensitive skin these are a great purchase. I will definitely be buying more soon. Also, be sure to clean your tub after using this product. The residue isn't as bad as other brands but to be on the safe side I would suggest cleaning the tub after using. It washes off fairly easy. No scrubbing needed. The box they come in looks professional yet cute! Vibrant coloring and amazing smells. Give them a try!",

That left a yellow residue around the liner that had to be hand washed away. It did wash off though. Overall, we will happily buy again (and did)!",

      "text": "I bought these as a gift for the wife. She has only used a few so far. She reports they were packaged well so none were damaged. These are smaller bombs but still lots of fizzing and colors that did not discolor the tub. She loved the smells. The rose bomb had small bits of a rose bud and the mango bomb had bits of what we assume was mango in it. I guess this helps with the fragrances. She said they were very relaxing loved the way they made her skin feel. We will purchase again!",

After one use, my skin feels very soft, without putting on lotion after and the strength of the scent was perfect...just enough to enjoy, not so much that my allergies were triggered.
