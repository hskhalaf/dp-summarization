Apparently, you can't replace the flimsy remote. Would not recommend.",

Also, one time, the volume went to full on its own and was making static sounds. Overall, I wanted to like this sound bar, but too many small issues, so it had to go back.",

    "title": "Q Acoustics Media 4 Soundbar with Built In Subwoofer - Black",
    "description": "Using twin 65mm BMR (Balanced Mode Radiator) drive units, the Media 4 gives pinpoint accuracy and is bursting with detail right up to high volume levels. BMR technology combines the advantages of both flat panel and conventional speakers. This means that, unlike some soundbars, the M4 is truly dynamic and won't turn harsh or brittle when the music or film action gets intense. Another key advantage of BMR speakers is the superb spatial imaging they offer. Compared with conventional drive units, they provide a broad and spacious sound that comes right out 'into' the room. Rather than using a separate subwoofer, Q Acoustics have elected to build the subwoofer into the main casing. This obviously makes for a neater overall package and less wiring. Using a dedicated 150mm x 120mm drive unit, plus its own 50 watt amplifier, the M4 has little trouble in reproducing deep, powerful movie soundtracks. Using NFC or Bluetooth technology, you can connect up just about any smartphone, tablet or newer laptop, Mac or PC and stream your music. With compatible NFC devices, simply hold the unit next to the top of the soundbar and you're good to stream. With Bluetooth you pair your device with the soundbar. Once done, you'll be able to stream music from your stored library or from streaming music services such as Spotify or Last.fm. Coming with both detachable feet and a wall bracket, you can choose how to place your M4 soundbar. Once positioned, connection is easy, too. Choose between an optical digital lead (ideal for most TVs), or RCA phono or 3.5mm analogue inputs.\n\n\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n1 x Q Acoustics Media 4\n1 x Lithium Battery (3V, CR2025)\n1 x Remote Control\n1 x UK AC Mains Cable\n1 x EU AC Mains Cable\n1 x RCA Phono Lead (2 metres)\n1 x 3.5mm Jack Lead (2 metres)\n1 x Optical Lead (2 metres)\n1 x Wall Mounting Plate\n3 x Anti-vibration Feet with 6 x Screws\n1 x User Manual",
