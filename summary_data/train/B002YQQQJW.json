The only thing I didn't like about them is the lid sometimes wouldn't tighten all the way and would come off.

I like the screw on lids because no leaks have occurred despite being knocked around in a diaper bag. Update 9-11-12 I am now reheating in the containers. Reheating has been easy and no worries on staining or morphing the container. I do recommend this particular baby food container to anyone considering making their own food. Durable and useful.",

After using them I ordered two more! I loved the fact I could fill the containers and neatly stack them in the freezer. I don't have to worry about the lids popping off in the diaper bag, or about bags full of \"ice cubes\" falling out or sticking together. I bought small removal labels to write on the contents and the date. All I have to do is pull a container out and let it defrost. They are easy to clean.",

You just fill to the 1 cup line of the container and divide the food. Overall all the Fresh and Freeze set it is a decent product- just don't buy the labels that Step Ahead adversite - those are a waste of money.",

If lid comes off when you take a container out of freezer you can't seal again until it defrost. So sometimes I feed baby something other than my first choice. Other than that it's my favorite item I've purchased to feed baby! (only thing I love more is my beaba baby cook)",

The little tray will fit perfectly on the freezer shelf or door and not take up much space. Excellent little system for managing homemade baby food!",

My only complaint is that when you freeze them, they do not properly click together and occasionally the lid will pop off. The snapping together was a fun accessory but not important to me, however the lid must stay on. I've learned to flatten out any food that you plan to freeze so that the lid does not pop off. Also make sure to not fill past the 2 oz. line or the same happens. All in all, I really LOVE these!",

One down side is that you really need to press the containers into the base for them to snap on. It hurts the palms a bit from the pressure.Other then that one little flaw, it's great! It attached easily to other containers and it does stay locked.",

They are a pain to fill too b/c they're so tiny, so I lay down a flour sack b/c it gets messy. I've switched to the small rubbermaid containers w/ the reddish lid. They do everything this does (stack, don't leak, etc.) but they're an actual serving size. The opening is bigger and easier (mess-free) to fill. I also like that I can snap the lid on the rubbermaid ones, right out of the dishwasher, so I'm not always looking for lids as I am with these.",
