From what I see, I would have to exchange the whole set which would be a pain because I have already seasoned the humidor and have my sticks stored in it. The humidor itself works great though and I am very pleased with it. I guess I'll just keep the lighter out as a decorative show piece.",

I was hesitant to buy one of these on Amazon, thinking that it wouldn't be as nice as one from a cigar store. I was wrong! This box is beautiful! And it was literally a fraction of the price the cigar store was charging. I am super happy with my purchase and so is my boyfriend!",
