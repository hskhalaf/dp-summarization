      "text": "Third time is the charm! After 3 tries, I finally found a life vest that fits correctly. When sizing this item, go by the measurements in the pictures, NOT the measurements typed in the description. For reference, my 5lb Pomeranian with a neck measurement of 9\", a chest measurement of 13\", and a back measurement of 9\" fits perfectly in an XS. I like that even the smaller size on these have the double chest/belly strap to provide extra support in case a quick pickup is needed and the reflective strips work very well. My dog also doesn't seem to mind wearing this at all, she was bouncing around happily from the moment I put it on her.",

The reviews I've read that comment on wrong sizing the reviewer only mentions the weight of their dog. The chart clearly mentions measureing the chest. For dogs with a broad chest, such as pit bulls, this is more important then their weight.",

Not sure if the sizing is different for different colors or what, but there was a massive discrepancy between the two. I have ordered pet life jackets from other companies and had no sizing issues. I realize the fit will not be perfect, but the difference between these two seemed a bit extreme.....",
