I used to spend so much time washing and drying mittens and gloves inside out to get rid of the smell (boys are stinky) and then trying to get them turned right side out again - such a pain! Now we come in and throw everything on the dryer - its FANTASTIC!!!!!! I wasn't crazy about spending $48 on a glove dryer, but now knowing how awesome and convenient it is I am recommending it to everyone!",

      "text": "I bought this to dry out my surf booties and gloves in my garage. It definitely does the job but it takes a while, usually I have to run it for 4-6 hours with the heat on to fully dry them. That\u2019s usually after I let them drip dry for 8-12 hours. I wish the fan was a little more powerful, then it would probably dry a lot faster. Overall, this is a good product and it keeps my gloves and booties from stinking up the house, which my wife certainly appreciates :)",

I first used the unit in the kitchen but had to take it downstairs because the sound bothered my wife while she was trying to watch TV in the living room. (There is no wall separating our kitchen and living room.) I do think that it is somewhat overpriced which is why I gave it only 4 stars. All things considered, I would buy it again.",
