I bought a chair from them and I had it over a year or two and it's held up really well. This couch is a little firm but that just means it's going to last forever . It's still really comfortable. I love the pullout bed And I love that I now have a ton of room for storage under the chaise lounge (bigger than it looks). This is a great couch.",

We have fun with the \"bed\" part out so that we (3 adult sized peeps) all have a chaise lounge to sit on with plenty of room between us while we watch movies together. The dog has room to climb on too. Pass the popcorn!",

I have slept on it every night and although on the firm side I am not uncomfortable at all. Very pretty color too. It arrived early which I was happy with since I was so excited to get it. So convenient to open and have an extra place to sleep. Very easy to put together too. Took a total of about 15 minutes. Don't hesitate if your on the fence about this one.",

It arrived late, and on the box it clearly says 99\" long. I do not have 99\" for a couch. I'm extremely disappointed, and had to remove an arm to make it fit. Also not true to color, it's more of a dark grey... Otherwise, we do love the functions and comfort of the couch.",
