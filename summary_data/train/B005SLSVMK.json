It has a crisp ginger bite, not too strong, but bold enough to taste the quality. A little heat sticks on the tonge after each swallow. For my taste, the sweetness is just right. Not like a soft drink, more of a perfect counter to the ginger bite. I use this product as a kind of medicine but it has a taste and qualities that make it enjoyable anytime.",

Beverages seem to hold their flavors better and seem colder when in glass bottles. In fact, the bottles are so pretty, I am trying to figure out how to upcycle them into something useful. CONS: 1. The price. 2. A non-twist cap, which makes it more difficult to upcycle the bottles.",

The ginger beer as a mixer is not too sweet or overpowering in your drink, making for a great flavor combination with whatever you mix. The ginger flavor is excellent, even on its own this tastes high quality. The ginger beer is the right amount of fizzy and doesn't bubble up causing your glass to overflow, either. I've been using Fever Tree almost exclusively to make Moscow mules and other grocery store ginger beers don't even come close to this one. The bottles also have a twist top, but I don't think you'll be leaving any behind!",

Through and through this tastes like ginger and even has that \"bite\" on the tongue that you get when you have real ginger. I had it for the first time on a recent trip to the UK and promptly ordered a bunch when I returned home, because now Canada Dry or Schweppes seem just sad by comparison.

      "title": "This is what GINGER BEER is suppose to taste like",
      "text": "I have drank ginger beer for years. Most of the stuff being sold for ginger beer relys on a high content of sugar and carbonation. That makes for a sugary drink Fever Tree brand is what good ginger beer tastes like Great taste, natural flavor with no carbonation and less sugar (20g) than most brands, allowing for a strong crisp naturlly ginger flavored drink. Superior in flavor to Barrs, and DG brands. The 16 ounce bottles are the perfect size. By comparison the rest are just overly sweetened ginger flavored sugar water. Always check the sugar content, anything over 30gs is too much sugar.",

The zing at the end of each sip (either by itself, or in your Dark and Stormy, or Moscow Mule) is amazing. The carbonation is nice as well, and adds to the quality of your drink. There is a lower sugar version available (only in 16.9floz, not the 6.8floz), which has the same zing, but with lower sugar (only 48 calories per serving!)",

Not only does this stuff taste great right out of the bottle, it's a wonderful mixer with rum, gin and vodka. Plus you get the added benefit of ginger's digestive perks. I drink ginger beer to calm an upset stomach and aid in digestion. I LOVE the real ginger bite too. I learned that ginger beer usually means real ginger and ginger ale is usually ginger flavored carbonated water. I will always choose the real ginger beer. I think this will be stocked in my fridge for long time.",

They now have a larger bottle!! and they've created a \"light\" brand for the watered down (probably off the top of the still) version.

    "description": "Flavor Name:Original| Size:16.9 Fl Oz (Pack of 8)A distinct, fresh ginger taste predominates. It is refreshing and clean-tasting without being overly sweet. As the liquid passes through the palate, the ginger will fill the whole mouth, leaving a warmth at the back of the throat. To achieve the fiery, full-bodied taste of our Ginger Beer, we selected three types of ginger for their complementary, yet distinctive, flavor profiles. From Cochin in India, we source a variety that lends a rich and earthy, almost chocolatey, flavor. From the Ivory Coast, we get a fresh green ginger that has an incredible lemongrass freshness. Finally, our Nigerian ginger brings a deep, intense flavor to the blend. As well as pressing the plant to extract the oils, we macerate the roots and steep them to release the stronger, more typical ginger flavors.",
