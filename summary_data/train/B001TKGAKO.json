We set it up either in the trailer at night or outside in our shower tent. We use with the Waag bags, so there is no smell or mess. Just fold up the bag in the morning and toss it out with the trash. I highly recommend this system.",

I bought numerous \"bucket\" type & folding portable toilets but couldn't find anything that was big enough to accommodate \"Man parts\" if you know what I mean. They all work well for woman but we all know it's different for men, this is why regular toilets for men have elongated seats. This toilet isn't quite the same as a house toilet, but it comes close. Can also be used as a regular seat with the lid down & folds up to about the size of a larger attache case. Great for vehicle camping!",

I used this when camping out in Colorado when the nearest gas station/convenience store was only a few minutes away because 1. I hate public restrooms that EVERYONE camping would also be using and 2. I couldn\u2019t wait. So I popped this thing out, got in my privacy tent and had the most zen waste eliminating experience of my life right there in the middle of the San Juan national forest.",

That is easily fixed by inverting the unit on a table and shaving the tabs with a box cutter. First, fold the legs back down and shave some off the upper edge of the plastic tabs (towards you). Open and close the legs again and shave some more, and repeat until you can release the tabs with moderate force. You don\u2019t want the legs to collapse in use, but you don\u2019t want to injure your thumbs either trying to fold the legs back down.",

We are in week 2 now and this portable toilet has been extraordinarily useful. We have access to a public porta-potty outside our residence close to the street, but this portable toilet is in the garage where I can take the kiddos for those middle of the night visits. It's clean, sturdy, the cleanup is super easy, and assembling the powder in the bags is a snap.",
