      "text": "I bought this about a year ago. Had a heavy duty light for about 25 years that I had thrown away thinking I would not ever need a timing light. Ended up getting a classic car, so I looked for a good light. This one got pretty good reviews so I bought it. Used it maybe 5 times over the course of the year. Not ever dropped, mistreated or mishandled. Started smoking and stopped working. Went into the trash bin. Too flimsy for me, even as a shade tree mechanic. Will not repurchase this or any Innova product. I'm moving on.",

I have new wires, new plugs, new cap and actually a whole new engine. It seems that the pickup doesn't grip the wire (8mm) tight enough to get a solid signal. If I use one hand and twist the pickup on the wire, it works much better but I need both hands for other adjustments. I have tried to use it several times with the same results. If I could clear up this issue, I'd give it 10 stars.",

Make sure all wires are safely away from moving parts. I used cable ties to avoid the fan and the a/c compressor. The green tach/coil wire has to go along way across the engine on my car so I was cautious. There are YouTube videos to help you understand the tool.",

      "text": "Timing light works as it should and feels pretty sturdy, well made. Included instructions are clear and easy to follow (not that it's too hard to use). Having the embedded tachometer is really helpful for setting idle after adjusting the timing. Only complaint: I wish it came with a case.",

I called tech support and they said of course they could fix it but since it was longer than a year since I bought it I would need to pay $69.99 for the repair. I only use it 2or 3 times and it broke that quickly, disappointed in product and warranty.",

      "text": "I have recently completed a restoration of my 1980 MGB, which I have owned for 27 years. I did most of the work myself but had a service shop \"professionally\" set the ignition timing and do other things at a cost $$$. Although the B ran well at idle, I was convinced that its timing was out and causing a lack of power and overheating. I bought the Innova 5568 to reset the timing myself. The Innova is nicely made, easy to use and the instruction booklet is explicit. Very pleased with this purchase - the only hassle is the B's battery sits behind the driver's seat and so I had to make a plan with the power connection.",
