      "text": "So far this is my favorite concealer the past month. It is very light, I have not felt cakey while using it. It blends in really well and doesn't settle in the fine lines around my eyes. Stays on very well throughout the day. I am crazy in love with the big brush it comes with - its a lot more fluid than shape tape -- very silky going on and it stays!!",
