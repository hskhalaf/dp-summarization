This product is poorly geometrically designed, the plastic cover is not correctly aligned and obstructs the view which will result in more impact over the safety it provides, without it the view is better. The stitching is poorly made and the padding will leave you concussed really easy as you can feel absolutely no difference. This is not a proper way to create a head guard. Sorry, please do more investigating. I'd rather get hit by bare knuckles then have a swollen brain.",

The fit was also off for me, it didn't fit well in the front, the chin didn't touch the front of the headgear. I also agree with what a few others noted, cleaning the inside of the headgear would be difficult because it has a fabric lining. Paid shipping to return the item because it just wasn't worth keeping; I'd rather pay more for an alternative piece of gear.",

This head gear provides that for me. I won't complain about the obstructed peripheral since I can't see as much as I used to anyway. But all in all it is a great product. My only complaint is I wish there was some sort of chin strap.",

It should only be used as protection. It doesn't make you invisible. One disadvantage is it cuts off some of your field of view. I get hit with hooks and body shots because sometimes I can't see the punch coming. I still recommend this product. Good job RDX!",
