I ordered the complete set with gauge blocks, switch, inserts, and feather boards, every piece is solid and works excellent. If you are in the market for a bench top router table take a look at this Kreg, it will not disappoint.",

However, it gives you guide dots to help with the accuracy. I am very happy with this benchtop version of a routing table and hope to get lots of use from it.",

      "text": "The Kreg benchtop router table is well designed and well built EXCEPT for the 1/4 turn lock handles that come with this model. Other versions of this model (as seen on assembly videos, etc.) have lock handles that are knobs or clamps and both seem to be a better design than the small handles that came with this table. I contacted customer service at Kreg to see if I could order a different version of the handles, but they were less than helpful. I can definitely rig something up that will be better than what Kreg provided, but that shouldn't be necessary for a well-regarded brand such as Kreg.",

    "description": "Style:Router Table Kit\n\nTake true precision routing wherever you go with a Kreg Benchtop Router Table System. This special product bundle includes the Precision Benchtop Router Table PLUS popular Kreg Routing Accessories. Includes Router Table Switch, Featherboard Twin-Pack, Level-Loc Reducing Rings, and Precision Setup Bars.\n\nKreg PRS2100 Bench Top Router Table\n\nKreg's freshly redesigned Precision Bench top Router Table now offers even more features that give it the capability of a full-size, industrial router table in a portable package. Whether you want a router table to use on a job site or compact router table to use in the shop, the Precision Bench top Router Table is a perfect routing solution for you. This table was built to withstand years of use and abuse on the jobsite. It features a rugged stamped-steel foundation, four hard-wearing rubber feet, a professionally edge banded table-top with an impact resistant Micro-dot surface, and an incredibly rigid aluminum fence, all built with mobile professionals in mind. During development Kreg found the majority of noise produced by bench top router tables was caused by vibrations traveling through the body of the table, and that much of this noise could be stifled by using the proper design and materials. By combining a noise-absorbing MDF table top with a rigid steel base and vibration-dampening rubber feet, our Precision Bench top Router Table is incredibly quiet, and actually tests quieter than most enclosed router tables.\n\nBundle Includes:\n\n * Kreg PRS2100 Bench Top Router Table\n * Kreg PRS3020 True-FLEX Featherboard, Pack of 2\n * Kreg PRS3100 Multi Purpose Router Table Switch\n * Kreg PRS3400 Precision Router Table Set Up Bars, Set of 7\n * Kreg PRS3050 Twist-Loc Ring Set, 5-Piece",
