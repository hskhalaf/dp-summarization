Only problem I have run into thus far, the design requires you to fill the container to the absolute top, which thereby makes it impossible to get into the freezer without making a mess. Two options I am toying with. . .filling it on a small baking tray for stability, or you have to clear space and 'top it off' once already in the freezer. If not filled to brim with water, the bottom melts out rather quickly...real quick actually with room temperature tequila, lol!",

Mints can be put in whole but you gotta alternate which molds you use and wait till they melt a bit and form before you can load of the others.
