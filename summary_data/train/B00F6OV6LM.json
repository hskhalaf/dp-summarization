But what absolutely kills these headphones is the sound leakage. You can't turn the volume up past about a \"3\" before anyone with five feet of you can hear everything coming out of the phones. Even if these were the absolute best sounding cans with the best active noise cancelling available, the leakage is unacceptable and is deal-breaker. There is no way these are usable on an airplane without disturbing other passengers. These are being returned to Amazon.",

Leakage out of the earcups is substantial and I wouldn't recommend them for environments that require no bleed. The controls are not very intuitive and although they seem fairly substantial and built well the design is too over the top. I ended up with the Paww soundwave 3 ($20 more) but way better in my opinion. They are a bit heavier but sound great and isolate much better. Non compensated review.",

Really like that it works via bluetooth or aux cord. The battery life is very long so I forget to charge it, having the additional aux option prevents the long wait for the recharge.",

I returned them to get the sony md1r's they are a over ear that is much more comfortable aswell as equal or better sound quality. although they are only offered with either bluetooth or nc not both together. however i am happy now with my nc sony head phones also these headphones like most on or over ear do get hot after a bit.",

I would have given it a 5 star except for the fact that the noise-cancelling works too well. Yes I said too well. Just when you think you have let off a silent one, to your horror and embarrassment you realize it was loud enough for everyone to hear it , except yourself.",
