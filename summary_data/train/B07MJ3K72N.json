They run a little large and the zipper to help get in and out of them really belongs on the inner ankle of the shoe instead of the outer ankle. I have UGG leather work boots from a few years ago with the inner ankle zipper and that zipper works much better and is not as awkward as the one on these sneakers. Other than zipper problem, I like them.",

I fell in love with this pair on UGG's website, however they sold out of my size fairly fast before I could place my order!! Ladies, these shoes are perfect!!",
