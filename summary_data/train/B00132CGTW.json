The tips have not rounded and all the ball ends are in perfect shape after a month of heavy use. I will update if anything changes but so far they are a must have for me.",

Half the frustration is finding what size you need and Bondhus organizes everything in a nice holder you can carry anywhere. I love how it has a standard end and ball end for tight areas. Yes you should not break the fastener with the ball end, only use it to thread it out once it is broke loose by the standard end. My only complaint is the set is missing 7mm and 9mm which honestly are odd sizes. Other than that I love this set. Buy it and you will cherish it for many years to come.",

It does get a little marred with some serious(and i mean serious) use but I think these will stay rust free for many years with zero maintenance or care. Absolutely no buyers remorse with this set, they look great, are very easy to find when you inevitably put one down and immediately forget where you put it, and give you the confidence to really torque on bolts.",

I am happy with this purchase. The longer end has a nice rounded hex to fit in tighter spots and it is also good for more leverage. My only complaint is that the more you use them the more the case, though it is solid and durable, it tends to round the holes and make the wrenches swivel in place leaving the smaller ones open to bend, although mine have not done so yet. Just a concern. But the case is great: tough and strong and keeps them together well, minus the swiveling.",

Anyways, so I took the 3/8 inch one and whacked it against the narrow edge of an older craftsman wrench, that was made in USA. It put a dent into the wrench. I may try it on a proto or snap on soon.",

It's not worth the trouble to send them back, but I would get more expensive allen wrenches if I were doing it again.",
