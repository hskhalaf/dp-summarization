The spring that they used is entirely too strong. I am a plenty strong man and it was extremely difficult to press the lever. All they had to do was use a weaker spring. I took the mechanism apart on all of the chairs and installed a weaker spring and now they work like a charm. This would be such an easy thing for the manufacturers to change.",

Good trick to closing it = lay it on the side with the latch close to the ground and push down on it and slightly push the chair in. It's less of a strain/pain on your finger/hand and it is much easier/quicker.",

My almost 2 year old loves using the table for arts and crafts, puzzles, playing, eating, etc. Really like that we will be able to use it for a few more years as well. All chairs and the table fold for easy storage. The only downside is that the chairs are a little hard to fold flat. I understand that they have a locking mechanism so the chair cannot fold up on a child (a plus), but it is really hard when you want to fold them up and put away. Because of this, we usually keep one chair open at all times and get the others out when friends are over to play.",

So we purchased this set to replace the old. This works perfectly. I really like the tan color. We don't need everything in our children's lives to be in primary colors. This one color set looks nicer with our home.",

I tried that and it worked! I feel the manufacture should correct this problem. I hope the latch will continue to hold after many uses. We will see!",

I put a tablecloth over it so it is not looking as bad. I have no way to cover the chairs. Sad I needed this for a birthday party and now it looks terrible for Christmas. so the company was contacted with pictures and they will not honor their warranty. I will never buy from this company again.",
