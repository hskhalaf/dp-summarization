Once it sticks it is a nightmare to clean. I have done everything the manual states and these things still stick. I do not recommend these at all.",

On a few occasions we have used the deep fryer and to our surprise it worked well. Overall this is a great addition to our kitchen. I will point this is not our go-to pot.
