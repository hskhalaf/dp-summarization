While I don't love this brush yet for blow drying as I still prefer my trusty vented round brush, the detangling ability really makes up for any lack. I've been putting a little leave in conditioner in while wet and then using this brush. No yanks, no pulls, no tears. I'm wishing that I had a brush like this years ago! Would definitely recommend.",

Because they are hard plastic, just use care when putting the brush down onto your child's head. Also, some people are complaining about the handle being too short. However, I believe that they brush is designed to be held with your handover the bulk of the brush. When you do this, it fits perfectly into the palm of your hand. The hard plastic can make it hard to hold if your hands are wet (only drawback). Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars!",
