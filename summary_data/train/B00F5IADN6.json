On removing my pack from the car I noticed the trunk mat was moist, swung my pack on and water gushed out of my pack drenching my backside and legs. The only positive is that it happened near town, not way up in the Austrian Alps! Note photos comparing the 2 fused edges, one side nice and wide, the other about 1/3 the width... poor, poor quality contol!",

I like the new design of how to put water in the container compared to the traditional design. Mounts for inside a backpack are pretty exclusive to Platypus bags because of two hanger slots, but could still be used in a standard backpack for hydration packs. The hose is quick detachable which is nice for cleaning and the mouthpiece is nice quality. I bought the mouthpiece cover separate but it should really be sold with the reservoir. Overall great product. Actually returned it though to get the 3 liter and backpack all-in-one.",

Tried using it with a standard backpack on a long hike, it worked ok, but definitely needs something to hold it up to the top of the backpack (I used a carabiner hooked to an outer top handle).

The result will be a tear into the bladder which is probably why several reviews here have complained of water leaks and failures. These bladders are too expensive for this kind of unreliability.
