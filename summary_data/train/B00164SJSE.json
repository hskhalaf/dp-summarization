They work but the quality of construction leaves a lot to be desired. The green fabric holds up fine, the elastic bands and the stitching that holds them on will fall apart far before there are any major problems with the main fabric. I wish someone made this long size with better quality.",

They are not heavy, have lots of air room inside,and are long enough to cover my arms. Yesterday I smelted down and cleaned up 160 lbs of wheelweights, and these little units guarded my arms the whole time. If I needed to, I would surely buy this again.",

After a year the elastic is mostly failing and mine have hundreds (if not thousands) of little holes from spatter - and more than a few bigger holes from grinding sparks and larger burn through areas. These would suit the light use hobbyist down to a T. I don't think I'd view them as a professional grade product and soon I'll invest in something better.",
