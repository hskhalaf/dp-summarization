      "text": "Best wheel ever! It\u2019s heavy though and my cage needed some reinforcement to keep it from rattling (the cage, not the wheel) but my chinchilla figured it out in less than 2 minutes after initial installation! It did begin to wobble a little but I just tightened the screw in the middle and it\u2019s been perfect ever since. This wheel is silent, but your cage may not be. If it rattles the cage, reinforce with metal rods to make the cage itself more sturdy. This will also help with how heavy the wheel is. Not for thin barred cages",

      "text": "Let me start by saying that the wheel was well packaged and sent very fast. It spun smoothly and without noise. The mounting bracket is made sturdy and has wingnuts for easy installation. I bought this wheel for my male rats to reduce the chance of a spinal injury and provide them with a outlet for excess energy. The only down side might be the bearings. They work wonderfully but cation is advised when cleaning in order to prevent rust. All in all I am very satisfied with this purchase and plan to buy another for my female rats.",
