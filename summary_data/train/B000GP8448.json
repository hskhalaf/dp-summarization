Excellent value. The clutch is just excellent. Gripe: the wheel auto-calibrates; so sometimes it doesn't center itself perfectly. Just have to jiggle it a bit in the control panel screen and it usually fixes itself. Also, none of the games had the controls working out of the box. Had to manually define throttle, brake, etc... Pedals moves a bit on my carpet. Inevitable. Everything else is superb. I'd give 6 stars; not often do you get something so well-made.",

Downside is of course you need a good bit of room and christ, the amount of cables this thing has! Would buy more!",

Logitec no longer makes these so if you see one for 300 or less and you are a serious racing sim player, grab it. October 2017 and this wheel is still going strong.

The Shifter is great, the 6-speed works very well with Live For Speed, and the sequential/paddle shifters work great for Gran Turismo 4. The Forcefeedback is very strong in this wheel and allows you to feel which wheel is beginning to lose traction. This allows for precise control over the car which is important if you are trying to get that record lap time. The Pedal base is sturdy, and sticks to the ground like glue! And the Wheel itself feels great in your hands, like a real wheel.",

Cons are it doesn't have a PS button for the PS3 and there were no labelling what so ever what the buttons supposed to be. Other than that, its still an excellent wheel and I would definitely recommed anyone enjoy racing games.",

This is easier on the F1 game because it is so fast you hardly have time to get to the gear shift. I highly recommend this product for those who like racing on the PS3 for the price.",

The table clams mechamism does not seem to hold properly on all surfaces and tend to slip off the edge. which can be a problem if you are in the mid of a tricky corner or trying to avoid a another vehicle. The tightening knobs are also difficult to turn and tighten. Hex bolt might be a better idea.",

      "text": "I must knock it down to 3 starts now... The shifter does not center correctly in sequential mode. Been through two of them. Many, many others reporting the same issues. Throw forward to engage is much longer than throw rearward, and sometimes it never disengages rearward engagement, causing you to miss shifts and run off the track. The software is NOT fully Vista compatible. The profiler is pretty well busted at this point. I'm not sure how they can use the \"Vista Compatible\" label, and not have software available. Same goes for the G15 Keyboard. Says it's \"Vista Compatible\", but the software does not work. Neither has Vista downloads available as of this writing.",
