You never have to adjust the line up of sheets of paper, as there is a stopper at the end to give your papers the same location of holes each and every time. If you are in the market to buy one, this is the one. You won't regret it!",

The only workaround is to hold the paper down with your hand - tricky considering you also need to keep your hand out of the way. Really disappointing since it's otherwise an excellent hole punch.",

I like that it locks in the closed position for storage purposes. The motion is smooth and it easily goes through many sheets of paper. It feels very durable and I am happy with my purchase.",

It arrived missing a c-shaped lock washer on the end of the punch, but rather than go through the hassle of returning it and waiting for a replacement, we placed a piece of tape across the pin until a replacement washer could be obtained. It's a minor inconvenience for us but suggests a less-than-optimal inspection process on the manufacturers side.",
