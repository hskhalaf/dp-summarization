I am 15 days on and have noticed improved digestion, elimination, and less belly bloat. I still have another week on the first round, and need to complete the second course of treatment.

I have more energy, skin on my face appears clearer and I feel some improvement with the sinus issues. My stomach also feels better. I might need to use it for a longer time. It tastes very sweet and it is easy to consume. I hope it heals the issues I have been experiencing for past few years with sinuses. Thank you for the product.",
