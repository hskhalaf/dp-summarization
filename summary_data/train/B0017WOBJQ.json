      "text": "I like this hole saw set. Comes with a variety of bits and are the deepest around and they can cut anything. HOWEVER, when I used these to cut holes, they are almost impossible to unscrew and change saws. As you're sawing, the saw screws so tight that I literally cannot get them off to change sizes. I've tried everything. This kit NEEDS to come with a tool to unscrew these better. I'm ruining my saws bending the metal just trying to unscrew them and it's way too much of a pain. Thinking about returning them and getting a new one and putting grease on the threads next time to hopefully make it easier",

The quick change is ok although I prefer what Bosch offers as it's quicker. I bought this for the number of sizes that fit into the case and the positive latches and heavy duty hinge they used. When you carry a hole saw kit into somebodies house the last thing you want is it spilling open and bouncing on a customers hardwood floor. This happened to me with the previous saw kit with a really cheap case. My only complaint is I wish they made the plug easier to remove.",

    "title": "Milwaukee 49-22-4105 Master Electricians Ice Hardened Hole Saw Kit 19 Piece",
    "description": "19-PC ELECTRICIAN HOLE DOZER HOLE SAW KIT. The product is easy to use. The product is durable. The product is manufactured in United States.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nMilwaukee Electric Tool Corporation introduces Ice Hardened hole saws, a new generation of hole saws that offer up to 50% longer life than the competition and are ideal for metal and wood cutting in a wide variety of HVAC, electrical, plumbing and maintenance/repair applications. Milwaukee Ice Hardened products utilize a proprietary cryogenic hardening process that improves upon traditional heat treat processes. Unlike surface coatings that wear away, cryogenics harden to the core by minimizing soft metal (austenite) and creating more hard metal (martensite). The result is a product that is more consistently hard throughout, resulting in life up to 50% longer than the competition. Milwaukee Ice Hardened hole saws also feature Matrix II bi-metal construction for greater durability and a unique precision-ground tooth geometry for faster cutting. A positive rake angle cuts more aggressively while deeper gullets quickly remove chips. A radiused back face reduces stress on the teeth, ensuring that the blade delivers optimum life and speed. Functional slot geometry allows for a standard slotted screwdriver to fit completely underneath the plug for easier plug removal. Kit Includes: Fourteen (14) hole saws: 3/4\", 7/8\", 1-1/8\", 1-3/8\", 1-1/2\", 1-3/4\", 2\", 2-1/4\", 2-1/2\", 2-5/8\", 3\", 3-5/8\", 4-1/8\", 4-3/4\"; Two (2) arbors: 49-56-7010, 49-56-9100; Three (3) drill bits: 49-56-8010; One (1) adapter: 49-56-6560; One (1) spacer: 49-67-0120; Space for additional hole saws",
