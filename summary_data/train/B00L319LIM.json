We tried this for several weeks before deciding it wasn't worth the effort. We had high hopes. I don't think it has to do with a faulty product, though. The product did exactly what it advertised. The therapy just wasn't what my husband needed to calm the tension in his back and shoulders.",

    "title": "Hansol Cupping Therapy Equipment Set with Pumping Handle 17 Cups (Made in Korea)",
    "description": "Size:17 CUPS*Cupping is an ancient Chinese method of massage for comfort. Cupping, the technique, is very useful and very safe and can be easily learned and incorporated into your family health practices. The new cups have done away with the traditional firing. This has made the application of the cups easy and safe. It has not only improved efficacy but also simplified the procedures of cupping therapy. They are easier to be handled and safer to be used for massage at home. In China, the new cups are very popular for family cupping massage. CAUTION: Thoroughly clean skin and remove body hair before cupping. Excessive body hair will result in weak suction (not strong). **DO NOT BOIL CUPS. DO NOT USE for slide/oil cupping massage. Our company is not responsible for damage to cups, which may result from slide/oil cupping technique or any massage techniques. **Please note that all the cupping cups are disposable**",
