If you have high arches and want shoes with good support that are light and breathable these are very hard to beat.",

Then I remembered that they could have been treated with Formaldehyde. Once before I bought a wearable product that I wore before washing and I had the same exact problem, Formaldehyde. After I put these shoes in the washing machine the itching and inflamation cleared up. If Reebok uses Formaldehyde to hold them in shape, I strongly suggest they switch to spray starch or something else to perform this function. Other than having this surprising experience, the shoes work perfectly well as a running shoes.",
