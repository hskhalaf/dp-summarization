There's no deep backstory or anything like that, and the game knows it (the characters even break the fourth wall to make fun of how implausible the story is). It's purely designed to be a fun and ridiculous escape from real life, and it accomplishes that incredibly well. My only complaint is that it's over :( P.S. the DLC is also top notch, if a bit short-lived",

      "text": "Insomniac? I totally forgot about these guys! Remember Resistance? Sure you do! This is a great developer, and I was surprised to see them making an XBOX one Exclusive! They haven't lost their tough for greatness. IF you like to shoot monsters and all sorts of vile creatures with guns, lots of bloods and profanity, then this game is for you. Controls are easy to jump into, but difficult to master. Fantastic graphics and funny characters. I wouldn't recommend little children playing this one, it's for grown ups, but if you think they just have to play, you can bleep out the language and Gore! That's a plus for any parent. I wish all rated M games would do this.",
