It's because of the configuration of the openings on the diffuser. I tried using old diffuser on this new blow dryer, but it doesn't fit.

If I just gently put the dryer down on the bathroom counter the attachment flies off. We all know if your blow drying your hair with a round brush that attachment coming off is a killer to the process. I would not purchase this dryer again.

The cool setting is in a very awkward place as well. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this if you\u2019re are wanting it for the diffusing or cool feature..",
