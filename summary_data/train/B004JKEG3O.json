With that said, the scuffs wipe off real easy with ordinary Clorox wipes, and just like that, you have white pedals again. Would I get these again? If I need new pedals, and I don't want to spend a lot? Yes. Will I replace these pedals with the same ones? No, I'll upgrade to Ultegra or Dura Ace.",

I able to generate a lot of power with these and you can't go wrong with Shimano products.

I am not someone that obsesses over every gram of weight on my bike, but these clips seem to feel significantly heavier/clunkier than the 105's and up. If you want to spend the money on them, I recommend the 105's over these. The 105's (or nicer) seem to feel lighter when clipping in. But if you are on a budget, and like the SPD-SL pedal features (including the few degrees of float, which is nice) then these are still good pedals.",

On my first long ride I managed to lose a screw, the others loosened, and I had to lay down next to the bike and pry my foot and cleat out of the pedal. My fault though - now I crank those screws really tight. Walking in gravel really kills the edge of the plastic cleat, but it still works okay. So tips: 1) don't walk in gravel without cleat covers 2) crank those screws and check them frequently",

It takes a good amount of torque to free your foot from these pedals and they are kind of tricky to clip into as well. I can picture myself becoming the viral video of the day if I tried using these on a street ride.",
