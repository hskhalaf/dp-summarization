Disappointed that Amazon sent the wrong size to me tho, I sent the shoes back and asked for the size I ordered to be sent to me (size 11) and yet again the replacements were the wrong size (10.5). Would highly recommend these shoes, and Start Fitness have been reliable every time I\u2019ve gone there, also better on pricing (no affiliation, just happy customer of theirs). I only came to Amazon for colour range but won\u2019t buy these on here again.",

I have worn these when just out and about with light walking but not running or carrying out any intensive exercise (the reason is that I injured my Achilles\u2019 tendon so has been very light walking). It is now 9th September and I\u2019ve just noticed the start of a split of the soul - please see photos. I am amazed at this particularly for the expense of the shoe. I don\u2019t think the shoe is up to standard and wonder if I\u2019ve been given a sub standard pair. However, there seems no means of returning them :-(",
