      "text": "Very rugged bag and good looking. The product photos show what it will hold and all sides except the back. The back is padded and has a breathable mesh. I think you could fashion this into a large fannie pack by using an adjustable belt of some sort. The shoulder strap is also nicely padded with swivel clips. The only negative I have is that the bottom is fabric. It still may be waterproof but I would have preferred a rubber coating so when you set it down on wet surfaces you would feel more confident that your gear will stay dry. All in all this was a great purchase!",

I'm able to fit my Olympus OM-D10 with the 14-150 mm Lens attached, my Olympus Pen E-PL5 with the 12-50 mm EZ lens attached and five other Micro four third lens, a small flash, extra batteries and accessories. There is still room for an iPad or a small thin laptop. There is a back zip up pocket for camera manual, note pad or maybe your phone. I love the extra top zipper opening for easy and fast access to your camera. The bag is very well made and of good quality materials.",

The d-rings previously were able to move too freely and started wearing the straps, same with the handle. Both of these issues have been fixed with newer version. The small version is just a little smaller than the large but perfect for my needs. Switched from from a full sized DSLR with 3 lenses and flash to a mirrorless camera and didn't need all that room. I did still need something big enough to hold a 15in laptop. This totally fits the bill.",

With 3 additional lenses, flash, Tascam -DR-05, and my gro-pro. My 17\" laptop and Ipad. Some files, and various cables, and things.... I was amazed at how much I could fit into this bag. It was heavy once I loaded it down, but you could get a ton in it. It was comfortable to carry around the airport. I highly recommend this bag for a traveling photographer/hobbyist that want a more discrete bag to carry their gear.",

Shoulder strap was very comfortable for me, and the top loading zipper was a real life safer. I don't like having my camera out longer than it needs to be, so this bag was good at keeping things discrete. Recently replaced the 75-300 with a much much larger 40-150 2.8, Still able to carry everything mentioned above, but it is getting a bit cramped. Leave out the Flash and you would be good to go.",
