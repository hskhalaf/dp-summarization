This was very misleading. Now I will have a black controller with a white motion plus on it. It will be functional, but look bad. I considered returning it, but didn't want to go through the hassle. The cartridge will do what it's designed to do and that is what is important at this point.",

It's extremely frustrating and I wish there was something that could be done without having to pause every 10 seconds to recalibrate.",

It is necessary to have more control with a lot of Wii games especially the Wii fit since many of the challenges require fine motor control. The only disadvantage is that it won't fit into the steering wheel which is fun to use in some of the Wii games. Ordering through Amazon was terrific. Great price and very reliable.

I found that finding a neutral position was very difficult, requiring awkward adjustments, and movement when going to swing glitchy. When your moving to swing it will occasionaly hit the ball before your ready, however, once you master the variety of skills (e.g., top spin, slice, etc.) the position of the ball is fairly accurate. In my opinion, the WMP is just average with the main advantage being increased accuracy of the variety of swings once mastered.",
