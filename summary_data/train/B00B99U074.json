Using some hoses that I picked up from the hardware store I put the whole bottle into the heater core and let it sit for an hour. Flushed it out, put things back together,and filled the radiator. I let the car heat up and my heat was back, not like new, but good enough. I may flush it again in a few months to see if that helps more, but this did what I expected.",

People who hype how it cleared garbage when they dumped in in coolant are morons. Mix any random garbage with your coolant and you create a sludge. Drain the radiator and flush with distilled water until drain fluid clear. Then use this. Then flush several kore times with distilled sonthis doesn't get left behind and mix with the new coolant.",

    "description": "Size:22 Ounce, (Pack of 6)Prestone Radiator Flush and Cleaner is a 2-in-1 formula designed for light flushing and heavy-duty cleaning for cooling systems to help prevent overheating, the #1 cause of engine failure. This premium formulation is designed to remove heavy rust and scale deposits in neglected cooling systems. These deposits can dramatically restrict coolant flow and reduce heat transfer, which may lead to possible overheating, breakdown, or costly repair. A super-chelating additive effectively removes heavy deposits by drawing metal oxides into the solution. Though strong enough to help restore maximum cooling system efficiency, this non-toxic, non-acidic product is easy-to-use and safe for all cooling system metals.",
