This bowl hadn't seen any abnormal usage to warrant the failure so I assume they must use very low quality silicone because I have similar bowls that haven't had this problem whatsoever. When I flex the material, I can see the silicone turn white which I've heard is a sign of poor quality silicone. I would definitely not recommend buying this product.",

So I bought this 1 1/2 cup collapsible bowl. This bowl is just the right size so it doesn't bother me while we walk. I just refill it instead of having a larger bowl. This is nicely made and has a nice clip to attach it to your back back, belt loop, etc. Good price too. Glad I bought it, so my dog can drink water and I'll be comfortable.",

One nice feature about the bowl is that if you are limited on water you can expand it only half way so your pet can still get a drink easily. Probably wouldn't recommend the 2 cup size for very large breeds but should work for most :)",
