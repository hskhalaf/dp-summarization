Unfortunately it's too late to try to return it due to their return policy even though it's brand new.",

The only problem I've encountered - I've got it laying horizontal (as in the photo) and I've attached these small rubber mounts at the 4 corners; however, it is not well stabilized when I reel in the hose. I find that I need to step on the base as I reel in the hose. I suppose that this reel would work better if mounted on the wall in a vertical position.",

They were very flimsy and the reel would pull out of the ground when reeling, but with some tent nails I bought for $6 at my local hardware store, it stays in the ground and does not pull up when reeling. If it were mounted to the side of the house it would not be a problem at all. Nice product. Happy with purchase.",

      "text": "Obviously the manufacturer has no QA/QC manager ! Materials are suitable and sturdy, the entire problem is the fit up and how it was welded. The fitting was welded to the threaded coupling to the face of the reel > 3\u00b0 out of plumb. This caused the hose reel to wobble terribly when the reel is hand cranked. Also several spots where the powder coating contained holidays.",

If you have less than 100 ft. of hose, the reel will not turn anymore when the last 50 ft. of hose is being pulled as it binds against the reel sides. It is well made and looks good, but I would not recommend it . Sorry!",
