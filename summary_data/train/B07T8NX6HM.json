The material feels \"alright\" but it could of been better honestly. I had high expectations but i was disappointed. UPDATE 3/Feb/2020 I ended up liking this shoe But the down fall is, when the red it wet it runs red all over the white parts of the shoes which is difficult to clean won't reccomend you wearing these if it's raining or was Raining.",
