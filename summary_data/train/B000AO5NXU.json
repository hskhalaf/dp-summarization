      "title": "Sealed cartridge bearings, decent looking quality.  Light.",
      "text": "Installed on an older 2004 Specialized Rockhopper. I really prefer sealed bearing headsets so finally bought one for this older bike. I have a Cane Creek S2 headset on another bike and it's a bit better quality, but this FSA one has sealed cartridge bearings, and installed fine. The crown race that goes on the fork looks to be aluminum. I haven't installed that yet as I bought a new fork that arrives tomorrow. Once I get it fully together and some rides in I'll update this review. Update as of 8/15/18. I've got a few rides now with this installed. It's super smooth and zero issues.",
