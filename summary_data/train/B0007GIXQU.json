The camera is all but useless. The Fuji shop said they need to replace the lens assembly, at a cost of at least US$120; for that price, I'm buying a new camera, but not another F10.",

The seller was reachable by both email and phone, and he did respond to my concern about the missing card. When I did receive the memory card some time later, it was one that had even more memory than he had said he would provide. Overall, I ended up feeling pretty satisfied with the product and the seller.",

In 1996, I was working in a digital imaging lab with the first point and shoot camera's; and said at the time that I'd buy one when the resolution reached about 2000x3000 pixels, and they were affordable. This camera is what I was waiting for. The combination of the ability to shoot at ASA 1600, sharp images, a good size, and a price under $200 (rebuilt) were the factors that made me choose this camera. The slightly clunky menu system and small capacity XD card were minor problems, but shouldn't stop you from buying this camera.",

I had liked it so much, I bought a little larger Fuji Camera shortly after and found the battery life was sucked away by the bigger screen and lacked the natural light setting the F10 had. Just yesterday the telescoping lens stopped functioning and I will really miss not having it. But as great as it was, It was past its prime because newer digital cameras have more advanced features and image stabilization which the F10 lacks. I will by another Fuji I think if I can find a decent successor to the the F10.",

This is the camera. There are plenty of things to complain about... the confusing menus, the lack of manual controls... etc. But I shopped around a LOT and this camera has the best image quality (I've seen) at 400 thru 1600 of any pocket camera on the market at any price.

It might not be the best buy for you if you want incredibly professional quality photos, but for the more casual/ informal photographers, this camera rocks!! You have your choice of various scene settings, and the picture quality is usually good (even if on the higher ISO settings). The camera also has other nifty features that prevent blurry photos and unfocused shots. My only problem with this camera is that the capture button is sometimes hard to maneuver, and a little resistant at times. Overall, however, this camera is a good buy for your buck!!",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer Do you really get the images you want? The Fujifilm FinePix F10 6.3 MP digital camera is loaded with features to ensure that you do, including 3x optical zoom, Real Photo (RP) Processor technology, a 2.5-inch LCD display, and a wide variety of exposure options.\n\nReal Photo Technology\nThe superb optics of the Fujinon lens collect light and precisely form the image on the 5th-generation Super CCD HR, which works in tandem with our newly developed RP (Real Photo) Processor to perform highly sophisticated processing of the image data at ultra-high speed. The result is an incredible degree of sensitivity with very low noise. Even at the maximum pixel resolution with the highest sensitivity, the resulting photos are vividly natural and beautiful. Fujifilm Real Photo Technology is making it possible to take the photos as never before.\n\nInnovative RP (Real Photo) Processor\n\n\n * All the advanced signal processing know-how of the acclaimed FinePix S3 Pro packed in the IC chip for uncompromising image quality in a compact digital camera.\n * Two cycles of sophisticated noise reduction processing for high-quality images even at high ISO settings\n * Ultra-fast processing for \"no-wait\" operation, imperceptible shutter time lag and shorter shot intervals\n * Energy-efficient signal processing for longer battery life and more shots per charge\n * New contour correction processing for clearer contrast with more natural resolution\n\nISO 1600 + 6.3 Megapixels\nBoasting a maximum sensitivity of ISO 1600, the new Super CCD HR combines with the noise suppression of the new RP Processor to fully exploit the high image quality and resolution of 6.1 million recorded pixels. * Easily take beautiful photos indoors, outdoors even at twilight and under other low-light conditions without loss of definition or nuance.\n * New built-in Anti-blur program takes advantage of super-high sensitivity and faster shutter speed to automatically suppress blurring from \"camera shake\" or movement by the subject under dim light conditions.\n\n \n\nThe Fujifilm F10's large 2.5-inch LCD features manual brightness adjustment and more. 2.5-Inch LCD Monitor\nThe extra-large 2.5-inch LCD monitor provides a spacious approximately 115,000-pixel canvas to compose your photo, check settings, and playback the beautiful results. Sensing ambient light, the Auto Gain function automatically adjusts LCD brightness, or you can manually tune brightness with the Low Light View button for optimum viewing indoors or outdoors. Plus a host of new shooting functions including the Post Shot Assist Window that lets you take the next photo while seeing the playback of previous shots, are supported by a totally new Shooting/Playback interface for more intuitive operation. Even when the camera is switched off, you can view your previous shots just by pressing the Playback button.Approximately 500 Shots Per Charge\nEnjoy as many as 500 shots without a recharge thanks to energy-efficient engineering and the high-power battery. On one full charge, take hundreds of photos at a holiday or business trip destination, free from battery worries.\n\n.01-Second Shutter Response\nThe responsive FinePix F10 is ready when you are!\n\n * Super-fast start-up time of only 1.3 seconds\n * Shooting interval of 1.2 seconds\n * Shutter release time lag of minimum 0.01 seconds\n\n3x Optical Zoom\nQuick and responsive, the Fujinon 3x optical zoom lens empowers you with a focal length equivalent to a 36-108mm lens on a 35mm camera. Capture the full flavor of the scene with wide angle or zoom in for a tight close-up. Combined with the 6.2x digital zoom, you can take advantage of a total zoom ratio of 18.5x!Smart and Speedy AF\nAF Assist Illuminator\nEnjoy enhanced AF ( Auto Focus ) accuracy when shooting under low-light conditions. And in darker scenes, the improved AF Assist Illuminator automatically projects a patterned beam of light further than ever to assist the autofocus and bring subjects as far as 4.0m away into sharp, clear focus.\n\nHigh-Speed Shooting Mode\nWith built-in improved High Speed Shooting mode, there are no more lost photo opportunities. With this mode, the time required for AF is approximately half of normal AF mode.\n\nVersatile Exposure Options\nF10's range and versatility of functions give you the freedom to explore the wonderful world of photography.\n\n * Automatic setting for easy point and shoot.\n * White balance, exposure compensation, photometry, AF mode\n * Video record/playback (plus audio) maximum 29.3 minutes at 320 x 240 pixels, or maximum 14.9 minutes at 640 x 480 pixels\n * Scene Position (SP)\n\nEasy Connection to Your PC\nThe included FinePixViewer software makes it a snap to download image files and movie clips to your computer while recharging the camera battery.FinePix Photo Mode\nThe convenient F button gives you one-touch access to your frequently used settings including quality mode, sensitivity, and FinePix Color mode (Standard, Chrome, and B and W).\n\nOther features:\n\n * PictBridge compatible\n * Ultra-sophisticated auto white balance\n * Multi-Language display (supports seven languages)\n * Rechargeable battery and AC power adapter included",
