EDIT: One of them died adlfter about 7 months or so showing only half a tank when the tank was actually full. The second one was having issues with the cold and freezing according to the maintenance personnel but it always worked fine for me. Still a great thing to have especially for being as inexpensive as it is.",

The only downside that I see is that the propane must be flowing to get the gauge to give a reading. Not a big deal. Just turn on the grill like usual and it will give a reading right away.",
