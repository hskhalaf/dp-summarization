They had me email them pictures of it and a copy of the receipt showing when I purchased it. In a couple days they called me back and said that they were going to send me a New 55# thrust rolling motor. They figured something must had gone wrong when mine was manufactured. I received the new one a few days later via FedEx, no charge. It is nice to know that they stand behind their product when one fails to hold up. Excellent customer service. 5 STARS!",

I use this for my hobie outback so my total weight with myself and all my equipment is about 400lbs and in calm water I can get to speeds close to 5mph. There does seem to be a gap between the 4 and 5 speeds but it's still a good motor. With my everstart group 29 battery I can troll for close 8 hours on setting three which gets me to about 2.8mph. This is my first trolling motor so I don't have much to compare it too but it's been great so far.",

Definitely I don't feel the least bit disappointed in any expectations of performance or quality.

As your battery loses energy the number five setting will drop down to something more like the four setting and then the three setting and then the two setting. I think you get the point. It cannot maintain top speed as your battery drains. If you run it on five then your battery is going to drain much faster. Keep it at three and you WILL go much farther. Also remember, you cannot 'farther' your education ('farther' describes physical distance, and further is figurative). You're welcome. :)",

I have it mounted to an Old Town Saranac 146 canoe, and it is perfect. The telescoping handle is very useful in this configuration, and worked out better than expected.",
