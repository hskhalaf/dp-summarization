Chiefly the texture of the solidified coconut oil, chewing/melting it in my mouth as I proceeded with the oil pulling. It was so waxy. The Dirt's Natural MCT Coconut Oil is wonderful. First, it's already liquid. It's a bright yellow, with other ingredients (such as peppermint, cardamom, and clove oils) that really help to make your mouth feel fresh. It can be used as a mouthwash as well as for oil pulling. It really helps freshen the breath. I highly recommend this product!",

The order came with a free 'dirty balm' too. IT IS LITERALLY THE BEST! I just ordered another one I love it so much. Never going back to burts bees or anything else.",

If you're still game...then...let me help by saying do not strongly inhale through your nose while you're swishing, as it will somehow go up your nose and the burn is lasting a long time. These ingredients can be a laxative. Also, if you're a puller then you already know that you don't gargle with it. Good luck and happy pulling.",

Just a little bit will build up to great quantities very shortly.
