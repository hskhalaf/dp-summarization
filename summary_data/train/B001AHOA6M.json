It has a knob on the side to control the heat, but I prefer to turn it up all the way and let the thermostat control it. This morning I had it turned off, and it was 54 degrees inside the home office. Ten minutes later it was up to 71 degrees. It isn't noisy when it kicks on and it seems to distribute the heat quite nicely.",

As far as the hookup goes, I ran a dedicated ciruit from the pedestal using 1/2\" hard pipe with 12/2 wire (20 amp). That took a few hours and know how obviously, but the unit itself was easy to install. Only downside is the dial is a 1-2-3 setting and I wish it had a temp rating instead. I may eventually put an inline thermostat but it seems like this could have been built into the unit",

As others have mentioned there is no cable, but a quick trip to the hardware store can fix this, allowing one to wire it for either a plug or for a direct connection. Direct connection is how mine is wired giving me a Zero Wires installation. The thermostat works perfectly. My wife turned this up in the middle of the night and by morning our bathroom and master bath were stiflingly hot.",

Why would the designers want you to have such a clear view of the romex power wire? What is the purpose for such a design? Ugly must be a fashion statement in germany. I bought another one because its a nice heater and will come up with a good looking fix myself.",

These elegant, surface-mount fan heaters are extremely quiet. They are a simple solution to quickly add heat to a room that may not get enough heat from a central source, as sometimes happens with a mini-split retrofit, or they can add heat to a space that never had it before, like a porch retrofit. CK, CKT, and CK Trend heaters have an integral thermostat, but the CK can be linked to a central thermostat if it is installed in a room larger than 215 sq. ft.Stiebel Eltron CK wallmounted fan heaters use a small, quiet fan to pull in room air and send out heated air. These heaters are perfect for spaces like bathrooms that already have a primary heat source, but may need a little extra heat added quickly.\n\nKey Features * Sleek European surface-mount design\n * Extremely quiet operation at 49.7 dB(a)\n * Built-in thermostat for maximum comfort\n * Downdraft design heats space evenly\n * Quality German manufacturing\n * Frost protection setting\n * Ideal anywhere quick heat is needed\n\nSpecifications * Voltage: 120V\n * Wattage: 1500W\n * Amperage: 12.5A\n * Rated output: 5118 Btu/hr\n * Recommended circuit breaker size: 15A\n * Minimum wire size (copper): 14 AWG\n * Heating element: Nichrome wire\n * Thermostat & high limit: Bimetal type\n * Motor: 18W shaded pole\n * Blower: Galvanized steel, squirrel cage type\n * Temperature range: 41\u00b0F \u2013 86\u00b0F / 5\u00b0C \u2013 30\u00b0C\n * Frost protection setting: 45\u00b0F / 7\u00b0C\n * Operating noise: 49.7 dB(a)\n * Dimensions (HxWxD): 18-1/8\" x 13-3/16\" x 4-13/16\"\n * Weight: 8.0 lbs\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nStiebel Eltron CK 15E Wall Mounted Electric Fan Heater-120V/1500 watts offers and exciting room heating alternative for new construction and renovation projects.
