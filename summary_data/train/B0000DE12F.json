Two of the tips included are not larked \u2018Ateco\u2019 and say \u2018made in Korea\u2019 vs the genuine Ateco tips that just say \u2018Korea\u2019 - the metal on those teo tips does not seem the same quality as all of the other tips either. Knowing I had the chance of getting non genuine tips was a risk I took after reading many reviews. I won\u2019t be returning the box of tips but think this issue should be resolved",

The first one shipped without much packing material and the plastic case was cracked. I sent it back in and they had a replacement to me in about 2 days. This set looks like it's going to have everything she'll need (and I'm sure I'll get to use it too). After purchasing bags and couplers from a different retailer, she should be able to decorate anything imaginable!",

Here is what I noticed. Tips numbered: 46\u00b0, 47, 48\u00b0, 61, 88, 100, 108, 168, 225 were missing. Instead I got: 46, 47\u00b0, 48, 60, 70, 87, 99, 191, and 193. Obviously some of these tips seem to be interchangeable varying only slightly in size by a millimeter, no big deal. Still, I think the assembly of this kit should be supervised more carefully.

Very disappointed in this product, this is made of stainless steel. Also this was the first time using tip#143, we had other tips inside the bowl where we soak the tips and this was the only one with this issue. Never had this problem before with my other tips.",
