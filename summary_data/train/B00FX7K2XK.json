I greased with just a dollop of vegetable oil. Once the brownies were done, I loosened the corners with just my finger and then turned the pan upside down to remove the brownies. I wasn\u2019t sure how the shape would look once cut, but it actually looks pretty uniform. Would highly recommend this as an alternative to the other more well-known brownie pan. This also gives more edges! Reminder to adjust baking temperature and time as this is a dark coated pan.",

    "description": "Do you ever wish your brownies had more crispy edges? The crispy corner pan ensures that each brownie you bake has four crispy sides! Made of durable carbon steel, this pan features a convenient PFOA/PFTE-free non-stick coating to help with removal and cleaning - hand washing recommended to keep your pan looking and functioning like new. After baking and cooling, simply flip the pan and gently Tap to release the brownies. Pull apart for twelve deliciously crispy confections! Because the pan separates the brownie batter, brownies may cook faster than when baked in a traditional style pan. During first use, periodically check for doneness by inserting a cake Tester or toothpick during baking. When the cake Tester comes out clean, your brownies are done! This would be your ideal baking time when using the crispy corners pan.",
