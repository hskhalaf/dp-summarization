I cut 22,000 16g 5/16'' galvanized rings I don't know how many Stainless Steel rings of various sizes but I did go through 2 big rolls of 12g SS, 1 roll of 16g SS, and some other misc. cutting of old fence and wire to send to the scrap yard. The spring, the handles, and cutting ability are amazing. Perfect for chain maille. Check out YouTube to see what they're capable of.",

I purchased this item to cut hardened solid rings from fishing hooks in order to replace with better rings and I'm amazed at how this tool cuts with precision and ease. I was so impressed that I also bought the 460 bolt cutter (another outstanding cutter). Every part of this tool speaks of precision and quality. The blades keep cutting. I don't see any distortion on the edges after cutting so many times. The blades also meet edge-to-edge precisely so that cuts are consistent. I'm confident this tool will last a long time, and something I might be able to pass on to my kid.",

They are compact, and they have a spring which returns them to the open position after a cut. The mechanism to hold them closed while not in use seems particularly well thought-out. They do cut through my fencing, but only with quite a bit of effort, so I am going to use a larger bolt cutter for my fencing project. However, I will keep these on hand for smaller projects.",

I guess you have to maintain jaws oiled in order to prevent rust after its use. I liked it a lot. My first real bolt cutter... and works very well. Recommended!",

      "text": "For us, the knipex 71 12 200 is perfect for cutting lengths of lacing (2mm mild steel) wire, for tying netting onto steel posts. The spring just makes the job just that little bit easier than using our favourite pliers, the knipex 71 01 200. As I have stated in a review for the 71 01 200, DO NOT twist the pliers while cutting, as you will chip the hardened jaws. The leverage design will make cutting wire a breeze. But as with the other model we use, these are great pliers for 2.5mm high tensile wire and will cut 4mm (8 gauge) mild steel wire without much effort.",
