I received this as a birthday gift and it\u2019s exactly what I wanted. It\u2019s an attractive timepiece with a nice weight. I like that it gives you feedback at a glance on your progress. I also like the added feature of the red bar that indicates if you\u2019ve been sitting too long. It syncs up easily to the app on my phone. I did trade out the band for a canvas one, and even that was super easy. I will recommend this to others. Well done, Garmin!",

The face is rather large, but works with my petite frame. I got it for about $62, which I thought was great!",

Would also be nice if it had a simple date function. Overall good, but needs some work before I could recommend purchase by others.",

I have to conclude that my Moto Z Force Droid with Android 7.1.1 is the problem. It would be nice is Garmin customer service had been more forthcoming or that the advertising would have indicated problems.",

No real issues I check the app on my phone when I want to see how I\u2019m doing with sleep and calories burned. Quick glimpse to give me basic things like how close I am to my step goal. It\u2019s simplicity is what I love the most. I actually sold the Fitbit charge 3 unopened because I like my Garmin so well. Even bought my daughter one as a gift.",

It has worked flawlessly and thanks to the app (Garmin Connect ) is very accurate when measuring steps due to the fact that the app allows you to ajust your stride... I got this tracker on sale from Amazon $68... I have seen that some people have had some problems with it not syncing with thier phones after awhile if I experience this I will update",
