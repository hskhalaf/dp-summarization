I think mostly they keep phone chargers, birthday money and such things. But everyone should have a place to keep what is important to them.",

Trying to turn the dials is a nightmare. I think I'm going to have to tear the box apart to get my daughter's stuff out - which is possible, because it's just paper. But really disappointing, especially after the time she put in decorating it to suit her.",
