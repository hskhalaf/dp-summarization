I purchased the natural brown 3 and it looks very natural a little darker but I know it will fade to a lighter brown since I did test the color on my wrist a couple days ago. I\u2019m not sure how long it will last on my eyebrows but I will update later. I mixed equal parts of color and developer in a little mixing cup, I used an old Anastasia brow brush I had to apply the product and it worked great. I let the product dry for about 10 minutes on each eyebrow then wiped it off with a damp towel.",

As another reviewer wrote, you should definitely do a test first, especially if you have sensitive skin. What works for me is to carefully apply vaseline around my eyebrows and then color in 2-minute intervals, or 2 minutes, then 1 minute at a time. I wipe off both the vaseline and extra color with make-up wipes, and if any stray color remains, scrub very gently around each eyebrow. While it's a neat and fast little system, be sure to protect the area--sink or vanity--and quickly look for and clean up any tiny splashes of dye.",

I wouldn't use this color on light blonde eyebrows. Shipping was fast too!",
