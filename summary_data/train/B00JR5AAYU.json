Mixing thicker dough by hand is quite tiring. The only con I could find was the attachments did have trouble pulling ingredients from the sides of the bowl falling short by about a 1/4 inch. Just keep a rubber scraper on hand to help the mixer along occasionally until all the thicker/stickier ingredients blend in.",

Even with more than ample time to work the dough, it completely failed to knead it and properly build the gluten structure, ruining the loaves.
