But I still liked it because it was cheap for beginners and very suitable. The light bulbs as well. Didn't like the watts. It was about 60 45w light bulb and it just wasn't enough so I ordered a 105w light bulb. Overall. I recommend it for beginners. This review shouldn't chase you away :)",

Came with enough lightbulbs for all the equipment, I think I only got five clamps though. All in all, a great starter set on a budget. Highly recommend picking up a tripod with this set!",

It's pretty solid and sturdy with one of the backdrops on. They look great and clean and smooth on camera. Creases and bumps steam out easy. They look great with the lighting, since the umbrella and box lighting is so soft they don't overreflect or wash anything out.",

I can't recommend it enough to everyone who asks me what equipment I use, this brand is reliable and consistent with satisfactory results. The white, black, and green screen are well made, the material is nice and drapes well and gives me a sufficient amount of space to work with. The umbrella and soft boxes are uncomplicated to put together and come with brawny 7 foot tall stands. The backdrop frame works as a great support system, the clamps fit around the rod and tightly hold the cloths in place and don't leave imprints. Amazing starter kit for any budding photographer/videographer!",

This pretty much gives you a fluorescent flat lighted look but I'm sure with gels and modifiers you can make the light look more creative",
