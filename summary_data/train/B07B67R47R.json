Instructions were pretty easy for both the table & chairs, I just wish the seat cushions had predrilled holes to make it easier (you\u2019ll need a drill, not mentioned in the instructions). The table is on the small side & straight out of packaging the chairs also look very low but they fit my 5\u20198 frame perfectly. Overall I LOVE my new dining set.",
