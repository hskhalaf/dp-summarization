Fans of this soccer cleat mentioned of its beautiful design as well as its excellent quality and notable comfortable fit. Some of the things they didn\u2019t like so much included the slightly tight and small fit of this Puma model. Overall, even with its issues in fit and sizing, the Puma Spirit Turf is still an impressive, not to mention, a very reasonably-priced cleat.",

I will say, however, and this is true for all soccer shoes, it gets hot on artificial turf. I would suggest some vents in the shoes or the shoe tongue have some holes so some venting can occur. The orange color seems to keep it a bit cooler than darker colored shoes.",
