This was perfect. I like the 12 slices instead of the 8 I was seeing around Amazon. I don't have to dislocate my jaw to eat a slice and coworkers don't have to wait 5 minutes while I chew if they have a question! Highly recommend!",

The size of slices are perfect for pie filling and for snacking. The center does not waste much flesh on very large apples you may not get all the core (but that was the same with other corer)",

Probably the secret is that if the slicing is too hard, don't try to put too much pressure on it and instead just use a knife to slice. It would be a lot safer.

On a huge Granny Smirh, I used a rubber hammer to pound it through the slicer, as I often use a rubber mallet on top of a knife to cut through yams or spaghetti squash. The Apple peeler included works well, and the little brush makes it easy to clean the slicer.",
