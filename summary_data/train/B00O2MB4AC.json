In our space, we don't need the freezer, and mini-fridges that have freezers are never that great, what's in the freezer isn't cold enough and they tend to frost things that are near them. The compartments are great, it has curves on the door shelfs so you can stick things in like cartons of milk or juice containers. The shelves are sturdy and I've got one shelf holding a 24-pack of water bottles without any problems. So far this has been a great fridge for us. I've included a picture that shows you how tall it is, when I was shopping I had no idea how tall it'd turn out.",

The unit is whisper quiet, well constructed, and has the ability to produce temperatures into the mid thirties per customer support. A perfect temperature for bar needs is around thirty-seven. The refrigerator has a strong light that illuminates the entire interior. My experience with one call to customer support is that CS is excellent. My only con is the heavy use of Styrofoam in the packaging. Using paper egg carton material product would be greener and provide the same protection as Styrofoam. Recommended.",

Called manufacturer and there only suggestion was for me to buy another adjustable leg for the other front side of the refrigerator and see if that would work or stick something under it to help steady it. Not the type of customer service I was expecting, thought they would have at least have offered to send another adjustable leg. So now I have to buy the other leg and hope it works/helps with the server wobble. I won't be buying from Danby again nor recommend them to anyone",

Very spacious for a small fridge, the auto defrost works well. We had to buy a thermometer to confirm the temp, as we use it in an AirBnB and don't want our guests turning it so low that it freezes -- as it WILL do. But, overall, I really like this fridge.

      "text": "I had a unit for 15 years...it worked great, but the motor shorted out. The new unit, tho not stainless like the old one, is doing very well. One issue was the heat in the side walls when the condensor/compressor was starting up. It concerned me, but that heating is over. I would recommend a refrigerator only for use. Ours is on the counter of our bar area. Not recommended to be put in a cabinet...it needs air circulation. I would recommend this to any friend.",

Don't know if it was because of the hot/cold weather in East Texas or not since it went through two years of both kinds.",
