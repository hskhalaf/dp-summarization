The video is of the second use when there was a bit of smoke after about 15 minutes of usage and I happened to have my phone. Left it alone for a couple days then used it two more times for about 20 minutes each with no issue. On fourth usage, suddenly became very hot after 10 minutes of intermittent use and smoked much more than in the video. The tool is now seized and no longer functions.",

The circle saw with left-sided blade (like a SKIL) has cut many 4x4s and deck boards. I like the quick-change SAWZ-ALL. The 20 v batteries have, from what I can determine, 1/2, again, the power and lasting than the older 18s. I would recommend this set to anyone that wishes convenience AND a good tool",

    "title": "DEWALT 20V Max Cordless Drill Combo Kit, 5-Tool (DCK590L2)",
    "description": "Style:Combo kitDCK590L2R 20 volt max cordless lithium-ion 5-tool combo kit.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nDEWALT\u2019s DCK590L2 20-volt max lithium-ion 3.0 Ah five-tool combo kit includes a premium hammer drill, a 1/4-inch impact driver, a circular saw, a reciprocating saw, and a work light\u2014a well-rounded arsenal of high-performance power tools that help everyone from carpenters and remodelers to electricians and contractors work their way through a variety of applications.\n\n\n\nDCK590L2 20-Volt Max\nFive-Tool Combo Kit\nAt a Glance: * Compact and ergonomic designs that don\u2019t compromise on power\n   \n   \n * Five tools included: premium hammer drill, 1/4-inch impact driver, circular saw, reciprocating saw, and LED work light\n   \n   \n * Tools come with 3-year limited warranty, 1-year free service contract, and 90-day money-back guarantee\n   \n   \n * Lithium-ion batteries come with 3-year free service contract\n\n\nThe DCK590L2 kit includes the DCL040 LED work light. View largerHammer Drill\nThe 1/2-inch hammer drill\u2019s high-power, high-efficiency motor delivers 535 unit watts out for superior performance in light and medium drilling applications. A 1/2-inch ratcheting chuck with carbide inserts provides superior bit-gripping strength\u2014reducing slippage during high-torque applications\u2014thus providing longer tool life. The hammer drill\u2019s patented three-speed (0-600 RPM; 0-1,250 RPM; and 0-2,000 RPM), all-metal transmission allows users to select the appropriate speed for the job at hand and is up to 30 percent faster than current hammer drills on the market.\nImpact Driver\nMeanwhile, the impact driver\u2019s robust motor delivers 2,800 RPM\u2014up to 43 percent faster than current impact drivers on the market. Its one-handed loading 1/4-inch hex chuck accepts and holds 1-inch bit tips for convenient fastening in tight spaces. Research shows that impact drivers are growing in popularity largely because of their smaller size and lack of kickback (or reactionary torque) thanks to the impact mechanism within the tool. Combined with its 5.55-inch length and 3.4-pound weight, the premium impact driver packs a serious punch in a small package.\n\nCircular Saw\nThe circular saw\u2019s powerful motor (offering 460 max watts out) and ergonomic profile (with lightweight magnesium shoe and optimized handle design) are ideal for professionals tasked with framing, cross cutting, ripping, bevel cutting and plunge cutting. Delivering 3,700 RPM, this saw is 10 percent more powerful than previous DEWALT 6.5-inch cordless circular saws\u2014and combined with its accompanying 3.0 Ah lithium-ion battery, it provides up to 57 percent more runtime compared with other leading 18-volt lithium-ion tools. Its bevel capacity of 0-50 degrees lends itself well to a variety of applications, and a 6.5-inch thin kerf carbide tooth blade provides users with the ability to cut completely through two-by framing lumber at a 45-degree bevel angle.\n\nReciprocating Saw\nThe reciprocating saw is compact and lightweight for access to tight areas (and it helps to reduce user fatigue). The keyless lever-action blade clamp makes for quick and easy blade changes, and the blade reverses for upside-down and flush cutting. Its 1-inch stroke length delivers 0-3,000 SPM for fast cutting. A variable-speed trigger with lock provides increased control, and an electric brake prevents blades from breaking with exiting plunge cuts.\n\nLED Work Light\nThe work light comes equipped with additional lumens (110 total) for brighter visibility, delivering bright white LED light that reduces shadows and helps differentiate between colors. (An added bonus: The LED bulb creates less heat than conventional Xenon bulbs.) Its pivoting head rotates 120 degrees with 11 detent positions for a wide range of visibility, and the integrated hanging hook allows for hands-free capability. Users can expect up to 11 hours of light output when paired with the 3.0 Ah 20-volt max lithium-ion battery.\n\nEndurance and Ease of Use\nDEWALT-designed electronics have been built into all of these tools\u2019 switches to provide maximum life by helping to protect them from overheating, overloading, and deep discharge during use. The max 20-volt\u2019s lithium-ion batteries provide up to 35 percent more runtime than existing 18-volt max lithium-ion battery technology, and the included Energy Star-qualified charger has dual voltage capabilities and it is compatible with both 12-volt max and 20-volt max DEWALT lithium-ion batteries. The tools\u2019 slim handles fit easily into users\u2019 hands, increasing the level of comfort during the course of long jobs, and the bright built-in LED work lights above the triggers have a 20-second delay that improves visibility in dimly lit spaces.\n\nAbout DEWALT's 20-Volt Max Lithium-Ion Tools\nDEWALT\u2019s line of 20-volt max lithium-ion tools features improvements in engineering and design to provide the performance, the ergonomics, and the innovation that contractors require. The new line consists of 11 tools, two lithium ion batteries, and two battery chargers, as well as a number of combo kits.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nOne DEWALT DCK590L2 20-volt max lithium-ion 3.0 Ah five-tool combo kit, including one DCD985 premium hammer drill, one DCF885 1/4-inch impact driver, one DCS393 circular saw, one DCS381 reciprocating saw, one DCL040 LED work light, two 20-volt max 3.0 Ah lithium-ion batteries, one 12-volt max/20-volt max lithium-ion battery charger, one belt hook, one 360-degree side handle, and one contractor bag.\n\n\n\nDEWALT's 20-volt max DCK590L2 kit also includes the line's impact driver, reciprocating saw, circular saw, and hammer drill. (Click each to enlarge)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe DEWALT DCD985 20V MAX lithium ion premium 3-speed hammer drill/driver Kit (3.0 Ah) has a patented 3-speed all-metal transmission that matches the tool to task for fast application speeds and improved run time. The DCF885 1/4-inch impact driver has a compact (5.55 inches front to back), lightweight (2.8 pounds), design that fits into tight areas. It has a one-handed loading 1/4-inch hex chuck that accepts 1-inch bit tips. This powerful little driver produces up to 3200 impacts per minute and has a max torque of 117 foot/pounds. The DCS380 reciprocating saw has a 4-position blade clamp that allows for flush cutting and increased positional versatility with tool free blade changes. The 1-1/8-inch stroke length delivers a fast cutting speed. It has a variable speed trigger with 0-3000 rpm to provide increased blade control and faster cut speeds. The DCS391 circular saw has a powerful 460 MWO, 3700 rpm motor that delivers power and speed to make the most demanding cuts with ease. It has 0-degrees-50-degrees bevel capacity to allow for aggressive bevel cuts for a multitude of applications. The 6-1/2-inch carbide tipped blade is included for cutting 2x material at 90-degrees and 45-degrees and more cuts per charge. The DCL040 LED flashlight has a bright LED output of 110 lumens. This light has an integrated hook for hands free use in multiple placements. The head rotates 120-degrees for easy flexibility allowing the user to position light at the optimal angle. This kit includes a DCD985 1/2-inch hammer drill, 360-degrees side handle, a DCF885 1/4-inch impact driver, a DCS393 6 1/2-inch circular saw, a DCS381 reciprocating saw, a DCL040 LED work light, two 20V MAX lithium ion 3.0 Ah battery packs, a fast charger, a carbide tipped blade, a belt hook, and a contractor bag.\n\nSee more",
