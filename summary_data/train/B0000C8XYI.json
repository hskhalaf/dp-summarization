I am meticulous about these re-baits. Furthermore, I was ignored by their customer service. Amazon censored an earlier review of mine. Just make sure you photocopy everything. I think they count on rejecting a percent of the claims to pad their profits. I for one will look to TrendMicro or McAfee next time around. Very disappointing experience.",

      "text": "I purchased the Nav2004 edition so I could gain the benefit of having background spyware detection. So after installing, rebooting.. I thought I'd give it a test and download some known Gain spyware such as Precision Time and Data Manager. Nav2003 let me do this without any warning!!.. also when I scanned my system, it still didn't notify me of this.. After waiting for over 1/2 hour on their support line.. I gave up and requested a refund.. Very disapointing.. as I had hoped that I would have a good solution against spyware... the bane of the internet... So if you have 2003, stick with it.. the new version isn't much better..",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n*Awarded PC Magazine's Editors' Choice Award in November 2003.* Symantec\u2019s Norton AntiVirus 2004 now comes with expanded detection of both known and emerging threats. Norton AntiVirus detects and removes viruses, worms, and Trojan horses automatically--without interrupting your work. It works in the background 24 hours a day to protect email messages, instant message attachments, Internet downloads, and other files. Now it can also detect viruses in compressed file archives before you open them, reducing the risk of infecting your computer. Symantec\u2019s exclusive LiveUpdate technology automatically checks for new virus protection updates on a regular schedule to keep the program up to date against the latest threats. It now even alerts you when your virus protection is getting outdated. Norton AntiVirus also defends your PC against emerging threats. Script Blocking intercepts fast-moving script-based viruses such as \"ILoveYou\" and \"Anna Kournikova,\" and Worm Blocking stops worms from using your outgoing email messages to infect other computers. The expanded threat detection in Norton AntiVirus 2004 alerts you to the presence of spyware, keystroke loggers, and similar programs that can steal personal information and leave your PC vulnerable to other attacks. Stop viruses and protect your PC with award-winning Norton AntiVirus. Small office packs for five or 10 users are also available. \n\n Features: \n\n * Expanded threat detection alerts you to certain non-virus threats such as spyware and keystroke logging programs. \n * Scans compressed file archives before you open them and risk infecting your computer. (Not available on Windows Me/98.) \n * Includes product activation procedure to ensure authenticity. \n * Automatically removes viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. \n * Scans and cleans both incoming and outgoing email messages. \n * Detects and blocks viruses in instant message attachments. \n * Downloads new virus protection updates automatically to protect against new threats.* \n * Worm Blocking detects worms such as \"Nimda\" in outgoing mail. \n * Script Blocking defends against fast-moving, script-based viruses such as \"ILoveYou\" and \"Anna Kournikova.\" \n * Worm Blocking and Script Blocking can detect new threats even before virus protection updates are created for them. \n\n *12 months of virus protection updates included with purchase of Norton AntiVirus 2004; annual subscriptions available online for subsequent updates per computer.",
