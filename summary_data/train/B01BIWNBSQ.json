Firstly it's a tad small, but this shouldn't matter if you are as close to the monitor as you should be. My but the main problem for me is that there is only 1 HDMI port which makes it a pain to switch between pc and console. Adapters are available to buy but that's not the point. Overall great product. Looks clean and the screen is fantastic and responsive. Highly recommend.",

There appears no way to improve the sharpness unless I increase the zoom on the screen. Perhaps this is more for gamers. Disappointed! :-(",
