Third week the power cord stopped working. It was loose to begin with, so I figured I would just buy a new one for $14.00. Worked for a week after that and the the machine stopped working all together and would only display an error message... I had to wrestle the damn thing back into the polystyrene and box to return it, but luckily UPS pickup was an option. So sad as I loved this treadmill!!!",

Jane at Rhythm and Fun was quick to respond. After prompt dialogue back and forth to explore options she offered to send a new treadmill. Well now I have my new treadmill set up. I did use Amazon to help with this and the tech was very good. It\u2019s a great treadmill. It folds easily to store under bed, couch or in my case vertically at the side of my wall unit. Customer service was stellar!!",

It doesn't have the option to change the elevation, but it also doesn't require you to lube the belt with this model. The control board is simple but effective for a treadmill desk setup. It is easy to move it around. Been using this for the last3 weeks now without any issues.",

They should figure out a better way to ship it though because there were a few pieces of plastic in the bottom of the box which had broken off of the trim.

Therefore if it is broken or lost the entire treadmill would be useless. There should be a start stop option on the machine itself and a second control remote as a backup. But over all I am happy with it. It came fully assembled which was very appreciate it.",

I've done some jogging on it on days when there's been bad weather and it's fine for a jog but wouldn't want to do a full speed run on it. It's 100% no frills and more expensive than other models like it, but it's 100% worth it for the longer deck on it compared to other models. Being 6\" a 42\" or 44\" deck wouldn't be long enough.",
