I can see it on objects maybe 10 yards away but not much farther away than that. the laser is so weak that it is imperceptible to the naked eye. Tried calling customer support, but they put me on hold for 30 minutes. It was nice they announced the wait time, but when by time came up after 30 minutes it went straight to a voicemail that was full. Seriously? The product may be great, but the tech support sucks and so far a miserable experience.",

Used it during the day in heavy brush and could identify different animals that I could not see with the naked eye 50-75 yards away. Could clearly see turkeys, deer and hogs walking in heavy cover!!!! I t was nothing short of amazing!! Thermal imaging at long range 500 plus yards was equally impressive. Clearly identify animals crossing trails that I would have never seen with my naked eye.",

The video feature is awesome. You get to show all your friends and family your hunts so they can see what it's all about. ATN scopes come with features you can't get with the bigger price range optics. Customer service is top notch too. Had a small issue with my scope and Oliver Vallero took care of me in a matter of minutes. This is my 3rd ATN scope and I definitely recommend you trying them out.",
