After we put the first one together, I was all set to give 5 stars BUT then we put the second one together and the drawer front is a completely different finish (see picture -- one drawer front has a nice wood grain, the other is just a plain no-grain veneer). They shipped at the same time from the same vendor. This doesn't effect their function at all and my 9 & 10 year olds don't seem to mind but if they were for use in my room, I'd return one.",

The door color did not match the rest of the table. When I get tired of looking at it I will paint the whole thing. I replaced the provided screws with pocket screws",

The pieces are not labeled and neither is the hardware. 3. If you have any kind of problems with your hands, you will need someone to put this together for you, because a lot of the screws need a hex key instead of a flat head or a Philips screwdriver. The table is worth the money, I bought 2 of them for beside my bed, and they look good and they are sturdy.",

There seems to be some contradictory reviews here on the materials of construction. Here's what I received: Made from *real* wood (appears solid, not plywood): table top, \"frame\", drawer pull, drawer sliders,screw cover thingys. Made from particle board: all other components except perhaps the drawer bottom. Made from \"other\" - drawer bottom. Hard to tell, could be heavy duty cardboard. Light duty use on this drawer! Equipped with a power drill and the two bits needed (phillips, 4mm), these can be assembled with ease in 20 minutes or perhaps less. Hope this helps in your purchasing decision :)",

The top and legs were solid wood, but the drawer (including the face) and bottom shelf were MDF. The drawer was also problematic when closing: The edges would get caught on the inner aspects of the table and would only close with much wiggling. Overall, the price reflects the quality: low cost, low quality. I'd rather spend slightly more on a better product. Also, $23 return fee (should have checked this out prior to ordering, I guess.)",

My husband put it all together while I was not home. To much trouble to take it apart and send back. It is sturdy the top is nice and for that I did give it 3 stars but almost gave it 2 stars.",

The legs are attached with screws and are reasonably sturdy (don't sit on it or place anything heavy on it). However, the drawer materials are made of sawdust compositon board and split when the attachment screws are inserted. The material also will not secure the screws well, as it it too soft. Therefore, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND glueing the components of the drawer together, or they will eventually fall apart. Due to the poor quality of materials in the drawer, I lowered the rating to 3-stars.",
