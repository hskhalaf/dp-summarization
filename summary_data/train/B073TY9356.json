As a note, I would recommend picking up a 3/8\" x 1-1/4\" fender washer if you're worried about a little more stability and sealing when mounting. Update: After being on my car just shy of 6 months, the rubber mast is cracking and the entire antenna is no longer black. It's now stained and turning gray, and has to be replaced already. For something that's supposed to weather the elements on a boat, it barely lasted a summer, fall and beginning of winter on my car. Won't buy again.",
