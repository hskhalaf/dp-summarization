      "text": "Trend Micro is one of the top security programs out there and it's a constant battle among Norton, McAfee and Trend Micro. The 2010 version, similar to Norton, shows lots of improvement. Faster and less intrusive. Also, I like the fact you can download the trial and then activate with the code from the box. A few annoyances about the program are the fact that it forces you to activate the program--which some consider a privacy violation. Additionally, the interface is confusing with constant upsells to purchase other options. For those that want another option besides Norton, this is a good one.",

Inserting the disc certainly opened up the installation app, but it kept crashing. I tried countless times, applied various updates to XP, Parallels, and nothing ever worked. Pretty disappointing. Even attempting to contact Trend MIcro wasn't any help.
