For days we tried. Finally had to call the Frigidaire Service Man, and he had to take the while back out to get this Filter out. It had an extra peg sticking out where the two connections are. It cost us $ 71.00. So hopefully we will have better luck with this one, because we did not know what was going on. Would have never bought this one had we known.",
