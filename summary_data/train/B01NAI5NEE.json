I could have probably got a few more beers in there but I would say 12-15 is a pretty good amount to throw in. Will sure beat lugging a big cooler up and down the beach.",

Realistically here you can carry 16-18(pushing it with 18) 12 oz cans with ice. The loop straps for the top look dainty, I wouldn't habitually pull those to open and close, better off just going straight from the zipper. The side compartments aren't bad, but not much netting to allow a deep well. Overall it's a solid choice for a backpack cooler.",
