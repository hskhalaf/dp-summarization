And this grill just cooks the meat so evenly and and I love it! Still looks great and it is nice and heavy duty. 5 stars for me!",

After talking to customer service about warranty which was another hassle, they were going to give me a deal on replacement part ( all grates, all the burners, flavor bars, top rack and the bottom big catch and the protects the propane tank and hoses) well after looking at the the frame it has fell apart so bad that you can not even put, the new burner or grates back in so I'm dead in the water. Will not be buying another nexgrill. Have pics but guess you can't post them.",

In short I would skip this one. This grill looks great in pictures but as soon as you actually get it and open the lid and feel the construction you\u2019ll have a very different opinion. This thing is VERY cheaply constructed with extremely thin metal and the so called stainless steel rusts quickly. It does seem, with gas grills at least, you get what you pay for. This unit is relatively inexpensive for all you Think you are getting and there is a reason why.",

I know this is common with gas grills, I just expected these to last longer. I hope my burners last long enough to justify spending $500 on a grill. Unless you can make your own heavy duty replacement flame guards like me I suggest either getting the cheapest grill you can and plan to replace it every few years, or save up for something like a Weber.",
