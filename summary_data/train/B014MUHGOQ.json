Does Smoke Hollow have any customer service presence on Amazon, other than selling? If so, I haven't heard from you. Amazon's resolution to the missing nuts/bolts was to send me an assortment pack of nuts/bolts that may or may not be heat treated, and questionable whether safe to use them in a device to cook food people consume. How about getting back with me, Smoke Hollow, and send the hardware that should have originally came with this smoker.",

      "text": "I've used this twice now. First time filled all racks. About 60 pounds of meat. Got to 225 degree's quickly. The bottom rack gets very hot. I rotated the meat half way through the smoke. Second round was about 30 pounds. Smoked 5 hrs. Moved bottom rack up about 4 inches. Finished off next day in crock pots cuz in a hurry. Worked great. Upgraded from a 5yr old 1 burner master-built. Would definitely recommend. Very pleased. Needed to open top vent at least 2 inched to keep the right burner from going out. The wood bins are better suited for chips, not chunks. Although smaller chunks work. Very pleased.",

After seasoning it I filled it with three racks of pork ribs, six chicken leg quarters, six ears of corn and six packs of mixed veggies (potatoes, carrots, onions & peppers). Everything turned out great! It was very easy to assemble. My only complaint was one of the sides was dented upon delivery. I was able to straighten it out without much effort and have not seen any problems from it. The door leaks a little, but that can be fixed with a little LavaLock High Temp Nomex BBQ Gasket.",

I also added 3 walls on the side and rear legs because he is in a windy area. I have had several smokers over the years but this is far better than those---I may have to get one for myself. The temp gauge was broken so I called the service number and another was sent out. So I used my meat probe hanging thru the smoke stack to read the temp until it arrived. I rarely use the drip pan supplied, I prefer to use heavy duty aluminum throw away trays",

First, the glass front will get dirty pretty quickly, and you'll need to clean it regularly if you want to be able to actually see the food. Second, you'll probably need to use something to seal the open seams between the metal pieces in order to conserve heat/smoke. Third, you'll need some Nomex/heat resistant liners to seal the door. I still love this smoker. I don't plan on getting another one until the this smoker's life has been spent. Just realize that there's some work to do on it if you get one.",

This thing is enormous and on my second smoke I did 6 racks of ribs, 5 lbs of pork chops, a 12lb Salmon and 10lbs of potatoes and still had a couple shelves to spare. I was very surprised that I could still get a good bark on my ribs and briskets! I highly recommend for doing a lot of food. It\u2019s too big to use for a single rack of ribs or half a pork loin as you\u2019d use a lot less propane on a smaller smoker. I\u2019m using around a pound of propane an hour on average.",

We do all of our own venison processing and he had grown out of his previous smoker. Seeing as he is so hard to buy for, I immediately knew what we would be getting him for this, his 45th birthday. The smoker has arrived, been assembled and has been seasoned and is now waiting for deer season to arrive. He is to antsy to use it, we may be buying some turkeys, ribs, and roasts just so he can use it before then.",
