It\u2019s a solid option for those who want to make quick and smooth transitions through the gait cycle. The shoe\u2019s upper, being nicely flexible, adapts very well to the changing movements and wraps itself securely around the runner\u2019s foot.",
      "pros": [
        "Many runners highly appreciated the light weight of the shoe",
        "Most wearers appreciated the minimalist design because it encouraged natural movements of the foot during running",
        "The customers thought the pair was optimally comfortable",
        "The runners mentioned how incredibly responsive the shoe\u2019s midsole was",
        "one such individual felt the shoe bouncing back and propelling him forward as he sprinted",
        "The purchasers liked the lace-up closure of the Under Armour Velociti since it secured their feet firmly, thereby ensuring a snug fit",
        "A few fashion-lovers admired the overall design of the shoe",

But they are very lightweight, the bottom of the shoe is so flexible and bendy, they feel and look like you can take flight in them. It hurt me to return them because I wanted to just stuff my foot in and go for a run. I plan on reordering a size 10.5 or 11 because they are exactly what I'm looking for, and I can tell they're good running shoes.",
