      "text": "When my husband and I started talking about having a baby I bought these strips mostly out of curiosity. They were very cheap so I thought why not... Well I have to say that they seem to work just fine and probably they helped us getting pregnant faster. I followed the instructions and they worked fine for me, giving consistent results every month. For the price I think it is totally worth it. Shortly after buying these I also purchased the pregnancy test strips and, when it happened, those actually gave me a much stronger signal than the test of another (much, much more expensive) brand.",
