As others have said, placing the ball of dough a bit off center towards the hinge side creates perfectly round, evenly thick tortillas every time. I've been making cassava flour tortillas with it. A sheet of parchment paper folded in half to cover top and bottom plates so that the press doesn't actually touch the dough means easy transfer to the pan and no clean up. I can see that this is going to get a lot of use. So much easier than using a rolling pin like I was doing before! The oven mitt that comes with is pretty nice too.",

My understanding is presses like this aren't the best for flour tortillas but for corn tortillas it works great. There are lots of cast iron tortilla presses on Amazon but it just so happens I needed a new oven mitt, so that's why I got this. There is no book, however.",

The press made it so quick and easy. I rolled balls, 50g each, sprayed parchment with oil and put the ball in the middle of the press between two parchment sheets and pressed until they were nearly to the edge. Peeled off the parchment and toasted on the griddle with a little coconut oil. Awesome!! Way easier and faster than a rolling pin, and perfect shape. Highly recommended!",
