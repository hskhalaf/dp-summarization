The laces make it possible to personalize the shoe to your foot. I have a high instep and often booties are uncomfortable, but that is not the case with these. The heel is not too high and very stable and comfortable. The color, deep sugar plum is just as it appears online and is a beautiful color that matches so many things.",

      "text": "I wanted these to fit and be so comfortable like other reviewers said. Part of the problem is that for open toed shoes, I'm between a 6.5 and 7. The 7 is too long, there is too much sole showing on toe box...but sometimes the 6.5 isn't wide enough. These are very good looking, I would rate them as a 1-2 hour wear time before they would bother me. Tight on the ankle for me..I sent them back and didn't like them enough to reorder.",

There is nobody to contact that sells the show to ask if they would match the new price since I bought them so soon they went down in price. Leather top's and heal is comfortable with the heigth it is and very secure when walking in this shoe",
