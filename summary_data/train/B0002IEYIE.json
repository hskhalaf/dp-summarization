This is a disappointment since it didn\u2019t arrived dry and sealed. Any suggestion in how to returned it?",

And they smell and stay cleaner longer using this... Of course it's not the same as professional groomers use but it's the next best thing for the price!

We ran out of our regular shampoo and the Earthbath was in the shower from his last bath, so I used it on my mid-back length hair.

It's not a bad smell but my dog is not a poodle so he doesn't need to smell like he just came out of the groomers. I'll dilute it down for the next bath in a 5:1 instead of 10:1 and see how it goes, but so far so good and he hasn't been scratching nearly as much.
