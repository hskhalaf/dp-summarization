First, it needs a 12v battery...or you can buy a nocqua battery pack for an extra $90+ with additional cables ($20). The mount doesn't have suction and can't be mounted to a kayak without purchasing additional mounting brackets ($35+). The screen isn't waterproof and doesn't appear to be well suited for taking out into saltwater where it may get splashed. It may be perfect for some pond fishing, but that's about it. All in, you'll spend over $240+ for this to get it powered and mounted. Needless to say, I returned mine.",

First, this unit has to be connected to a 12 volt power supply such as a car battery or one of those car battery booster type units. So if you plan to use it in a kayak you need to plan for a power source. Second, the screen/keyboard unit is not water resistant at all. If there is a chance of rain or spray you need a ziplock bag or some such to cover the thing.",

      "text": "Got it, hooked it up, took it out on my 12' inflateable boat. This fish finder worked great 1st time out, simple layout of controls, easy to navigate the menu and get right to using. Another feature i liked is it shows me the battery voltage so I knew the battery condition with my trolling motor running. Really happy with this purchase and it has a great price point. No rating on tech support because I havent used it.",

You need to put screws through the stern of your boat and seal it with caulk. Than run the wire to the front near your steering wheel and connect it to an electric source. The Garmin Striker 4 is an outstanding product at a great price.",

Have done some good fishing with it. Would recommend it for a inexpensive option. I didn't give it five stars because I would have liked a better stand for it.",
