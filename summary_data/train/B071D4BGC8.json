Uses one CR123a battery for both laser and dot which is great. Battery life seems fine with no off drain. Not real picky for red dot clarity, seems decent though.

I will never buy another cylindrical battery optic again. Cylindrical batteries slide fore and aft with every shot and springs wear out and fail to maintain contact.
