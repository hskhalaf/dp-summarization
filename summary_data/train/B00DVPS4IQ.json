It took me about 5 days to see a faint second line, and it darkened every day after that. I took my drug screen, a 5 panel ecup urinalysis, on day 12 of no smoking and was offered the job 3 days later. I did nothing more than my normal morning walk and water throughout the day. You can trust them.",

The other test was from the dollar tree for just a dollar. Like I said I've used them before and was never steered wrong. These easy at home tests are throwing up false positives i won't highly not recommend this product to anyone.

I used Strip, a masking/detox agent, checked my urine with the test strips and it had a very faint pink line. I immediately took my required UA and passed. In my experience, they've worked great!",
