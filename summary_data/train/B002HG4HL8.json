We use Coola as sunscreen right now, so decided to try the lip balm as well. In summary, if you have ever used their sunscreen, you will know that the aerosol has a chemical smell to it when you put it on. I would not think that they would do the same thing on the lip balm as it goes \"in your mouth\". In summary, i would not recommend this product and will not be purchasing it again moving forward.",
