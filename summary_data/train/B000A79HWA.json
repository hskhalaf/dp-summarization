This nailgun certainly does the job, but I had 2 issues: 1. It was a little heavier than other framing nailers I've used. For weekend warriors such as my self an all day project may make you fatigued. 2. The rubber grip is not tight on the tool. This means if I don't grasp it firmly the grip slips around easily on the handle. This may not be the case with everyone. Other than these 2 things I haven't had any problems like jamming etc.",
