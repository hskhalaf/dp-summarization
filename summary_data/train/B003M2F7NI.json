One of the accessories, the brush, perhaps the most useful accessory, consists of two pieces that will always detach themselves on lateral movements, making the brush practically useless (-1). Overall, you spend half your time reconnecting the suction tube and accessories together when you use it. Making the suction tube supple and using connectors to hold everything together would make this tool fantastic.",

It\u2019s just that good. Everything is well thought out from the inside to the outside. Especially hose and power cord storage when it goes back on the shelf. I like it a lot, and so do my co-workers.",

I will carry it with me when I travel.",

But in general this small vacuum will finish your task and has a ton of great attachments.",

When I wiped the surfaces with a damp rag, there was very little residue left. I've used every attachment while vacuuming, and it work every well. While I haven't used it for wet vacuuming yet, I have no doubt it will work well. This is a great deal for the price.",
