One of the seven Continents on Earth where this product was produced choose to make things inexpensively, but forgo quality in the process. I would be willing to pay a fair price for a quality product. Unfortunately there are few, if any, North American vendors remaining in the manufacturing business.",

Only caution is to make sure your Chain-stay Tube is sufficiently oval, or it will rotate.

But if the bike were smaller, and the distance from the rear hub and the pedals a little shorter, I would have to send it back. But in my instance it works perfectly.

I could have lived with that, but what did me in is then the bolt for adjusting height of the stand sheared off while I was tightening it.

It doesn't seem to rattle and is well constructed. I'm not rock-hopping or bike racing so the convenience of a kickstand certainly outweighs any sliver of extra weight. It might be nice if they included a modest wrench for the installation, but I had a set of handy hex wrenches.",

After tightening the screws about as tight as I could, the kickstand still has a tendency to slide out. The problem is that the oval clamp doesn't attach solidly to the round frame. Also, it attaches farther to the rear of the bike than standard kickstands so even if the kickstand doesn't slide out, it still isn't very stable. Long story short, I'm still looking for a good aftermarket kickstand.",
