Searched for a 7ft long TV Stand, in similar height.. All were over $500 plus . I had the center cabinet, and saw the book cases would look as good, or better. Very happy with choice. All pieces fit as expected. Excellent craftsman ship (for the price)..I had 2 tall cabinets, next to my component cabinet. Replaced these tall cabinets with the short ones.I can tilt my TV and watch from the dining room , kitchen. and family room.",

It is important to orient pieces the right way. While these are not as sturdy as custom solid oak shelving I had made years ago, I have normal books and audio equipment on them with no signs of fatigue or sagging shelves. The top and frame are nicely finished oak; shelves and back appear to be laminate, but they're in shadows if there are items on the shelves, and the whole effect is a lot more elegant than you might expect for the low price.",

All are heavy particleboard and they tend to have very good instructions and hardware has always been exactly what was needed (or occasionally a few extra pieces). If it has a fault, it's that the particle board can splinter easily so you have to be VERY VERY CAREFUL when putting the nails into the back to hold on the backboard. In addition this one came with an imperfection in the top which wasn't an issue with this one since it went in the closet. Still a bit annoying. Returning it would be monumentally difficult.",
