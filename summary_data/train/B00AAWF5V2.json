It began scratching using non scratch utensils and it also started sticking, despite repeated curing. The \"Lifetime Warranty\" is meaningless as it does not cover \"normal use\" only \"defects\". Is a pan advertised as non-stick and non-scratch that does scratch and stick not defective? Only buy this if you want to pay $35 for a pan that only lasts about a year. I would never buy another Tramontina product.",

In fact, food slides so easily it's sometimes difficult to get a spatula under it, it just pushes away. UPDATE: It's been 10 months and the pan, after nearly daily use, is no longer non-stick. I suppose that's a decent life for non-stick pans, but I can't see adding to the landfill every several months, so I'm going to try a carbon steel pan.",
