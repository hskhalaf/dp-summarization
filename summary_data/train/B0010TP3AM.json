I'm sure it was several years newer too! I worry this seller is peddling old products. This one has to be a decade or so to be that dry and cracked up, wouldn't it?",

The brush and polish and daubers are high quality. The cloth was predictably useless. You will never see a shoe shine guy using a tiny little bit of chamois. I would pay more for a larger piece of chamois.",
