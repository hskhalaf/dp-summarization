I wash it right away and dry it so I can put it away since my son grabs dishes from the clean rack to prevent any accidents. so far I have used it to cut walnuts and strawberries and I feel this cutter did a good job. I'm excited to use it for other things as I'm sure it'll cut down on the prep time.",

I thought it was going to be something tough to use and yet surprised me when I only used 3 fingers to make a miracle for my Cowboy Caviar. I chopped Onions, peppers, garlic, tomatoes, celery and scallions and then noticed my wife was mad cause she wanted to use it. NOT JOKING. This is the best thing for a single person or a family. A MUST HAVE.",
