Update: This company has fantastic customer service and replaced the injector and were incredibly kind and professional. I'm very impressed and appreciative.",

I injected several pieces of chicken and pork in preparation for smoking and the needles were nice and sharp and the fluid flowed easily, not problems at all. The case is cardboard, but it has nice cut-outs to keep everything organized. The cleaning brushes are also a nice touch. Overall I am very impressed with this product.",

Most people's knife skills(including mine) are not that good. I like to use a mini chopper or an immersion blender to process the marinade. Or you can use a commercially made marinade.",
