Unfortunately when they open them some of the chocolates have slipped around into other slots and some days have no chocolate, some two or more! Not very much fun. I have not tasted the chocolate but according to them it\u2019s not very good either. I won\u2019t waste my money on these again.",

Unfortunately, the calendars were dented and creased in the corners. The first door we opened, the chocolate was gross looking (see pics)! We ended up throwing some of the candies in the garbage. I was willing to pay more for the calendars just for the nostalgia factor but unfortunately I was disappointed with the overall quality for the money.",

    "description": "2 pack of advent calendars with each December day's window containing a piece of chocolate and a special double door for Christmas Eve (December 24th). A fun way to countdown to Christmas with a daily chocolate treat. The advent has been celebrated since the 4th century AD. Originally, it began at the end of the feast of Saint Andrew and lasted until Christmas. Today, the advent is celebrated starting on December 1st and lasts until Christmas Eve. The tradition of calendars can be traced to the German Protestants. During the advent they would mark the days with chalk or lit calendars. While popular in many European countries, advent calendars were not popular in the United States until a photo was released showing President Dwight D. Eisenhower opening the doors of a calendar with his grandchildren. PeA is happy to be a part of the Christmas season and tradition for many families. As the #1 selling imported advent calendar in the United States, PeA has proved time and time again to bring merriment. Each door features a different piece of molded chocolate that\u2019s sure to inspire yuletide cheer!. This 2-pack features one santa and one snowman design, each calendar contains 24 doors, with a piece of milk chocolate behind each. Make it one of your holiday traditions.",
