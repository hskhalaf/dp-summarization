      "text": "I actually really like this pillow, which is saying something as I return most of them. It seems well made, didn't smell too badly, I aired it out and used it the same day. I would only wish it was an inch thicker all the way around. Even petite as I am, my head will go through it and end up nearly on the bed - about two inches from it. I love the way it cradles my head though so I push it up against another pillow for more support. It is not a stand alone pillow for me but I think it will last a good long time and it meets most of my expectations.",

This is the first pillow that has given me enough options to shift easily, cradle my head and neck perfectly and fall back to sleep without all the plumping shifting that wakes you and is so very frustrating. I love it and just ordered another. I have a temperpedic, a coop, and so many more. This one cradles your head in so many ways.",

I don\u2019t wake with tingeling in my arm ( I\u2019m a side sleeper). Also with some pillows I my ears would hurt if I laid to long in one side...not this one. I\u2019ve spent loads of money on pillows, but this one hands down is the best one yet! Hopefully, it will last a long time! I plan on updating my review in a few months.",

I have used feather, polyester and memory foam pillows. Nothing has worked! This pillow is simply amazing and would buy it again.",

I am totally being truthful when I say after my first night with my cradle pillow my neck and shoulders felt better. Each night has brought increased relief. Hope it lasts!",

I love that I can turn it around when I need more support, and I love the wings that make lying on my side comfortable too. It did take me about 2-3 nights to get used to it, but now I'm convinced I can't live without it. If you suffer from back and neck pain, do yourself a favor and buy this pillow!",
