I chose this phone because of the screen size and I have to say I'm glad I did. Content looks rich in colour and with the 6\" screen it's easy on the eyes. Phone runs the latest andriod platform so is quick and responsive. Photo quality is very good, however in very dark situations it does struggle a little but that's me being picky. I give this phone 5 stars due to price, quality and feel.",

Best of all it does not automatically install apps without my permission that I do not want and cannot get rid of (unlike the S7 edge).

      "text": "I'd always had Sony mobiles until the last one, I had a Blackview A20, big mistake! I tried to get used to it but after 5 months I gave up and have gone back to Sony. This XA2 Ulra is fantastic. Easy to use, comfortable to hold (and I have small hands) plenty of memory, quick to respond, I could go on and on. So, yes, I definitely recommend this phone, I love it!! ps Forgot to say, I'm a 73 year old Great Grandmother who loves technology \ud83d\udc75\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a",
