They tell you to run the Dremel on high, at the highest RPM, for 5 minutes with no load on it. I did this and could hear the unit running smoother as the 5 minutes went on. I then read to do the flexible attachment on high, hanging straight, for 2 minutes. I did this as well. Then I started using it and put some major loads on it and had no issues. Still works like a charm! Great kit and I\u2019m very happy with it.",

My dad has one that's a few years old and that still works perfectly.",

This set has pretty much everything someone needs to get a good amount of use out of the ubiquitous multitool. While I still havent employed nearly half of the many add-ons having them on hand in one set is great for keeping thing organized and readily on hand.",

The tool itself is worth the price and the 5 star review, it is easy to handle, tons of variable adjustability, does not heat up, just perfect. The only reason this kit receives 4 stars is due to the attachments which could be a lot better. They wear out fast and are generally over priced. Much better to just buy the base Dremel tool and then get one of the many wonderful accessory kits that amazon sells.",
