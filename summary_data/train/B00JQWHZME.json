I haven't driven with it yet, just loaded it up with some fishing gear to see how things fit. So far, so good.",

I was initially concerned that it would not fit, but the mounts are adjustable sliding front and back and locked afterward. It took me about 15-20 minutes initially and will take about five minutes for subsequent mounts. I did not notice anything different when driving in town and on the interstate at 65 mph. I will follow-up with a mileage update after a trip. Overall, I am very pleased with the Skybox!",

Pros: - Looks the least awkward - Holds a ton of gear for its size - Installs easy for two people and a step ladder - Gives you a bit more peace of mind re: parking garage ceilings and air resistance Cons: - Too expensive to have lock mechanism issues and debris/water getting inside",

We mounted it on a 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee which already had a factory rack. It worked beautifully. The locks are a little tough to work at first. We sprayed dry graphite in the keyhole to help with the sticking key. Purchasing from Amazon's warehouse was the best. I'd advise anyone to look there when looking for something like this. Thank you Amazon, you made my son's Christmas!",
