Happily, new neutral colors of the Ghost 11 and 12s make the Ghost even more appealing since, at 70 yrs old, my days of cutesy flats are about over. So back to wearing Ghost! Most important to do so after a torn tendon in my foot wearing those cutesy flats along with bunions and arthritic knees now too. Am a very active walker, not runner.",

My only complaint and reason I had to return was the fact that I wear a wide shoe and these Ghosts did not feel wide like the Brooks Adrenlines I also own. Could have just been a a missed tag on the shoe or box, either way still very much impressed with Brooks shoes and reordered another a pair of Brooks.",

And the insole is becoming less supportive even though the shoes are not yet 5 months old. Will be rethinking my commitment to this line.",

When I put these on to run my feet don\u2019t hurt like in other shoes. I even bought $150+ shoes because my feet hurt so much. These are amazing. I do have to say after two months the amazing feeling turns to an ok feeling but you are suppose to buy new shoes every so many miles but I can\u2019t afford to keep doing that. I would say these are mid priced shoes and totally worth the money.",

Reasonably priced compared to other high end shoes (which never fit as well or were as comfortable.) I highly recommend them!",
