Her left ear was extremely bloody looking, clogged up, has thick gunk in her ear and since I've used this product in the last month or so. It's been clearing up and i see less gunk in her ear. The product suggests twice a day but since I forget one I go to work I do once a day and occasionally skip one day. The scent smells so good! I wish I had a shampoo like that. Its fresh and subtle.",
