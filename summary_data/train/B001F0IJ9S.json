      "text": "Awesome for yard training for pups. Lightweight but very stong and didn't fray. If they are headed into road i just step on the end without having run after them. Plus if they are around the corner I can easily know their whereabouts by looking for the end of the leads. Sometimes they get caught around a tree or our swing but easy to undo. Highly recommend and money well spent. Yes you can get a rope burn if they are high-speed running while holding it but easily preventable with common sense.",

They sent me a new check cord along with a prepaid return label to send the old one back. Great customer service by SportDog.",

Might be a good product for a dog who doesn't have a lightening speed razor chew. The orange color is great, easy to keep track of the line and not trip. Bummed we can't use it anymore.",

What I like about this long line is the bright color which makes it easy to identify my dog, and the diameter of the cord which is just right for holding in your hand. My cord does get tangled plenty though when I clip it on my dog so I question the \"tangle-free\" marketing. I usually have to spend 10 or 15 minutes untangling after using it on my dog. I also felt they could have at least burned the end of the cord or somehow sealed it so it's not just a chopped piece of cord at the tail end.",

I purchased the SportDog Orange Check Cord and was impressed by it's durability, the fact that the color didn't fade, and that it is strong enough for a 127# dog. I highly recommend the SportDog Orange Check Cord.",
