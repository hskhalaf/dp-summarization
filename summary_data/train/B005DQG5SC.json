If you want a better glass, smaller foot print and more light go with the Nikon.",

The neck strap easily interchanges between the binocs and the pouch, the lense covers are simple yet well made, the eyecups are comfortable and easy to find the adjustment detents, and the focus is fast without being twitchy.

I'm very happy with the endeavors - picture is crisper from what I can tell, lens caps are great, little-no fog build up, and the magnification of these with a 32MM objective is much more stable than 8 x42s with seemingly little-no dropoff in magnification.

I don't think this binocular is quite as good optically as the very best binoculars on the market, but some of those binoculars cost more than 7!! times as much as this one. I think the optics of the Vanguard are very good and the binocular handles very well. The focus and diopter adjustments work great. The eyecups work well for me when I'm wearing eyeglasses. The binocular is a pleasure to hold--it is well-balanced and the armoring material is very comfortable.",

    "description": "Size:8x42\n\nVanguard's Endeavor ED binoculars provide nature and outdoor enthusiasts high performance features at an incredible value. Premium ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass with MultiGuard coatings allow for sharp, bright images and high contrast even in low-light conditions. The ED glass aligns the colors to meet at the same focal plane to reduce the chromatic aberration and obtain the highest resolution and image contrast. As a result, the image is sharper.\n\nEndeavor ED features an ergonomic, open-bridge design that's comfortable to use, along with a lightweight magnesium alloy body, large center focus wheel, and 3 stage twist out eyecups, . Nitrogen-charged and O-ring sealed, the Endeavor ED is water and fog proof to take on challenging weather conditions. Emerald Coating is specifically designed to provide the full spectrum of color within the band of green tones. This coating is essential for nature enthusiasts, because it ensures the most vivid and natural shades of green.\n\nP2 Phase Coating was developed for enhanced image clarity and true color reproduction. Vanguard's P2 phase-coated BaK4 prisms creates crystal clear images and high resolution observation. V-Max Silver Coating provides crisper, more vivid images and sharper contrast due to impressive light reflection. Anti-Reflection Coating on all air-to-surface lenses dramatically minimizes light reflection on the lens. Coupled with fully multi-coated treatment, it ensures near perfect light transmission and image recognition, enabling the brightest images possible, even on the sunniest days.",
