      "text": "We were VERY skeptical that our 70 lb female German Shepherd would be any bit interested in a wheel chair. She was diagnosed with Degenerative Myeliopathy 2 months ago and it was progressing quickly. Heartbroken that our 10 yr old pup was accelerating into full-on mobile disability; and with the help of the best holistic vet on the planet, we got the wheels. Our sassy pup LOVES them. She can poop and pee in her wheels, she can still chase the bunnies, and she is much happier to be Ms. Independent trailblazing through the forest, instead of us holding her back end up with a harness every where she goes. For such skeptics, we are beyond elated with our purchase.",
