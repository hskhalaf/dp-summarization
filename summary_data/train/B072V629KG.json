I got it one what they were offering was the pretty one with the flowers all over it. I wasn't sure how it was going to work but I am completely satisfied. It's lightweight tiny easy to use and with my cluttered workstation it doesn't take up a whole lot of space. It's easy to move from one side to the other so I'm not twisting my whole body to accommodate the lamp. And the appearance is so beautiful. I absolutely love love LOVE this lamp!",

This product dries my gel polish very fast. Pretty much cutting 1/2 of my nail curing time over my old UV Lamp. The reason why I gave this product 4 start over 5 is because of the plastic cover inside is very hard to take off. As you can see in the picture, there are still bits of pieces stuck inside. Overall, I would recommend this product! My nails turns out great.",

The only reason ik give 4 stars is because the little decal on it that says 36 watt started to come off immediately....I kind of liked the decal lol thats the only reason it lost a star for me. I was surprised the decal came off with how much I baby this lamp. I don't want to have to buy another one so I am super careful with it. Performance wise this lamp is great and I highly recommend you purchase one.",
