My son's head gets a little sweaty where it cinches, but otherwise it's comfortable. It provides maximum coverage for the face, ears, and neck. The cinch around the head provides a perfect fit for little noggins and the chin strap keeps it in place. My kiddo never complains about having this hat on. If your child is going through the hat pulling phase, note that the chin strap just snap off on one side if they pull hard enough.",

It's very hard to find a hat in her size, which is a bit smaller than the smallest official adult size. Her hats, when she can find any, come from the kids' rack. This one luckily has n size-adjustment band, so when it surprisingly turned out to have a larger-than-expected crown, she could compensate for that. Now the hat fits comfortably around her forehead though the crown still looks about a half-inch too big for her all around. Otherwise, this is a nice, well-made hat for the price.",

They couldn't have been more right! This hat packs super well (takes a little smoothing out, but not terrible by any means) and, most importantly, the brim stays up no matter what! All the time! Revolutionary as far as wide brim hats for children go. And even better, my daughter loves it and will actually wear it. Super adjustable and anticipate she'll have a few more years out of it - she's almost 3 and I got the \"2-8 years\" size. Would highly recommend!",

I also LOVE the design of the chin strap.

The adjustable head strap makes the hat small enough to fit her head right now and and will expand as she grows. The chin strap is easy to use/adjust and stays put and keeps the hat on her head. The brim of the hat is a little stiffer than most other sun hats so it sticks out straight all around her head giving her head, face, neck, and shoulders shade. She wears it with no fuss. She seems comfortable in it and it doesn't get in her way or block her view. Great hat!",

She did leave it on once the glare from the sand and sun started to bother her without it. No sun damage at all to our little one!",

Must have been comfortable to wear because my 14 mo. old grandson never tried to take it off. The breakaway strap is great. Highly recommend this hat.",
