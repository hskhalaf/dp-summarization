It also makes it nice to have a seat when there is no other place on a job site. I have buckets with parts trays the fit inside and having them right under me save a lot of trips to look for them. It is very well made and can be used as a rolling palet for many items.",

We have 8 different scents, and they all roll under a work station to be out of the way when we're not refilling from them. The rollers are perfect because they don't take up a lot of room outside the parameter of the bucket, they are very easily maneuvered, and they are super sturdy. The buckets weigh 50 lbs when we fill them, and the rollers handle them very well. Wish we would have bought them a few years ago. Riverdance Soapworks LLC",
