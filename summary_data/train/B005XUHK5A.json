If you happen to have an appropriate velcro strap handy that would work also but not quite as easy to use as a rubber band.",

As a level for posts and other such items, this level is fine. Just be ready to use a rubber band on metal pipes. The magnets are worthless.",

This is the first time that Irwin has let me down. (This *might* work on square steel posts that would have more surface area in contact with the steel post.)",
