We got it for our trip to Australia and New Zealand and took thousands of pictures over the course of a month. I love the light weight and small size. I use a wrist strap instead of a neck strap and that is very handy. Battery life was fine, but I did buy some extra batteries and needed one when we were out all day. The features available are amazing, but it is still easy to use. I will be mastering it for months more to come. There are some great tutorials on the web and I'd encourage you to watch them.",

I bought an excellent tripod here as well -. Thank-you so much Amazon! :)",

Seriously though, if you\u2019re looking for an excellent mirrorless dslr, look no further. Even though this model is a few years old, it is still extremely powerful and will blow the doors off many new cameras in the price range.",

I must say I am very pleased with the quality of the photographs,it is so light even with an additional 200mm zoom lens.

The main advantage of the a6000 is its fast focusing speed where the eos m2 is lacking. There are other major differences but the main drawback for a6000 is that the mobile for transferring photos via wifi is not working and it is the deal breaker for this camera. Shame on sony.",

I never tried the facial recognition and eye focus, for example. But I will now. My only complaint is that Sony chose not to include a 3.5 mm microphone jack. The only microphones input is through the multi-interface-shoe and it doesn't work well. But for still photography it is a great camera and the video itself is good.",

The only thing you give up is the extreme small size of the NEX-5 body, and the magnesium material use in the NEX-5.

      "text": "I don't think there's a better APS-C mirrorless camera, or even a DSLR, out there - and certainly not at this price. I've found the controls to be intuitive and highly customizable. The autofocus is as fast as you'll find in a mirrorless ILC and the autofocus lock-on has been a dream come true for me as I shoot fast moving working dogs. My only real complaint is that the pop-up flash cannot wirelessly trigger an external flash. You'll need to shell out $300 or more for one of Sony's flash units. Or, alternatively, you could buy radio controllers. Regardless, it's an annoyance.",

It is also everything Sony A5000 wasn't: lighting fast shooting, fast focusing, good low light performance, good viewfinder, very portable. The only minuses I see are the battery (expected and quite normal for this type of camera) and very expensive E-mount lenses. For now I rely on the fast and clear E-mount Sigma 30mm prime that works perfectly w/ the camera.",

If you used two batteries in a grip (even if Sony) the chips don't agree with eachother and the camera shuts off saying improper battery installed. You can't use off market lithium batteries. If you're shooting a wedding or sports event you CANNOT miss a single second. Having your camera turn on and say \"Screw you, I won't turn on\" even though the battery is 80%, is beyond frustrating.

The menu is a bit skimpy, but the in-camera help menu is just fine. It is a bit larger, however, and won't fit in the small leather fannypack I used for the NEX.
