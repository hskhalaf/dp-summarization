Using the included stand (which tilts the keyboard downward, away from you), it's much more natural resting position for your hands - if you hold your hands out flat, palms down, in front of you then let them drop, the position they fall into is very similar to where they are when using this keyboard.

I've always had good things to say about this Microsoft ergonomic keyboard and I think anybody that wants a good ergonomic keyboard at a fair price that's going to last them should buy this. after about two years I wear all of the paint off of the keys is the only complaint that I have is that the numbers and letters on the core keys that I use a lot do end up getting rubbed off and worn off",

Now that we are 100% remote since March 2020, I purchased the same one for my home office and it still works EQUALLY as effective here at home. Your hands are positioned correctly as you type and your wrists lay at the proper angle WITHOUT cramping and risk of injury. I highly recommend this keyboard. Also, it arrived AHEAD of schedule which is ALWAYS a bonus!",

Some of the keys are stiff and not as 'soft touch' as I'd like so that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. However some of the keys are starting to soften as I use it; hoping the whole keyboard will loosen up. Would definitely recommend this keyboard.",

Second drawback regarding this issue is that you still need to map manually the 'F-(1-12)' keys to make it work correctly. Another features that this keyboard lacks of is the inclusion of at least an extra usb port, which most other brands support already. Otherwise this keyboard is great and I do recommend it",

      "text": "I absolutely love this keyboard. I have been a medical transcriptionist for over 10 years and have used this keyboard almost from day one. I have never had wrist pain or issues. I just replaced the first one I bought several years ago. The only reason I replaced it was the letters had worn off the keys and the spacebar started to stick, probably from years of multiple spills. It takes a little getting used to at first because of the design but definitely the best keyboard I have ever used.",
