Searched online and people are saying you need to update the firmware in Windows 7 for it to work with Windows 10 (I'm on 1809 update). Tried this and there was no firmware available. It also didn't work in Windows 7 as the label software it comes with is utter trash. The free paper roll provided was 62x8 but there was no such paper size option in the program. Do yourself a favor and buy another up-to-date product. Dymo are superior and actually work.",

The software it comes with is great, as it is divided into \u2018basic\u2019 and \u2018advanced\u2019 tabs. So you can rattle off a basic address label super quick, or drop into \u2018advanced\u2019 mode, and create everything from a drawer label with graphics, to a 1 metre long banner with huge text. Print quality is good. Print speed is fast, and the V shaped cutter is ultra reliable. Highly recommended.",

It is not a good idea to put a label sheet through a printer more than once as the adhesive can catch on the printer internals and jam the printer. This printer does what I need and more - I am still discovering what it can do! Good value, easy to use and very versatile.",

I like the option of cutting after each label or at the end of the printing job or not at all, plus manual cutting with a press of the button. Each option can be useful in a different situation. I like that it supports continuous printing, so long labels can be created with the right tape, or one can use manufacturer set label sizes.
