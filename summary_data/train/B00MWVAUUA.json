This should prevent the ends from coming loose. This should be OK for occasional use.",

Mallet is a tad bigger than I thought but not a huge issue. Has a very nice weight to it so it's neither too heavy or too light. The interchangeable/replaceable heads is a nice touch as well. Don't think I'll be needing to replace them any time soon but it's nice to know I have that ability. I saw several other similar mallets with multiple heads but I thought that might be a bit overkill for my needs. Overall, really nice multipurpose mallet.",

I use it mostly for woodworking, but its also great for assembly and general tinkering. It doesn't leave a mark or damage the object you're working on unless you're really ignorant. So far the plastic end has held up pretty well after repeated banging. Seems to be better quality than the comparable Harbor Freight hammer. The screw on ends are a little loose and won't tighten down to my satisfaction, and the Tekton sticker peeled off easily, leaving sticky residue, but for the price, you can't beat it. Great tool to have around the garage.",

The black hard nylon handle feels like it carries the weight of a blow with stronger contact. If you are working on tacking or something fragile, you'll be using the red head for clear consistent striking. You cannot beat this price! Great overall mallet.",
