      "text": "So it's mentioned on the directions that this might cause a 'little irritation/ mild burning\" but, maaan, does this stuff kill my face right before bed time. I've combined with some acne treatment as well as The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution, and have since, seen little/ no difference in the hydration of my face when removing this specifically from my skin care regimen. Also note: I have dry/ combo/ sensitive skin. So? If you've the same skin as me, I'd recommend deleting it before checkout... Or, buy it for curiosity and see if it's a better fit for you.",
