The heavy lifting is done by a Texas Instruments PCM2705, with an SNR of 98db, sample rates of 32, 44.4, and 48 kHz. This is an older USB 1.1 complaint device and has since been replaced by the PCM2705C with USB 2 compliance. The device itself works perfectly for connecting studio monitors to my PC.",

When playing music on both computers, I can switch between them without the audio skipping a beat, no setup required. No driver necessary. This is it!",
