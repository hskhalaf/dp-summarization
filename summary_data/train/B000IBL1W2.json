I am pretty sure you will like to have this kit.",

No serious handy person is buying this to do real work. If you're buying it for your teenager moving into the dorms, it's fine. If you're buying it and have any intentions to do more than hang a picture or assemble some flat-pack furniture, I'd strongly encourage you go to your local big box hardware store, buy an inexpensive tool box and a hand select a few store-brand essentials. It won't cost you much more and you'll have far better results.",

The tools may not be industrial grade, but they are more than tough enough for home use. I also experienced some very cheap tools that you can use once or twice before they break.
