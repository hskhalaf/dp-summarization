It comes with a saw for cutting meat. Or small branches. Cannot speak to dishwasher safety as I bought this for use up at my cabin in the woods- I'm fortunate enough to have running water and dishwashers are a want to have not a need to have. Peace.",

As per the usual with their products, this turner is solid/well made. It's clear this will hold up to many years of use/abuse. The length of the handle is perfect for grilling and the serrated edge is simply a must for any grilling turner. Highly recommended, but you should already know this is good stuff--it's OXO!!",

The 16\" Grilling Turner has a wide head with a beveled edge for sliding under foods and is also great for scraping off the grill. One side of the Turner head is serrated for cutting into meat to test for doneness. The Tongs feature angled, scalloped heads for lifting even heavy food to remove from the grill. Both tools have long handles and soft, non-slip grips to keep you safely away from the grill while still cooking everything to perfection. The locking tab on the Tongs keeps them closed when not in use and both the Tongs and Turner have hanging hooks for storage and are dishwasher safe.",
