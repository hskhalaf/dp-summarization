I've also used it for general tummy problems at home and it seems to relieve those, too. The pills are very small and dissolve easily, which is a blessing in itself when I'm medicating my children under 10 or so. There's no real taste either. I'm thrilled to have found a natural alternative for treating motion sickness!",

I then popped two tablets under my tongue.and within a short time I literally felt totally grounded and enjoying the sway of the ship. I used them three or four times over the course of the week and each time I had the same experience. Great for me. Perhaps they will work for you. No side effects either.",
