Holds two 750 milliliter bottles of wine, making it ideal for entertaining, with a distinct, horn-like shape to ease pouring and minimize splash. Unique design, plus you can return leftover wine back into the bottle, with the smaller-than-average pouring spout.",

The good thing about this horn design is that it makes it a lot easier to pour the wine into a glass or back in the bottle. The narrow spout allows a lot more certainty about where the wine is going to go. So it's working for me.",
