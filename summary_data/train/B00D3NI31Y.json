He quickly gained several pounds and I asked them to try the feeder at least for a couple days. It took him about a day or two to completely figure out how to use it (and yes, you will need to withhold feeding your cat until they figure out how to get the food out), but once he did they haven't gone back to bowl feeding since and they love watching him use the food tree! I would recommend this feeder to all cat owners!",

      "text": "Does what it says. There's a rotatable part on one of the levels that allows you to alter the size of the holes on that level, which has the effect of slowing down how easy it is for the cats to get the food down/out. So depending on how determined/lazy your cat's are (or how quickly you want the fun to be over), you can adjust it somewhat to your liking :)",

He thinks the different brand of kibble is a treat, and will use the tree when he wants a snack. He's very sneaky and will stick his paw in the hole on top and hit the kibble as hard as he can, which is hilarious. The only thing is you have to clean it often since it gets dusty and be vigilant that the kibble just doesn't sit there all the time and get stale obviously.",

    "description": "Color:greenThe Food Tree Cat Toy is based on the original Catit Food Maze but with several major design upgrades! The Food Tree is difficult to knock over thanks to its new broad stable base, and the top opening was reduced to prevent cheating cats from directly accessing the kibble in the cat bowl. The Senses 2.0 Food Tree acts as a cat slow feeder and is the feeding solution for cats that tend to eat quickly. Cats are required to move the dry kibble or treats from the top to the bottom of the cat puzzle by pawing through the side openings. The kibble ends up in a whisker-stress free cat food bowl, which prevents spillage. The slow feeder cat bowl can be set to various levels of difficulty by rotating the middle disc and adjusting the opening sizes. This cat puzzle feeder is also super easy to disassemble and clean; simply remove the base and top then handwash. We recommend that you handwash this item with natural soap (free of abrasive materials) and water. Catit is focused on creating cat enrichment toys for all cats especially indoor cats. Cat toys for indoor cats should encourage a cat\u2019s natural foraging and hunting behaviors. Our Catit Senses 2.0 line has created a wide variety of cat toys, with this in mind. To keep your cat interested, you need to change their toy set-up often, Catit Senses 2.0 is the only cat toy series that allows you to create new and exciting setups for your cat, quickly and easily! Each toy was designed to activate and stimulate your cat\u2019s unique senses, all in one fresh, green style to match any home interior, no matter the arrangement.",
