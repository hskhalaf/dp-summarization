We were using diaper creams, corn starch, baking soda, we were cleaning it, we were drying it after every change, it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. We were at a loss. Finally, I got luvs brand as a gift (we had been trying other brands as well), but these did it! 3 days in luvs and that butt rash cleared right up! She\u2019s so much happier! And for $20-25 for 252 diapers, who can beat that price?!",

Unfortunately, I get headaches easily from scents, and compared to other popular diaper brands (we used Pampers Swaddlers), these are so unnecessarily perfumed. It is pretty strong, so if you are sensitive to scents (or if you dislike the chemicals making your baby's butt smell like eau de parfum), I would probably stick with another brand.",
