Mr Pen has high quality materials and i love the fact that all items come in a clear heavy duty open and close bag to hold everything. Plus Mr. Pen's cute mustache makes learning fun,even a mustache sticker is included. This set is sitting proudly on my son;s desk. I am very happy with my purchase!",

I can imagine having this set as a great asset with my school supplies (if I were a student) from the time you start using a compass through college.",
