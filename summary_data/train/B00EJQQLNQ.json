There's no handle on the top so it's kind of awkward to pick up. I got it mainly for hardwood floors. When I used the floor attachment, all the hair (mine and pets) got stuck in the bristles and had to be untangled and manually fed into the suction tube. I then tried the carpet attachment - it too was heavy, not easy to attach and the hose is so stiff it was really difficult to use.",
