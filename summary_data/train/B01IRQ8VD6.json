But these drops feel great, no sticky, gooey mess, and no haze, AND don't have a bunch of questionable ingredients in them!",

I ordered 2 bottles to begin with, and have used 1+, and my eyes feel way more comfortable. Other drops stay effective for a while, or irritate the tear ducts into producing tears. This just soothes with its homeopathic ingredients, and i find I am having to use it much less these days as my eyes are staying more comfortable. Nevertheless, I re-ordered so I wouldn't run out and the order came within the day (I live in Amazon's area).",

It really helps with dry eyes and what I like most is the bottle. It's a glass bottle with a long pointed top. When you unscrew the lid, you can just squeeze the sides of the cone-shaped top to squirt out the liquid. It seems so much easier (and more accurate) than having to squeeze a firmer plastic bottle to get the liquid out. I would definitely recommend this eye drop.",

    "title": "Similasan Dry Eye Relief Eye Drops 0.33 Ounce Bottle, for Temporary Relief from Dry or Red Eyes, Itchy Eyes, Burning Eyes, and Watery Eyes, 2 Count",
    "description": "Dry eyes are a common discomfort - reading, stress, contact lens wear, and staring at the screen all day can dry out your eyes. We all want our eyes to feel better, but many dry eye sufferers are concerned about the chemicals found in eye drops. Traditional over-the-counter drops use chemicals to mask symptoms. Similasan of Switzerland works differently, by using natural botanical extracts to stimulate the body's natural defenses and target the root cause. Similasan products are made without harsh chemicals, so you can use them as often as needed. Can be used with contact lenses. Drops will not damage lenses but performance might be better when applied without lenses. If you have redness, itchiness or irritation, it is best to avoid lenses for a while. Trusted by pharmacists and families in Switzerland for 40 years, Similasan is a leading Swiss brand of remedies that use natural active ingredients instead of harsh chemicals to keep families healthy. Our state of the art facility located near the Swiss Alps makes over 190 popular remedies for children and adults. Claims based on traditional homeopathic practice, not accepted medical evidence. Not FDA evaluated.",
