Sure enough, after repeated use on live cedar tree branches (we kept within the 1.5 \" diameter), the loppers are already wore out. Less than 1.5 months of use, and the bracket flexes on branches that it should just cut through with little to no effort.",

We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas. In seven years two blades have broken. Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website. A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use. These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.

You also need a pair of bypass loppers if you care about the health of a living plant that you are pruning. Unfortunately the bypass loppers are not ideal for both jobs. They will quickly dull if you use them to cut dead brittle branches. I therefore wound up with both of these loppers and a pair of Fiscars bypass loppers of similar size. Both are excellent tools and have a 3 to 1 mechanical advantage that makes it incredibly easy to cut large branches.",

The best thing about them is that they cut beautifully and I'm not a very strong person so this makes my job so much easier. The bright color allows me to find them after I leave them in the leaves. Happy with my purchase.",
