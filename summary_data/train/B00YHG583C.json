I have one that is a different brand and was more expensive and looks like a wine bottle, so if I am trying to be discrete it is a clear giveaway. This Seven Fifty vacuum insulated wine growler is great. It can be passed off as a water bottle if you are trying to sneak wine or any other alcoholic concoction into an event where it is not allowed. No metallic taste and it keeps your wine at the perfect temperature.",

I was surprised when I took it on a rafting trip, everything we brought was warm due to the 95+ degree heat but when we busted out the wine from this bottle, it was still cold! Will stay ice cold for 24 hours if you put enough ice in it. Highly recommended!!",

The cap fits well enough but certainly not like other growlers I own (for beer, mostly) that keep the beer from going flat, but it seals and since fizziness is not the main objective, it is not a problem.",

I've looked over all the reviews to see if anyone else had had this problem, but I do not see anything about it. I would like to know how I would somehow remove that metal taste from inside the growler....Any ideas?",
