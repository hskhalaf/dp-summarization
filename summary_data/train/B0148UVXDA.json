This pillow is worth $10 if that! Seriously. I bought some Bellagio pillows at Sam's club months ago for 2for$20 and they are FAR superior to this gimmicky product. Your basically paying for the barrage of advertising you see everywhere and that's it. Quality speaks for itself and these just don't have it. $50 is an INSANE price for a pillow anyway, should have you dreaming of unicorns and such but no. DO NOT BUY!",

I've had my firm queen pillows for 5 years and a wash n dry on high heat makes them feel like new again. I highly recommend these pillows. Best I've ever bought.

I have purchased a number of MyPillows in various fill or loft levels and I am very happy with them. I do recommend MyPillows, but for me the Firm fill is sufficient, the extra firm fill was a bit too firm. The MyPillows need to be washed and dried before use to get their fill in the correct state, otherwise they are very lumpy. The extra fill completely filled the pillow case, soaked up A LOT of water and took extra effort to get dry.",

It may be a nicer pillow than some, but far from extraordinary andI don't think it is worth the high price.",

You can feel it's just filled with little memory foam balls and it's just a freakin weird pillow. And WAY overpriced - just don't buy it. Nothing replaces a high end, expensive real down pillow or a highly rated contour pillow. Typical \"As Seen On Tv\" product.",
