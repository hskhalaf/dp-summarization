Would 100% recommend! *note: I would not use this as a traveling caddy, but one to hold supplies at home out of the way. Does not come with carrying handles.",

This new one opens 5 inches, hardly enough to hold the blanket I'm knitting, plus an extra skein. If it opened wider, I'd love it. As it is, it's going back.
