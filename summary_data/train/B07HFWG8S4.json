Hardware definitely is top notch and I'm looking forward to see what software improvements come to the product.",

We have been using these regularly for the last month or so, and it feels like they're in the same room with me. It's so nice to just set it on the counter and have it follow your movements around the room. To be honest, I haven't used the Alexa portion of it, but this nails it on the video calls. It will sound corny, but this really has improved our family closeness in a way a smartphone just doesn't match.",

We all really enjoed it and then it just turned off. My mom figured she would be able to send it in to get it fixed or replaced for a fee, seeing how its such a pricey device, but no. it seems you are out of luck if you dont buy the warrany. Now i know. My advice if you dont want to pay an extral $50 on top of $280, stick with the cheaper alexas and video calls on your phone. its really not all that different.",

Another bad recommendation is that when you switch the button to turn off the camera on the top of the product , it doesn\u2019t allow you to communicate with Alexa means that it only works if you use the touchscreen or maybe just like a clock (useless) .",

      "text": "This was a gift.....it's really cool and we use it daily.....my only complaint is the sound quality isn't very good. We don't blast the volume and it stays in the same spot on a countertop.....but when listening to music...like I am right now....the speaker crackles and somehow the words skip/blur sometimes :-0 Perhaps the one we got is somehow defective. I keep wiggling the plug thinking that's going to magically solve the problem....but no such luck :( If the sound didn't crackle....this would be an awesome piece of technology. I should probably contact the seller....",

But this doesn't solve the problem at all. It didn't recognize the face of my kid at all, so it wouldn't pan according to kid's movement. Also few nitpicks- Panning is slow (or too smooth), Edges are very sharp. Stand is fixed at one angle so no way to adjust if you want to show something on the floor while portal is placed on the tv unit.",
