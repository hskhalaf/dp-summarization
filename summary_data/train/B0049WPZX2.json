We did need to bungee it to a post since it scooted across the deck in the wind when she was out of it. (She picked the spot where she wants to sleep!) It's the perfect answer for those looking for a safe, dry environment for their cat even if she wants to sleep out in the open weather rather than under an overhang or in the barn. This is the solution to several years of searching to keep her dry even in our Oregon rainstorms. Thank you!",
