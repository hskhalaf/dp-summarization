It's sharp looking, comfortable to carry, and has sufficient room for items such as towel, a block, t-shirt, etc. There are 2 mesh pockets and one zipper compartment on the inside. The outside has a mesh pocket on each end and also a zipper compartment on the outside. This bag has plenty of room, yet it doesn't feel bulky. It appears of high quality and is the only one like it that I could find. Plus, I am impressed with the customer focus of the company, that wants its purchasers to have a 5-star experience. Hats off to you, Asutra!",

Perfect size for essentials like hot yoga mat, towel, cell phone, keys, and a few other extras inside bag, with carry space for full size yoga mat on top. Adjustable straps so you can carry down by your side, or lengthen to sling over your shoulder. Compact, but can pack a lot in the bag. Mesh pockets and outside as well as a zip pocket on the exterior. Very simple, well made and stylish looking. Very happy with purchase.",

I get that it is a YOGA bag and one doesn't wear sneakers in yoga however I often double up my classes with something else that requires sneakers. I've managed, but it's a little tricky. I also do wish the strap was on the bottom. Once the mat is buckled in, you cannot get to the contents inside. *Kerry*",
