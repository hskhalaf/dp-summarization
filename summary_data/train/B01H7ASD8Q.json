I gave it 4 starts because I think for the price, the cushion should be better quality. It works great to seating for two, but not comfortable enough for sitting for long periods. But for less than $100, I\u2019m happy with it.",

I loved the bench and color of the legs, but it did not fit together perfectly. The legs are apart by more space than there should be. Guess I have no choice but to keep it.",
