This lamp is a game changer!! 4 different brightness levels, totally solid, and so sleek you hardly notice it! I would for sure recommend.

      "text": "First - the light it gives off is pleasant and easy to adjust from soft to bright. (Actually, it's incredibly fun how you just slide your hand over the button and the light changes) Second - the lamp is a beautiful design that doesn't take up space or block wall art (in my case) and is modern and clean. Lastly - it was incredibly easy to put together once I got passed a completely stuck point. Hard to explain, but I wish they had included more explicit instructions for dummies like me on the direction this one piece had to go. Overall delighted with my purchase and the price for it",

Time will tell if it is as rugged.We like the soft-touch switch and must say, to our surprise, the light seems to be as bright on the highest setting as the one it replaced. I am sure that the electricity saved will be a big plus, too, and we have been converting every light/lamp in the house over to LEDs for the last couple of year as the old conventional bulbs die.

It works almost like a touchpad, not an actual switch -- once for brightest, twice for medium, etc. It often seems to register more than one touch, so I have to cycle thru again to get it brightest.

The only downside is that they are a little lightweight. The stand is not quite heavy enough, so kids and pets can knock over if they bump into them. However, as there's no glass in the construction, this is not a major problem.",
