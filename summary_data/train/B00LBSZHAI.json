      "text": "This was the newer model by the same name - it doesn't feature certain elements you may have seen reviewed elsewhere (crosshair overlay, unusual resolution options) however it is a great monitor and a bargain with it's incredible refresh rates and g-sync. It came with a non-uk power cable, which has a sturdy adaptor fixed in place - a small niggle but it hasn't impacted me at all. Excellent monitor overall.",

Games running as low as 40fps seem like they are running at a stable 60! Glad I managed to grab this on sale as well! I fully recommend this product! The colour isn't anything amazing and its still only 1080p, but for the price i can't complain at all!",

      "text": "I have nothing but praise for this monitor! Getting full 144 fps on all games that support it, the gsync works perfectly, with the added bonus that I can turn off vsync in the actual games to free up resources, height adjustment is a nice feature, and grear colour! The only problem I had, and at no fault of the monitor, is thathat my specific gpu, GTX 980, requires a mini display port and I had to buy that separate. Overall amazing product!",

I am really impressed with just how great the quality is from the actual production and quality of the resolution and graphics, the G-Sync technology even granted me around 10-20 fps more than my other monitor. You just need to make sure your graphics card is G-Sync compatible. I then Upgraded my PC with the Gigabyte Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB graphics card and I have to say the combination of the two make every thing look so superbly stunning. Would not think twice about recommending this product to anyway, great item!!!",
