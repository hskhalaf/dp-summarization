      "title": "Swiss Ski Vacation & the Canon 870IS",
      "text": "This camera was purchased just before a ski trip to the Jungrfrau Region in Switzerland. The camera behaved flawlessly and took over 450 photos and 10 videos without a hitch. The only errors were self inflicted by the photographer. It is wonderful to have such a small camera that takes such awesome and inspiring photos. I kept the camera in a fleece bag while skiing or in my backpack in a camera case. The camera traveled everywhere from Zu\u0308rich, Thun and Zermatt. I like the size and the ability to take pictures anywhere and at any time. This video was filmed in B/W mode while I was skiing behind my friends. The location was Murren, Switzerland.",

      "text": "Another great Canon point and shoot. We were hesitant with getting a camera without a viewfinder, since in the past we have liked having them when in high light areas (like at the beach etc) since sometimes its hard to see the screen. This is not the case with the huge, bright, and crisp screen on this camera. It has been bright enough in all situations to not need a view finder. One of our friends had the same fear...and they have been very happy with their sd870 IS. Great battery life so far also! Love the button preview when you lightly touch the touchpad. Good when you don't know what the buttons do. :) Highly recommended camera!",

As with previous PowerShots, it's great in representing photos similarly to how my eye saw the image, the 28mm is rocking, and the video quality is fabulous. I just discovered all kinds of fun special effects for video. Unlike my previous POS, oh I mean P and S, which was a Lumix, this PowerShot lets you zoom while a video is being filmed. That's a great feature. Get a large capacity memory card and this camera, and enjoy taking beautiful professional quality photographs.",

I also own the Canon EOS digital XT but the wife and I needed something compact to carry around. Since then the SD870 has become our primary camera. On a different note, my 2 year-old was playing with SD870 and managed to jam lens. I submitted a repair request through Canon's website [...] and in less than 7 working days after I shipped camera to Canon my camera was back from the repair center in perfect working order. The entire process was simple, from submitting ticket request to checking status of repair online, and all this was done under warranty.",

There are lots of setting you can tweak on this, but the main ones I use are the ISO settings. Although this camera has anti-blur, I find that you still need to set the ISO higher manually in many instances to get the best results - that is, without using the flash, which I hate (in all cameras of this type). I wish Canon had done a better job of that. Once you've got the setting you want, it takes great pictures. The menus and settings are easy enough to use (if you know what they all mean).",

Very stable even in a moving vehicle. I took several pictures of the Whitestone Bridge in New York while driving after sunset. The images are clear and the color exquisite. Easy to download and print pictures? It's a snap. Great little model!",

The wide angle feature is outstanding and the extra zoom compared to a 3x lens is perfect. The quality of the pictures is where Canon stands out, other cameras may have better zoom lenses, but the picture quality falls short. The start up time and the time between pictures is very short and the stabilization is very good. Only one weakness, though not unexpected in a point and shoot, the flash is weak and is not good for any great distances.",

I also can't use the camera's various settings considering I can no longer see the menu on the screen.

It took me awhile to get used to using a camera with only an LCD screen, but it's so large (3 in.) and clear, high resolution, that I got the hang of it quickly. The learning curve re: buttons/functions was not steep since I have had Canon cameras before. Took first pictures on a walk along a creek with leave changing and was very pleased with quality. The plastic components (battery cover, etc.) are the only negatives that I've found - covers seem flimsy and likely to break.

The size makes it a handy carry around point shoot that doesn't intrude into the picture composition like some other \"larger\" point shoot cameras. Menu selections are easy to understand and playback review a separate button. Great camera.",

Action shots comes out clear and not blurry (at the right setting) and night shots are amazing. The movie function is nice but don't expect it to give you quality like a real digi-camcorder.

      "text": "I have tried many brands of cameras: Kodak, Fuji, Sony....This camera beats all of them hands down. The battery life is phenomenal, the pictures in light and dark come out very clear with little digital noise, there is easy access to manual controls, face detection and image stabilization work wonderfully, easy to work and figure out....I'm still discovering all of the features. I would definately recommend to a novice and to an experienced shutter bug!",

I told Amazon about it and had a new camera in about 4 to 5 days. They paid for all the shipping also. I am very pleased with the service I recieved.",

It is also very durable I have dropped it more than the kids and it doesn't have a scratch. It will also give you some great advanced settings if you are the advanced user. I had another Canon before this one and would highly recommend Canon Products and Amazon.com. I think this is the best camera for quality, features and price right now. Hope this helps!!",

The best feature is the wide angle lens. If you have even low light conditions, you won't need a flash and yet the pictures (on a computer screen at least) aren't grainy. Battery lasts a long time. Get the canon elph leather camera case. It protects nicely yet keeps the camera compact.",
