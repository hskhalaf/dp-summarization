The body butter is rich and creamy, smells pleasantly, and is absorbs fairly quickly into the skin. Unlike others, it does not leave a slimy residue or makes you feel awkwardly sticky. Overall, it leaves my sensitive skin soft, smooth, and soothed. It's a great product - very much recommendable.",

It leaves my skin nice and smooth though I am an older woman. The only reason I did not give five stars is the screw-on lid. It does not completely seal the jar. In other words when closing the jar the lid never gets tight. It gets taped when traveling. I love the Avani Dead Sea Body Butter,...so I am a bit inconvenienced.",
