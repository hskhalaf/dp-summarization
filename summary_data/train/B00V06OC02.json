I can still use it, but I obviously have to handle it very carefully. That said, I'll never go back to emery boards; this is really terrific ... and so, so time saving.",

Tired of replacing those files and feeling as though I was generating too much garbage for a simple nail file, I decided to give this one a try. The file is NICE and it's not too fine a grit (read: it doesn't take forever to file my nails). It's great that it comes with a hard case - a glass file should be protected by a hard case, especially in a handbag. However, the case is very cheap. I'd pay more for a nicer case with this otherwise beautiful file.",

I would thought it to be the opposite and for it to slide very smoothly- but the upside to that is that it is far more effective in filing your nails. It only takes a few swipes here and there to file down your nail, whereas with my old metal file it would take me a half hour to file both hands. I think I'll be a repeat customer next time I need another file or want to gift one.",

Cons: -The glass file tip edge is rounded so it cannot be used as a cuticle pusher/scraper without additional damage to nail. -The case is made out of cheap plastic that easily and often gets jostled open causing the file to not be in the case. Notes: I recently discovered that a thin metal file can also fit in the case along side the glass file, pro if you have it, con because if you do not, the glass file bounces around in its own case, probably assisting in the cap coming off.

I also like that you can file your nails in either direction w/o worrying about your nails splitting. Very fine product which I'm recommending to all my friends! Great customer service as well, following up to see if I had received it and making sure I was pleased. Very much so!",

I can rinse it in water and it's all clean again. If you're gentle with it, you WON'T break it. If it breaks, you either dropped it or you're filing aggressively. If your nails require more aggressive filing, I highly recommend you keep your filing hand close to spot where you nail makes contact with the file. That way, you don't risk pressing to hard and forcing the file to break in half...hope that makes sense.",

Regular old emery boards just tore them up. So called \"diamond\" metal files were somewhat better. The czech glass files give me a very smooth and silky finish. I notice fewer chips, breaks and peeling of layers. I would recommend this product to anyone with similar nail problems. You will definitely notice a positive difference.",

For years I was using one of those cardboard sandpapery doohickeys that send shivers through your whole body and don't accomplish anything except splintering your nail in 60 different places. This file, while slightly more expensive than metal and foam/cardboard alternatives, won't break the bank and will actually make filing your nails a treat. This files your nails down smooth and even with ease. My nails even feel stronger overall whereas previously they would feel weak and brittle near the tips where I has used other files. I highly recommend this file.",

The file is also easy to clean and looks brand new after wiping it (while other files quickly deteriorate and show wear). Also, my nail tips are very smooth and don't catch on my tights. They also have not chipped or cracked which they used to do all the time. Very good deal for the price :)",

Once I started using these, my nails filed down so smoothly that I don't even both with clippers anymore. Now it always looks like I have a fresh manicure when all I do is file my nails once a week.
