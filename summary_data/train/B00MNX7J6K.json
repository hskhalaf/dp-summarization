Some precautions are that you must sweep your house prior to use as it is only a mop! Also if you have dried spills that have been there for a while you may have to prescrub prior to using the mop. I enjoyed my first experience with it. I had to use 3 pads and about 1/2 of the included cleaning solution bottle to clean a very small kitchen, very small bathroom and one bedroom and a few hallway areas.",

Excellent on hard wood although best results are to Swif with the wet feature, and follow up with a dry pad.
