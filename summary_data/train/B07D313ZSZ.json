      "text": "Got this in October, so I\u2019ve only had it for 3 months and the base barely works. If you so much as push the charger in a little too far it doesn\u2019t work. If you move the cord around at all it doesn\u2019t work. The only thing keeping me from giving it 1 star is that it works really well when it actually decides to work. UPDATE: Originally gave a 2 star rating because it barely worked kinda. Now it\u2019s not working at all. After 3 months of sitting in one location, never dropped or damaged, it no longer works. I\u2019d say this is a HARD PASS. Do not waste your money.",

I had to use multiple battery packs a day if I decided to game for more than 4 hours. The charger itself stopped working as intended as well. I have to angle the batteries on the base for them to even charge. If you\u2019re considering purchasing this just spend a little more on a better one. I\u2019m going to have to buy another charger, so buying the cheap one has back fired.",

The battery packs hold charge for roughly 12-15 hours of usage, not counting controller idle timing so probably 8-10 hours if you are playing really intensely. If you have a second controller you would have 0 down time and only have to swap the battery if one reaches the end of its cycle decay several years in the future unless it is physically damaged. Well worth it to pick up this unit and a secondary controller.",

They must have accidentally sent me the \"other brand\" because these batteries only last 4-6 hours from a full charge. It's not because the batteries are old, I've only had this product for a few days. I've tried a different controller and both batteries, same result. My Ni-Mh rechargeable AAs last just as long and supply more power and charge faster. The only benefit to this is the docking station and it's faster to swap out batteries as opposed to standard AAs.",
