It feels cheap and it shows as it no longer works. How about something a little sturdier. For $150 this product should work well for years, not two weeks. Disappointed. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM the Growler Works website---- this product is non returnable to them. Fortunately, Amazon vouches for their products and issued a refund.",
