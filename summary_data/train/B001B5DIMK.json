I only wish it came with a bulb for the light, or at least a voucher for the bulb. I added a magnetic feeder (Pangea Ultimate Gecko Ledge) and a climbing vine from it's breeding terranium so it had something familiar in it's new habitat. This was packaged with care and it arrived in a timely manner and in one piece. I'm very pleased with this purchase!",

I did buy a digital 2 in 1because reviews for the little ones this comes with weren't great, but I put them in to check them and they give off about the same readings as the digital one. But we'll see how long they last, and I would still recommend the digital one. EDIT: I figured out the light. The box sits in the middle nestled between the top latches.",
