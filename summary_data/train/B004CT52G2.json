It makes it look thirsty and parched! even though the other reviews say its left their hair amazing, not for me! So on I search for something my locks will love! It's been a search for me for about (hmm...all my life?!?).",

I have always had serious issues with my hair tangling while shampooing. There was a famous salon brand that caused my fingernails to rip; that is how tangled my hair gets. I discovered Ouidad when I was wearing my hair curly for a few years. It is such a good brand. This product is recommended for more intense curl than I have, but I strongly recommend it even for Caucasian hair. My hair is so healthy and shiny now. The co sit-up we smells a bit like honeydew melon.",
