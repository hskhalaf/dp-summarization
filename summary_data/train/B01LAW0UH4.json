Being solid, they are especially effective when focusing on adduction and preferred when placing them under my back or neck for shavasana. Cork blocks are definitely my preference.",

The items were very professionally packaged - so nice, I almost didn't want to take the wrap off. These blocks came with a sturdy quality strap.

If you put heavy strain on your straps you might prefer a more heavy duty one. One cork block from most places is upwards of $20, so to get two plus the strap for under $30 is a great value.",
