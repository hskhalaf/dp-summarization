It would stop running every few days mostly at night , even after it was left out in the Florida sun all day, several times. It will not hold a charge. To late to return to Amazon. On April 20, I mailed it back to Seiko repair . On May 7, they tell me it will cost $103.28 to repair!!!!!! I can buy a new one for less! I am still expecting a free repair under the warranty. I have used Seiko watches for over 50 years. They have always been reliable and long lasting. I only hope the company will make good on this watch.",

But you should expect this since it is a solar watch. Extremely pleased with this product, I look at it all the time when it is on my wrist because I can not stop looking at how good it looks.",

You then must find a shop to fix it, as it's a super hard thing to replace without proper tools and great eyes. After three times comiijnb unattached using two different bands, I give up. terrible design.",

When the watch arrived I set it up in the winter sunshine coming through a west window and that seemed to kick-start the movement.

The second issue is that the sliver band surface scratches rather easily but doesn't really much less shiny. Overall, if you want a classy solar charged watch this is the product for you",

Do I have to do this in the morning to get the date to change only at midnight?",
