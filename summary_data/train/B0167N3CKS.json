The story line is decent.The overall concept of the game isn't hard to figure out. I like it a lot.",

I especially enjoyed the beast taming parts of the game, and many of the side ventures were really interesting. The reason the game only got three stars was that many of the missions and side stories became very tedious. The game is all about survival, so the gathering of materials and building of tools became not only dull but monotonous. Overall I would say the game is worth playing, but it is far from the best in the Farcry series.",

The storyline is weak to the point of non-existence. The graphics are awesome but that is so in most games these days so that's no reason to buy it. If you haven't played any of the Far Cry Games start with 3, then 4, then 1 and 2. Save this for last or even pass entirely. Three stars because it is not a bad game, it just doesn't measure up to its predecessors. I'd rate FC 3 and 4 at 5 stars each, FC 1 and 2 at 4 or so.",
