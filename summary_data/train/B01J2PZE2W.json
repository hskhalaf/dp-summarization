The sole is the Skechers cushy Go Walk and it's like walking on a cloud. Bought the navy with the light gray sole and it's a nice contrast instead of a bright white. They come with 2 sets of laces, navy and gray. After hearing my son say how comfortable these were and how these are his \"go to\" shoes now, I would recommend these for anyone looking for comfort and style at an affordable price.",
