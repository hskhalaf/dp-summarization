Cracks then appeared around the rim and later at the bottom causing the pitcher to leak. This item was only cleaned by hand and never put in the dishwasher or handled in any adverse way. Infusing is a fabulous process for flavoring all kinds' of liquids, unfortunately this item isn't the pitcher to do it with.",

But, I thought, maybe I was just unlucky, so I bought another one in February 2017. Today the handle came off the second pitcher. I loved serving lemon-infused water to my guests with this pitcher. I loved that it was lightweight and so much easier to handle than a glass one. I loved that it was clear so the luscious fruit was clearly visible. But, alas, the handle is just unreliable. Too bad, but I won't buy another.",

Second, I washed it immediately, and let it dry. Third, I filled up the pitcher with purified water. Added some blackberries and raspberries. I left it in the fridge for about 5 hours. I did not taste the flavor, so we figured maybe I should cut the berries. I didn't cut them the first time because I figured I didn't need to. I'll try the water tomorrow morning. **fingers crossed**",

Seller, find a non toxic sealant and eliminate this problem - otherwise I love it. Cannot recommend to others with this persistent problem. Please contact me if you want to replace this item.

      "text": "I got this for my birthday from a co-worker, and I absolutely love it! The first time I used a mango, orange and raspberries, plus two green tea bags. I refilled it three times before deciding to try something else. Now I have cucumber and an orange with fresh basil leaves and two lemon flavored green tea bags. Nice and fresh, especially with it heating up here in Florida. It inspires me to drink more water when I'm at home, and the taste is so nice, I don't hesitate to refill the glass over and over. Just use your imagination and find your perfect concoction!",

Use a little Vaseline on the infuser and don't twist too tight. We have some cracking, but it didn't break. It is sitting in our refrigerator, one of the most appreciated gifts I ever bought my wife.",

I like the look of the pitcher and the feel of the handle. The infuser attaches easily and stays secure. Infused water is a nice change of pace from regular tap water with or without a lemon slice added. Peaches, strawberries and raspberries work well. Adding a bit of honey or stevia makes it tastes even better. I bought another one as a gift.",
