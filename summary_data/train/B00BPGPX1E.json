I have baby fine, over processed hair and am able to repair it from the inside out without having to chop it off, thanks to this product. Also my stepdaughter recently had a haircut where the stylist took off way too much length. I directed her to the Eu Naturel Biotin and her hair grew back twice as fast. This stuff really works. And I like that its vegan.",
