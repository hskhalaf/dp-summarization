Eaay for her to get on, and only a TINY bit baggy in the hips. But certainly nothing that bothers her. Covers her rear end well/fully & doesn't ride up.",

If you're unsure, definitely buy a couple of sizes and make sure Amazon is offering FREE RETURNS on those sizes, that's what helped us!",

      "text": "My 8 year old daughter has had two of these suits (the black/pink and the blue/white). On both of them the fabric covering her bottom wore through and became translucent after 5-10 uses. We did wash it in the washing machine, but air dried it; I'm not sure if this is what caused the wear. for some reason, the fabric covering the bottom is not lined, while the rest of the suit is. I'm surprised more people haven't commented on this (a few have), but I'm guessing many of the reviews were written soon after receiving the suit and based on the fit rather than the wear.",
