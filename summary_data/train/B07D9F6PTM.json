He was taller (from the mud) too, lol. after a few dips in the Kleen Pawz cup I was able to break loose the big chunks of mud/rocks and then rinse his paws again. dry with a towel and he was happy again. I felt Kleen Pawz made this job a lot easier and I would recommend it to anyone where their dog may get muddy paws.",

I have to be honest, I\u2019ve only used it twice only because my dog is a jerk. :) However, I was worried about her paws fitting in it because they are huge and they fit great. She\u2019s a 100lb. American Bulldog and her paws are as big as my palms. Great product and I love that the company is a small business.",
