Also, they stay in my ears comfortably when I run at the gym which is what I got them for. They connected to my phone via Bluetooth easily. They also came with a little charging cord, instructions, and a cute round hard case to keep them in. Battery life seems good so far. I can go multiple workouts in a row and not have to recharge. I would order these again or recommend them to anyone.",

I highly recommend a pair and will probably purchase another pair as a backup for the gym. Definitely can not go wrong.",

When the volume goes to high, it will inform the user of the risks of hearing noises loudly. This can get annoying as you need to press okay on the notification to increase the volume. Once if reaches the highest volume, it will beep loudly which really hurts and its annoying. The charge takes 2:30 hours but it really last a long time so l can't complain about it.",

Finally, the sound quality is a little worse than I expected, even for a budget set. Thankfully they have consistently stayed connected with no drops.

Bluetooth isn't a great transmission system for high quality audio, no matter what brand you buy. The limitation is Bluetooth, not the headset. With that in mind, I can't agree with people who claim other Bluetooth earbuds sound much better. From AirPods to Bose Bluetooth, they all suffer the same quality issues. Ignoring the deficiencies in Bluetooth transmission, the sound that you get has decent bass, and highs. The volume level is fine, and the battery life is about 8 hours.

Seriously, even at the lowest volume it was too loud. But now, the audio is so bad that it needs to be almost max and barely anything comes out. Audio constantly changes volume, cuts in and out.

Bluetooth range is typical. The bluetooth is a bit loyal to the last device used but will recognize multiple devices. Comes with a nice case and extra ear pads and USB cable. The software seems very robust in how it handles switching to and from other devices and he voice prompts are nice. Seem to be a really good product (not cheap) highly recommended.",

These don't sound as good for sure, and they amplify the wind if you're running or working in windy conditions. Also, the receiver/earbud size seemed a little larger than what I'd like, but sort of expected. I found I was much happier with the music experience once I did some EQ work (see image). But like I said, for this price, I'd purchase them with no regrets.",

Update: After using them for a week, I am even more impressed with how well they work. The Bluetooth connects instantly and never drops out. Answers my phone seamlessly and very clearly. Charge lasts all day, and recharges very quickly. I don't think you can find a better product at any price.",

I think the biggest attribute is that I have small ears so even with the smallest size rubber ear bud attached they still had the tendency to float just outside and fall out easily because the over-the-ear part is too big. But I struggled to find anything that offered a smaller fit, so I went with these. Pros however were easy bluetooth pairing and function, battery life seems solid so for the cost these are a good value. Worse case scenerio (for me) is my husband has a back up pair.",

Just say \"Powering off\" and leave out telling me it's disconnected. Of course it's disconnected; it's powered off.",
