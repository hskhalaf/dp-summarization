Very well made, sturdy stitching, the handles look useful, but I haven\u2019t had to use them yet. Definitely strong enough for 2 Mastiffs.",

It has given me a better control with just one leach and the swivel at clips are helpful. Also when my husky start acting crazy I was able to get the soft hand to get more control. It does take time for the dogs to get use to it but be patient.",

It gives them each enough length to feel like they're walking on their own but I'm able to keep them under control and pull them close if we come across other animals on the path and we need to go past each other. It's just a fantastic leash so glad that I spent the money! I couldn't be happier!",

The dogs took to it immediately. I ordered the double leash for my two Goldens, each about 70-80 lbs. It took me a little while to handle the leash, but the dogs did well immediately. The \"key\" is the swivel coupler! Magic for sure!!! It would be important for both dogs to be approximately the same size. Love it!!!",

But, I use it with a regular leather leash and it works great. We prefer to walk our two dogs on separate extenda leashes, but when I take them alone, this leash is perfect. The dogs do have to get used to it. They are used to going in whatever direction they want, this leash makes them walk along together, which is great for me as I'm not getting tied up in leashes!",

This seems to be really well made, heavy-duty and the swivel keeps them from getting twisted. I love that each side has a handle so that I can grab the more reactive dog and hold her next to me if she gets worked up about something. I need to get a slightly shorter leash to go with this- using my 4 foot leash just gives them a bit too much freedom to run wild. But, swapping that out for a 2-3 ft lead should make this perfect.",

And the extra handle in case they pull is great. Seems durable and will not break easily. I would highly recommend this product. Just wish it came with the handle and didn't need another separate leash.",

      "text": "This leash is so cool! Combined with the pronged training collars it made a previously impossible task possible. They wouldn't behave on a leash AT ALL before the metal collars, they practically ripped my arms off. With new collars they walk nicely but having two leashes at a time if I am walking them alone was almost impossible. This thing allows for one handed walking of two big GSDs without hassle! Great purchase!",

The straps are adjustable but I wouldn\u2019t put them too short so your dogs have enough space that they aren\u2019t attached to each other. The swiveling metal attachment works perfectly, they could swap sides without getting tangled. The only thing is I am going to get a shorter leash. My greyhounds like to walk close to me and with this addition I had way too much material! Great product tho I\u2019m very glad I bought it I will look at their other items for my pups!",

I don't think that my dogs or my use of the product are in any way exceptional, it's just poorly made. Too bad. This was a great coupler at first. The additional handles are helpful and it was generally comfortable and convenient to use with my two 70-lb dogs. But within half a year one of the buckles that allows the length of each leash to be changed broke, and within one year both broke. Very disappointed but I can't afford to replace this every year, so I'll have to find a different one.",
