The router dropped internet connection about every hour or so forcing me to unplug and replug the router to reconnect. (Note when I plugged the modem directly to computer (Bipassing the Belkin) I had internet. I contacted the Belkin support (five times) they would get me online but again an hour or so later it would drop internet connection. I suggest against this Belkin, the N1 Vision is great, but does not have the USB ports in back for wireless printing and Ext HD hook up. R, John",

I figured, this type of thing happens, not to worry and the replacement worked fine... for a few months. On the positive side, when it was working, it certainly had adequate range and it was very simple to set up. So 6 months later, of course it is too late for me to return the defective thing to Amazon. So I am now dealing with a warranty claim. No fun at all, but such is life. But hopefully I can save you some grief. It's simple -- don't buy the darned thing!",

Setting up a home network is a nightmare - still can't get it to work. On the good side, the two USB ports work great. I'm sharing 2 printers, and it found them both first thing.

However, the one thing I didn't know, was that this router does not support USB drives formatted for Mac (i.e. HFS). Only NTFS or FAT32 formats are currently supported. This was a major disappointment as I am primarily a Mac user. I am really hoping that Belkin will provide a firmware fix for this asap!!",
