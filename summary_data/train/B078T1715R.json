I am a college student who likes to watch movies and tv shows, but also needs a device that can stay alive during a day of classes. This laptop has been perfect for me, as its battery lasts for several hours (using Google drive and other websites simoutaneously) and it is not heavy at all. I sometimes forget it's in my backpack, that's how light it is! Everything is working beautifully, haven't had a single problem.",
