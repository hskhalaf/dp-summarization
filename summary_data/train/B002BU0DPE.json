You will always have a better mic when it had a usb power source because the mic has a stronger power source than those with just a 3.5 mil audio jack. If you want your friends to be blown away by the high quality of your voice, buy this headset. After sharing this with my gaming friends, 6 of them bought this headset. I will buy again when my headset breaks. This is my second pair, and my first lasted 5 years.",

We have never been able to get them to work on our PS3, even after countless hours of troubleshooting procedures from many different sources, including Turtle Beach. The cords are a huge pain to deal with, frequently get tangled and are always in the way. We finally got so fed up with the PX21 that we went to the local Gamestop, bought a bluetooth ear piece for $35 and never looked back. The bluetooth ear piece has been flawless. I can't believe we paid so much and wasted so much time for such troublesome product like the PX21.",

The sound output is clear and strong, to the point where you can use them as speakers (not super loud speakers, but still) and the mic input is crisp and clear. It's very comfortable to wear, although somewhat loose on my smaller-that-average head. If you are into or even plan to get into online gaming, this headset is a MUST buy at the just under 50$ price. This headset is also universal, which means it can be used with all consoles and even PCs. EDIT: The price has hiked significantly since I bought them. Get them while they're cheap, you wont regret it!",

The audio and mic work great and the audio adjustment controls are convenient and easy to use. The headset is lightweight and so doesn't bother you while wearing it for a marathon gaming session. However, because it is lightweight, it isn't the sturdiest headset I've owned. I recently dropped mine (off of a tall bookshelf mind you) and the plastic connection between the earpiece and the part that goes over your head broke (turtle beach has replacements for some parts, but not this one). That said, I liked it enough that I ordered a replacement PX21 the same day.",

I returend them as there were within the warranty period and Turtle Beach replaced them promptly. I believe the failure was due to packaging design as it put undo pressure on the failure point, needless to say the new packaging has changed for the better and the problem has been addressed. If this new set fails or works out I'll let you know either way in the future. I would give this item 5 stars if it wasn't for the failure.",

The sound is excellent the mic is very clear and you can adjust almost every bit of audio you hear just from the headset. Although it is great there are a few small thing i would like to point out. At the point where the speaker attaches to the headset there is a weak point, be VERY careful about that. Also, the wires could be a bit longer, i find myself a little close to the screen at times. Overall amazing item, go ahead and buy it now.",

I got my set in the mail yesterday and hooked them up as soon as I got home from school to try it out with Assassin's Creed Revelations, and I was STUNNED by how incredible the sound quality is. I'm hearing things in games that I could NEVER hear before, and it's amazing. For anyone who either just wants a headset to play games without disturbing anyone else in the house, or to those who are really into multiplayer and need a good headset/mic, I highly recommend the PX21s.",

How would you feel about spending your money, to receive trash that will not work and you can't get your money back? Find a company that stands behind their product, because this one will not. Sure, the set of headphones you receive will probably work, for awhile, but what if they don't? Or what if they conk out after two months of normal use? Will you be satisfied throwing your money away? Please try to find a similar product from someone else, because if we continue to give companies like this money, we'll have nothing but crap.",

I tried to return it but the return period for the item was only until the 14th of Sept 2013 - I can see why it is such a short return window - because the product can't last very well. it was delivered promptly - so 5 stars there.

If you're using the headset next to someone, he or she will most likely be able to hear what's going on through the earcups. The PX21 can also double as a PC or Mac gaming headset. You can either use the USB dongle as a virtual sound card or use the included 1/8-inch-to-stereo-RCA adapter to attach it to your sound card. Either way, the headset performs just as well, adding to the overall value of the product.",

And the game volume to zero. Which sucked!!!! because i love being able to hear my games. Today the left side of this headset came off so now these are complety useless.
