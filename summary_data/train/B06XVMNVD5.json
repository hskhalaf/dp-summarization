      "text": "I loved this TV. It did everything I wanted and more. Unfortunately after 13 months there is a line of screen burn running along the bottom of the screen. I cannot match it to any news tickers on sky news or BBC news, so they cannot be the cause; and I also don't play games on the TV, or have anything attached that could cause the screen burn. This probably won't help anyone as there are newer models of this TV out there, but screen burn seems to be a big problem with OLED TV's, and if I'd known that at the time I would not have bought this TV",

I have been mugged by a Korean, because LG will not help you even if you have a warranty because they will accuse you of wilful damage. So, the message is do not buy LG Oled TVs.",

      "text": "As many people have said the picture on this tv is staggeringly good. I had a 4 year old 4K set but it does not come close to this one in terms of definition.If you want to see something truly spectacular that fully justifies my comments catch The Blue Planet in UHD on BBC I Player (which is included as an app on the set) while it is still available. Wow!!!!",

This is worth 3k originally and at half that price stands up still to sonys top spec TVs that cost over 3k and even 4K. The picture will just blow you away it's so so so good. I would say buy a sound bar but honestly the picture is so good it's just not worth wasting your money elsewhere.",

The picture is incredible with great intuitive logic in terms of set up and general use. 4k Bluray films like Planet of the Apes show off the capability of this TV. 65 inch fitted to the wall has that wow factor even switched off but it backs it up with pure amazing picture performance. No wonder this TV has just won the 2017 What Hifi Best TV award!!!",
