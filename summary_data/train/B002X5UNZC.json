Drill pilot holes first and the included lag bolts will suffice without breaking off, which was what one buyer here suffered. I feel your pain, but everything worked for me this time. The biggest hassle is locating the studs. This bar requires two studs to be 48\" apart at some point, which is no problem if the carpenters put the studs at 16\" centers like they should have. Mine were a bit sloppy in a few locations, but I finally found a spot that worked. Now it's rock solid and looks okay, too.",

I'll spare the details but 3 snapped (You can't be gentle enough with these). Had to dig out the sheetrock and twist them out with vise grips.

We wanted it mounted in our garage and liked the option of wall or ceiling mount. It was very easy to install, taking only 20 minutes. We appreciated the width of the pull up bar allowed for any standard stud spacing. The diameter of the bar is comfortable for both his grin and my small one. My husband is most impressed with the sturdiness of the bar and says he would buy it again and has recommended to all of his marines.",

After using our make shift pull up station in our squat rack that moved a ton while performing just about every exercise, this is a dream. I'm just sorry we didn't do it sooner. Installation instructions on studbarpullup.com were spot on. We were missing some of the hardware from a torn box during shipping. Although we ordered through Amazon, Mark from Stud Bar responded within minutes and dropped a new set in the mail. Amazing service! This bar is highly recommended!",
