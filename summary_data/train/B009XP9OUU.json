Unfortunately, pulling on the legs did not cause the toy to squeak, and sean keeping the body together came undone within a few plays. Got this for the dogs for Christmas and lasted less than ten tugs. I was very disappointed to have paid 17 dollars for it. Other reviews are good, so I don't know if the toy we received was defective, given that it wouldn't even squeak. :~( Would love to give it another shot, but not for that price!",

I went to the bathroom and by the time I washed my hands the body had already fallen apart my the seams and he was destroying the ball. On one hand, I liked that the dog was super excited for this toy. On the other, it seems pretty poorly made for a $12 toy since it fell apart at the seams. It lasted 20 minutes from Amazon box to trash can. What a waste.",

You will save about $5 ordering this through Amazon as the local pet shop charges more. I have a GSP and an Irish Terrier if that helps. Oh and you will find carcasses in random places as the toy is pulled apart which will make everyone in the family giggle :)",

Last time this happened (6 months ago) with a dog toy it was credited to my account and I returned it with shipping on the seller. How can I get this done again? Toy seems durable but it was the seams that were not stable. Not for big dogs. I just wanted 30 days; that's all.",
