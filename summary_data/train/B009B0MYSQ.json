The only downside is the occasional \"Lens Errror\" which is a Canon thing and can strike light lightning (very rare). It means you need to send the camera back, but Canon and Amazon are incredibly efficient about it and you'll have it back in 5-7 days, good as new. Go for it, the price is right and you really can't beat this camera.",

Pull the camera from your pocket in low light conditions? Count on the ring turning to a setting guaranteed to ruin your shot - Menu difficult to navigate. Too many arcane and unnecessary menu options - Slow autofocus - Dubious quality control PROS - Small size is convenient - Takes acceptable images, after getting the lens cover open. Assuming you remember to double-check the function ring first OVERALL - Very disappointing - Buy something else",

The touchscreen makes picking the focus a lot easier and looking through pictures similar to looking on your smart phone (but with better quality). You can also transfer photos without even using a cord, which I thought was really neat. I took this camera with me to Italy when I went and it was wonderful. I'm sad that I misplaced it in my various moves. This camera doesn't compare to the other PowerShots in this line.",

You can zoom easily and flick to view the saved pictures. The wifi feature is really nice for transfering the photos to your phone or just browsing the photos that are located on the camera on your phone and deciding which ones to bring over.

If you dont carry around your smartphone and do GPS logging with the Canon app on your smartphone, the GPS function is almost useless.

My Lumix finally gave up the ghost, so I started shopping around. I found the S110 and was thrilled at all the options and the fact that it shoots in RAW format so that I can bring the photos into Lightroom for adjustment. The flash tends to over expose the subjects, but it was easily adjustable by taking the flash compensation down a notch. Beautiful, true colors. Folks are amazed at how good a camera it is for a pocket. Love Canon products.",

It turns from red to green after 1 hour when the battery is NOT actually charged. We made the mistake of thinking the camera was not functioning properly because we hadn't fully charged the battery.

Still to date, no winners. The hole you are meant to stick it through has an impossible bend and I so I remain strapless.",

The Wide-Angle lens gives your images a distinctive sweep and grandeur, capturing landscapes, cityscapes, tall buildings and wide groups of people with ease. The large f/2.0 aperture allows you to achieve shallow depth-of-field for creating portraits with beautiful, soft background blur, and incomparable Canon optical technology delivers a high performance lens enabling incredible images, even in low light.\n\nBEAUTIFUL IMAGES AND FAST PERFORMANCE START HERE\n12.1 MEGAPIXEL HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nThe PowerShot S110 employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor, which delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.\n\nCANON DIGIC 5 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the PowerShot S110's image sensor to bring phenomenal increases in processing speed and power, delivering incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. The faster processing speed results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the PowerShot S110 can achieve higher ISO sensitivity and even perform advanced functions like lens correction, special scene modes and much more.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM FOR EXCEPTIONAL LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE UP TO ISO 12800\nThe PowerShot S110 gives you the power to create images with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. The 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works in concert with Canon's own latest-generation DIGIC 5 Image Processor to create the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you'll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality even at high ISO speeds all the way up to ISO 12800; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur in a variety of situations for incredible photos and even when shooting video.\n\nGET THE COMPLETE HD EXPERIENCE\nCAPTURE STUNNING 1080P FULL HD VIDEO IN STEREO SOUND WITH A DEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON; VIDEO FUNCTIONS INCLUDE FINE DETAIL MOVIE PROCESSING FOR LIFELIKE IMAGES, ZOOM WHILE SHOOTING, AND CONVENIENT PLAYBACK ON AN HDTV VIA THE HDMI OUTPUT.\nSimply touch the dedicated movie button, now conveniently embedded in the PowerShot S110's thumb pad, to start recording video in 1080p Full HD. Video captured in 1080p Full HD is breathtakingly vivid and realistic, and Canon's Fine Detail Movie Processing achieves beautiful videos with high resolution processing that records approximately 4x the amount of information during video shooting for even greater image clarity and sharp portrayal of even the most delicate of details. You're free to use the full range of the zoom in movie mode, and sound is recorded in stereo. An HDMI output allows you to view and share your video on an HDTV immediately, simply by connecting the camera to the TV with an optional HDMI cable.\n\n\nENHANCED TOUCH PANEL CAPABILITIES\nA 3.0-INCH CAPACITIVE TOUCH PANEL PURECOLOR SYSTEM LCD OFFERS EASY AND INTUITIVE OPERATION, AND TOUCH SHUTTER MAKES SHOOTING EASY AND INTERACTIVE.\nAnyone familiar with today\u2019s touch screens will feel comfortable using the PowerShot S110 right away. The big 3.0-inch PureColor System LCD responds to familiar one- and two-finger touch operations. Users can spread and pinch to change the magnification in playback, drag two fingers to switch display, use the easy interactive Touch Shutter, and quickly select camera settings. You can even adjust the panel\u2019s touch sensitivity to your liking. The camera\u2019s sophisticated control ring, located at the base of the lens barrel, can be used in conjunction with the Touch Panel to conveniently access a range of additional actions.\n\n\nFASTER FOCUS AND HIGH-SPEED SHOOTING\nHIGH SPEED AF GREATLY IMPROVES FOCUS SPEED AND HIGH-SPEED BURST HQ ALLOWS FOR CONTINUOUS CAPTURE AT A MAXIMUM OF 10 FRAMES*** WHILE MAINTAINING SUPERB IMAGE QUALITY.\nThe PowerShot S110 is equipped with Canon's latest advancement in AF technology: High Speed AF. The result of several improved technologies, High Speed AF delivers significantly faster focus speed of 0.2 seconds and a dramatically reduced shooting lag time of 0.25 seconds, for a super-responsive shooting experience that lets you capture every great shot as it happens. The technology also powers the camera's new High-Speed Burst HQ, with continuous capture at a maximum speed of approximately 10 fps. Moreover, images captured in High-Speed Burst HQ maintain the camera's superb image quality.\n\n*** The continuous shooting speed is approximately 10.0 fps. \n\nOPTIMAL IMAGE STABILIZATION IN ANY SITUATION\nINTELLIGENT IS AUTOMATICALLY CHOOSES FROM SIX DIFFERENT MODES TO OPTIMIZE IMAGE STABILIZATION FOR THE SHOOTING CONDITION.\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot S110, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. SET YOUR CREATIVITY FREE\nFULL RANGE OF SHOOTING AND RECORDING MODES INCLUDING 12-BIT MULTI ASPECT RAW+JPEG, AS FOUND IN CANON DSLR CAMERAS, FOR THE ULTIMATE CREATIVE CONTROL.\nAs with many EOS DSLR cameras, the PowerShot S110 uses a 12-bit converter to process the output of the CMOS sensor, resulting in true color, smooth tonal transitions and natural gradations. The PowerShot S110 lets you shoot in RAW mode, which records all the information captured by the sensor, giving you outstanding flexibility and complete creative control when editing your images with Canon\u2019s powerful bundled software, and the camera allows you to record in RAW and JPEG formats simultaneously. Now in RAW mode, you can even select among several aspect ratios, including 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, 1:1, and 4:5.\n\nADD GPS DATA TO EASILY IDENTIFY IMAGES BY TIME AND LOCATION\nRECORD GPS+ DATA ON YOUR SMARTPHONE USING THE FREE DOWNLOAD OF THE CANON CAMERAWINDOW APP** AND WIRELESSLY ADD THE LOCATION DATA TO THE IMAGES IN YOUR CAMERA.\nThe PowerShot S110 with its built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae allows you to tag images with GPS+ data recorded by your smartphone loaded with the free Canon CameraWindow app**. With an easy setup, your smartphone will record location data such as latitude, longitude, altitude and shooting time. Then after you're done shooting, simply transfer the location data to wirelessly add the information to the images in camera. Perfect for organizing albums and vacation photos, this feature ensures you'll always know where and when your images were recorded.\n\n+ In certain countries and regions, the use of GPS may be restricted. Therefore be sure to use GPS in accordance with the laws and regulations of your country or region. Be particularly careful when traveling outside your home country. As a signal is received from GPS satellites, take sufficient measures when using in locations where the use of electronics is regulated. Cellular data charges may apply.\n** This software enables you to upload images to social network services.
