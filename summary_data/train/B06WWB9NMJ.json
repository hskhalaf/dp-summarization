      "text": "My beautician recommended Pureology Hydrate Sheer Shampoo for my fine, flyaway hair that is prone to split ends. I rate this product 5 stars because it preserves color better than any other shampoo I have used, even with daily use. Expecting the dried-out feeling of my scalp that is typical with commercial shampoos, I initially wondered whether my hair was getting clean with Pureology Sheer. After 7 months of use, this shampoo has redefined my expectations for \"clean.\" My hair feels greasier than usual one day after shampooing, but also looks more natural and healthier because of stable color and decreased frizziness. Glad I can shampoo daily without extra damage.",

Because it\u2019s low in water content, it\u2019s more concentrated so you can use a lot less than shampoos at the chain pharmacies, which makes this price a lot more reasonable. It leaves my hair feeling healthy, retains my hair color nicely, and I get good volume. I used Pureologie\u2019s pink volume shampoo for years and this is a solid replacement. I\u2019m the type of person that tries other products and switches brands regularly. However, I started using Pureology about 15 years ago because it was sulfate-free. I try other products but continue to be a Pureology customer after all these years. Great stuff.",
