      "text": "The recommendations from the PBS show America's Test Kitchen have not let me down yet and I love that you can always find the products on Amazon. Their tests show that wine only lost 10\u00b0 after 7 hours. I only keep a bottle in it during dinner for about an hour and it stays refrigerator cold. The inserts are thin, freeze quickly, and take little space in the freezer so I store them there. The bottle also stays dry and messless vs ice. Well made and looks great as well.",

      "text": "We were pleasantly surprised and pleased with this wine cooler. First, It is quite attractive in a combination of polished and brushed stainless. The four frozen panels were removed from the freezer in the quart Ziploc bag I had placed them in for ease use. They slice into slots at the bottom of the cooler to form a circle. The liner is now inserted to cover them and soon it becomes quite chilled. Now it is ready for the wine. We were so happy to have a perfectly dry wine bottle, as those in ice are always so messy. The cooler keeps wine cool for several hours. We could ask nothing extra from this fine product.",

Clearly I'm not demanding much of it but under those circumstances it excels. It works much better than the old cooler with ice that I used to use, no need to keep a towel handy to dry off the bottle for every pour, no mess, no fuss. So for those of you just trying to maintain the temperature of a bottle of wine while you drink it, this is a great solution.",
