He loves them! Nike run's sort of narrow verses a Reebok sneaker and he was concerned they would be too wide. They fit wonderful and he said the memory foam is so comfortable! He ordered a second pair!! Plus I ended up ordering my adult son a pair as he loved them so much! Great sneaker for a great price!!",

The mesh padding under the breathable criss-cross pattern did not extend to the tip of the shoe in the toe region on either shoe. As a result these developed a hole in the top of the criss-cross pattern on both shoes within two months. This was with the shoes fitting appropriately, the shoes always worn with socks, and the shoes worn an average of 3 times per week. My previous Reeboks did not have this issue and lasted 2.5 years.",
