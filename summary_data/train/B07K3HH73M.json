      "text": "I am a recreational table tennis player, but Joola has been around for as long as I can remember. Many of their paddles are certified for professional tournament play, but I never really understood (or tried, for that matter) what made them better than the inexpensive ones I had bought at Big5 or Walmart. When I received this Joola paddle, I was surprised by how GOOD it felt in my hands. There also is a noticeable difference in the quality and workmanship over the cheaper paddles, and the control and speed are slightly better. This is a great beginner paddle!

At first I didn't know anything about them but we have definitely learned a lot. This paddle is one of my personal favorites. As I have already mentioned, I am a beginner but have been practicing everyday. I have learned several new serves and how to put a spin and backspin on my serves. This racket feels good in your hands. I would recommend this for beginners. Also, as mentioned above we have tried several brands. Don't waste your time... buy Joola!!!",

For the best action, keep the racket face clean, and if performance begins to degrade, get yourself a new racket (perhaps time for an upgrade?).",
