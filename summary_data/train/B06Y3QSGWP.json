Very high quality unit, well deigned and constructed and the \"bic pen\" type on/off mechanism is really ingenious for controlling water flow while you wash your dog. Over the years, I've used a number of cheap versions of this in the past and always felt like I was struggling with the unit on my hand while trying to control the dog and the water- this elegantly solves that problem with the in palm flow switch. Also, I'm impressed that the set included everything needed to install the unit on a home shower including a y-valve and teflon tape.",

This tool works perfectly and cuts bath time down substantially - the scrubber gets the water through the mass of hair and down to the skin very quickly - it also worked well for the short-haired mixes. Shorter bath time, with less fuss.",

But the reason I really love it is that it makes washing my dogs super easy. I have a Chihuahua mix and a German shepherd mix and it made bathing them faster and easier. Neither one of them exactly fight baths but they more slowly try to worm their way out of the bathtub. So the quicker the bath the better. It\u2019s gentle enough for the short haired Chihuahua but does a good job of rinsing the longer haired German shepherd mix. Five stars easy.",

I don't see the need for this device personally, when your fingers and a big plastic cup from a football concession stand works just as well...I guess they both cost about the same, but the cup came with an ice cold beverage in it.",

There is not enough stream coming out and not enough water force delivered, much less than a typical garden hose nozzle, for a large thick-haired dog. Probably would work very well with small to medium dogs (e.g., Chihuahua, Basset Hound, etc.) or maybe a large dog with very short hair (e.g., Weimaraner), but definitely not (as we tried) with a 135lb. Akita. It would have taken FOREVER with this device. Had to end up throwing it away. Again, probably a great tool for the right application/dog.",
