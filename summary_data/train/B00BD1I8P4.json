If you already have some Sonos speakers and have the app set up was simple, 1 cable plug it in, discover the speaker, perform the \"update\" that's it. Box to operational in 15 mins. As far as sound quality goes, it's Sonos, nuff said. I purchased this to help with my poor hearing and missing half the dialogue on programs, this is certainly an improvement. In summing up, a top notch sound component at a mid range price, buy one. 1 glitch, mismatch in lipscync on UHD content on Sky Q, I'm sure there's a fix but I've only had it a couple of days.",
