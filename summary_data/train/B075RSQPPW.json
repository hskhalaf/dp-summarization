It keeps the beer cold for right up to the time that I swallow the last mouthful and I am impressed. I highly recommend this glass. However, one caveat. I did not expect that i would be warned about putting the glass in the dishwasher because that might disengage a manufacturing plug on the bottom of the glass. It must be washed by hand. However, that is no taxing chore just a minor inconvenience in exchange for the satisfaction the glass has given me. I think it's a fair trade.",

Fortunately they came through just fine but now it's hand washing only. It's not because they are cheaply made only because of the unique method of construction. Buy them, you'll love them!
