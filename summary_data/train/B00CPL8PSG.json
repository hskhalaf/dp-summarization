It was getting those crazy Cylinder Mis-Fires when I read about this product. As soon as I put this in via a gas fill up, I could tell the difference right away. It has ran great these past 8 months and the Service Engine Soon light that had been on since around 70,000 miles is no more. Your results may vary but this stuff is awesome.",

My car has 107,403 miles on it. The service engine light came on briefly then went off. No problems. Just quick acceleration and smooth idling.

Noticed a difference in the idle and response after about 3 gallons of fuel ran through it. I highly recommend Jectron. It\u2019s a high quality additive. My only complaint is the inner seal was slightly leaking upon arrival. If it was leaking any more, it would of leaked into the box. The little funnel is very useful for pretty much every car.",
