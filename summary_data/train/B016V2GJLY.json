Can't wait to get the 2\" backsplash to complete the look! Once I'm done refurbishing my cabinets and laying new floor, this oven is going to be the gem of the kitchen. Another note - Robert from Executive Appliance is an absolute gem. So helpful and communicative. I'll be returning to him for other appliance needs in the future!",
