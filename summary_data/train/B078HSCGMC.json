      "text": "Very good sound and Bluetooth functionality. A bit heavy compared with Bose QC 35 II. The main drawback for me is that there\u2019s too much clamping force on my ears. The cups are a bit shallow so they put pressure on my ears, and my ears are small. The Bose by comparison are almost like wearing nothing. These PSB headphones are superior in sound, but the Bose are far more comfortable.",

I returned them solely because of fit, I have a large head and fit was pretty tight and uncomfortable with time, their fit was similar to NAD 50, which sounded great but had a very tight headband for me. I actually really liked phones, just the fit was not good",

I had their M4U2 headphones and loved those but given the purity approach of the company, never thought they'd make a non-wired headphone. I'm glad they did. The fit is perfection. I have the Bose QC wireless and find those to move around a little. These stay put. The sound quality and room feel technology are just epic. The noise cancellation is definitely better than the Bose QC. Love these all the way around.",

You can easily use these on an airplane with the included adapter cord -- so these are both wireless and wired in one convenient package! It also has a nice carry case, and larger stereo adapter, too, for those who still have large home systems. I'd never heard of this brand before, but learned it's been around for about 2 decades, and is known for quality. Buy these with confidence!",

They don't feel or sound \"cheap\" but they also aren't as nice sounding as some studio headphones I've tried for a few hundred dollars LESS.
