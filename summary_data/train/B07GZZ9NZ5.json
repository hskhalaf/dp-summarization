I spent $217.00 on what is advertised as refurbished and essentially \u201cas new\u201d condition pair of head phones. These were purchased in June 2018 and stopped working February 2019. The warranty is 90 days, so by no means are they obligated to replace them, however I don\u2019t think anyone would be satisfied with $217 for 8 months of use. I cannot in good faith recommend re-com or any of their offerings. Spend the extra money and get new ones, and avoid Re-Com.",

The right earphone has a plastic piece that connects it to assembly that goes over your head...it has completely broken off into pieces. I can\u2019t believe this. I could probably tape it together but it would be totally embarrassing. Has this happened to anyone else?",
