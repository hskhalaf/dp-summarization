A few of my friends (girls) said it was a little hard on their forearms while passing, but once we adjusted the pressure to a good amount, there were no complaints. This is a great ball for the price.",

It will last you forever, as long as you don't abuse it (use it outside/around sharp objects/kick it) Still a great option, even though there is a newer model.",

So far to me it has a nice padding to it - it does feel a little heavy so not sure what thats about. I will not be able to use it for another week so we will see if it loses air sitting.

      "text": "If you're playing co-ed, girls will complain about this ball after about 5 passes. It's a little hard. Honestly, I'm a big guy, but after peppering with this ball for a few minutes, my radii were starting to get a little numb too. So it hurts to pass, but is very satisfying to set and hit. You definitely do NOT want to be on the receiving end of a hard hit, no matter how or where you take it. Long story short, this ball feels pretty sweet, but your friends won't want to play with it. Ultimately, not worth the hefty pricetag.",

    "description": "The Mikasa MVA200 Indoor Volleyball is tested and ready for high-quality performance in the Olympic Arena and was used in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. Features include an eight-panel swirl design that allows for more contact area on the surface to improve passing and control and a unique dimpled microfiber material that creates turbulence and cuts down on resistance as the ball flies through the air. This lack of resistance allows the ball to fly through the air in a truer form so you can be creative with your serves and spikes.",
