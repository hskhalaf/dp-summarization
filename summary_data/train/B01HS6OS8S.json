I'm still wearing it but I can't put anything too thick or heavy underneath it, so I went ahead and ordered one size up and will probably end up giving this one to my sister or donating it.

The down is super warm, there are cuffs in the sleeves so no drafts and finally - BIG pockets that don't bag out or change the overall look of the coat. Add the fun (fake) fur and this jacket was a great purchase. It has a feminine cut to it as well - bonus in a down jacket!",

Im 5' 6\" and 133lbs slim and the medium just look square on me. No shape. It wasn't flattering to my figure. The small would've been better. Other than that cute jacket but should've been a little less in price",

I have broad shoulders and the S was snug around the shoulders/arms with thermal and fleece layers underneath - but still loose at the waist (I'm 5ft 5 and about 140 for context). Coat feels surprisingly warm given the light weight. Like the inner elasticated cuffs at wrist. The fur is def faux looking but its a hundred bucks! Manage those expectations folks : ) Nice coat for the price.",

The real test was the weather, down to 20 degrees F. Everything that wasn't covered by this jacket was freezing. Everything that was covered by this jacket was comfortable. Overall, love it!",
