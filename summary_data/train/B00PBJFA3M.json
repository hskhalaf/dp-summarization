I also use my cup during ovulation for ttc. I don't know why more women don't use these. It's so much better than the typical tampons and pads. The price is right. The quality is great. I can see these lasting for many years.",

Fortunately, it's great every other day of my period just would suggest a light liner on heavy days. These cups are not too hard or too soft, they're a great in-the-middle leaning more toward soft which I love. They're pretty, easy to clean, and much more earth-conscious. Thank you for your product!",

The only thing I have to say is be careful with long nails because scratches are really painful and make sure you\u2019re relaxed, also be gentle. If you feel it on your butt then it\u2019s likely you did it correctly. Didn\u2019t leak, just use a panty liner or pad just in case you didn\u2019t get all the blood when wiping after inserting the cup. No regrets, comfortable and I don\u2019t even feel it there. Removal is a little tricky or slippery so make sure you have a good grasp on the bottom of the cup.",

It takes some practice putting them in and taking them out but once you have it down you really can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s there.
