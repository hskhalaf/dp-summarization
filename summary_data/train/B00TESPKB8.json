      "text": "Got this to weigh foster kittens. It is great. Very superior to my old one. Weighs quickly, gives a stable weight, and weighs small kittens (under two pounds) as accurately as a scale made for weights under 5 pounds. After using the scale for seven months, I have to downgrade the scale. The issue is not accuracy, it is the very short battery life. I'm already on the second battery change. The scale uses a tiny button-type battery that just isn't up to the demand of frequent use. I own and heavily use a kitchen scale and our bathroom scale, and batteries last years in these units. If you get this scale, lay in a supply of batteries.",

As far as using it to weigh a newborn or wiggling baby who is pretty mellow with most things EXCEPT being weighed... it gets the job done. It's not a hospital grade scale and the weight measurement is a bit off from what we get at the doctors. As a nursing mother it is nice to see the numbers going up. It's about half a pound give or take but again this is weighing a baby who at no point in the process lays still. I'd recommend it and buy it again.",
