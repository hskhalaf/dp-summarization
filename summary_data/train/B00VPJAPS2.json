It is simply too slow to operate for people to be able to split logs as quickly as they claim. It is also not built to last either. I didn't have a chance to use mine until after the return period had ended and it broke the very first day I used it. Save your money and either split your logs the old fashioned way or pony up a little more to get a gas or electric splitter.",

I do not think there are any electric splitters with this much force, and if you go with a 10 ton gas powered splitter, you are talking major bucks.

Also on some larger (>8\" dia) you can start the split with the axe and the ram can finish it for you. The only complaint I have was the packaging was not good enough to survive the shipping process.

One side has a stronger push but can be harder to break the log so switching to the other handle is likely much easier but has a shorter pushing distance. After breaking up logs outside I brought it in and keep it next to my wood stove. Now my 7 year old makes the kindling with it inside.",

I found that I needed a block of wood to extend the range of travel of the hydraulic piston for some logs shorter than 12 inches.",
