      "text": "Latest firmware removed the ability for web address access to the camera. What this means is you can no longer type the IP address of the camera and be prompted for username/password. This makes it impossible to use your server to stream/record video. So if you are a synology server user and hope to record video you will no longer be able to. Prior to firmware 1.07 you were able to use with synology server for unified streaming across multiple cameras, recording to server hard drive and local access to make changes. Unfortunately I purchased multiple cameras prior to the firmware update and no stuck with cameras that don't work for my application.",

      "text": "This camera is great! The only problem I've had from it is that anytime headlights shine through an area it sets off the motion detection and I live by the road so it makes it difficult to keep on at night. The app interface could be cleaned up and stream lined as it can get really confusing flipping through all of the different screens trying to find the one setting you need to adjust. Other than that, the picture is great, the audio is fantastic, it's definitely not as expensive as other cameras and it's very high quality.",

Difficult to set up, had to read others reviews to learn password, not provided with instructions. Frequently fails to livestream to my phone, like right now. I've never figured out how to make it auto record when triggered by other home sensors. On the plus side, the image and audio quality are good, when they work, which is not always. Very dissatisfied with this overpriced and finnicky gadget. I expect better from Samsung. Will look for other brands of cameras to fully set up home monitoring system. Had this for 6 months, glad I only bought 1.",

Quality isn't as great as I hoped from the app. mounted about 7' on a wall, and hard to zoom in to see if baby's eye's are open or closed most of the time. App takes about 10 seconds from the time you go \"I want to see the video\" to the time you actually see the video. It has been very stable on my wifi though, and haven't needed to reboot it or anything.",

For live monitoring, the camera is excellent but for recording purposes it is essentially useless.

    "description": "1080p Full HD WiFi CameraView larger SAMSUNG HD PRO WIFI IP CAMERA (SNH-P6410BN)\nWhether you want to check in on what your pet is doing, see if the kids are safe or just want the reassurance of knowing that your home is secure, the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro is the perfect way to keep an eye on what matters most. You can view your SmartCam HD Pro from your mobile device anytime from anywhere in the world, giving you peace of mind. Designed for optimum performance with Full HD 1080p video quality, simple set-up and an intuitive experience, the SmartCam HD Pro provides the high caliber video experience you would expect from Samsung. The SmartCam HD Pro can be easily customized to instantly alert you to both motion and audio events so you won\u2019t miss a thing! The SmartCam HD Pro delivers real-time notification of activity through your iPhone, iPad, or Android smartphone or tablet. It also has a built-in slot for a microSDXC memory card which allows for video storage for later review. Once you\u2019ve downloaded the Samsung SmartCam app and have set up your SmartCam HD Pro, there are no extra costs or monthly fees for viewing or storage. The SmartCam HD Pro WiFi IP camera introduces many advanced features such as Wide Dynamic Range, Samsung Light Enhancer, Advanced Motion & Audio Detection, and Motion Zone Select. Each camera is equipped with a built-in microphone and speaker for crisp, clear Two-Way Talk \u2500 one more way Samsung helps you be in two places at once!\n\nSIMPLE WIFI SETUP\nSetting up the device is simple and requires no use of software or CDs. Simply download the free Samsung SmartCam app for Android or iOS, available on the App Store and Google Play, to your mobile device. The intuitive setup wizard helps you to begin viewing your camera in a matter of minutes.\n\nADVANCED MOTION & AUDIO DETECTION\nIf your pet enters an \u201coff-limits\u201d room, the kids come home from school, or a window is shattered, you\u2019ll be immediately notified. False alarms due to slight changes in lighting or minor movements such as a houseplant gently ruffled by an air vent, are now a thing of the past! The SmartCam HD Pro\u2019s Advanced Motion & Audio Detection recognizes that things like rolling cloud coverage, falling leaves and swaying branches are not key events. You will only be notified, through instant push notifications to your mobile device, of true motion events such as someone entering the room. And in low light conditions, audio detection has you doubly covered listening for loud incidents you should know about.\n\n\nView larger 1080P FULL HD VIDEO\nThe SmartCam HD Pro WiFi IP camera provides up to 1080p Full HD streaming video to your mobile device, delivering better image quality than 720p resolution. Capture every detail of your kids playing video games, your cat poised at the window awaiting your return, or even the cash register inside your store. The large 1/2.8-inch CMOS sensor allows maximum light through the lens \u2500 yielding vivid colors, brighter video and stunning detail.\n\nTWO-WAY TALK\nGo ahead: remind your child to do her homework or tell your dog to get off the couch. The Samsung Enhanced Two-Way Talk feature lets you not only hear what\u2019s going on around the camera, but also allows you to talk back through your smartphone, no matter where you are. A built-in audio minijack that accommodates external speakers (not included) amplify and enhance the sound quality.\n\nView larger SAMSUNG LIGHT ENHANCER (SLE) & WIDE DYNAMIC RANGE (WDR)\nSLE: The Samsung Light Enhancer enriches available light in dark areas to give you superior image detail in even the most challenging low light conditions. If you wake up with the nagging feeling that you left the burner on under the kettle, a quick check from your smartphone will put the issue \u2500 and you \u2500 to bed. WDR: Bright light streaming through windows poses no problem for the SmartCam HD Pro. The WDR technology enhances details in backlit conditions to give you a clear view of the outside, while eliminating murky silhouettes in the foreground. So while it may be high noon outside, you\u2019ll clearly see the sheriff\u2019s star as your little cowgirl has a showdown in front of the playroom window.\n\nView larger TRUE DAY & NIGHT AND ULTRA-WIDE ANGLE\nThe SmartCam HD Pro features an advanced IR Cut Filter for accurate, vibrant colors. Even in darkness, the camera provides clear, nighttime video up to 16 feet. No more need for barefoot late-night safety checks! While other cameras have constricted angles that limit your view, Samsung\u2019s 128\u00b0 Ultra-Wide Angle lens gives you a wider view to maximize your recording coverage without compromising quality. Want to know what the kids are doing with the crayon over there in the corner? The SmartCam HD Pro puts you right there!\n\nMOTION ZONE SELECT\nMotion Zone Select further fine-tunes what you want the camera to pay attention to. If you want to keep your eye on the window, but the dog runs back and forth beneath it, Simply draw a box around it on your screen and the camera will alert you when someone is approaching outside. You can select up to three motion zones in the camera\u2019s field of view.\n\nLOCAL VIDEO STORAGE\nCapture those important events right onto your SmartCam HD Pro. Local video storage is possible through a micro SD card slot with the ability to record directly onto a microSDXC memory card* with up to 64GB capacity. Set your camera for continuous recording, record at scheduled times, or, to minimize viewing time and storage space, record only when motion and sound events are detected. You can even view the recorded video right from your mobile device from anywhere in the world. *SD card not included.",
