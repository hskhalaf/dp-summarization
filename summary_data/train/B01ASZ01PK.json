I did notice it is smaller then other pillow pets we have. Definitely more for a toddler. I don't see it being big enough for a bigger kid to use as a pillow. Looks great and seems to be good quality. Very happy with it.",

      "text": "I had concerns when purchasing it about how comfortable the face and helmet area would be to lay on but it is very plush and comfy. We got this for my son to use at daycare and he loves it. It also has a velcro strap to fold it up when not using it as a pillow and then an additional piece of fabric that covers the velcro when not in use, which is a nice touch. The only downside is that the white fabric lost its vibrancy so quick. Usually I can get the color back when washing in oxy-clean but that was not the case. Considering its for a toddler I guess that's to be expected though.",
