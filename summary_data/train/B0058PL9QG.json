This lens was the missing link in my cache. This will allow me to grab pro level images with shallow depth of field or in low light when it counts! The auto focus is ULTRA fast and accurate on my Panasonic G7 and even faster on my Panasonic GH5 ( I'm talking stills). This would be the perfect lens if it only had weather sealing but that's the trade off for only $349. (Amazon payments is sweet!)",

This 45mm lens is comparable to a 90mm lens on a full frame 35mm camera. So it is a wonderful portrait lens, great indoors and outdoors. This lens is tack sharp across the full frame. Depth of field is wonderfully shallow so your background and foreground just disappear into a silky softness. Put this lens on an Olympus OM-D or Panasonic G3 or GH2, and your images will beat the pants off mid-level APS-C DSLRs and, hard to believe, go toe to toe with the last-generation full frame DSLRs (i.e. the Canon 5d Mk2).",

If you are shooting video, suggest instead grabbing a good quality Canon FD 50mm f1.4 or Nikkor equivalent with speed booster instead. This lens can cause some pretty bad moire in certain situations when shooting video whereas the previously mentioned vintage lenses will not. DOF is super shallow wide open which can provide some good bokeh, just be sure to use that ultra zoom to set focus properly as it can fall in and out of tack sharpness easily when shooting handheld.",
