Having an older heating system I didnt have a common wire but decided I'd just run the necessary wiring. It was a bit of a hassle but well worth the effort. The ecobee 3 app works flawlessly.

All the same features without the fancy touch screen which, unless you want the futuristic look of the chameleon screen to blend into the wall behind it, does everything else the more expensive unit offers. So simple to adjust or monitor temperature with smartphone, computer or tablet while at home, on our way home or on vacation to make sure it's just how you want it!",
