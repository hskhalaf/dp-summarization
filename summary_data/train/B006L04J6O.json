The Sorel box had a split in the top, the sticky label was stuck to tissue paper and cardboard shapers were missing.",

But if this doesn\u2019t bother you and you are more about the warmth and function in cold weather and snow then I highly recommend these. They are also a great look.

Which is not the fit I expect from riding boots, or some other fashion every day wear type boot. Very cute also.",

They are definitely heavy boots to wear around. Wont feel much lighter than wearing ski boots... Want to give a 5 star but need to wear around for an entire day and see what my feet feel like afterward.",

AND though Sorel makes more than just boots, theres a boot in everything Sorel makes. Sorel combines felt, wool, premium leather, and flawless construction with people who aren\u2019t afraid to get their boots dirty. To measure your foot, place your feet flat on a piece of paper and mark your longest toe and the back of your foot. It is best to do this standing and wearing socks. Measure the length straight from your longest toe to the back of your foot using a ruler or measuring tape. Use the chart to find your size\n\nSorel's cold weather footwear is ideal for those participating in active winter sports like snowmobiling or sledding, or for activities where maximum protection is required -- like all-season hunting or fishing, or simply going to work.",
