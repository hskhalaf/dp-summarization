      "text": "Excellent monitor. I play Rocket League and the predecessor to this monitor XG2401 was rated at a 10ms input lag response (One of the fastest 144hz monitors). I imagine this XG2402 is the same, if not better. In any case it changes the way I play RL for the better, especially coming from 60hz. Only 2 minor problems so far: 1. Buttons on front rock the monitor up and down when you press them. 2. The wire holder on the back is pretty flimsy and I almost broke it trying to put it on the stand. Otherwise very pleased and I recommend highly after about 2 weeks of use.",

After a lot of research this was the most affordable monitor that supports both 144hz AND Freesync over hdmi (The older XG2401 dosent support freesync over hdmi). Works flawlessly, Colors are decent especially for the price and the stand is amazing and very adjustable. Perfect budget gaming monitor. Highly recommend especially if you might be in an oddball situation like myself.",

Thankfully, you don't need drivers for 144hz support. You can change it on Catalyst Control Center. 2- Location of usb3 ports are useless. I still have to get back of my pc to use them.

Despite the dead pixel, this monitor has worked well and I would purchase again. Great quality picture and settings for me.",
