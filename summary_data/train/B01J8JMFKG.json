      "text": "I'm very happy with this lavender scented waterless dog shampoo. I have a lab mix with food allergies/sensitive skin. I recently changed my dog food brand with great success. I was very pleasantly surprised with this spray. Between the new dog food & this spray, no more Benadryl for my fur baby. I sprayed this on & rubbed it in his skin. He's been clean ever since. There are several things that I like about this spray: the safe ingredients, the light scent, the clean smell that it leaves, even after a few days & the lavender scent fades, it dries quickly, & also that there is no more itching! This is the only one that I'll buy!",
