The results were liberating, giving him control over this aspect of his life again. Unfortunately he has since passed away, I appreciate the sense of freedom to control the lights (and thermostat, the door locks and much much more with other devices and multiple Echo and Dots in various rooms...) this setup was able to provide him in his final stage of life. For that sense of liberation despite his physical situation I'll always be thankful.",

I admit that I am not very tech savvy, but had no difficulties setting up the Echo. Once setup was finally completed, it worked fine, but was harder to use the App. I ended up returning it because, when all is said and done, I did not have enough outlets to have one unusable, since it is located in one of my most used rooms.",

      "text": "This model (HS100) looks the same as the discontinued model with energy monitoring (HS110), but it does NOT have energy monitoring. 4 stars because this was basically my mistake (the description never claims it has energy monitoring) and I'm sure it works fine otherwise, just wanted to write a review in case other people come here looking for that feature.",

      "text": "I have a TV that won't shut off, no joke. Other than its incessant need to keep turning itself back on all the time, it works beautifully. This smart plug is the answer to my problem. I can plug my possessed TV into it and when it starts with its antics, I can simply turn it off with a touch on my phone. Genius. I LOVE this smart plug, a few bucks and an incredibly easy setup and I no longer have to replace a stupid expensive TV. This smart plug is amazing! Super easy to set-up, works beautifully and is a lifesaver - well, a TV saver. LOVE it!",
