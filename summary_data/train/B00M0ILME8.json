This machine is strong, it starts right up and it\u2019s versatile with the three positions on the handle. It literally takes a second to change the position of the trigger relative to the blades. That makes it easy to trim sides, tops and the back of hedges. Don\u2019t be fooled by the brand Tanaka it\u2019s been around for awhile and it\u2019s a quality brand used by many professionals and homeowners alike. This gas trimmer is a time saver. Unplug that corded trimmer and get with the program, like I did. You won\u2019t regret it.",

I did notice a few others had the same issue. Something to consider, but again the machine itself is fantastic, starts quick and runs perfectly, trims so nice and clean, well designed and quality built, I would recommend this product.",

Only have used them once so far but they were fantastic. I bought the 20\" and compared to my electric 20\", I feel like I can do a job in half the time because they cut so well on the 1st pass. Some people may feel these are a little heavy. They were good for me but after about a 5 hr job my arms were a little worn out.",

However, this item has been leaking gas from (because of a faulty grommet) which spills fuel continually which is a serious hazard. I have emailed the company countless times over the last 2 months to get a replacement part and no one has contacted me. The manufacture is overseas and can't be contacted by phone. American repairs facilities will not work on it because they don't have parts I am stuck with a $228.oo paper weight which I can't use.",

The trimmer feels less than stated weight and since i am a woman of short stature and not the strongest in the world, This really helps. Overall i am glad i finally have a more powerful gas hedger bec no matter which electric one, they simply don't measure up.",

I found out that they still make their top line in Japan. It works ok, but we will see how it holds up. Almost wish I had paid a little more for the Stihl or Husqvarna now. After using twice last season, now i try to use it and the fuel line going into the tank is broken already, gas all over me and now I can't get my trimming done. Stick with Stihl, Husqvarna or Echo.",
