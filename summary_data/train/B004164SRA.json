      "text": "Lovely kitchen scale! I've been baking for a while but always used to make do with measuring equipments, doing very complicated calculations. I decided I needed a kitchen scale when I started seeing recipes which required me to add 3/8th of an egg or whatever. Decided to get this one based on reviews, and it's perfect. Tares down to zero, gives the weight in different units, auto-powers off quickly, very accurate, and easy to clean up. It's made my life so much easier and my baking better! Highly recommended!",

I placed a small bowl on it, zeroed out the weight of the bowl, then filled the bowl to get the exact amount of the ingredient by weight! This scale is so small I just slide it in a drawer when not in use which clears up more of my counter space. I just love it!",

The flat design, accuracy, ease of use, storage, and very reasonable cost of this scale made me purchase a replacement and write this review. I highly recommend the Ozeri for home cooks and bakers.",

The ability to tare the weight of a container and measure in early ounces or grams were a must and it does all that perfectly. I would totally recommend these scales.",

Anything else (honey, oil) with a different density won't register the proper volume.

I use these suckers 10x a day measuring liquids, cereal,meat, etc etc. The only downfall I find is that it doesn't measure initial 1 - 2g of something like powders. Meaning that If I put 1g of a powder on the scale, it won't register until maybe 3 or 4g. then every gram continually adds up/ measures.
