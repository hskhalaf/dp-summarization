I scoured amazon for preggo pillows and read quite a few reviews, and compare the prices to pros and cons. I'm happy I pulled the trigger on this mainly cause it served it's purpose and helps her sleep, but also because the cost savings vs preggo specific pillows and the function of a body pillow after the baby gets ejected. Do yourself a favor and pick one up and don't forget the cover. Also the pillow is not extremely firm and very comfortable.",
