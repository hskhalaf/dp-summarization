The ladies in the class were amazed that I found a size to fit my size 14 flippers I have as feet. I got the 19M. They were a bit tight at first but after about 10hours they fit perfect and are very comfortable. Too bad they don't teach my feet to be in the right place at the right time. I gave it 4 stars because I had to secure some seams to withstand my 233lb frame.. These poor shoes are gonna take such punishment.",

These are fabulous for practicing or social dancing. My \u201cproper\u201d west coast shoes either make my toes go numb and blister my heels (heeled sandals) or turn my big toe into a giant bruise and blister my heel (men\u2019s/unisex shoes). These are sweet relief. Especially for weekend events where I\u2019m dancing for 16 hours a day!!",

With heavy wear and excessive dancing they do wear holes in the toes, and on the sides, but the double layer of canvas prevented my foot from meeting the stage. I was able to die them brown with Rit Dye, but had to color the rubber with Sharpies and paint pens, and replace the shoe laces with black ones. Other than that, they lasted for about 3 months with heavy dancing. They are wonderful!",

Otherwise, the product is great for school productions and exactly what she was required to purchase and priced much better than anything we could find locally.",

    "description": "This jazz boot from Sansha will have you performing your best. The Soho features a lightweight canvas upper, a lace-up front, and a split suede sole for maximum flexibility.\n\nIn 1982, Franck Raoul-Duval, a 25-year-old Frenchman with a passion for dance and Russian history, created a new type of ballet shoe. After numerous trials and adjustments, he came up with an innovation that changed the lives of dancers everywhere. The split-sole ballet slipper, with its glove-like fit, was born. Sansha now manufactures an extensive range of dance shoes for everything from ballet to jazz, hip-hop to flamenco, and ballroom to tap. Sansha collaborates with dance professionals, teachers and store owners to remain a prominent brand in the dance capitals of the world.",
