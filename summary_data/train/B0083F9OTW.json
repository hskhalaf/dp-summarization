Not a peep or a squirt on the second, third, fourth, etc. try. Also, when you hold the canister, it feels like there is nothing in it, it is so light. Too bad. If it worked, I think it would be effective because that one blast was impressive......so disappointing.",

I will note that this is NOT for all dogs. Two of my friends' dogs will cower and retreat, sometimes shaking for minutes after this is used. So definitely test it out and do not continue if this happens to your dog. This is not simply compressed air (as many of the competitors are) but contains lavender and chamomile, which is supposed to have a pheromone effect. Whether or not this is true, I don't know, but the product does work well and has a pleasant scent.",

I actually used the spray only 3 or 4 times. After that, I just held the can up and he immediately backed down. It's been a couple of months now since I've even had to do that; the behavior seems to have been completely eliminated. The smell of the spray is not horribly unpleasant, but can seem a bit strong if sprayed right near the face. Still, an effective and affordable tool for getting your pup in line when needed. Definitely worth a try.",

The loud noise didn't even make him flinch and the pheromones seemed to have no effect. I tried it on several occasions and it did nothing to even distract his leash aggression.

It has made a HUGH difference in the barking! Most of the time, all I have to do now, is say NO BARK, if any one of them starts & they stop immediately! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY ONE LOOKING TO CHANGE A BAD BEHAVIOR.......NOT ONLY FOR BARKING! I only wish it came in a larger size!! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!",

I understand my little dogs bark is a defense mechanism (of sorts) for her, but when it became incessant and I couldn't get her to stop it was beyond annoying for me...and my neighbors. \"Stop That\"\"has proven to be a miracle remedy.. Only had to use it twice... the noise is startling so it really got her attention immediately...the pheramone aroma is really nice and I believe has residual calming effect....except now I don't get the opportunity to smell it as all I have to do now is SHOW her the little orange can and she stops barking.",

I'm It sure if it's the spray sound or the safe \"chemical\" that chills out my hyperactive American Bulldog but I don't really care because this stuff works! So well that I don't even have to spray not anymore I just show my dog the can and he relaxes. It's so small and portable easy to take on walks or store in your purse.",

Went through 2 cans and still the exact same reaction. The dogs are terrified of the spray because of loud burst. Each time they recoiled in fear as they barked non-stop. We saw zero change in their attitude to the spray. We just became sick of smelling the sweet smell.",
