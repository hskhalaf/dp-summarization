He does get hung up on different levels when he's not sure what to do and asks for my assistance but otherwise this entertains him for his allowed amount of time that he gets to play. We own most of the Lego games and this is one of his favorite.",

I have had to jump in and \u201cfigure out\u201d what the game wants you to do at times but they love the game. For reference, it\u2019s easier game play than the lego marvel avengers game. That one frustrates them.",
