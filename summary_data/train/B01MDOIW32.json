Cooking eggs has proven to be easy and stick free. It had also been a breeze to clean. Time will tell if the non stick coating lasts since other pans lost their non stick coating with use. Am considering purchasing a larger size. There may be less expensive pans that perform as well, but I\u2019ve been happy with all my le crueset purchases and decided to give this a shot.",
