This one I purchased was indecent shape, and thought that data transfer would be a snap. Well it didn't perform quite as well, data transfer really slow, and didn't get all my apps either, it too was slow, and had to manually load my Apps. The phone kept getting warner to touch, just my observation, my other phone didn't get quite as warm. The Vendor contacted me via email and provided a return mailing label.",

I don't know if that has to do with verizon (Verizon Store Demo Mode) I just disabled the demo app but it would re download itself. Not sure if I'm the only one having this problem. If anyone knows how to fix that; let me know. Greatly appreciated.",

To change between vibrate and silent you have to go into the settings, you can't just use the buttons on the side. And to send a mass text, to add recipients you can't go down the list of contacts and check them off, it only lets you add one recipient at a time. Other than that, I really like how this phone handles and that the screen isn't insanely big. It doesn't seem to lag which was my largest problem with my last phone. It also has really good cameras, both forward facing and rear.",
