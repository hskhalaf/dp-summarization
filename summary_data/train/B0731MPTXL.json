I thought great, I'll get this for our third kid so that it natively fits in the stroller. However, the other 1 star reviews are right. This thing is NARROW. THERE IS NO WAY A 35POUND BABY can actually fit in here. Ours is about 16 pounds now and we are having to buy a new seat. For reference he fits fine in the Peg Pereggo. This is a huge disappointment and not in line with what Britax is capable of bringing to the market",

It may be a little snugger for a chunky babe, but I don't feel like it's too slim. Any car seat is going to be heavy and hot, so I fully expected that. He doesn't over heat in it and I don't mind the weight of it, just think about an arm work out without going to the gym! The shoulder pads are much bigger than the last but again, they just give your baby a little more cushion so the straps aren't digging into its shoulders.",

Only con is that, my newborns head falls sideways and I am unable to put a headrest support in it because of the existing one already in it.",

LOVE IT! The car seat snaps right into the stroller seamlessly and rides so incredibly smoothly. This infant carrier is just a little bit heavier than other carriers but the safety benefits are worth it in my opinion. Installation of the base is easy and straight forward and the carrier snaps in and out with no trouble. Let\u2019s not forgot about this adorable cow print. I highly reccommend Britax!!",
