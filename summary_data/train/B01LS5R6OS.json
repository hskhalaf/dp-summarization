      "text": "Extra nice being able to plug all my electronics in at one place instead. Compact yet robust charging strip. Like that the USB side and outlet sides have separate power buttons. The phone holder notch is a neat little bonus too. Well made, attractive, and extremely functional. Fast charges my Nexus 5X via the USB C port. I am buying more of these right now. I think would make an excellent gift, especially for the gadget lover or geek in your life. Would love to see this in black. Awesome job iClever!",

It also serves as a night light since it lights up on both sides. I also like the fact that you can turn OFF the power during the day or when not in use. Highly recommend!",

Switched one to the AC and all was well. One of the white buttons came off in my bag. Easily put back into place but it should probably be a tad more secure.
