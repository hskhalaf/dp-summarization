It says that the frame can hold 500lbs of normal use but unfortunately it couldn't even withstand half of that weight with normal use.

This should be 5 Stars but mine arrived missing two sets of screws and bolts. I triple-checked the packaging to see if it fell off. It was just missed on their end during final inspection or assembly. So I had to go to Home Depot to get two pairs to complete. Wasn't happy about that and was an inconvenience. Otherwise, it's a nice product and I'd purchase again.",

You can either have the frames slightly offset from each other which looks goofy, or what I did was just get a strip of plastic from McMaster and use it to space. Beyond that, it's rock solid. If it's going to fail it'll be at a weld, and at that point it's not design but fabrication that's at fault. No wiggle, no shaking at all.",

Neither of us had ever owned a bed base like this before and was only used to box springs. We were a little nervous as to how it would work and hold up and so far, a few months into owning this base we have not been disappointed. It's one of the best purchasing decisions we've made regarding bedroom furniture. It sets up in minutes and is very sturdy and supportive for your mattress. It's also extremely quite, it doesn't squeak or produce any noise at all. You can't beat the price and quality you'll receive with this item.",

No surprise, one by one the slats on that thing were breaking. I got this frame to replace it and it's definitely an improvement.
