Noticed it getting loose after only 1 week of use, then broke about 2 months thereafter at the point where arm connects to the base, which is plastic (see pics). This is not acceptable material to be using at the part that is subject to relatively high torsional forces. You don't have to be an engineer to know that this is just simply piss poor design. I would advise avoiding this brand and consider something that is built to last more than a few short months.",

I have had this for several weeks and won't use another brand or mounting device for my phone. because it is a suction cup forer a week",

My phone has only fell off the magnetic mount once in the 10+ times I have used it on off-road adventures, and the suction cup has yet to release from the window since I installed it. The long shaft from the suction cup to the mount bends as needed to adjust the angle of your phone, but is also very stiff and rigid. It holds the phone still during street driving, but does bounce around a bit when driving off-road. Overall, I am happy with this solution for my Jeep!",

The goose neck is a little hard to articulate, but at least doesn't lose its position. Lastly, the suction cup appears to hold pretty well and at least can be re-washed if I have to reposition it. The only disadvantage is that the metal plate interferes with QI charging. If your phone is QI-equipped and you use it, make sure you DON'T attach the metal plate directly to your phone. If you're using a third party QI charging case, don't stick the plate anywhere until you test compatibility with your different charging pads.",

Great thing is when I remove the mount later I can simply peel off the blue painter's tape and leave no evidence of its installation.",
