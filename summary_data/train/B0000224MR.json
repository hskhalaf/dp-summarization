I used them with a werner 24 foot ladder broken down into two sections. I highly recommend... PRO TIP: change the quantity in your cart to 2 and you will save about 50 bucks for whatever reason. If you choose the pair option in the box the cost is around $90 bucks. Choose the one only option for $22 bucks, then change quantity in cart to 2 and get a pair for around $45 bucks instead of $90. Not really sure why they have it setup that way....",

This ladder hook is way too small to extend over the ridge cap. The ladder hook actually dug deep into the middle of the ridge cap damaging it which will cost me hundreds of dollars to repair. This hook needs to be 12 inches longer and the hook end needs to extend about 6 inches further to reach past the ridge cap. If you have inexpensive shingles and a small 6 inch ridge cap, then this hook may work for you.",

They were inexpensive, but I will not use them again. They will spend the rest of their lives in the pile of junk in the barn. Not worth the trouble to return. Please, improve this product!

      "title": "Nice Heavy Duty Product",
      "text": "Nice quality. Made of heavy gauge steel. I used two of these on a 24 extension ladder to fix a roof problem on a very steep roof. I used a piece of waterline pipe insulation tapped to the hook end to keep from damaging the roof at the peak when flipping the ladder over. It does make the end of the ladder relatively heavy so when moving the ladder you will need to adjust for that. I felt very safe on the ladder but you should also use other safety restraints.",

With them I was finally able to safely get on my 10:12 pitch roof and repair some single damage. It was a slow process but I did feel safe while using them. I would definitely buy them again or recommend them to others.",

As I looked the page over, the photo of the item clearly states \"2 Pack\". I wondered if it could be possible that Amazon had listened to people's complaints, and was now shipping 2 hooks per order. I was doubtful, but placed one order, and got one hook. Why they have \"2 Pack\" in the photo is beyond me. (not to mention inaccurate and deceptive) The hook itself does look very good. Heavy, good quality.",
