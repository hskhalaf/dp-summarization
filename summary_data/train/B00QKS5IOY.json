But now they have changed the ingredient list so much - in reference to the added ingredients and they are awful. There is so much \"junk\" in them and they are a strange light green color and the taste is off. I won't be ordering anymore as I do not feel that they are safe to take. Just too much stuff that is not good. Why do these companies selling natural products put so much stuff that is not good for you.",

I've tried: melatonin, valerian, non-time-release magnesiums, magnesium oil, epsom salt baths, magnesium citrate liquid (holding a teaspoon under my tongue had worked better than anything till now). All of these often help but not enough.The first night I tried this Mag SRT I slept well. The second night, too, and the third. It feels like a miracle. Why doesn't everyone know about this? I'm pretty much in gratefulness-shock. I don't even take much, but probably some people will need to.",

I learned from a physician that the body's supply of Magnesium can be lowered when taking certain medications. He suggested a timed release Magnesium supplement. I wanted a high quality supplement to try. I chose this one and the effects are almost immediate. Now the night time continuous leg aching is gone!! I am & will continue to be a regular user of this product. Taken as directed, I have a steady release of Magnesium in my system with no more aches in my legs. Thank you! Deborah G. of PA",

For me, this appears to be the one and only form my body likes. Thank you Jigsaw!",

I don't feel sleepy when taking it, and I sleep better at night. I still take another type of magnesium that helps better with palpitations, but I take it much less often than prior to taking this time released. JigSaw has quite a few formulas, so rather than order a different one, I've put this on my auto-order.",

If you need a quick dose these aren't for you. Get a dissolvable supplement, the kind you mix with hot water. They're the best if you need right now relief.

      "text": "I'm giving this supplement 4 Stars because I appreciate the major effects I'm experiencing from Jigsaw: feeling calm and relaxed without the laxative response that magnesium oxide usually produces. My only problem with the Jigsaw tablets is that you're required to take FOUR per day to achieve a dosage of 500 mgs. I tried to follow those directions but discovered I was having daytime drowsiness! For that reason I began taking TWO tablets--half of the recommended dose--fifteen minutes before bedtime as a way to promote more restful sleep. And it works amazingly! Now I can skip taking melatonin and other herbal, OTC sleep aids!! \ud83d\udc8a\ud83d\udc8a",
