It\u2019s large enough for me (thin, medium-length hair), however, that isn\u2019t the reason why I purchased it. I needed a good quality, strong plastic cap with a cotton band that didn\u2019t unravel in a week. It\u2019s not a satin-lined cap which I didn\u2019t need either. No water comes under that band and I\u2019m 2.5 months in. The others may as well be conditioner caps. Now my friends and family want in!",

The price is outstanding considering all the wear I gave it. I definitely would purchase this again, and I did! Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed.",

It may cost more than most caps you see in drugstore, etc, but it is well worth it. My last 2 caps only lasted a couple of months because the elastic stretches out and it is worthless.

I think for the price I paid for and for the period I used it. It was worth the money. So it's good.",

I've never had this issue with other brands of shower caps.
