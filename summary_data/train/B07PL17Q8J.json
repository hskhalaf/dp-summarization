      "text": "In my opinion, these shoes are great off road and give you plenty of grip on muddy, gravely, uneven ground, forest and hill trails . They feel sturdy and responsive. They are light enough but feel a bit clunky, which can be normal for trail running shoes. The biggest problem in my eyes is the grip the New Balance Men's Nitrel Trail Running Shoes give you on wet tarmac. Due to the much smaller surface of the outsole connecting to the road, even walking can be quite tricky and slippery.",

Having run thousands of miles in NB's with good comfort, these are so far away from the normal experience that I can only presume these are fakes.",
