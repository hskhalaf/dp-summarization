Before this style became so common, I frequently got compliments on them. They really go with everything, and work with casual as well as dressier clothing. The boa pattern adds a little extra something that I love...otherwise, they look kind of cheap, like tin foil or something. The only negative about these shoes is there is zero arch support, so if you have high arches, these may not be for you. Otherwise, they're fantastic!",

      "text": "Cute shoe, but was a full size too small and narrow, even though I'd ordered a half size larger than my usual size due to previous reviews. Definitely not recommended for wide feet. Also, the cork was missing in obvious areas on the toe strap of one of the sandals. Perhaps there is a quality control issue with the cork style. Had to return them, but was grateful for Amazon's return policy.",

If soiled, the item should be wiped with a clean, damp cloth and dried naturally. To shine, buff with a neutral or matching cream polish or leather lotion using a soft, dry cloth. Avoid liquid shoe polishes or polishes containing silicone. Patent Leather To avoid color transfer, patent leather items should be kept away from other patent leather and plastic materials. If soiled, patent leather cleaner should be used to clean the item - household clean products should never be used. Suede Suede should be sprayed with a stain repellant prior to wear and stored away from items that can cause color transfer. If soiled with dry dirt or a light smudge, a suede eraser or soft bristled brush should be used. Soiled areas should be brushed in the same direction as the suede grain. Polish or wire brushes should never be used. If soiled with a wet or oily stain, item should be taken to a professional cleaner. Beaded or Printed Materials Items should not be sprayed with replellant prior to wear as this can cause discoloration. Items should be stored away from items that can cause color transfer or those that can snag on beading.\n\nSummer just got a little bit hotter and a whole lot easier. The textured thong upper consists of just a few well-placed straps over the foot and around the ankle. Add to that a flat sole and you'll be slipping into this at every oppportunity.\n\nSam Edelman shoes epitomize chic comfort.
