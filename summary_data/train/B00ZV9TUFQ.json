      "text": "I purchased these running shoes to replace my asics as I begin training for a half marathon. First of all, they fit fantastic, feel comfortable, light and breathable. I've not been for a proper run in these yet, as I prefer to break my trainers in with walks first and after a few long walks I found my feet did ache a little. Definitely not something I'd experienced with my asics. I'm no fitness expert, but personally I would recommend these trainers more for gym goers than running enthusiasts, for the price though they are a worthy addition to your collection.",
