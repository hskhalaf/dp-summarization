My first one is 3 years old and going strong! They have been left out in weather at times and dirt, paint and chemicals spilled on them.",

MY ONLY SUGGESTION FOR IMPROVEMENT IS TO INSTALL 4 NON-SLIP RUBBER CUSHIONS ON EACH END OF THE METAL FRAME SO THAT THE Garden Kneeler WILL NOT SLIP ON CONCRETE FLOORS, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT IS USED AS A SEAT.

The bucket was too low and my knees would grind and burn horribly when trying to get up. But this kneeler seat is 2.5 to 3 inches higher and helps a great deal without being too tall. Also the seat is very comfortable since it is a sturdy cushion that should last a long time with proper care.. The tool bag is quite an added bonus. Definately this is a very good investment at a low price..",

Further the bag should be wider so not to fall between legs once the weight of tools is placed in it.

The only saving grace is Amazons return policy - they are replacing it with a new one. We will see if the replacement is of better quality. Stand by for further info. P.S. If Abcosport wishes to increase quality - slot the handles tubes and lengthen the struts to extend into the handle then weld. This would prevent the sudden drop brought on by a failed weld.",

It helps me stand up more easily too as I am now 74 and while in good shape for my age find standing up without help hard on my thigh muscles in particualar. This will save my bacon as I am constantly down weeding and planting through the warmer seasons. So glad a friend introduced me to them.",

I have found it useful for weeding my flower bed and cleaning my bath tub. I am sure I will find other uses as well. For those with sensitive knees, padding of some sort may be called for for some tasks. As for seating, buyers would do well to check the height of the seat for their own body fit. Also, check the tool attachment if buying for a particular purpose. Folds up nicely, so great for carrying and storage! Nee",
