I have an old furnace in our extension and this replaced the old one easily and I can now control it from my phone which is all I was looking to do. If you have a c-wire and can install an Ecobee then definitely choose it over this but if you don't and just want to upgrade your existing thermostat this a great option.",

But its seems when we lose the Wifi connection the unit does not come back on line when the wifi is restored, i need to use the reset button. But since this at a vacation home some 200 miles away its not easy. I have asked tech support what the problem is and they said just hit the reset button. My daughter has these units installed in her home and never has had the issue. I would not recommend this unit if you plan on installing at a remote location.",

There is no way to lock the wall unit from whatbI can tell. My young kids wanted to play with it quite a bit when first installed.",
