Something went wrong with one of the locks; the combination was reset from the default, but it didn't seem to take the combination I provided. Fortunately, I only needed three, and setup of the other three went fine. If I want to use the fourth, though, I'm going to have to take the time to guess the combination -- I tried all the variants which were just a digit off each way of my intended combination, but none of those worked.",
