Immediately flushes with water at all the seams, and the back zip unzips completely at times when duck diving larger waves. I even felt compelled to call Oneill, and they told me it was more or less my fault for buying their low end suit. I am shocked this wetsuit received such a good rating on Amazon. I would recommend buying the quicksilver syncro series if you are looking for an good affordable suit even if it\u2019s a tad more expensive.",

It stinks up any room, bag, or trunk you try to put it in to mask the smell. No amount if washing ir treatment gets rid of it. It has something to so with what it was made of. Strongly recommend not buying this product. I cant believe such a brand name would keep selling it. They must have no sense of smell or they are fumling this product. Hate to think what the warehouse smells like where all if these are stored. Would give zero stars.",

The sizes run a bit tight, so you might want to get the next size up from the sizing chart that they provide. The zipper on the back comes undone pretty easily, so make sure you strap the neck tightly around it. Great mobility. The underarm region gets a bit chafed with mine after excessive use, but that is probably just my winter chub so I can't blame the suit ;) Great suit for 60-65 degree water, definitely recommended!",
