I work with butterflies and we needed some supplementation of nectar for the end of our season and the butterflies started feeding very quickly. I used the Songbird nectar mix and it was easy to make. Flowers are the ideal source of nectar for butterflies, but if there is nothing else available they will feed from this feeder. You can certainly make your own nectar mix with sugar and water, but keep in mind that insects need salt so it would be a good idea to add a little salt to your mix as well.",

I thought this would be a nice \u201cfree lunch\u201d for butterflies. They couldn\u2019t care less about it. The hummers took a little interest in the beginning, but honey bees took over in the end. Giving it 3 stars because feeding honey bees is a good thing! If you want butterflies in your yard, plant native host plants! (Milkweed, Passion flower etc.)",
