Of course it's dense plastic that may stand the test of time but for $160+ for something this small you'd think they could make it out of metal.",

It didn't hold at all and the ratchet track is very poorly made. It is just a stamped thin metal strip and if it did work I don't think to would last long. If Kreg would just make the clamp more durable I think it could be a great jig but for now I went back to the trusty K4.",

The instructions were clear and easy to follow. The materials are very high quality and the whole machine just has a good feel to it. I took a couple of scraps of 1x6, put them in the jig where they were securely held and within a few minutes had my holes in place. Selecting the proper screw was a breeze with the included chart/instructions. I can see myself looking for reasons to use pocket holes now just to use this tool. It's great! Highly recommended.",

If you go more than that, the clamp will pop loose. Staying with the 2 click setting, the clamp works great. Dust collection is very good too. Oh yeah, I accidentally moved the depth setting while using the pocket hole jig on my project and didn't notice until a couple of screws came thru the work surface. I must have done it when I was removing the vacuum hose. Be care of that.",
