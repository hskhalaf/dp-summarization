      "text": "The chute didn't have any tears, scratches or intrusions anywhere on it. I did purchase the 40 inch and it does what it needs to do. Just make sure there is a long enough distance to have the chute fly outwards to give the resistance you need especially if it isn't windy. The chute is actually durable which I found out when my puppy randomly jumped on it out of no where with his nails more on the sharp side at the time. There wasn't a mark on it after the surprise attack which made me happy.",
