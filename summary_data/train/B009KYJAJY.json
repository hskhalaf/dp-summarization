So for $44 you get a watch that works, works well, takes a beating and can be replaced for 1/10 the cost of Seiko, or 1/100 the cost of a Rolex. This thing is BOMB-PROOF! The watch is ALWAYS the first thing to get hit, scraped or broken on a job. When you retire, buy a Seiko, tell everyone who asks about the amazing deep sea diver you once were and be glad you didn't waste money on an expensive watch that looks like the Seiko until you finished diving for good.",

Second, after one year the adjustment dial on the right side just popped off (daylight savings time). Now the time is wrong and it can't be adjusted, and it has water inside the dial).

So you will need a 22 mm band if you want to buy a new one for this watch. Other than that, it's a great watch. It looks really good and has just about everything you need from a good diver.

My watch is perfect in every way, from the polishing of the stainless steel to the second hand ticking right on every mark. The bezel rotates smoothly, with no backlash whatsoever. I like the band, too, which is practical and tough. My Omega Seamaster 2254.50, on average, is about +2 seconds per day. The Casio keeps far better time for a fraction of the price.",

I'm not saying its worth hundreds or thousands of dollars, but its amazingly well made and I get many compliments and admiring glances from people while wearing it...especially after adding the gingerbread colored watch strap from the guys at Barton watch straps (also purchased via Amazon) see pics below. I have dozens of watches that I buy/sell /trade/collect...And in my opinion, if you can only own one watch and your $$ is limited, this needs to be it.",

I LIKE analog, I can read it with my aging eyes easily underwater without pressing any buttons! I've been diving for years. I LOVE this watch, DOUBLE LOVE it for the price / quality!",

But foremost, does anybody really know what time it is?",

The included strap looks good and is great for water sports, but I added a striped NATO strap, comfortable and durable and quick-drying. Swam with this all weekend and am incredibly pleased with it. Very glad I found it before buying a nearly identical one for almost $400. The date window is small, but so is the one on a renowned $10k swiss model, and I don't think a date magnifier would be an improvement to the clean looks here. The illumination is initially bright but doesn't last. Otherwise, a beautiful, rugged watch and would be a cool gift.",

Secondly, I like the fact that the crystal doesn't have the pronounced \"dome\" that the 102 has, perhaps it'll be a little easier for me to keep from scratching the crystal so much. I realize that just a little over 24 hours may be too soon to objectively judge the accuracy of this watch, but so far it's spot on. Very pleased with this purchase.",
