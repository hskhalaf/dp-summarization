I had their old model which did not have this problem; it just simply quite working after a couple of years. Now this one works in slow motion. The only redeemable thing is if I press the close button after is was suppose to close then it sometimes actually closes. The only place for this is in my garbage pick up.",

At 4 months we started to notice the lack in power in the lid, tried changing the batteries, but saw no improvement. The decrease in power has consistantly plagued us since and now it barely opens. On top of the power issues the open button on the lid has cracked and is now sharp when touched - and this is just after 7 months of use in a household of 4! Not recommended, spend the extra $50 and get a trashcan that will last you multiple years!",

This is way over-priced. If you have young children who, of course, always bump into, and bang things, do not buy this. Very dissatisfied.
