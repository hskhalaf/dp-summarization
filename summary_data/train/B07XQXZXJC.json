Why? I get no disc, no plastic, no shipping, yet it costs 2.5 times as much!? Crazy. Get this pricing in line Amazon/Microsoft! Otherwise buy a version that accepts discs and save yourself in the long run. I wouldn\u2019t buy this again.",

Parcel arrived exactly 5 days after I ordered it, as promised. Item is brand new, comes with free but limited Live Gold subscription and Game Pass.

It is also great for kids as they don't have to deal with discs getting them broken or scratched or lost. If the next xbox comes disc free I would definitely buy that one!",

It's an excellent console for me and I enjoy it every moment with it.",

Not exactly what I want showing across my TV for 20 minutes while everything updates on the gaming system I bought my 8 year old. Other than that it has been a fairly good product. Second issue, I wish the remote controls worked from the 360. Now I have to go and buy a new controller so my kids can play together, when I already have 3. Ridiculous.",

Products arrived earlier than expected in a sealed packaged box but should have came with protection surrounding the console inside. Everything was brand new in the box and works 100%. No issues except I wish xbox made this console with a bigger hard drive. 1T isnt enough for an all digital console. I recommend buying an external hard drive and purchasing the xbox game pass if your going to buy this. Oh and another controller as well if you plan on playing split screen. Other than that, I LOVE this beautiful console!",

Like having to buy batteries for the controller or rechargeable battery packs as opposed to charging the controller directly to the console.
