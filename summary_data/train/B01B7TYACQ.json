      "text": "I recently moved into a sketchy neighborhood and needed a cheap security system fast. These do work as intended and boy they are LOUD. However, my doors have thick crown molding around them and the two pieces can't line up right next to each other. So, they can't work for me, unfortunately. I'm going to hang onto them and see if someone else I know can use them. Okay, I'm also hanging onto them because I'm too lazy to make returns, but they do work. Just keep in mind that both pieces need to be perpendicular to each other so take a look at your doors before buying!",

I cleaned the surfaces, waited for them to dry, then when I applied the components I pushed on them firmly for about 15 seconds. You can\u2019t expect them to stick to a surface that is not clean, and you must make sure they have good contact. Just sticking them on there quickly might not do it. Other than that they do the job.",

I had to remove it and replace it with double-sided tape I bought at home depot. I had one fall off at night and sound off until it hit the floor, popping open and scattering the batteries out of their compartment. I put it back together and used better tape. Other than that, they work. Bad guys hate noise and lights.",

Fifteen minutes later, I completed the installation and testing of all 8 devices. Super easy! The \"battery saver pull tabs\" and peel-and-stick strips were big time savers. A few days later, I received a follow-up from Doberman Customer Support to see if I had any questions or issues. I recommend Doberman Security for their customer care and product value.",
