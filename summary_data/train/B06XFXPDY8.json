The front head lamp has a more focused beam which is excellent for close up and far away night use. Overall I highly recommended this product.

The flashlight does so many things you usually can't remember them all at once when your telling people about what all it does. The light is like a spot light at night. I will always buy these lights for the rest of my life!",

When we opened up the flashlights we were surprised how well built they were and how bright the light was. 3 out of the four worked great, but one needed to be charged before the light worked. After charging it worked perfectly. Great item to have for the car.",

So I can't charge it unless I hold the piece which is loose wires to the charger to it which to me is unSafe Too bad it was after my warranty because I would have taken it back.",
