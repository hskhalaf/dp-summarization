The sub-trunk isn't perfectly flat in the Model S, so this will be a bit uneven longways, and this also causes the dividers to be just ever so little slightly too tall and hit the sub-trunk cover. Easy solution is to slightly angle the dividers to the side so that they are not as tall, and vollia! Super useful!",

Besides the sturdiness of the piece (looks like new after 3 years of usage), I love that I can move the dividers inside to hold various sizes of bags, toys, shoes, jackets, etc. I also love the handles, which give me the opportunity to take out my whole shopping load in one go.",

Due to it's low siding and the fact that the quality of the overall product is decent I decided to buy it. It was expected except the gas smell that emits from it is really bad, like air out for a week bad before putting into your vehicle. Overall it's a decent organizer (hoping the trim doesn't come unglued again.)",

Otherwise it'll do the job! This stays in place with a rubber lip around the edge of the base. I liked this over alternatives because I didn't want velcro on my brand new interior.

      "text": "What I like most about the Rola 59001 trunk organizer is that it is substantial, well built, and that it fits nicely in the Bolt EV luggage space. What I like least is the smell, not something I want to be breathing. Hopefully the smell will go away so that I can leave it in the car. I've left it sitting out in the garage for six days and the smell remains. Without the smell I'd give it five stars. We'll see... Update. Finally after a month or so the smell disappeared.",

The dividers are easily movable and add to the units rigidity when upright. The side handles make it easy to life the entire thing out of your vehicle if the need arises. Folding it back to flat is also easy. The very best part is that it fits on the floor of my F-150 Crew Cab pickup with the seat down.",

They can be placed wherever you like to make larger, smaller or even no compartments to customize whatever you are carrying.
