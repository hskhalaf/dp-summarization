I had to call today because the motor broke off. I must say support is very helpful. It could use a better mounting bracket as it's plastic. All in all it's a get what you pay for and how you treat it. No other trouble with it at all so I'm a happy customer and feel 4 stars is a fair review.",

The wheels are nice a wide but they do ride a little bumpy. I wish there were softer wheels on it. I push with my right and my left foot is in front. When riding like this, you have to have the board the opposite way if the logo which is odd because I\u2019m in the majority so idk why they printed the label the wrong way around. Other than that, I\u2019ve had it for a week now and I\u2019m happy I bought it.",
