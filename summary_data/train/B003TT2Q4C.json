We had had a Kitchenaid toaster previously that we really liked so decided to replace it with another Kitchenaid. What a disappointment. If it wasn't such a big deal to return it, I would send it back crumbs and all. Now I have to find a new toaster that actually does what a toaster is supposed to do. Don't waste your money on this one.",

      "text": "I like this Toaster. Nice enough to leave out on the counter. Settings are easy to figure out. Toast browns evenly . Good to have four slots to get the job done fast for breakfast. Slots are wide enough for bagels and it has a bagel setting. The only shortcoming is that the toast doesn't pop up really high when done, so the handle needs to be held up to get more access to the toast. Also the toaster makes a sound when it is done, so if you don't want your appliances talking to you, then don't get this one. I have had this for 6 months with no problems noted.",

Would be better if the toaster had a \"sleep mode\" that would activate once you touched it, saving power, but one that provides a menu to choose from before you start the toasting cycle. Also, toaster lock down mechanism is a little difficult, since it doesn't engage easily, and you have to force it down a little more aggressively to get the device to lock. Once locked down, THEN you can choose the level of toasting.... kind of a cart in front of the horse analogy",

      "text": "I had been searching all over for a 4 slice toaster to replace our old, cheaper one that finally gave out after ten years. I read all the reviews and searched many stores online. I finally settled on this one. I have to say the toasting is perfect no matter which setting you put it on. It also tastes great because whatever you are toasting is perfectly done. The only problem - albeit a minor one, is that the toast or bagel doesn't come all the way up when it's done. But to me, that is a minor thing. I just pick it up with my fingers and it is fine. Great toasting and price was ok.",

      "text": "This has got to be the best set of toaster I've ever purchased. It over toasts my bread when you just put in 1 toast instead of 2. It also over toasts if you put a second set of bread slices immediately after toasted one set on the same heat number since the toaster is already pre-warmed. The LCD is cool, but I thought it would show me a real-time countdown of how many more seconds left before the toaster would be done. But instead it just shows the heat level of the toast. The color of this toaster is just so great. Makes it very easy to clean.",
