I can confirm Comcast WILL swear up and down this modem won't work with their service, and try to give you one of their bulky $300 modem/router junkboxes, both the techs and the support reps. This is false, just go to Comcast's online chat and tell the reps you have a Cisco DPC 3008 and not a 3010 (they are both DocSIS 3 and basically the same modem), they provision it, and that worked fine for me. Don't let your ISPs talk you into buying their hardware that you don't need.",

I purchased this item used, with all of it's cables. After calling up Charter and getting their modem cancelled and ours connected (which took about 30 minutes because of issues they had with our account), we got the modem up and running. After that, our internet has been amazing. We can have 5 devices linked up and running at the same time without slowing down the service unlike before. Very glad that I upgraded and got our own modem instead of leasing from Charter. Very pleased with the results.",

I assume my upload speeds increased as well, but I do so little uploading that I have not noticed a difference.

      "text": "I bought this to replace the piece of crap Netgear that Cox gave me in Scottsdale, AZ -- I have the Ultimate service that just recently (yesterday) got upgraded from 65mbps to 150mbps -- speedtest.net shows 100mbps -- I don't know if I am capped due to the modem or if the cable company is under-delivering. Overall I'm super happy with the extra speed, so probably won't dig too deep on that, as far as I can tell this is DOCSIS 3.0 compliant and I have been really happy with it. Never dropped the connection and always fast (we stream everything in HD).",

The representative on the phone did not ask the brand or model number of the modem; she only asked for the MAC address number. So even though this is not on Time-Warner Cable's approved modem list, it will work. (At least it will work with TWC in South Carolina.) And since you can pick it up used a lot cheaper than the Motorolas I think this is the way to go. (I would not be surprised to see this on Time-Warner's approved modem list before long.)",
