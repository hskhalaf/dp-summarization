Flimsy construction and loose door locks make this a hassle for cat owners and could put cats in a dangerous situation if they escape at the wrong time. At 18-inches long, it\u2019s smaller than most carriers.",
      "pros": [
        "Large side locking clips, which are essential in front-loading pet carriers should a cat prove reluctant to exit, or to disassemble quickly for storage",
        "The metal door is removable and can swing open from the left or right side with a simple selection",
        "Assembly is rock-simple"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Flimsy construction means the carrier flexes widely",
        "The door latches can loosen up, allowing the door to swing open, particularly with a determined escape artist, some users report",
        "Larger cats may find it a tight fit",
        "And returns can cost more than the carrier\u2019s purchase price"

I put down just the bottom of this case and cut some bedding from an old blanket and put inside. He immediately took to it and it is his primary sleep spot now. Days after, I attached the top of the case. He didn't seem to mind it at all and now he sleeps and chills in the complete unit. So I haven't used it on the road yet, but he has quickly claimed it as one of his favorite places.",

It is a bit lighter weight than some others, but that was fine for my purposes.",
