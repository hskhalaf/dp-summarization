It definitely hydrates, in fact it feels like there's still lotion on my skin after I repeatedly rinse. That's okay, hydrated skin looks younger, but after using the product for two days my skin started to break out. That's not okay, I've continued to use it hoping my skin would calm down (and also to get use of the money I spent) but I will not be buying again.",
