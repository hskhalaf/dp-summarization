The cart was purchased in early 2012 so as of this review it's almost four years old. The only thing I don't like is the way narrow handle doesn't fit my grip but I solved that by spiraling a thick foam twist-tie over the existing foam padding.",

The one I received is different from the photo, and has a weird telescoping tubular component that runs vertically up the center between the legs of the handle and attaches to the heel of the flip down foot. I still cant figure out what purpose it serves, and it bent pretty quickly, making it difficult to telescope in either direction. I'm not going to bother to explain it more than that because it's clearly a stupid design, and it doesn't match the photo you see here anyway. My recommendation: Get the aluminum version.",

This is a durable, compact, and light weight cart that can easily hold 100+ pounds. The wheels are rubber and not filled with air, which is great! Nothing to get flat and the rubber holds up better under the weight. Takes small curbs and edges easily and rolls smoothly.",

A huge improvement over some other designs. Push the button and the handle comes up versus my old one that you had to fold the handle over. Fold the platform down and the wheels pop out automatically. My old one requires you to pop the wheels out first then fold the platform down. It's not heavy duty but for a few boxes and moving stuff around the house or delivering to a building where two trips would be a pain, you can't go wrong at this price.",
