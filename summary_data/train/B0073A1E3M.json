While I absolutely love the image quality, speed and capabilities of my Canon Dx and FF cameras, the biggest issue was the weight and bulk of the camera equipment. Constantly carrying a heavy DSLR with a professional lens is not only impractical, but it is also painful. The day I started using the E-M5, I just fell in love with it. Everything just felt right about it \u2013 excellent image quality, incredibly fast auto focus, wide lens selection, superior ergonomics with a boatload of customization options and it's very handy.",

As has been said before the buttons are smaller and harder to reach and there are less available on the body than the EM1. I moved to micro 2 3rds because I am disabled and need the lighter gear. Was worried about IQ (coming from a Canon 6D) but you seem to get 2 stops more than I did back in the days of fast 35mm film, so I am happy. If it's too easy, it takes away the fun!",

The only reason I would not give 5 stars for this beautiful little object is that the back buttons are plastic and feel a little fragile. An internet search shows that in some cases some of the buttons become detached if treated roughly, including the top control wheel. Knowing this I still went ahead and got the OMD + Lens as the pro's are huge compared to the con's.",
