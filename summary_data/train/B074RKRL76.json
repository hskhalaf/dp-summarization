It literally does all the planning for you - it makes it so easy to be on top of your life to make lifestyle changes. 3) It looks really nice - From the faux leather cover, two bookmarks, an elastic closer, and a pen holder. I love it and would definitely recommend! ~Order this journal - its a life changer~",

It helped me keep track of my daily activity (my doctor also wanted me walking every day) and everything I ate for meals and snacks. My weight gain slowed down and I was able to make some really mindful healthy choices that lead to a healthy pregnancy. This planner really drove home the point: What you do today matters.

Unlike others, this one has room to write what you ate, or how much you work out and also to mention the equally important issues in your life, like what was good today and what do you need to work on. For me, a diary like this is part of the process of awareness of proper nutrition and I highly recommend it.",

I do not eat enough fruits and vegetables and this helps me keep track of how much I eat and when I need to eat more.",
