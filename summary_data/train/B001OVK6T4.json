I almost didn\u2019t buy it because it too expensive but I was frustrated with all my buys so I finally bought this and I must say it\u2019s the best thing that I\u2019ve ever bought. The price is way more expensive than other rice cookers but you get value for money. Now am waiting to see how long this baby will last before it starts giving me problems. Hopefully not !!!!",
