The pieces do not fit together properly, you have to force them together in some areas and they still do not hold and they bend and gape. The post that holds the heart on the stand broke immediately after we placed the heart on top. I fully understand that you get what you pay for, but these are junk, not even remotely worth the cost. Will be returning.",

The torso with organs, I guess in China their organs are not put together like Americans, the picture is correct but the liver, in order to fit has to be more to the left if you want the rib cage to fit. I'm a NP and thought it would be good fo my grand daughter. Putting them together was more frustrating.",
