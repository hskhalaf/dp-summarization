I do not recommend, I will not ever buy from this company . ..And neither should you. Unless of course you want a poor quality mattress, with a side of crappy customer service.

Initially i was happy with it, but it has not even been 2 complete months and the mattress sinks in the middle. It is not comfortable to sleep on as you can always feel it slanting.

It\u2019s too much for one person to carry. I covered it with a thick 3 inch extra firm latex topper and it\u2019s perfect. I needed a basic mattress that would be a good foundational support and this worked perfectly. It makes a great stand alone mattress as well which is surprising. The edges could use more support, but overall, for the low price under $270, I was quite surprised at the ease of set up and good quality.",

Also, no smell, mattress doesn't make me too warm as you really sleep on this mattress and not in it like a Casper or similar product. This is my first memory foam-coil mattress and I'll never change. One less thing to worry about in life. If you're thinking this is too cheap and too good to be true, get in line.

Per given instruction, we did leave the mattress for 2 days for proper expansion. We both are under 180 pounds so if the mattress was reasonably firm, we should have been okay however this one just didn't work out in terms of back support and firmness for us.",

We let the mattress sit for three days before sleeping on it so it could expand fully. I do believe that helped get us off on the right foot. Also, it has a slight odor that has faded over time. I\u2019m very sensitive to chemical smells and I could handle this just fine.",
