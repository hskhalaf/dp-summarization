      "text": "The main selling point of this toothbrush, besides that it's electric, is its ability to track your brushing. Unfortunately, my device was completely unable to track any amount of brushing in the back bottom left, and usually also ran into trouble in the back lower right, back top right, and back upper left. This is despite attempting every angle physically possible. That basically leaves only the fronts, back top middle, and back bottom middle working correctly. I want to know where *I* accidentally missed my brushing, not where the toothbrush accidentally missed my brushing. I hate returning items, especially toothbrushes (who does that?), but this product isn't worth anywhere close to its relatively high price.",

I do like the sensor that throttles it back if you brush too aggressively.
