And it's spacious: I can carry my laptop, a water bottle, a lunch, and a client folder. It's like magic. Seriously, I can't stress how happy I am with this bag. The one thing I wish is that it came in the grey or cream colors it used to come in.",

I walk/bus to work and carry all my things with me in a backpack, so I needed one with room and that would withstand/was sturdy. Within three weeks, however, BOTH zippers broke and were unfixable. They broke within minutes of each other! I am so frustrated-- the whole reason I needed a new backpack was because my old one's zipper broke... after FOUR YEARS OF USE. NOT THREE WEEKS!! This is ridiculous-- Herschel is supposed to be a reputable company making nice, sturdy products... yet your zippers suck. Returning promptly.",

The front pocket has just enough space for small things like your phone, calculator, etc. My only complaint is that on the front pocket it doesn't have a pocket to hold like pens or small things that you would normally get with like a Jansport backpack. Oh and it's also nice that there's a laptop pocket on the inside so you know that your laptop won't get scratched when in it.",

The zippers aren't the smoothest, but I prefer it. I live in a big city and I feel that the zipping would make it easy to detect a pickpocket, or if something was falling out. Overall I definitely recommend investing in this backpack if you'll be using it long term and/or for heavy duty purposes.",

A lifetime limited warranty. After emailing with Herschel about the broken zipper, they requested proof of purchase and some pictures, and gave me a code good for the original amount to their website. With the redemption code, I ordered a new backpack and it arrived in just a few days! Problem solved.",

Overall for the price, the quality is not that great. Very disappointed.",

My thought for paying more (than a typical elementary backpack) was that the quality was better and he would get years of use out of it. Well after a year, the zipper is broken. I contacted customer service. They responded and asked me to provide them with proof of purchase along with pictures. They have not responded back after weeks and multiple attempts on my part to get a response. Upon googling it appears that the zipper quality is a MAJOR problem. Buyer beware. Update... I will say they finally contacted me and resolved the problem.",
