Held up all night. Sad part was we had to pop threm at the end of the night to clean up the venue and beware the confetti will make a HUGE mess!",

Be advised that if you buy a helium tank to blow the balloons up on your own you will only get about 12 balloons out of the tank because the latex with the confetti are heavier and takes a bit more helium to get them to float. Overall, they were a great product and I was very pleased with them.",
