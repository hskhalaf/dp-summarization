My only concern is that the adhesive is so strong (as it needs to be to stay on all night), when I remove the strip in the morning, it takes off a layer of skin from my nose. After 1 week of use, I had exposed skin and a sore on the top of my nose. To resolve the issue, but still be able to wear the strips, I simply apply a small amount of vaseline to the softest skin on my nose, and the strips have been working perfectly!",

I've used these for years almost every night, and I recommend the original. The chamomile is kind of fun for the smell, but don't buy it if it's too much extra money.",

      "text": "It had been a few years since I tried strips. I don't remember Extra or Advanced being available back then. So figuring newer is better I tried Advanced first, always on squeaky clean skin. They stuck for about an hour and a half. OK, so I downgraded to Extra and only got about a 3 hour stick. Finally I went to these originals and they're still sticking strong after 7 hours. It seems the newer models' aero wings don't contact my skin enough. The adhesive may be different too.",
