Yes I did follow the instructions and deflate them on the second day to 50% and reinflated. Still dragged. The description says it comes with a 35cm ball. The photos show the ball bulging across the bar at the front and touching the back brace. I measured the distance straight across from the bar to the back and it was 40cm. The pictures are incredibly misleading. I'm keeping the base but now have to purchase 45cm balls so they will actually fit snugly and not sag through the hole.",

I had seen this on some programs that they were being used in schools, would work perfect if insisted in the proper use.",

Sadly, the silliness of how short she is next to the tables at which she\u2019s working negates the point in many ways. It is also difficult to inflate, even though we have everything we need to do so; the moment you remove the air hose, air is coming out. It also deflated quickly with use.",

      "text": "I love the idea of this product. This chair would be ideal for my 5 year old. However, while setting it up, the ball included is drastically smaller than the space it is supposed to fit into. The whole that is supposed to \u201chold\u201d the ball isn\u2019t at all in contact with the ball. The chair cannot roll because the ball is sitting on the ground. According to the description, the ball should be just above the ground. Over all, I love the concept but this is poor execution. I will be keeping the item in hopes to find an appropriate junior sized ball to make this product work.",

I'm going to use these in my preschool classroom instead and buy adult size chair for my kids at home. They have a desk the height of a 3-drawer file cabinet and these chairs were WAY too short.",
