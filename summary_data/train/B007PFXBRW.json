I keep my phone in my back pocket most of the time, or in a clutch if i don't have pockets and those cases are just too much. This one is perfect! It was tested by a 1 year old recently and passed with flying colors. She picked it up and started shaking it around so of course it slipped. It did just like it always does and landed screen down but the case did a great job of taking the impact. You couldn't even tell anything happened. I would recommend it to everyone. Can't wait to get all the colors.",

Its tight corners pushed up the edges of my Zagg screen cover on two sides causing big bubbles, plus the top power button and the side volume buttons are covered by the case and difficult to click, which seems like a strange design choice. Too bad because I do like the look and feel of the case. I am going to go back to a two-part case that doesn't smoosh my screen protector and that has cut-outs for my key buttons.",
