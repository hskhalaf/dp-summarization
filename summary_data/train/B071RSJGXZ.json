Certainly didn't want to lug around my 5DMKIV all around the Caribbean. Shooting underwater was fantastic. The controls were easy to manipulate underwater. Most of the photos were really good and the video was nice as well. Anyone who thinks that the image quality of any point and shoot is as good as a DSLR like the MKIV or MKIII is delusional, but then again I can't submerge a DSLR underwater like the TG-5. For vacation snap shots it fits the bill nicely.",

Update - I called tech support and they recommended a new battery, which solved the problem.

By eliminating the stress of the elements this camera is fun and carefree. Keep your phone in a lifeproof case and use the TG-5 to capture the moments and share them.

I learned this the hard way, and irreparably bricked my camera halfway thru a trip. (2) The battery can be inserted backwards just as easily as it can be inserted correctly, which makes the camera appear bricked when it isn't. A truly stupid design.
