It was intended to have a cell chip and be on a cell plan but the cell company bought more than they could sell. It works fine without a SIM chip on WiFi and the features and specs are better than unsubsidized tablets. It's sold as refurbished but my appeared new.",

I used it for about a week before deciding to return and bought an ipad air. I dont understand why the liquid smoothness of the IPad UI is unattainable on such a powerful tablet. If you are an android afficionado, this is just the tablet for you. I can imagine the performance once you root it and rip out the custom UI. Also, the additional SD card slot can go upto 128gb (you are stuck with whatever size Ipad you buy).",

It would be nice if Samsung enabled adoptable storage so that you could use it system wide but they have yet to do so. It runs plenty fast, playing any 1080p video I have thrown at it.

The seller denies all responsibility citing a 6 month cut-off for returns. I looked into the seller a little further and they operate a series of pawn shops (NY?). The tablet was advertised as new. When I started it initially there was no start-up information required and frankly, I now think it was actually used (pawned). Beware.",

If you are running kitkat, you need to download the amazon App Store, the amazon shopping app, then amazon instant video. If you use the amazon for tablet app the instant video will not work, you need the amazon for phone app for it to work properly. Wake up amazon and design a proper app like you did for kindle and ipad.",
