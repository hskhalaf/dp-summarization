After I booted it up, I was blown away by how vibrant and crisp the image looked. After using this, I don't think I'll watch on anything smaller than 100\". I also have a 50\" 4k TV (without HDR), and I would still rather watch a movie using the 1080p projector. I took some pictures that will give you a good idea of what it looks like. Note that the pictures do not show the true scale of the projection. In person it looks huge!",

I'm really impressed with the image quality, but only use it in the dark, so I can't comment on the performance in normally or even dim lit rooms. Also only using it for movies, even though I'm a casual gamer. The fan is a bit noisier than I'd like, but when watching a movie I don't notice it except during quiet parts. It's also currently just sitting on a table behind the viewer temporarily till it's ceiling mounted. So I don't expect it to be a an issue at that point.",

      "text": "Colors are rich even on eco setting and there is no \"Rainbow effect (RBC)\". It's great but definitely needs some improvement with picture processing. On fast scenes, obvious pixelation shows up akin to lower resolution pixelation like how Minecraft looks like. It's not that the entire image pixelates but just some details/highlights in the whole picture shows obvious pixelation. I suspect the hardware or software does this to keep up with the fast scenes. Still this would be a great purchase given the $79 replacement lamps. Compared to a BENQ 1075, the pixels of the Epson 2040 are bigger and so the screen door effect is obvious when one is up close to the screen (1-2 feet).",

Was worried about getting a 3LCD over a DLP, but the brightness and clarity of the projection are pretty decent, even with a semi-lit room. Utilizes CEC as well, which was a bonus. Would definitely recommend as a mid-range projector. Only thing I would suggest is turning off the frame interpolation, at least when playing games. It creates a lot of ghosting effects. And, I wouldn't use the speakers on this thing; get dedicated speakers for better audio range.",

The built in speaker has no bass to it but it is not bad all things considering (speakers or a sound bar does improve the experience). One note: the project automatically comes with the frame smoothing feature already set. This gives the image that dreaded \"soap opera\" effect but can be deactivated easily (I recommend doing this).",

As advertised you can get 134\"@ 12' From what I'm seeing, the given projector dimensions, are slightly off . In my living room it currently projects at 9'1\" wide from 12'10, elevated @3'10\".",

The first time he cranked it up w/ some weather channel footage, I was amazed by the picture. I can only image how awesome it would look w/ a real screen. His room tends to get stuffy and it seems to do ok (ie, no overheating). I'd say the fan also generates average noise.. very happy",
