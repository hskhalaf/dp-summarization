The shoulder strap is very adjustable, I am 5'10\" and got the perfect length for \"cross body slouchy\"! A lot of different storage areas, I like the fact that there is an outside zipped area against your body that you can quickly reach items like phone or other small items. Inside is large, but divided into 2 areas with zippers. The fold over closure is a leather strap over button, a little awkward, but very secure.",

It has lots of zipper-ed pockets on the inside and one on the outside for easy access. The straps are very comfortable and easy to adjust. You have to tie them in place but I much prefer that to other methods as there is no buckle/clasp to break or wear out.",

Only annoyance is there's an interior pouch with a zipper on it that fits pretty loosely, and as such it tends to hang open over the main compartment of the purse, and I accidentally shove my wallet in there instead if I'm not looking, which prevents it from closing: suffice it to say, me and the purse fight sometimes at the checkout line! But it's infrequent enough, and the purse is great otherwise, so I'm cool with it. It's a nice bag for $15!",

The purse is a little heavy on its own and after you put stuff into it, it's gonna be way more heavier so as long as these straps hold up, I will keep my 5 star review. I really like this purse so I hope the straps hold up and don't rip. Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",
