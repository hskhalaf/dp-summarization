Worst thing is that Bushnell ignored me when I sent the product back--I have USPS proof of delivery but they still have the product and my money-- I lost more than $240 purchasing this Bushnell product through Amazon.",

When you take that batteries out to store it or replace them when they are used up, the scope doesn't always go back to the 'tuned in' setting you had so much trouble to get to in the beginning. Not sure what causes that. Sometimes it's not far out. Other times it's hard to find the 'sweet spot' again.",

The video out function is now working as it should. The Bushnell Z is now living up to it's full potential. A great night vision scope that operates day or night in full color or IR with the capability for internal video recording or capture......Awsome. I base this review on my many years in the surveillance field as a police detective and private investigator.",
