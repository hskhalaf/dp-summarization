I wanted a bathing sure that was a bit camouflaged in the belly area because I have IBD and sometimes get this 3-5month prego bloated look. I also wanted to a cute, but sleek, one piece for swimming at the gym. I ordered a sun hat and a cute sheer black sarong to use on the beach! For the money, this is so cute without looking matronly.",

I ordered a 1X knowing that most bathing suits are a bit on the tight side and this fits perfectly! It's comfortable and not too revealing, but also not too conservative either!

It does not cover the entire back side. It's not as bad as some but just so you know, It does not come all the way around the buttock like full coverage panties. more along the lines of French cut. It is a great suit overall.",
