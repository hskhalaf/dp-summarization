There are many other options out there for double the cost, but I can\u2019t imagine how they could be double the value. You won\u2019t regret this purchase. Sets up in less than a minute, folding it up once you get the hang of it will take maybe a minute. This company makes simple to use, high quality intuitive products.",

Putting it back in the small bag that comes with it is not as easy as opening it up. I suggest that you follow the instructions, take your time and be careful when you fold it back into it's storage pouch. It will go in there, just don't try to force it.",
