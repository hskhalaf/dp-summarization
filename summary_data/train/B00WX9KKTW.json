      "text": "These pans cannot be beat for the price! Professional chefs use ratios rather than recipes as ratios are easy to memorize. The ratio for Popovers is 2:1:1 liquid to eggs to flour (by weight, not volume). Add salt nd whatever you want (herbs, Parmesan, etc.) to the ratio. Start with smoking hot cups (400-degrees) and fill about 2/3rds full. Allow the batter to rest 30-minutes (or overnight) to hydrate the flour thoroughly. Reduce heat to 350-degrees after about 15-minutes, cut a slip on top of each to dry out the interior. That's it!",

The popovers slide out seamlessly, carrying a lovely finishing sheen on the \"crust.\" Dare I admit it, I don't even wash the pans when I'm done! They are that good. I have been cooking popovers for 38 years, using this recipe: 2 cups milk 2 cups floor 4 eggs 1 tsp. salt Beat just till mixed and lumps gone. Fill pans 2/3-3/4 full. cook at 450 till popped; then turn down to 375 till brown. NEVER open the oven door while baking. Thin out if at all needed so the consistency of the batter is like coffee cream.",

By some miracle, after a minute of cooling, the popovers left the pan as soon as I tipped it onto the cooling rack. Easy clean up. Thank you for a fantastic product, Bellamain!",

Ive made plenty of popovers and I hate to say it but Ive had better luck with large muffin pans. Guess I'll try another recipe and see if I have better luck.",

Both times I cleaned the pan in the dishwasher, but it would've been trivial to do it by hand. I'm very satisfied.",

    "description": "If you've been disappointed with the flat, heavy popovers and Yorkshire puddings you get using regular muffin pans, it's not your fault; it's your pan's. Discover the difference the Bellemain Popover Pan can give you in achieving dramatically better results with minimum effort. \n\n2.25\"D Cups Promote Rising\nThe best popovers are those that rise high, staying light and tender inside. You simply can't get that effect with a muffin pan whose cups are only an inch or so deep. The Bellemain's cups are twice as deep, which allows popovers to climb up to impressive heights. \n\nNonstick Finish for Easy Food Release\nWith no sticking to the bottom or sides, popovers slide out in one easy piece. (Of course, you will still want to use the melted butter your recipe calls for to give your popovers their delicious taste and crispy surface.) Cleanup is a breeze as well; in fact, you can put the pan straight into the dishwasher. \n\nDurable, Welded Metal\nCount on the Bellemain's rugged construction for years of trouble-free use. The dark colored metal also absorbs heat faster, which is ideal for the high temperature, short baking time that produces perfect popovers.",
