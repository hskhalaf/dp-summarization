When it did try, I found that it is too narrow to walk the bike up, it has to be ridden. I'm in my 70's and don't do that anymore. When I tried to return it, I was told \"to bad\" it is outside the 30 day return window. Now I'm stuck with it. I was going to replace it with a tri-fold one from the same company. Not now.",

It's not quite wide enough to safely load and unload the cycle while on the cycle so I use a 2x10 along with the ramp so I have a place for my feet. If I buy another one o would get it from Titan ( very nice people ) but make it a little wider",
