The light buzzard and sound effect are pretty shabby (could be so much better). Great game to play once or twice, but there it is sitting in my game closet untouched. No further requests have been made to play it. It's either too difficult for the little ones, who become frustrated when their out after their first try or it becomes boring when the challenge is not taken seriously by the older players who give up.",

    "description": "Style:GameIn the Operation game, kids get to be the doctor and make Cavity Sam better or get the buzzer! Perform successful action noted on the cards by picking funny ailment pieces out of the game tray with a pair of tweezers. But watch out! If the tweezers touch the sides of the openings, the buzzer goes off and Cavity Sam's nose lights up! Then players look for their Specialist card that fits that action to earn an even higher fee. The player with the most money after all of the Funatomy parts have been removed wins the game! Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSurely countless medical careers have been launched because of this humorous game. The Operation game board features Sam the patient, lying atop a red plastic \"operating table\" with 12 body cavities exposed. Players perform highly skilled procedures with a pair of tweezers such as removing a broken heart or butterflies in the stomach. This kind of surgery requires a steady hand! Doctors must remove the offending body part without touching the metal lining of the cavity. Touch the metal edge, and you'll set off the buzzer and make Sam's nose light up. Then the designated Specialist steps in--for double the fee! If you're playing solo, try performing all 12 operations without getting zapped. Two AA batteries are required. Operation is for one or more players. --Elizabeth Ward\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nDoctor, the patient is here to see you!
