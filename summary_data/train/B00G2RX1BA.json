Air threader is the best feature, however, not mentioned much in product description is how easy it is to thread the right/left needles - at the point of threading the needle eye, there is this 'clip' you push the thread into and lift the lever and the needle is threading. No squinting, magnifier glass,no frustration. Only thing is that CD/DVD that came with machine didn't auto run in my computer, but there is same thing on YouTube so was no issue. This is a MUST for any serious sewer.",

I bought the OTHER serger with air assist and no needle threader many years ago for $1800.00 floor model. And this costs me at least $500.00 less. Todays price on the OTHER serger is $2100.00 so the savings is considerable. I was told that Juki made the OTHER serger machines for them. Their engineers designed it but Juki manufactured them since the OTHER didn't have a factory.",

    "description": "The Juki MO-1000 Serger threads like a breeze with the all new air supported threading technology! It even threads the needle with an automatic needle threader! Key Features- ADJUSTABLE DIFFERENTIAL FEED: Even with easily stretched fabrics such as knits and georgette, create beautifully sewn finishes by adjusting the differential feed. Adjustments can even be made while sewing. BEAUTIFUL SHARP CURVE: The distance between the needle and knife is 9.95mm (conventional model: 15.5mm), allowing you to sew beautiful inside curves. UPPER LOOPER CONVERTER 2-/3- THREAD CONVERSION: Switch to 2-Thread sewing simply by pushing the 2-/3- thread changeover attachment to the left, making this operation even easier. WIDE THROAT AREA: The height of the throat is 72.4mm. Due to this height, the usability of the work space improved infinitely. QUIET OPERATION: The sound reducing design minimizes the operating noise and the unit sews with less vibration. LED SEWING LIGHT: The needle area is brightly illuminated. The long-life, energy-efficient and eco-friendly light will not heat up, even after a long period of use. WASTE COLLECTOR: Provided as a standard accessory, the waste collector catches cut-off fabric and is useful for keeping the area tidy. CONVENIENT THREADING WITH THE EASY THREADER: Using the new easy threader feature, easily thread the machine from the threading hole tot he looper with the power of a strong whoosh of air sent from the electric motor. This amazing function dramatically alters upper and lower looper threading. AUTOMATIC NEEDLE THREADER: Quickly thread the needle! With the automatic needle threader, the needle is threaded in 3 easy steps.",
