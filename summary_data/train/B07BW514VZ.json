But there was also a sticker glued to the side of the bottle that said \"90 tablets\" and \"new.\" When I opened the bottle, I found inside 30 tablets. Thinking there had been an error, I checked my prior order, which was still unopened. I had ordered and paid for 90 tablets. I had received a bottle with the same labels. It's still unopened. Anybody want to bet on how many tablets are inside?",

The Active Adult is a single tablet per day, and has a nice blend of vitamins, minerals, and supplemental ingredients. With one tablet, it's easy to add something else if needed. As a lovely bonus, I can smell the Rosemary extract in these, an aroma I find pleasing. Highly recommended- and I really appreciate that they changed the name from Senior something to \"active adult.\" I'll tell you when I'm a senior, darn it! Until then I'm just an active adult with a lot of experience and really good vitamins!",
