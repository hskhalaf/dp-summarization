      "title": "Very smooth running and quite",
      "text": "Its literally a life saver. This lockdown was driving me insane with the kids in the house and home workouts. I bought this fan as I wanted some good night sleep, the last thing I wanted was a disruption to my sleep. I automate the fan to turn on at certain intervals throughout the night and always put on swing of course. Throughout the day my kids use the fan when they are having their siesta. Very simple and straightforward to use but at the same time sophisticated enough to control with schedule and all the automation. The noise is absolutely minimal, so amazing you forget you have it on. Would definitely recommend it.",

      "text": "Nothing to dislike. I wanted a big fan. It's a big fan. It connected to Smart life easily, I always use AP mode. I have to say that the setup was much easier than my Teckin switches and light bulbs. It would probably set up equally well with their own App, but I like to have all my kit operating from Smartlife if possible. I like the smart feature, it adds a little life to its operation. Last but not least.. It's a British start up design. Might be made in China but isn't everything.",

      "text": "This fan is at the pricey end of the market largely due to the interactive technology it employs. It is very easy to put together (even without reading the instructions!) and operation is straightforward. They have clearly invested some time and money into the app so operate the fan from your phone etc. It downloads cleanly and is very intuitive in use. Much is made of how quiet this fan is, and although it's certainly a lot quieter than our old phone it's not as quiet as I'd hoped, plus the blue lights are non dimmable for night use, which would be a great improvement.",
