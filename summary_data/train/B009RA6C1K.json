      "text": "These rings are a nice bright yellow. They're fairly heavy, which is good, and have a lightly textured surface. The straps are easy to hang and seem to have little or no stretch. I'd say the quality of the rings is a little better than some other plastic rings I've seen, in that the molding line is less visible and can't be felt. If you're not going for wood rings, these are an excellent choice.",

Weather has not done anything to the rings or straps. Inside pair are just as nice, and have an extra 6 months on them. Owned them for over a year, and love how quickly I can get a workout in! Only complaint is that during certain exercises the rough straps rub against my arms and cause bad irritation.",

The straps are very long so there is a lot of leeway to mount them, and you can adjust them to any height for progression. I am new to ring work, so I can't speak to how they hold up with lots of sweat; I can barely hold my self up on them. This is going to be fun!",

(I change the set up/rings height at least 4 times a week and still no wear) Overall a great purchase and a good way to work out.
