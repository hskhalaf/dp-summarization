The reason I'm submitting a review is to give this HELPFUL TIP: In order to create a passable boarder from the perimeter to the transmitter, you need to wrap the wires around each other 10-12 times per foot, which for us was about 50 feet. What we did was put the two wires in a drill (where the bit goes) and turned it on. It took less than a minute. They should put this suggestion in the manual.",
