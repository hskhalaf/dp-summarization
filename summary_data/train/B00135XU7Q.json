      "text": "Installation was very easy. It took about 15 minutes from start to finish which included the \"detection\" time. I collect vintage telephones and wanted something I could use with older model rotary dial sets. Depending upon the model of the dial set, the ring volume varies but is audible. Dialing out works perfectly. When answering a call, though, it is necessary to wait for a \"click\" to be heard before you begin conversation. It takes about a second. If using a touch-tone set, be sure that the polarity has not been reversed. Otherwise, the tones may not generate correctly, if at all. Very pleased with this new \"toy\".",

A bluetooth speakerphone would do the same thing, but my father would NEVER be able to figure out the technology. This product uses technology to dumb-down the connections for technophobes to feel right at home. Great product for the elderly. A+",

The range for the Bluetooth is acceptable for my purposes. It was a no-brainer to set up on my smart phone. I had it working within minutes of taking it out of the box.

When the cell phone is taken out of range, the system disconnects, and will automatically reconnect when the cell phone is brought back within range.",

I should have known from other people's reviews that this thing wasn't going to do all that it promised it would do.

After many hours of trial and error effort, I found the problem to be and incompatible bluetooth version from an older cell phone trying to link up with the XLink device. The two would only stay linked for about 5 minutes. Once I tried my wife's newer cell phone everything worked fine! Also, it wasn't clear (to me at least) that a specific pin number had to be typed in.",
