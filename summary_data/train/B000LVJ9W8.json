      "text": "While I consider a high quality ergonomic keyboard essential to any office worker, I cannot offer comparisons between brands. The price for the Kinesis is a bit ridiculous, it's comparable to similar models. Any well designed ergonomic keyboard will reduce (not cure) discomfort, and significantly increase typing speed and accuracy. Cons: Esc, F-keys, and programmable buttons are small and not mechanical-- you will miss-click them occasionally, and other reviews report them breaking sooner. I do find the Esc key to be fairly annoying, since I use it a lot. There is not a single empty mechanical button on the keyboard where we can assign a macro. Pros: Everything else. After about 2 years of use now, I rate this 5/5.",

Now it takes some thought when going back to using a regular keyboard, though! It is also programmable if you really want keys to be in a certain space. Expensive but worth the charge!",

      "text": "I'm a programmer who's had symptoms of RSI for the past year now. After trying both the Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, I can say with certainty the Kinesis keyboard far exceeds the Microsoft models in ease-of-typing, layout (I love how the space and backspace bars are right at your thumbs), and comfort. I'm quite tall and lanky, and never could find a good desk where I could be constantly wrist-neutral without having my knees touch the bottom of the desk with a normal desk keyboard. The Kinesis is designed to sit on your lap, which makes it very comfortable for me...and easy to find that ever-important wrist-neutral position.",

I then ordered the split model from the same company, and I love that one - especially after I put a grip mat under it so it stays in position. BTW, it was the mac model and it works just fine. The split version has extra keys which are very useful, like a \"delete forward\" key which I use all the time (now if it had a keyboard i would be totally in heaven). So, consider the split model over this one.",

The keys on this keyboard are more like that of the old IBM Selectric typewriters and have a long travel in comparison to a modern keyboard feel. Because of this, I feel that it causes me to inadvertently bump adjacent keys, making mistakes and slowing me down. I was very hopeful of this keyboard, since i type all day long. I will continue to use it because it has helped to relieve the wrist strain i was having with non ergonomic keyboards.",

      "text": "A great keyboard that is minus 1 star due to the lack of Mac OSX drivers. It simply needs some drivers to fix the useless keys, which are The Right Control key, scroll lock, pause break, key pad, program, and very useful ones such as the SPACE BAR for punctuation... In fact, the latter makes the product entirely useless, so minus 4 stars. Please consider emailing tech@kinesis.com to request these functions if you agree.",
