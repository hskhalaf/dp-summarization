      "title": "Very nice but a little tight!",
      "text": "I just recently purchased these headphones and was very excited until I put them on. The design is nice and the overall build quality is very good, however the headphones do press down against the top of my head. I have them opened up all the way and they still seem a bit small for my head. It's not a deal breaker and probably will not return them but wish they were a bit larger in that aspect. So far the sound quality is superb, I watched Oblivion on my new ipad air and it sounded awesome! If you see these for $99.99 again don't hesitate you probably won't find a better set of headphones!",

      "text": "If you're a fan of audiophile, you must try this. The mid and the high are just perfect. The bass is no rich but it's deep and solid. And you can easily turn the rich bass on by tuning the Equalizer. I bought it for the price of 70$. With this price, this headphone is unbeatable. I've tried the more expensive one Beats Studio (it's now > 200$ on Amazon). I don't think it's better than this one when it comes to audiophile.",

These babies are comfortable and sound incredible.Cable is removable-therefore replaceable, if need be.",

That really comes in handy when I'm outside and have my ipod or phone in my pocket I give these 5 stars. They are awesome",

He says these are much better for depth of sound and for comfort; with the Steel Series he had to take them off after a movie and spend a few hours letting his ears rest, but with these he's still comfortable after the movie is done. Recommended! The only drawback was that it didn't have the pink/green plugs for the PC jacks, but he kept the cable from the Steel Series and used it with these. Problem solved.",
