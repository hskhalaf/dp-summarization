After reading the few neg reviews here and on other web sites, decided to add some straps for added support/stability. They don't interfear with folding, makes the bottom of the compartment stable, will prevent seams ripping, bolts poking through.The Velcro fasteners underneath don't have to be used, easier folding and unfolding. 2.00 ea. for the straps @ wally world (camping area). She loves to ride in it, little big when folded, 28 lbs or so, but a quality stroller.",

The reason I'm giving her such a low rating is due to the position of the bowels of the tires. There is a design flaw go with the small air pump and how you attach it to the tires to pump them up. In order to pump it up you have to get between spokes and from the inside under the buggy new regular bike. No regular bike pump will fit this due to this design flaw.

You control the stroller by leaning it, with the front wheel locked, unless you\u2019re taking it in a shop or somewhere narrow where you need to move slowly and with great precision (then unlock the front wheel).",

I clearly remember taking our old stroller on a hike and having to carry it half the time because its little wheels just couldn't handle the rough terrain. This one can take anything you throw at it (or at least has so far). Best of all, it's very simple to get our dog into and out of. The no zipper thing is a stroke of total brilliance!",

It's also easy to fold (once you do it the first time). Its also a little slimmer than some others, which is great for me. The cup holder isn't deep so I'm not sure I'll use it but I can throw a bottle water in the underneath basket. Overall I'd highly recommend because you're pet will have a smooth ride! I purchase the divider too but not sure I'll keep it. It sits too high and unless the canopy is latched my dog could easily fall if she moved.",

When we meet a large dog which could lead to barking, I can snap the cover close quickly. Our neighborhood streets are rough, without air ride we could not use a stroller. My only dislike is the cup holder, its not deep enough or large enough. I am having trouble finding something that will fit securely in it and living in the deep south, it's hot - water is a must. I do love this stroller!",

However, when I took the front wheel off to install the new bearings, i realized the nut securing the wheel wasn't even tight. I changed the bearings out anyway, but the original ones looked fine. So, if you are experiencing the death wobbles, just tighten the front wheel and I'm confident this will solve your problem. I haven't had a problem since!",
