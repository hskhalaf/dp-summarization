      "text": "Loved the glasses until I switched to the black polarized lenses. The black lenses are much thinner than the rest and kept on popping out of the frames. Since the reason for me to buy these glasses was to using them while fishing during my vacation... it kinda of defeated the purpose of buying them. Going to keep them just because I really like the blue lenses for every thing else. 12/26/17 After getting a new par if black polarized lenses things worked better but after a while it got loose again. I decided that I needed the black lenses more than any other so I used crazy glue. No more problems!",

      "text": "Very flimsy, feels like it will fall apart before I get on my bike. Cheap plastic, like the one from bad toys. The holding mechanism for the lens is very bad - you move the nose piece up and down to \"hold the lens in place\". The problem is it does not click in, the whole thing twists and the lens moves about. Honestly the case, the soft pouch and the lens cleaning fabric are more useful. Size is for a very big head - if you have a small head these will be too large. I have a medium size helmet and these are for people with large size helmets.",

Lens changing is easy (after a little practice) if you don't pay too much attention to the instructions and just look closely at how they are attached. Two of the lenses are a blue tint which I don't use, but the Yellow lens is great for cloudy days. A little \"squeezy\" on my size 7 3/4 head but that helps them stay on. Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase.",

Beyond that, the quality of the frames leaves much to be desired. Stiff, inflexible, brittle-feeling plastic and unable to fully open both earpieces. Uncomfortable and unforgiving fit. These do not appear/feel to be designed to last under moderate, much less, rigorous wear. The $20 Ironman shades from Walgreens are far superior in every conceivable aspect.",

Some glasses that do fit don't keep the lenses close enough to actually turn down the brightness on life, but these are just right. My only gripe is one of the swappable lenses doesn't fit as snug in the frame as I would like, but they are great for the price and I may just need to adjust them some more.",

An excellent value, with 5 different lenses and since 75% of my job is driving I am prepared for any driving or outdoor conditions! In addition to the lenses, you get a lanyard, a microfiber bag and my favorite...the zip up case with a clip! I have and will recommend these glasses to everyone! They arrived on time and I am very pleased with this product! Thank you!",

      "text": "Great glasses for the price. I've had at least 5 pair of Oakleys this is a great buy at 1/8 the price. Fits my narrow face well and the last pair lasted me about 10 months with all the abuse I gave it. Swapping lenses is easy and the plastic and rubber is of decent quality. I bought two pairs this time and if the standup like the first pair then I will continue to purchase.",
