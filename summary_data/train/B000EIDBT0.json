      "text": "The camera have been produced in 2006. Since then the unsold stock is still sold for unsuspecting persons like me for high price. Comparing to similar cameras of today camera it is bulky, has no internal memory and who knows whether there are any service center alive to support it... The WiFi setup drivers for the camera are for Windows XP only, they don't work on Windows 7 and higher. And I haven't managed to make the WiFi to work on Windows XP as well. Even Nikon wrote on their site that they don't plan to release new drivers for it. Conclusion: I regret for buying it and don't recommend to anyone.",

I prefer Nikon, they make professional products for consumers at fair prices. Check out my web site to see some of the pictures I have taken with it. Cannon sucks!",

Also, the flash is somewhat overly \"hard\" (rather than soft), so I don't really like how the pictures look with flash. I wish it was easier to switch between video and photo modes.",

Red eye reduction is wonderful, however the flash does go off about 4 or 5 times. It's not broken... it's supposed to do that for everybody who thinks their camera has a glitch.

    "title": "Nikon Coolpix S6 6MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Wi-Fi Capable)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe stylish Coolpix S6 has been built with the sharing and enjoyment of digital photography in mind, combining high-quality imaging performance with a striking wave-surface design, the ability to improve images in-camera, an outstandingly large LCD, and a powerful new Pictmotion function that allows users to create entertaining in-camera shows.\n\n The brand new Pictmotion function lets users create much more than just a slideshow--indeed it enables a radically new form of in-camera entertainment. This allows users to select favorite images and movie files, pick a style, and then select a music file from one of the five pre-installed files in the camera--or even add their own music via PictureProject for Windows only--to suit the show. Pictmotion then automatically analyzes all these elements to produce highly entertaining shows that are coupled with pace and transition selected to match the chosen music and style.\n\n These shows can then be played back anywhere, anytime on the ample-sized 3.0-inch LCD monitor, and because the LCD offers a surprisingly wide viewing angle of 170 degrees (both horizontal and vertical), such in-camera entertainment can be enjoyed by everyone at the same time. The camera also features Auto Image Rotation, which detects pictures that have been taken with the camera held vertically, automatically rotating them to suit in-camera LCD playback.\n\n With the Coolpix S6, image quality is a top priority: the camera offers a 1/2.5-inch CCD and 6.0 effective megapixel resolution to produce images that stay sharp even when significantly enlarged. It also features a high-quality 3x Zoom-Nikkor ED lens with a range of 35-105mm (35mm equivalent) that gives the photographer the flexibility to zoom out for beautiful landscapes, zoom in for tightly-composed portraits, and enjoy macro photography from as close as 4 centimeters.\n\n The Coolpix S6 has been specially designed to be visually appealing as well as easy to use. The eye-catching wave-surface design is about more than just great styling--its thin, compact dimensions and form make the Coolpix S6 really comfortable to hold.\n\n In terms of control, the camera features a new rotary multi-selector that allows fast circular scrolling for speedy image browsing at up to 10 frames per second, a range of buttons that further simplify operation, and an on-screen icon with a cursor that tracks circular scrolling, making it easy to select desired features. Furthermore, users can select functions by name or icon according to their personal preference, and all menus and icons have been made easier on the eye with a new color scheme and optimized icon dimensions.\n\n The Coolpix S6 also boasts a new one-touch portrait button, conveniently located at the top of the camera body, making it much simpler to take better quality pictures by offering easy access to Nikon's unique Face-priority AF, In-Camera Red-Eye Fix, and D-Lighting functions. With Face-priority AF, the camera can automatically detect people's faces in the frame, no matter where they are located, to produce sharply focused portraits.\n\n In-Camera Red-Eye Fix detects the unfortunate red-eye effect that can sometimes happen in flash photography, automatically compensating for it in camera to produce more pleasing results. D-Lighting (available in playback mode) enables users to improve images that are underexposed or taken with too much back light--creating a copy of the image with light and detail added where necessary while leaving the well-exposed parts exactly the way they were.\n\n The Coolpix S6 delivers the additional advantage of Wi-Fi capability. Offering IEEE 802.11b/g support, it allows users to send images wirelessly to a computer as soon as they are taken or to transfer in one go all images stored in memory to a computer. The Coolpix S6 also supports cable-free printing, enabling images to be sent directly to PictBridge-compatible printers without the need to use a computer. (Cable-free direct printing requires optionally available Wireless Printer Adapter PD-10. The PD-10 adapter is not included and must be purchased separately.)\n\n A selection of 15 Scene modes--four with Scene assist--allows Coolpix S6 users achieve satisfying results, aided by clear focus and optimal exposure in diverse situations. All the user has to do is select the most appropriate Scene mode best for the scene and compose the shot, leaving the camera to automatically select the optimum settings. \n\n Three movie modes with sound are also available for capturing action at up to 30 frames per second. The camera also features Time-lapse movie shooting capability that allows dramatic results to be created out of slow-moving action, such as shooting a flower blooming or a movie of clouds rushing across the sky, for example.\n\n The Coolpix S6 helpa speed up your search for recorded images thanks to a Calendar function that automatically sorts images according to the date they were taken. For further versatility, the Coolpix S6 comes complete with the Cool-Station MV-15, to allow batteries to be recharged while they are still in the camera. It also offers USB connectivity and can even be hooked up for TV display.\n\n On a final note, the Coolpix S6 comes bundled with Nikon's complimentary PictureProject software and an easy-to-use Wireless Camera Setup Utility which employs a simple Wizard to configure the camera for wireless operation. The beauty of PictureProject is that it makes editing pictures, organising shots and sharing images remarkably simple, while a range of available plug-ins lets users extend capabilities as they like.\n\n Nikon Coolpix S6 feature highlights:\n\n Pictmotion with high-quality music Nikon's new Pictmotion is much more than a simple slideshow function. Available on both the Coolpix S6, it allows you to select your favorite images and movie files, then pick a style and add a music file of your choice from among five pre-installed ones, or load your own choice of music (via PictureProject for Windows only) to suit the images. The Coolpix S6 then automatically analyzes each element to produce an entertaining show with pace and transitions determined by music and style for in-camera viewing anywhere. The generous LCD with an impressive 170-degree viewing angle that makes it easy for everyone to see. Furthermore, to heighten enjoyment of audio elements, the camera also features a large speaker that delivers heightened sound pressure and a sampling frequency increased from 8 to 22kHz that makes for noticeably enhanced sound clarity. \n\n Eye-catching wave-surface design\nThe Coolpix S6 has been created with a unique wave-surface design that is both esthetically appealing and very comfortable in the hand.\n\n Large LCDs \nThe Coolpix S6 features a large 3.0-inch 230,000-dot TFT LCD. Such generous size does away with the need for a viewfinder and makes for easier composition. The LCD also offers an impressive 170-degree viewing angle that makes it easy for everyone to enjoy the playback of still images, movies, and entertaining Pictmotion shows anywhere, at any time. \n\n Rotary multi selector and improved GUI\nOperation has been made smoother, simpler, and faster. A new Rotary multi selector incorporated into the camera back enables high-speed image browsing with circular scrolling action at up to 10 frames per second, while a range of buttons built into the Rotary multi selector make for more intuitive operation. There's also an on-screen icon with a cursor that tracks Rotary multi selector scrolling to make function selection even simpler still. The Coolpix S6 also features various screens and menus created with a color scheme that's easier on the eye, functions can be selected by the user's choice of name or icon, and all icons have been optimized and made clearer for easy viewing. \n\n Built-in Wi-Fi \nThe Coolpix S6 features the additional advantage of built-in Wi-Fi capability to add further enjoyment and flexibility to digital photography. Providing IEEE 802.11b/g support, it enables individual images to be wirelessly transferred to computer as soon as they're recorded, allows all stored images to be sent to a computer simultaneously and also supports cable-free direct printing with PictBridge-compatible printers. (Cable-free direct printing requires optionally available Wireless Printer Adapter PD-10. The PD-10 adapter is not included and must be purchased separately.) One-touch portrait functions\nA standalone One-touch portrait button is conveniently located on the top of the Coolpix S6, giving direct access to three innovative Nikon features for in-camera improvement. Face-priority AF automatically finds and then focuses on people's faces no matter where they are in the frame for pleasingly sharp portraits time after time. In-Camera Red-Eye Fix can automatically detect the annoying red-eye effect that sometimes occurs in flash photography, then compensate for it in-camera to give natural-looking portraits. And D-Lighting can improve underexposed images or shots taken with too much back light by creating a copy with light and detail added wherever necessary and well-exposed areas kept exactly as they are.\n\n Other features:\n\n\n * Highly compact dimensions: 100.5 x 60 x 21 millimeters (3.9 x 2.4 x 0.8 inches) \n * Carry-anywhere light weight (without battery and memory card): Approximately 140 grams (4.9 ounces) \n * Internal memory: 20 MB (approximately); SD card compatibility \n * BSS (Best Shot Selector) identifies and saves the sharpest shot automatically from ten sequential shots \n * Exposure BSS automatically selects and saves the shot most closely matching user-selected criteria from five sequential shots \n * USB connectivity supports easy transfer of data to computers and other peripherals \n * Swift startup of approximately 0.8 seconds; continuous shooting at up to 2.2 frames per second \n * Date Counter visually records countdown of days to an occasion or number of days since an important event \n * Help Button provides easy-to-understand explanations for functions on main menu \n * Blur Warning informs user after shooting if an image is blurred \n * Menu available in a choice of 20 languages \n * Noise Reduction produces better results during low-light conditions \n * Time zone function enables the camera clock to be set to local time, anywhere in the world \n * 4x digital zoom extends compositional freedom \n * Rechargeable EN-EL8 Li-ion Battery (supplied) can shoot approximately 200 shots on a single charge \n * Field Jacket FJ-CP1 water-resistant case (optional) lets users keep the Coolpix dry to underwater depths of 3 meters (not included--must be purchased separately) \n * Dock Insert PV-10/PV-11 (supplied) enable direct printing to compatible ImageLink printers \n * Choice of White Balance: Auto with TTL control, 6-mode manual (Daylight, Incandescent, Fluorescent, Cloudy, Flash, and White Balance Preset) \n * Voice recording available for duration of up to 5 hours or until memory capacity is reached",
