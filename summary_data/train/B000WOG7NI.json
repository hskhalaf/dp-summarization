I wanted this to help me sew, but it is making more work for me. Can't find any good videos to show me how to use this for fusing iron-on interfacing. Anyone use a steam iron for this?

The little holes where water sprays leaves some mark on the shirts but its goes away. Distilled water should be used. Do not use other kind or your fabric will be brown or will looks burned.
