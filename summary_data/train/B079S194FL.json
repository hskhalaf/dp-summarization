If it is breezy, definitely stake it to the ground, or it will lift up or blow away.",

The first time you have to attach the tent before you fully extend the tent. The side wall are also easy to attach. I thought I was getting all 4 sides for the tent, but didn't realize that they come in 10 foot sections. Therefore \"4 sidewalls\" equals 3 sides of the tent. Spend the extra 10 dollars and get the \"6 sidewall\" option if you want to completely enclose the tent. I actually set this up by myself but I wouldn't recommend it. Get some other people and it would be super fast.",

      "text": "The frame itself seems sturdy enough but the fabric is very thin. Some of the seams have already started separating and I don't expect the fabric to last for more than a few months. The thickness of the fabric is about that of a windbreaker. Most of it is single stitched. I would return it but the weight is such that I would have to pay a great deal in shipping, so it is not worth returning. I feel like a sucker regarding the fabric. Lesson learned.",

It could have been really bad! I sell jewelry and it could have been disastrous. But it stood against the forces of nature! And...having a pink tent...everyone can find you easily. It was great!",
