It had tons of great reviews so I bought it without giving the ingredients list more than a once over (lazy, I know). Turns out, it contains some kind of aluminum salt that is highly absorbable through the skin. Most people who are searching out healthier deodorant options know that aluminum is one of the worst ingredients. This product is a counterfeit organic masquerade product that contains the same unhealthy crap that regular deodorants have. I'm very disappointed and will be more vigilant about reading and analyzing ingredients lists in the future.",

The liquid was dried out on sides and it didn't came in any paper packaging just clear foil wrapped around.

Not to mention, it almost seemed like it was promoting sweat. With my previous deodorants that I've used, I have never had sweaty armpits, but this one I did. It wasn't pleasant. Overall, would be good if you are prone to irritation, but I wouldn't recommend otherwise.",

It felt heavier than the others, and when I popped it open, I found a huge ball of crystallized product. I\u2019m hoping that was just a fluke, because overall this deodorant is great.",

I alternate between this and primal pit paste. I prefer Bali for odor control and because it doesn't leave stains on my clothing but it will occasionally irritate my skin. Making sure it's dry after applying and using powder helps.",

It goes on so light and the smell is almost none existent which I personally like. I feel like with regular deodorant you have to scrub your underarms pretty hard to get the residue off but with this one its easy to wash off.",

      "text": "When you first use Bali Secrets you can tell right away it\u2019s high quality. The essential oils give it a clean, fresh scent and a little goes a long way. Unfortunately I was one of the few who ended up having a reaction to it after a week but otherwise I loved it. My skin is extra sensitive to pretty much everything and I\u2019m probably one of a handful of people if that who had this reaction. Martin e-mailed me to follow up on my purchase and offered me a full refund due to the skin irritation. Most companies never personally follow up with customers so this only reinforces the quality and high standards behind this brand.",
