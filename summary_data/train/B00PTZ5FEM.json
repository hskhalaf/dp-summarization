I was alittle disappointed that the footbed was so slippery when they got wet. I know these are not the top of the line Teva's but with the amount I get to go Floating I really didn't want to invest a ton of money into getting a new pair of river sandals. They have a very cool look and when dry are very comfortable for the type of sandal they are.",

As a former river guide many of us would duct tape the velcro on the strap behind the heel, they no longer have velcro on that strap and it was more a bug than a feature in my experience. We used to find a great many \"barely used\" Tevas floating in eddys, (never in my size) usually due to the heel strap coming loose. The leather footbeds are quite nice. I probably should give them 5 stars but there is always room for improvement.",

I don't have much to say about durability as I've only had them a few days, but they seem to be well made and can see myself wearing them regularly. Good quality sandals for good price, would definitely recommend.",

I just expected a little more life out of them as the tread and footbed were still in great condition. Not sure if the fact that these particular ones are canvas straps which after years of playing in lakes and streams just broke down.
