Nice clean looking stand...The only drawback, but I'll figure out a camouflage -- is the open back does leave cords exposed. 100% happy with my purchase!!!",

      "text": "I wasn\u2019t sure whether to buy this stand or not after reading some of the reviews. But once the price dropped I just went for it.... and I\u2019m so happy I did. Not only did I get a good price but this stand is pretty I love it!!! I assembled it with my 2 daughters 8 and 11 years old and we took about an hour and a half. The instructions are basically just pictures but if you have common sense then there should be no problem. Also it was very well packaged. The only one thing I would say is you definitely need 2 people to assemble. Hope this helps....",
