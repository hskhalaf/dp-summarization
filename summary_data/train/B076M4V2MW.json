In order to lock the chest strap in place I realized after some time that the end of the nylon strap has to be pulled through the rubber lock strap (holds true for all straps, but this was the only one I needed to tighten.) I tried to keep it in place by placing it between the \u201cears\u201d of the rubber strap, which does not work. How does one truly rate this without jumping off the roof? Give myself 5 stars for being sensible.",
