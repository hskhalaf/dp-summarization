This heats up SO FAST and doesn't take as long as I expected to cool down to pack up. Please know that I do not use water in any of my irons anymore! It does nothing but frustrate me and leak. I have a full size Rowenta which I love and it is working beautifully with NO WATER! I now use water and Mary Ellen's Best Press in spray bottles, when needed, and I am a happy camper!",

I have given it one day, four day, one week, two week breaks to see if it will heat up again and alas nothing. A very poorly made product. Incredibly disappointed. Please take my advice and invest in a better iron, otherwise you will just be paying for this one and having to buy another two months later. I would like to know how to be reimbursed.",

Definitely better for iron-ons or arts n' craft projects rather than for ironing clothes, but still does the trick if you're a broke student living in dorms with clothes all wrinkled from being folded and crammed into drawers. I mainly use it to put iron-on patches on my backpack and other things. It takes a few minutes to heat up and you sorta have to iron longer than you would with a full-sized iron, but I found this to be useful because it makes it less likely that you'll singe your clothes or whatever you're ironing.",

I can't see where its leaking from so I guess its just not sealed correctly. Because of that it doesn't iron clothes very well.

Just hang up your clothes and push the steam button. BE AWARE, however, that if you're using water that has any amount of minerals in it (for example, ALL water in Europe), the minerals will start to collect on the faceplate and leave burnt crusts here and there which in my case only ever came off on my white dress shirt collars.
