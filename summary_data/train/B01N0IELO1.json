They are sturdy but not heavy themselves; they work on leverage. The base is 7 inches long, so it reaches under several books at a time to secure them. My books and binders are standing up straight, no sliding or falling over.",

That\u2019s not the case at all. They are super thin and seem cheap but they absolutely get the job done. I put 6 on the bottom of both and absolutely no scratching!",

Glad I checked into Amazon and saw these beautiful bookends that go perfectly with my bedroom furniture. I did not want BLACK for the color and saw that they came in BRONZE also, along with a couple of other colors...probably white and gray (cannot remember). I took a chance on the bronze...which came like a dark walnut. So pretty. With the long 'tray' on each 'end', it gives them a good balance and strength. Very please with them !!!!",

      "text": "These are beautiful, and ere exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately, the felt pads they include to put on the bottoms of the bookends to keep them from slipping are crap. They\u2019re too thin to do any good, or the bottoms of the bookends are warped just enough to keep the pads from doing anything. Jus plan to provide your own non-skid pads and you\u2019ll love these, honestly.",
