My eyes get very watery and red when I put on eyeliner of almost any kind, even eyeliners that claim to be hypoallergenic--for a while I feared I would no longer be able to wear eyeliner every again--but I gave this one a last-ditch try a while back, and I'm so glad I did. This brand and type is the only one that doesn't irritate my lids and eyes and undereye skin. I would recommend this eyeliner to anyone who struggles with sensitivity to eyeliner.",

I'm personally planning on using this around the waterline, and different ones for accents. I will definitely buy more colors in the future. :) 20yrs of being told I'd get use to makeup and not tear up, and I finally find something that doesn't feel like torture. <3",

Every time I try, I end up with the eyeliner broken off (or rather, \"smeared off\") inside the sharpener, no matter how slow and careful I am.

Didn\u2019t get to use it and breaks off and the sharpener doesn\u2019t work either. Waste of my money. I will buy this in target, Walgreens and Walmart next time. Even if I pay a little more at least I get to use all of it and the pencil works.",
