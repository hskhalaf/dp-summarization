Set up is super easy just pop off the battery cover, remove batteries, pop in rechargible battery pack, instal new cover and charge until completion.

My understanding is that Microsoft made a deal with this company to create matching charging stands with their controllers. I wish all consumer electronic companies treated all their products like their own art form. Microsoft doesn't always get it right, but they know how to make a controller. Usability of this controller for PC gaming - that's for a different review.",

For the price, I would highly not recommend until the battery door issues is resolved.
