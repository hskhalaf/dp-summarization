All the cleaners I've tried don't work - or they leave a residue on my stove that show any type of mark of finger print. I was desperate and found Wright's Cooktop Cleaner. After scrubbing and wiping - I have a perfectly clean stovetop. It doesn't leave any type of film or residue and if you touch it after wards you can't see the finger prints! Defiantly will purchase again when I run out!",

It works great, even on stubborn burned spots on my glass stove top. I have allergies to some chemicals, and this one has only a mild odor and doesn't bother my allergies.",
