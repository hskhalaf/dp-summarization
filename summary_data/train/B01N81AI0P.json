Probably better to go with something plastic or machined brass or where the bond has been smoothed. The lip inside is large enough it would hamper liquid flow as well.

I have a refillable mini perfume in my purse and the smallest funnel outs perfect for pouring the perfume into it from my big bottle. No more waste! These are perfect for using for soap and essential oil blending into small bottles. Being that they are made of stainless steel, they are not only easy to clean, they do not absorb odors like plastic ones do. The set of three is on a ring so you can store them together, or take them off the ring if if desired. These can be used for liquid or dry ingredients.

Now, whether using it with thin-necked oil and vinegar dispensers, salt and pepper shakers, hot sauce containers, hip flasks, spices, herbs, aromatherapy bottles or beyond, our perfectly sloped, carefully balanced funnel provides the smoothest filling.",
      "MORE AIRFLOW WITH TRICKLE-GROOVE TECHNOLOGY: Sometimes with small amounts of ingredients, blocks happen. But Bellemain\u2019s mini funnels are custom made with a trickle groove embedded down its stem to allow for more airflow and maintain a steady flow that big kitchen funnels envy.",
      "THE NO-CORROSION PROMISE | HIGHEST-GRADE STAINLESS STEEL: With 18% chromium for maximum corrosion resistance, your mini funnel set will stay beautiful and safe for years. The professional food-grade stainless steel that makes up these funnels also resists breaking, bending, scratching, and rusting.",
