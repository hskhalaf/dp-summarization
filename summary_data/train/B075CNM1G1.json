It also supports her really well with the bolster around the edges. It isn't entirely water proof, but it has served its purpose well a couple of times when she has had an accident. It holds up really well in both the washing machine and the dryer. Can't beat the price. Would definitely recommend.",

The stitch was already coming apart so can\u2019t imagine it lasting through a wash. The arms expanded outward at an angle, not straight, leaving no sitting room on a smaller size couch. Lastly, the back longer part was all flattened and the \u201ccushion\u201d material inside was not soft at all. Honestly, you\u2019re better off just laying down a blanket for the price. If you know how to sew, purchase foam and make your own border. I may just purchase velcro and DIY something myself.",
