We've had it over a month now and our dog uses it constantly throughout the day to go out on the deck and we've had no problems with it. Great deal for the price!

I think a thicker frame, and pin-like plastic all over the inside on each side would've been a better way to get sturdiness. I wish they put more thought into how it connected to the screen.",

      "text": "Perfect ! The screen door is very slim, light, just great. Extremely easy to install, no need to remove the screen panel either. Just use tape to mark the outlines, place any hard surface on the opposite side and use an exato to cut then pliers with something soft in between the metal so you don't scuff the plastic frame and press the two parts together. There is a small gap that is easily fixed by taping some foam strips and then the only thing left is hope that the your cat will actually manage to learn to use it!:)",

Also, the screen in the doggy door is regular mesh, and easily destroyed by puppy claws. Would be better it is was a metal mesh, but that would most likely increase the cost.",
