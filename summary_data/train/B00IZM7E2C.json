And hunters/military folks walked up to him and said... \"Nice Ghillie Suit.\" He thoroughly enjoyed himself with his friends at parties and trick-or-treating. The only drawback is that this thing sheds like crazy. We have been picking up the threads all over the place, and spent the better part of an hour picking up after our son at our church building where he wore it for an event.",

The adult large size fits over hunting jacket & pants without issues, covering boots too. Hood is a good fit as well. Rap for rifle covers entire rifle. Will have to improvise for scope with burlap or mess. Most Hunter's / snipers would make their own ghillie suits, but you can't beat the price for this ghillie suit. It does however leave stragglers with strands falling out, but overall satisfied with the purchase.",

In some places it was overly thick in other places it was extremely thin. I suspect that there is very little quality control at the factory where these suits were made.",
