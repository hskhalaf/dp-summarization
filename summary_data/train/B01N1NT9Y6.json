The regular remote uses 2 coin batteries (crc2032 i think?) Which obviously will not last for months on everyday usage. Why did they discontinued the previous one with rechargeable battery? Because the quality of those internal batteries were bad? Nvidia you should really provide more quality on your peripheral accesories. Chinese knock off prove to be more reliable.

I know how to turn off in the system , but you have to disconnect the power cable and plug in again to power on . Sleep mode isn't off switch, it's more of a standby . The switch thing is stupid though .you do need to power off unit , not designed to stay on !! Nvidia needs its ass kicked for this decision !!",
