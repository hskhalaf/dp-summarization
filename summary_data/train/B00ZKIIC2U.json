There is just something so calming about this long-forgotten scent of childhood. I personally like it better as a linen/pillow mist, but it's in no way bad as a body spray either. Just this morning I tried misting my scarf and I was in heaven as I walked to work. This is amazing and I can't wait to try out the other scents!!! :)",

She likes it better than the previous one she used, so I\u2019m sure we will be buying more in the future! We appreciate the great customer service too!

I've been using it as a face spray and it feels energizing and fresh. Because its not a flowery fragrance, my husband likes using it too. We both appreciate the clean ingredients and how it gives the face and mind a perk up throughout the day. I'll be looking into Asutra's other sprays and definitely recommending this one! Thanks.",

Pte: I spray it in the air about 2 feet above my pillow; then I allow it to dry before going to bed.",
