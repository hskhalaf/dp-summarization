Nice idea on the box, but probably much too heavy to be reliably shipped without damage. I needed the horseshoes for Memorial Day event so I went ahead and installed the stakes and used the horseshoes. The finish literally started coming off the horseshoes immediately, and after only one day of use is pretty much completely worn off. Wishing I would have purchased a different brand. The stakes work just fine and the finish was okay.",

Within one day of pitching with these shoes, the coating not only started to fall off, but created burrs where you would ordinarily hold the shoe. As nice as the box is, the shoes are not close to the quality you would expect for the price.",
