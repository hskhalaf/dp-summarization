Only the writing was somewhat decent but anyone who actually uses this book to prepare will be in for a very BIG shock when they take the real test. My child was only ok today when he took the PSAT 8/9 because he actually did some regular PSAT prep, in addition to using this ridiculous book. Unbelievable!",
