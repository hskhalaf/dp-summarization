The only complaint I can even come up with is that the hand holds can be twisted to make an awfully obnoxious sound, nothing a little fussing won't stop xD.",

They have hardly played with anything else since we gave it to them a week ago. The face that it rotates 360 degrees is the kicker. They spend most of the time spinning each other around versus going up and down. I had no idea it would be such a hit!!! Well worth the money. Only con: One black foam handle has already broken- but my 5yr old son is rough on things.",

Double-check the screws once in a while and make sure plastic center insert is pushed in because it tends to slowly slide up after being used for a while. You just push it down by hand, even the kids can do it. We keep it outside none stop and have no problem with the rust yet. So far so good. Wish I found something like this before.",

I sort of skimmed the first part of the instructions and just started putting stuff together, only to realize that I used the wrong screws in random instance and had to take it apart and redo it. AGH. :) Still, this is a lot of fun and I really recommend this toy.",

Also having some sort of spring or cushion under the seat would help prevent feet getting stuck under.",

We have kids from 2- 8 that love playing on it. The color never faded.",
