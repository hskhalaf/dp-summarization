Although not concerned about cooking without oil or butter, the surfaces are slick and as far as I can tell not easy to burn the contents -- not recommended to test that feature. The lids indeed do not exactly fit on the pans, but within. Not to mention I have many lids left over from pots and pans that are no longer in good condition. I'll be looking for more sizes. They nest nicely. and they are LIGHT. The price is right. I highly recommend them.",

The only downside to this set is the fact that there are no lids for the pans, but that seems to be a pretty common problem with a lot of sets. I just purchased a universal pot/pan lid so I had something to cover my pans while cooking, which works fantastic with the set. Honestly, I bought this set for the colors, and the colors have not faded. I've never put them in the dishwasher though, I always let them sit until the pan is cool to the touch, then rinse them off if I'm not ready to wash yet.",
