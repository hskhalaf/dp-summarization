The lack of basic quality control with Creality is astonishing. I mean come on guys, this is a precision engineering machine and you didn't even test the motherboard before shipping it out. Very disappointed!! Returning it.",

My only recommendation is that you purchase a mirror box at Lowes or Home Depot to be on the top of the bed. Use painters tape or glue on the mirror. This printer is possibly better printer than my CR10-s. The Ender 3 is a great quality made printer and it has more print area than the Ender 2. You can put it together easily in less than an hour watching youtube videos. Don't waste money buying 1k printers, most of the items you will make will fit on this or the CR10-s.",

The only two knocks I will give it is the instructions aren't the greatest if you're new to 3d printing, and the gcode test files on the included card were sliced improperly causing them to fail.

You can update your firmware it's a pretty straightforward process however out of the box it does not have this enabled. I would personally like to see auto bed leveling and future models.

It took about an hour, and was spot on. My son has since printed several figures, and assorted keychains.

They quickly sent me a spare parts kit, with 4 rollers, upgraded bed springs, PTFE tube, and an additional wire harness! Nice! I was also pleasently surprised at some of the details of this version of the Ender3. It has a silicone hot end sleeve, a nice plus. It also came with firmware with thermal runaway protection already active, critical for fire safety!",

But the seller is very helpful and has helped me out replacing the bed with no cost so I bumped up the rating of the seller. Very great support.",
