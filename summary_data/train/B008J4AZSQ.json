      "text": "I really love this tent, but out of nowhere a tent pole snapped tis weekend. It had been set up a few miles into the forest, I left in the morning, bright sunny day, no wind, and came back to this. Cut into the rain fly too, what the hell. Tent was full staked and supported by guy wires and all. Here I am bragging to my friends that they overpaid for their quality and expensive REI tents..... Well looks like they'll have the last laugh afterall. No I have to figure out how to get another pole and probably a back up one too... Ugh!",

Very secure on the ground and when you add the cover tarp, very wind resistant. Make sure you tie the point side towards the wind. It helped us weather Algonquin Park up in Canada in below freezing temperature. Water proof but if you don't zip up properly, you may get water inside when opening the zipper in the morning. I like the tan color which helps blend in the nature but the orange stands out so you can find your tent.",

It's easy to take the fly on and off however so if you are in an area where privacy is a concern you might want to put the rain fly on.

Repacking the tent is kind of a pain but Alps has a youtube video that gives some pretty good advice when doing so, albeit slightly time consuming. For one full sized adult, the tent has plenty of room but if you're sleeping two, I'd imagine it could be tight.",

The Lynx, which has aluminum poles opposed to fiberglass poles, is very similar to our Taurus Tent series. The Lynx has more mesh than the Taurus, taking up half of the walls on each side allowing even more ventilation. The tent is an easy to set up, 2 pole rectangular dome style tent with pole clips that easily fit over the poles for quick assembly. ALPS has not cut any corners... between the factory sealed fly and floor seams, weatherproof fly buckles, 2 doors for easy entering and leaving, 2 vestibules for extra gear storage or weather protection, and extra-large #8 zippers, you're sure to find everything you could want in a tent with our Lynx.",
