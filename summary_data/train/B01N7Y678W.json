I like that the on-off switch stays in the on position, so you don't have to hold it. It sure beats using the old T-bird's bumper jack. It would be nice if it came with alligator clamps instead of a cigarette lighter plug, so it could be hooked directly to the battery. I bought a separate adapter to do just that.",
