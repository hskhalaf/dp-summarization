The menu buttons and Sceptre's bright rear input color coding is a little odd. The menu buttons are on the back and are easy to use, once you figure them out. The monitor looks great at 1080p watching videos and has up/down tilt. Worth the money for sure.",

Initially, it was an painstaking inconvenience because I only used the monitors to study for my courses. Now, it is a tremendous work stoppage as I work from home and require both monitors to successfully do my job.",

The picture on this monitor is really fuzzy and grainy, and black levels were a joke. While this monitor is light weight, I did NOT feel comfortable with it only having two vesa mounting holes, as opposed to the industry standard of 4.
