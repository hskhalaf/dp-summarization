Good buoyancy, with me sitting in one of these (5'7\" & 215 LBs), it's comfortable and can be in about 2, 3 feet of water and not bottomed out. it's great.",

I was a little worried about getting it onto the top of my car, but after a couple of practice attempts it wasn't too difficult. It is super stable (we kayak the TN river) in windy and choppy conditions. It seems to track well and for a recreational kayak it hits all the marks. The seat is is comfortable and at 5'9\" I found the leg room to be fine. I'm more likely to try more kayaking spots now with this rigid kayak and I believe that this one will last me for several seasons.",
