So, I began to do some searching for \"high density foam\" here on Amazon, and I came across these incredibly priced, perfect foam bricks to place my large, heavy studio monitors (speakers) on, and these things do not disappoint! They're perfect in every regard for this sort of usage. I got the height that I needed as well as the isolation in spades, and the price was reasonable to boot. Great product.",
