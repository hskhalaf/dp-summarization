Reddit and facebook apps constantly refreshes. Returns was a pain as it is not free. I opted for the pricier unit to have that peace of mind that the product I purchase is good and went through a meticulous testing for quality. I need to pay for return shipping.",

      "text": "This phone came with the microphone broken (AND the LiIon battery at zero percent). The mic is the subject of a major lawsuit. So they didn't even bother to check it. Battery life was ... ok but clearly compromised. Now I've repaired some phones and I was willing to try this one, but with zero help from Google, this isn't worth it. So I paid $100 LESS for a brand new Moto G5 and love it.",

      "text": "The phone itself is great. Fast, smooth and still quite capable in 2018. My problem is with the description. While I feel the phone may be new, I specifically asked the seller if the phone was new and sealed in the box before I purchased. I received an answer of \"Yes\". Not only was the phone not sealed, there was a card inside the box stating that this phone was from a reseller and if I had warranty issues to contact them or Amazon, not Google. So obviously it's not off the line brand new. I see no signs of use or wear so that's good, but the description and re-seller I feel were misleading.",
