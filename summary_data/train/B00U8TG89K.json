Wish it would be discounted since $50 is a little much compared to other options from Under Armour which range from $30 - $40 at times. However for that price tag it does as advertised and provides a conforming fit to keep one warm for the winter without feeling too baggy from layers of clothing. Would buy again.",

It's also super short, like about 4 inches shorter than the HeatGear of the same size. In short, if you wear an XL in the HeatGear, you will not fit in the ColdGear of any size.
