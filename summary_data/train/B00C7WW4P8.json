I am a vegan and obsessed with with my cats health and I will not feed them anything else. Yes it is expensive but you are losing vet bills years down the road. What's more important?",

She loved that. Switched to lamb because I'm a young, broke person and it's like $20 bucks cheaper, and she absolutely refuses to touch it. I'm maybe managing to get her to eat half a can a day at best, and only if i put dry food in it that makes her sick but she likes. I've used three cans trying to do this and so I can't return it, but she hates this flavor.",
