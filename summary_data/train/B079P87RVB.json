The little sand castles are cute, but so far the kids don't care for the little shovels. Our favorite thing to do with the kinetic sand is combine it with little plastic construction trucks.",

It took forever to get the kinetic sand off her & she ended up with a red rash from all of the rubbing that had to be done to remove it. NEVER AGAIN! What a rip off!!",

I called the kinetic sand company to see what they can do, (nice girl) but she basically told me that she could send me 2-3 4.5oz colored sands instead. This is THREE LBS. And the best I could get offered is not even 1 lb to replace it!? Smdh. Sure disappointed, and a waste of 20$ :(",

He has requested more! i love how there is more colors at affordable prices. the little tools that come with it make it even more fun! my little guy will sit for a while and play with his sand.
