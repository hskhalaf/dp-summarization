      "text": "Both the good and bad reviews of this little washer are correct. It depends on how you use it. If you spin it slowly so the clothes drop from top to bottom each revolution, the clothes are slammed down through the hot soapy water 60 times per minute. So two minutes of cranking slams them through the water 120 times and they come out sparkling clean. If you spin it faster, centrifugal force keeps the clothes at one end of the washer, and you end up with wet, dirty clothes. I love mine!",

It's certainly untrue that this thing uses less water than handwashing. It's nearly impossible to rinse all soap out, or even to drain it completely. Couldn't find anyone to take the thing so it went in the garbage, waste of $45. I'll stick to more effort and time hand washing, rather than use this.",

The thing leaks during draining and this rems to be getting worse. Draining it also won\u2019t get all the water out. The little protector over the drainage hole inside kept getting loose leaving the clothes to clog up the drainage hole. I ended up glueing the thing in place. The framework the washer hangs in seems flimsy and moves very which way when spinning the washer. So far, it\u2019s not showing cracks, but I\u2019m not holding my breath.",

The little doohickeys that keep the legs from sliding off could have been easier to assemble. I wouldn't have minded using an actual screwdriver to attach them, might have been easier.

Biggest potential negative is the drain pipe, if it cracks you can't do much. Great product overall!",
