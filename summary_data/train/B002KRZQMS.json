      "text": "We are very pleased with the purchase of this tent. We got it for the sole purpose of a cover for our little one at the beach. We all ended up spending quit a bit of time in it! Our whole family could fit under it pretty comfortably. There was also room to put all of our stuff under it (so it was out of the sun). We also used the sand pockets to hold all of our flip flops and beach clothes. I'd definitely recommend this tent for any outdoor activity if you have little ones. (I'd recommend practicing folding it back up just a few times. We did and had NO issues when we used it.)",

It held up very well to the wind and was super easy to set up and put away. I am glad I practiced once before taking it to the beach though because it made the process much better. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. My only concern and I say this hoping that it never becomes an issue but I could tell it was pulling quite a bit at the very top so I\u2019m hoping the stitching lasts.",

I wouldn't have been able to get a tent with poles and stakes put together quickly enough to keep two toddlers in my reach. This tent takes 15 seconds to pop open on the beach- and once you get the hang of it, it takes about one minute to take it down and get it back into the carrier. Super lightweight. Sturdy on windy days (deep pockets along both sides that you fill with sand). Side windows give great ventilation. This was such an awesome addition to our \"beach gear\".",

It doesn't blow around and it is easy to stabilize it. I live in Florida: you need protection from the sun. This let the breeze in and the sun out. It is also easy to fold back up once you get the hang of it. I practiced in my living room the day before the beach and had no problem at all folding it all back up. (I'm 64 and no mechanical genius). Also, it weighs next to nothing. You carry it over your shoulder like a hand bag. This is the best invention ever!",

On typical nice, breezy beach days, we just need to turn/adjust it in the right direction so the wind doesn't catch it and knock it over. We fill Ziploc baggies with sand and place in the side pockets to weigh it down.. works great!!",

As a tip, use grocery bags and put the sand in those to weight it - it makes for an easier tear down. You can also adjust the height of the tent by positioning the sides closer or farther apart.

I don't think that I would take kids to the beach again without one. [My son] slept the entire time in the tent, and it's nice to just have a little shade and privacy.\" As a result of his email, I have ordered a second tent since we have additional children/grandchildren visiting at the same time this year.

It's so simple to setup and take down, that we took it down every night and setup again every morning with no problems. I would recommend a big mat for underneath, and bring a shovel with your beach toys to fill the sides with sand faster.",
