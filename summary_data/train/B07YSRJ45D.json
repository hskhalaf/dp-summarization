      "verdict": "The people who have tried on the Reebok Floatride Run Fast were generally happy with what they were able to experience. This road shoe apparently offered effective performances on the roads. The lightweight build and the soft midsole construction were also given praise by neutral pronators. On the other hand, there were gripes about the upper being unsecured and the outsole peeling off after some time.",
      "pros": [
        "Several people reported that the Reebok Floatride Run Fast was obliging as a shoe for speed training",

        "A handful of runners felt that the price of this road shoe was on par with the quality of its materials",
        "it\u2019s not too cheap, but it\u2019s not hot on the wallet",
        "The width and the sizing scheme were aspects of this product that were thought to adequately follow expectations"

      "cons": [
        "A tester complained of in-shoe wobbling and unsteadiness while wearing the Reebok Floatride Run Fast",
        "A few people observed some wear on the outsole after only about a hundred miles of using it",

This causes it to be very easy to wear down uneven do to a non-perfect gait, which then just makes your gait even worse as it will make it hard for you to try to correct it with the uneven heel. Mine are worn down almost all the way on the arch side of the shoe. This has never happened to such an extreme for me before.",

I only use it for races and so far it's held up to ~70 miles with minimal signs of wear. When it eventually starts to wear, I'll roll this pair into my 'hard day' workout flats for sure and maybe try to find another pair for racing. I have worn it in every common race distance from 5k to marathon with no comfort issues.",
