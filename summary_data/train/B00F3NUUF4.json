      "text": "BEWARE! The 8 port model SE3008 design has changed dramatically from what is described. There is now a SE3008V2 which is completely different. I ordered 2 of these units on 7/17/2018 specifically for the orientation of front panel lights and rear panel ethernet and power jacks. Unfortunately I was shipped model SE3008V2, which has all lights and ethernet jacks in the front, and only the power jack in the rear. I have to blame Linksys for not giving this a completely different model name. For more info, see <a href=>this Linksys article</a>. I will have to return these and find a suitable alternative.",

This is bad if you have this on your desk because now you have messy cables facing you, and usually there is tension on the cables that pull the switch to one side. I have one purchased in July 2018, and that has the connectors coming out of the back. Sending this back and try and find the \"older\" version where the connectors come out the back.",

The first test was between two desktop computers running off the same NAT router (before adding this switch) showed 980 Mbps throughput for upload and download; the test after installing the switch returned the same values.",

Upon receiving the box I called support and asked them for a wall-mount kit, as it came with a rack mount. They did not have one, but offered a refund if I returned to Amazon. I needed the switch so I bought a NavePoint rack to wall adapter plate from Amazon. Overall the product works great. Just wish it came with a wall mount kit.

In the evenings my boys use it when gaming as there is only one shared Ethernet wire at that location. Neither have complained about any speed issues or loss in mindless gaming ability.

Jun '18: I have to reset this switch too often. This isn't a value at all. It is the weak link in my network. Nov '18: I've not had to reset my switch since replacing the Linksys.",

When a gigabit Network has a few slow devices (like, TV sets) some other routers will block packets from the same source while a packet is queued to a slow device. That is annoying, particularly when there are several of those slow devices. This router doesn't do that. Packets going to the slow devices do not block packets from the same Source going to other devices. You can actually get (close to) gigabit throughput, even with some slow devices in the house.",

Otherwise the two versions appear to be the same. Update: while rewiring and installing, I realized that it was actually the connectors that were moved to the front with the lights. The back has only the power plug. So, to clarify, v2 has the power plug is on the back, the connectors and lights are on the front.
