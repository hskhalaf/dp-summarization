      "text": "I paid about $100 less for a NEW never opened Apple MacBook Air computer from \"Electro Express\" on Amazon than I would have if I went to Apple directly. The problem is that it broke 8 months after I bought it. No problem right? Apple products have a 12 month warranty. True. The problem is that these re-sellers have old computers. Apple starts the warranty clock when \"they\" get them which in my case was 14 months ago. So basically I bought a computer with a 6 month warranty. Long story short: the repair is $475 and \"Electro Express won't return my emails. Buyer Beware!",

The new models just have a cheeper feeling than the older ones. Even the Apple logo has gone cheap, it doesn\u2019t even light up. Just two ports to plug into now. I\u2019m returning it, I can\u2019t justify the price now, Apple MacBooks are far from what they were in the past. Just Sad",

On top of that the computer came with a Full one year warranty! I think I might've just lucked out. But I received a great computer for 250 dollars less than what they were selling the new ones. I'm happy I took the chance on a \"used\" MacBook Air from amazon",

A few months ago Amazon lured me with an $800 deal on this discontinued Mac laptop, which was the last that had any USB ports-YAY! Soooo glad I went back to Mac. It was worth twice the price to me to walk away from all the PC mishigoss and just have the darn thing work without me having to triage update fallout or basically ever turn it off.",
