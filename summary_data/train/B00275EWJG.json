I'm a 61-year old woman and I did it all by myself in limited space with my fur babies crawling all over, but I should have had a helper. One person did mention about the instructions not designating the left and right sides very clearly. I discovered that after I had it all assembled (after a lot of...shall I say, angry outbursts!) But I just used my power drill and made new holes. It's together, but it doesn't look like a tight fit, but it'll do. It looks great and it is huge! The instructions are only diagrams, no text or explanations/descriptions.",

When screwing to the top I almost made a hole in the wood by going through. The engineers may need to adjust the screw siZe for that aspect. There was also lots of fibrous residue. Along with that is a string varnish smell. My concern was the Prop 65 warning and what they loose debris could cause. If they could address this I think this would be a good piece considering self assembly.",

All screw holes lined up, the instruction were clear and the entire unit is in alignment. Very heavy pieces, and I would suggest you use the box it came in to cushion the pieces to avoid scratches. I love the way it looks and it will double as a quilt storage unit.",

For that I just drilled my own holes (another benefit of having the drill).",

The hardware is solid but do not attempt to lift the trunk using the side handles. You would have to drill holes through to the interior and get different screws that attached all the way through the side panels and were secured with a bolt in the interior. I always use glue when assembling a wood product since I never intend to disassemble the product...in this case the trunk. Glad I bought it.",

It looks good, and offers a good bit of space for storing those seldom used items that were taking up too much of my closet space. It took a little time to put together, but the instructions (with schematics) were very clear, and all the hardware was individually packaged and clearly labeled. I also purchased the matching coffee table. Between the two, I managed to clear most of the clutter from my closets, and they look great in the living room.",
