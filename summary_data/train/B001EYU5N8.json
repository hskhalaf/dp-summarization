NEVER buy drill bits that are rounded on the ends! Go hex all the way!!

You will learn very fast the correct direction to turn them. They do cut steel very well. Use cutting oil, it's a must. And little tip, if you put in a drill, it will turn them much faster than by hand. You're welcome.",

    "description": "Color:BlackDEWALT DW1177 20-Piece Black-Oxide Metal Drill Bit Set\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe DEWALT DW1177 20-piece drill bit set contains bits sized from 1/16-inch up to 1/2-inch. These bits have a black oxide finish for greater wear protection and longevity of the bit. The parabolic flute design also gives these bits greater strength. They have a 135-degree split-point design that reduces slip and walking and allows for easier no-slip starting. The bit set includes a sturdy tough case container to keep bits organized. Tough cases include a sliding soft-grip lock that keeps the case closed securely to prevent lost bits. These bits are ideal for drilling in metal, wood, and plastics.",
