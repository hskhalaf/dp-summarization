This also makes cleaning the canister quite a challenge. It should have been flushed with the body of the canister.",

I keep ground coffee in this container and coffee grounds stick to the inside of the lid and make a mess of coffee grounds on my counter, when unscrewing and removing the lid. The magnetic scoop is gimmicky as it interferes with closing the lid of the container when the scoop is in place. I have had this container for some time..hated to replace it.

If you put the top on too quickly or if the scoop is off center at all, it will fall off. But not a big deal, it just ends up on top of the grounds or beans. If you are filling a reusable Keurig cup or something with similar diameter, the scoop is too wide and it spills over the edge when filling. I understand this is probably a pretty small market, but just an observation. Otherwise the look, sealing ability and build quality all seem done well.",
