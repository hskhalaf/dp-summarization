I have a whirlpool dishwasher and often the stock silverware basket would fill up before the trays would fill up with dishes and glasses. This solved that problem and we no longer have to run the dishwasher early just because of the silverware being full. I easily removed the handle as I didn't feel it was necessary, but it's there if you prefer. The material is pretty solid and I highly recommend it.",

It doesn\u2019t fit exactly in the same side space, so we have to set it in the back of the rack which is not as convenient. Also, it is not as large as the original, but works just fine. Like the optional cover which slides out of the way if not needed. Very pleased so far.",
