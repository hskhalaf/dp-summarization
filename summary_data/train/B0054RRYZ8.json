They are a decent price, but may be an add on item, so beware. I usually order my treats when I order food, so it's no issue. Make sure you don't feed your fur babies TOO many treats. Please feed them a good basic diet recommended for them with treats given at a reasonable amount.",

That was great. I will say that I\u2019ve had other bunnies before them and some of my buns actually do like these snacks so there is still hope for other buyers. Thanks",
