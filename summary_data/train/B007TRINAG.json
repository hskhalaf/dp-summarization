They also stand behind them and will replace them if the dog chews them up. Mine have done that a few times and I did replace a couple with the warranty. But when the collar or leash has had a long life and meets its end in a dog's mouth, I just let it go. I highly recommend their collars and leashes.",

I have always joked that using a leash and collar on my girl was just for show; she could step out of it if she so desired and occasionally at the farmers market I have looked down to find myself holding a leash and collar with no dog attached! Properly adjusted, this collar is loose around her neck, but tightens if she tries her slippery escape trick while I am not paying attention. I believe this should be much safer than a choke collar and more comfortable than a harness. Heck it looks beautiful too! 5 stars with no hesitation.",

The great thing about Lupine is that they guarantee their products for life, even if chewed. I do have a preference for the 1\" collars, as I like the thick and sturdy look of these. Also, if you have a dog that is stubborn or had a narrow head (like a Basset Hound) then the \"combo\" collar is for you! It allows for the collar to be loose on the neck but tighten when you need it most.",
