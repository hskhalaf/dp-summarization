      "title": "Made a huge difference after foot/ankle surgery",
      "text": "I had ankle and foot surgery last year (2016). Golfing was tougher than I had hoped, and uneven ground was especially difficult. I tried several of my golf shoes (plenty to pick from) and none of them felt good or stable. I bought these Puma hi-tops thinking I was out of options, but what a difference these shoes have made. I am thrilled with the improvement, and I can play without the issues I had with the low tops. I am confident that I will be able to walk at least nine, and likely eighteen. These shoes are worth every penny, and I recommend them to anyone with foot and ankle issues.",
