Its body dimensions are almost the same as of previous 15\" model. With thinner bezels, its able to pack a 16\" screen. 2. Sound from the in-built speakers is a major step up from the previous generation. It is incredible how it cancels out vibrations from the woofers, giving you rich deep output, but surprisingly no vibrations in the laptop body. 3. Awesome new (actually old) MacBook keyboard :-)",

      "text": "I like the thin bezels around the screen which resulted in a much fuller view screen for work and multitasking. Although the new display looks great--the keyboard is a significant added change since it includes Apple's new magic keyboard. It is probably the best Mac keyboard ever released by the folks at Apple. Overall, this new MacBook is rather pricey, but there's a reason it is called \"Pro\" because it is designed for professional. With this laptop you're paying for performance in a portable package.",

After watching this screen, other laptop screens should not enter the eye, and I don't know whether it is a good thing or a bad thing.",
