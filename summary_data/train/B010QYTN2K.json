It was unbelievably annoying and this has completely solved the problem. I am very satisfied. Make sure to request the the SmartFeed Ramp from the PetNet website when your product arrives. It will add an incline to help the food reach the front of the bowl. I have recommended this product to many people :)",

Also, the food does not slide down the shoot, so eventually in gets jammed up and sends us an alert to clear the jam. This is because the shoot is made with very little slope to it, it's almost horizontal. I am returning the item.",

You can't associate multiple feeders with a single account so I had to go through the exhausting and buggy setup process twice. Overall, 3 phone calls with customer service later, I got it set up on two separate mobile phones. I mailed customer service about problems I was having, and they never even responded. Also, the feeder often get's stuck, and I have no idea that's happened. It doesn't give me confidence to leave my pets away. The user interface is incredibly confusing, and spends too much time asking for completely useless info.",

It stopped telling me when the food was low and would just alert me when my poor kitty wouldn't get fed a meal. It also lets me know when it powers off... the plus is my 14lb over weight cat now weight 11lbs and is very close to his ideal weight of 10lbs. It has taken almost a year to figure out a schedule and food to correct his weight.",

But it's not a good product - merely ok. Luckily, I've had no large pieces of rubber. But Having read those reviews, perhaps I'll stop using it. It's not reliable, the app is glitchy and slow, it has no features to allow for multiple cats, and the customer service is abysmal.",

Petnet will help you make intelligent decisions when it comes to your pet's food -- bringing you joy while keeping your pets healthy and happy. The SmartFeeder will help you manage feeding times, portion sizes, proper ingredients, and have your pet's food delivered right to your doorstep. \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\nControl your pet's feeding from your smartphone The Petnet App gives you peace of mind in the palm of your hand ensuring your pet is always being fed, no matter where you are. \n\nTake the guesswork out of feeding your pet SmartFeeder measures portions based on your pet's age, weight, and level of activity - so you can ensure your pet is eating the right amount of food every time. \n\n\nHealthy Portion SmartFeeder lets you set feeding times and programs itself to dispense your pet's ideal food portion, so you can put an end to overfeeding. \n\n\nProper Ingredients Choosing the right food for your pet can be confusing. SmartFeeder matches your pet with the ideal food recipe to ensure your pet is properly fed. \n\n\nFood Delivery SmartFeeder monitors how much food supply you have in your home and ships more when you're running low. \n\n\n\nPeace of Mind Our goal is to simplify your life by delivering your pet's ideal food directly to your doorstep. We'll help you make intelligent decisions when it comes to your pet's food -- bringing you joy while keeping your pets healthy and happy. \n\nAbout the Startup \nDescribe your product in 3 words.\n\nSmarter pet feeding.\n\nWhere did you get the inspiration for your product?\n\nPetnet was born out of our love for our pets and the passion for how best to improve their lives. SmartFeeder does this by providing proper and consistent nutrition that will have both immediate and long lasting effects to their health and wellbeing.\n\nWhat differentiates your product from similar products out there?\n\nThe SmartFeeder is truly \u201csmart.\u201d It uses sensors, learning software, the power of the cloud, the world\u2019s largest pet food database, and your smartphone to learn and understand your pet\u2019s nutritional needs. It then uses this information to match your pet to the perfect portion and ideal ingredients specific to your pet\u2019s age, weight, level of activity and breed. You can control the SmartFeeder from anywhere in the world. Using your smartphone, you can manage feeding times, portion sizes, food recipes, and receive notifications about feedings, battery life and much more. And of course, since everyone dreads going to the store to buy food, the SmartFeeder even has your pet\u2019s food delivered right to your doorstep.\n\nTell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process.\n\nThe most challenging part of the creation process was to truly understand the everyday problems pet owners face when feeding their pets and design a simple to use solution to address those problems. We discovered that this came down to three things: portion control, compatible ingredients, and food delivery. For most pet owners, it\u2019s nearly impossible to understand the food labels on a pet food bag and to then ensure that particular formula addresses your pet\u2019s nutritional needs. And of course, the age old question \u201chow much am I supposed to feed my pet?\u201d. The answers to these questions are not obvious and often take a lot of time and research to figure out. Our goal at Petnet was to design a feeder that addressed portion control specific to your pet, matched your pet with the right ingredients, and eliminated the hassle of having to run to the store to buy food. In the end, we reached our goal and simplified feeding for everyone.",
