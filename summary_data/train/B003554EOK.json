For now, very pleased. I'll update my review once I use them on my vacation in St. John next week. Also, for those who can't figure out what size to buy, I wear a shoe size of 6.5, and ordered the XS. Before doing so, I found this size chart on another site selling the bootie.",

I wore these in conjunction with Columbia water shoes - so they were always enclosed and protected. Disappointing as I really liked these socks for their fit and warmth. Unfortunately, these are out of warranty and not returnable. Shop around and look at other brands before - the longevity of these socks is questionable.",

You need wetsuit booties for support activities such as windsurfing, surfing, scuba diving, etc. Socks are great for protection from the fins and a little from the heel etc. So wetsuit booties or boots have some type of sole and more supportive traits. The socks are great for comfort in fins for swimming, snorkeling & body boarding. You would slip on a surf board. You get the idea. Amazon is great for searching for any product you would like.
