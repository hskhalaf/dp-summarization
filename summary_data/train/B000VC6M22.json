      "text": "I have had these for over a year. I use them daily for night\\day biking for anti glare / UV. The straight ear pieces go well over my helmet straps. They have stopped countless bugs, dust, hot winds, gravel, and the massive glare from new headlights. I intended on buying a 2nd pair, but my original is still going strong. The UV they block (mango color) is sufficient for average days in AZ, but start to struggle on high (13 extreme) UV days. They are awesome for my intended purpose, anti-glare - eye protection. I also feel they would work nicely in a florescence environment to put a soothing color over harsh lighting.",

I am going to buy more of these glasses they are stylish and offer moderate eye protection from not aso heavy things. I did notice powdered objects getting into my eyes at work they offer little protection from things coming up in under them when working with very fine particles. I will be gifting these around the holidays coming up to hunters shooters campers working people basically anyone who can use some cheap stylish eye protection.",

As soon as you start moving again, the fog goes away, so no big deal. Rain-x works well on them for wet weather.",

The anti-fog is really impressive. I keep messing around breathing on them because it's pretty cool.",
