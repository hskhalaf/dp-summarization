      "text": "Yeah, so I wanted SO bad to love this USB mixer, but after 7 hours of trying to get it to work with my PC, I just can't recommend it as a USB interface. It technically works, but the input is so low that the audio is unusable without heavily changing how your PC uses audio input (aka 3rd party programs). The preamps are great, but I needed a USB interface, so I guess I'll get a Mackie or Focusrite. If you want a good mixer for live applications or you have a Mac or Linux system (don't know, don't have 'em), I'm sure this would be awesome. Otherwise, I would say stay far, far away from this one.",

After checking, I noticed the transformer states 110V and not dual. This brand new mixer went up in smoke within seconds and we never got to check its functionality. I'm in the process of returning it. If you buy it for outside of US, please check the transformer for correct input voltage and don't rely on package or user manual.",

There is ZERO humming noise from the unit, the long throw faders are butter-smooth. This was never the case with the Behringer. I had this unit shipped to Zambia, in Africa, while in its original packaging from the Amazon Seller and nothing else, and it arrived safe with all the extras (XLR Cable etc) intact. Best Investment. The packaging was A-PLUS and the extras were very much appreciated!! Solid deal all round!",

I want to love this unit, really I do, but it drives me absolutely mad with how damn quiet the audio interface signal is. I bought this to line in hardware (Digitakt, Octatrack and Sp404) into my Ableton setup. Was really bummed out how much I have to boost the signal, whether RCA, XLR or TRS, to get anything over -6db. My gain staging is all over the place and the signals are way too hot once I can get them loud enough. Something to be aware of. Everything else is great, but the interface problem defeated my sole inspiration to incorporate the MX-10 into my rig.",

It saves a lot on cabling and (probably) has a better quality sound than analog I/O to a computer. Certainly seems good to me so far.

Its always nice to have the package of 4 XLR cables, and the 3.5 mm male to 2 1/4 inch males are great for connecting a phone or tablet. The MG12XU itself is great. The preamps sounds nice and clean. My mic is dynamic, which requires max gain from this thing. Even then, I hear little to no noise. The DAC is very loud, which is a bit of a double edged sword for those who use low impedence headphones, but it's nice and clear.",

I am in a metal band and the board handles everything great, the effects work flawlessly, and the recording quality is better than we had any reason to expect. Yamaha and Steinberg is a great combination, one I will surely be sticking with in all future endeavours.",

You can turn the level down all the way, but it's nicer to have the mute button with the ideal light that tells you which input channels are muted. The second thing that I dislike is that there's only a single FX send output. It's nice to have both an AUX send and FX send, like the Behringer products. After having purchased the MG10XU, I am considering returning it in favor of the Behringer X1204USB.",
