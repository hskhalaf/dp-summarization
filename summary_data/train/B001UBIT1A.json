      "text": "This is my 3rd Nikon D40. I have had the D80 and D7000. There are great features on all of them but the D40 will take great pics, is less expensive and very lightweight. Coupled with a fixed 35mm f1.8 lens this is a perfect camera for travel. You can always zoom or crop afterwards and be assured of great low light performance since the 6MP sensor is more sensitive than other cameras with more MP crammed in. For shooting active kids, the high 1/500 flash sync speed will stop action perfectly.",

Although I enjoy the bells and whistles on the 5000, I enjoy the feel of the D40 in my hand. It is part of me and takes wonderful pictures. I bought it second hand, as a back up, and to take on paddling trips, but it's my favorite.",

It had one thing I really missed from later Nikon cameras, 1/500th flash sync speed. I don't use it often, but missed it. So I picked up a used body for a good price and am not regretting it at all.",
