      "text": "I used for a camping trip in Alabama. A creek ran right near where we camped at. The filter performed great. The water was mostly clean to start with but was able to filter about 4 gallons before needing to clean the filter. I was able to do that right by the creek and start filtering again in about 5 minutes. Worked great. All together I filtered about 10 gallons during the trip. When the pump becomes difficult, field strip the filter and clean it. I suggest always keeping one bottle of purified water in reserve for cleaning the filter. You do not want to clean the filter with unpurified water because of contamination.",

The plastic body leaves me a little hesitant to state it feels solid, but it truly does regardless of the flex when pumping water. The design makes it seem relatively simple to replace the plastic part if it ever were broken, but i wouldn't go out of my way to try it. The actual internal mechanism is quite solid. It is a little heavy, but to be expected from a mostly metal filter that feels as reliable as this one.",

It is not the lightest out there if you're backpacking, but if you don't mind the extra ounces, I think they are worth it for the durability. I'd take this and just a handful of iodine tablets, rather than two lesser lighter filters (one as backup).",

      "text": "On deep mountain trails in the middle of july where the water spots were little more than mud holes this beauty came through where a gravity filter and another pump filter could not maintain. We did have to clean it frequently but three adults and seven youth survived the treck because of this beauty. It was a high adventure 50 mile hike, shoes gave out, feet gave out but this filter trucked all the way throuh and was ready for the next treck. This product is for serious people in serious situations, I bought one for my brothers, sisters and parents for their year supply and 72 hour kit, that is how sure I am of this product.",

I run an orphanage in Kyrgyzstan and we take our children to the mountains. There we must filter our own water. The mountain streams look clear but they are not! We have had children get sick after using other filters but our Katadyn filter has worked great for us. I would buy another one if something were to happen to this one. Very happy!",

Comes with a carrying case , scotch bright pad to clean the ceramic filter , lubricant for the orings a plastic bag to keep the inlet hose separated from the rest of the clean parts . And a filter gauge to let you know when you have to replace the filter . The filtered water does have a taste to it as all ceramic filters seem to have. It works very well . I gave it 4 stars because of the price and the price of the replacement filter also the ceramic taste to the filtered water.",

    "title": "Katadyn Pocket Water Filter, Long Lasting for Personal or Small Group Camping, Backpacking or Emergency Preparedness",
    "description": "For over 30 years, the Katadyn Pocket Microfilter has been the top choice water filter for emergency preparedness, professional-use and militaries globally. Engineered with the highest quality construction; it can handle the most rugged conditions. The 0.2 micron silver-impregnated ceramic filter element can lasts an impressive 50,000 liter, depending on water quality.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWater treatment products are in high demand for outdoor enthusiasts, international travelers, and relief agencies. Few are better for long-lasting continuous use, however, than the Katadyn Pocket water microfilter. Made of heavy-duty materials, the Pocket features a silver-impregnated ceramic element that's effective against bacteria and protozoa even in extreme conditions. Unlike disposable filters, the ceramic element can be cleaned several times, even in the field. More importantly, the element filters all microorganisms larger than 0.2 microns (0.0002mm), producing clear, drinkable water no matter where in the world you are. The pump also includes an improved, round pump handle for better ergonomics and an outlet hose that attaches to water containers with a single clip. \n\n The Pocket hails from Katadyn's Endurance series, a high-quality line of filters that produce up to 100 times more water than standard water filters. The Pocket is so tough, in fact, that it's the first choice for extreme adventurers like Mike Horn. Plus, it's the only water filter with a 20-year warranty. Other features include a measuring gauge that indicates when you should change the filtering element, a cushioned base that makes it easy to pump on all surfaces, a prefilter, and a carrying bag. \n\n Why Water Filtration Is Important\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) attributes 80 percent of all travel diseases to contaminated drinking water. Drinking water contains three groups of pathogenic microorganisms: viruses, such as hepatitis A, Norwalk virus, or poliovirus; bacteria, like e-coli, salmonella, and cholera; and protozoans, such as giardia and cryptosporidium. Tap water and ice cubes are usually the culprits when traveling, but even bottled water can be questionable. The backcountry is also a source of waterborne illness. A pristine stream may be safe one day and contaminated the next, as microorganisms stemming from human and animal waste are typically spread by rain and runoff. As a result, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends treating water from every source in the backcountry. \n\n Specifications:\n\n * Usage: 1 to 4 people \n * Capacity: 13,000 gallons \n * Dimensions: 2.4 by 10 inches \n * Output: 1 quart per minute \n * Technology: 0.2-micron ceramic depth filter (cleanable) \n * Weight: 20 ounces \n\nAbout Katadyn\nThe Switzerland-based Katadyn has been producing high-quality portable water systems since 1928. Katadyn products are used by militaries, health organizations, and outdoor adventurers worldwide, making it the global leader in portable water treatment. With subsidiaries in the U.S., Germany, France, and Singapore, Katadyn products are used wherever safe drinking water isn't available, whether for travel, camping, or humanitarian applications.",
