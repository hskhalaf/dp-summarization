My environment: Old house (1924) with old plaster wall, normally challenging for WiFi. Dual band 2.4/5.0 helps a lot. Family of 5, adults and college students, typically 10-15 WiFi devices active at any given time - 5+ mobile phones, Amazon Echo, wireless printer, Sony PS4, 1 smart TV, 2 smart watches, etc. Positioned in center of house. Hard wired to smart TV for video streaming. No WiFi repeaters or bridges needed. Good coverage throughout house. Very happy with AC2300, Definitely Recommend!",

The signal was spotty at best, was often disappearing, and I couldn't even get a decent signal on the second floor of my 1700 square foot house. Also, for months I've been blaming my internet provider for only giving me 20 Mbps of the 40 Mbps I've been paying for. Turns out, I've been yelling at the wrong people. This router booms throughout my house and I get all 40 of my speed. Getting to control it with the Tether app is nice as well. This is a solid investment for your home Wifi set up.",

Insurance offered by Amazon and of course the router has a 2 yr warranty. The insurance turned out to be a joke as they wouldn't do anything until the Mfg responded because it was under their warranty. Problem the Mfgr couldn't be found by either me or Amazon. Bottom line, the router worked well until it failed, however, don't expect the 2 yr Mfg warranty to be worth anything. As to the insurance, stay away from it, it's a joke!",

Direct quote from support \"Yes for this router you can connect up to 32 devices \" Apparently it is a hardware limit so flashing the firmware won't help. Of course there is no way of knowing this when you buy the router. Now I have to find another solution and I've had this device too long to return it. What a waste of $$$.",
