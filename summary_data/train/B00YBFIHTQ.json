After wearing them for a week, they definitely have much better support than my previous sneakers. (That's why I bought them, supposed they are a 'top 10 support shoe for women') They sometimes make my feet sore across the top; loosening the laces have helped somewhat. My feet still ache some by the end of the day, but these shoes are definitely a huge improvement. I am now highly doubtful I will ever find a shoe I can stand in at work that will keep my feet pain free....",
