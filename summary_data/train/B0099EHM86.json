Nothing I've tried has helped very much and that includes the sulfur based products, ketocanozole Nizoral, etc. I've been using this almost daily for a month now and my scalp is doing better than it ever had other than when I was in the army and had no hair. This stuff works wonders and I highly recommend it. Believe me, I know the embarrassment of dandruff, and the flakes as well as that intense burning and itching that comes with the dermatitis. This stuff helps, at least in my case, immensely. I highly recommend it. Take care.",

I am an African-American woman with very curly hair and the medicated prescription shampoo my dermatologist prescribed worked for scalp health, but was too drying for my hair. This shampoo totallly impresses me by removing dry scalp gently, cleaning and conditioning my hair well, AND it smells wonderful! I tried the conditioner also, and it\u2019s nice. But, the shampoo works on it\u2019s own to clean and condition. Get the conditioner if you want a cute gift set for someone. It\u2019s a nice extra, but the shampoo really can work solo. I have been using the shampoo for 4 months.",

I wasn't expecting a miracle, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the shampoo really did help. Like anything, it took a few uses, maybe about a month or so before I noticed a difference but it was enough for me to order more and continue using this product.",

And I pair it with a different branded, super moisturizing conditioner. The scent is exactly what you think it will be lol, medicinal but fresh...like tea tree oil which I find pleasant. Bottle is somewhat small for the price, but a little goes a long way, and since I'm not using everyday should last me awhile. Generally, I like the super clean, detox effect it has on my scalp. Will buy again.",

First, the pleasant tea tree scent, not overpowering. Then the lather is nice, and what I really liked was the clean feel from the rinse, leaving my hair feeling super clean and soft. This is definitely going to stay on my list. Thanks for a nice product !",

      "text": "It's a nice shampoo. Has a good smell and makes your hair feel super clean. However, I got this specifically to work on my dry scalp/dandruff and I have yet to see much of a difference. You also have to use quite a bit of product to get it to spread through your hair. Then they recommend washing a couple of times, so you can go through the small bottle pretty quickly. Final conclusion: nice shampoo for a good clarifying hair wash, but not great for dry scalp/itch relief/dandruff prevention. Wouldn't purchase again for the price.",
