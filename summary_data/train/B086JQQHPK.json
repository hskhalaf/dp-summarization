It melts plastic consistently and it could not be easier to use. It charges quickly enough via USB as well. The addition of a small project book with templates and a plastic sheet to \"trace\" onto is also appreciated! You are only limited by your imagination in terms of what you can create with a 3D pen but having a mental springboard and examples of what can be done is great.",
