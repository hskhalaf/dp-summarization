      "text": "Although this hammer is stainless steel, it is NOT a solid stainless steel head but rather a 3 piece stamped stainless steel head that\u2019s weighted with something that rattles around on the inside. The issue with this design is that there are gaps in the hammer head that meat/liquids get into and can pose a sanitation hazard. Poor design, in my opinion. After further research, it appears that Cave Tools is Re-branding a mass produced cheap design and throwing a silicone sleeve on the handle. Disappointing. I would not have purchased this product if I paid more attention to the design.",

However, had to give it 3 stars for several substantive reasons: The handle is clearly not long enough to be superior not is its circumference adequate. When testing it - bc handle is not long enough --- the \"U\" hook at the end dug into the hand causing considerable discomfort & a bit of bruise. Not quite ergonomic enough also. A good design can be great with a more length, a wider grip (handle circumference) & ALSO -- make the prongs/rivets protrude (stick out) considerably more. That would make it superior vs ok.",

None of those round disc's with a vertical handle for me! the hammer/mallet configuration lends itself to a 'natural' pounding motion that all are familiar with. The silicone handle cover seems fine and there are no issues IMHO with flaking/peeling. The nubs on the one side of the mallet are great for slippery surfaces (chicken breasts, etc.) and don't trash the flesh while in the process of flattening the material. The quality and finish of the mallet is first-rate. Finally, I love the fact that you can toss it (carefully) into the dishwasher!",
