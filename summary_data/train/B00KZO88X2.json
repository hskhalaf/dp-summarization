I was surprised as it even included the minor foramens and lines that most other models neglect to have. This is not only a great learning tool but and awesome office model. The skull detaches for closer instruction as well. The wheels are a little cheep but it allows you to roll it smoothly over hard wood floors. Overall five stars and highly recommend for the student or professional!",

Holes were punctured on both ends, with one of the poles sticking out approximately 2 inches, still covered in bubble wrap. The box was standing on end instead of flat, as indicated on the box. None of the pieces were damaged. I am looking forward to labeling it.",
