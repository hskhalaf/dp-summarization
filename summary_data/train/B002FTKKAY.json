      "text": "1. This is not triview mirror as all 3 mirrors open on the same side. But it became clear only after the cabinet was on the wall. 2. The mirrors are very fragile , and to open a door you have to press the mirror itself so you leave a mark on it - very annoying. 3. The room inside is very small. It's literally a \"medicine\" cabinet because even a bottle of shampoo or conditioner doesn't fit in.",

It was a bit more difficult to install than I had expected, but it came out fine. The storage capacity is also fine for my needs. I suspect that new homes and younger homeowners may want something a bit different, but I am completely happy with my choice and definitely would recommend. My recommendation missed five stars because it of the little bit more difficult installation.",

I installed it by myself using the ample packaging material to hold up the cabinet while I fastened it to the bathroom wall. The wall did not have an electrical box so instead I wired it to a corded plug and then plugged it into a switched outlet right under the cabinet. The doors and lights worked flawlessly, there are no blemishes. There seems to be ample room inside the cabinet for everything I need.",

Unfortunately, the directions are horrible and we hit a major \"snag\" after cabinet was installed on bathroom wall. My medicine cabinet has 4 sockets for 4 bulbs, but hardware and wiring were totally missing in socket #2. This let's you know that \"quality control\" at the factory was non-existent or very, very poor! Instead of returning, we had to make a trip to Lowe's and purchase replacement socket and wiring kit (without electrical background this would have been a big nightmare).",

ONLY thing I would change (and there are easy fixes for this, like a decal on the corner of each door, or glass etching a design with etching cream you can buy at any hobby shop), you have to touch the corner of the door to open it, so there are always smudges on the mirrors in the bottom corners....",
