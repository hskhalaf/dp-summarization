Very thin \"leather\" as you can see especially on the face in my picture, that is, if they are even real leather any more! Stitch quality is much lower. They look like a cheap imitation of what's listed on Amazon, but I sent my pics to Ringside and they said they looked authentic. I guess some companies try to substitute an inferior product and hope people will still buy them because of their old reputation! What a disappointment!",

They've broken in well but aren't torn up after over a year of use.
