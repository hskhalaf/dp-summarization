The quality of this map when it came was really cheap as the paper was a bit ripped and then folks having to write on top said it was not so great. I am giving it 3 stars b/c originally it looks really cool if you write with a strong sharpee but after that, if you want to use anything else like markers or pens-- it didn't work well. It also bleeds to the other side. So get it if you want a simple map to hang in your place, but nothing else",
