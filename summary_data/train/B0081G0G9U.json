I am also going to fasten a rope to it down the other side of the roof to be sure it doesn't come off the roof.",

It appears to be made out of the same kind of steel that the Japanese used to make toy soldiers out of. I threw this piece of crap out and made my own. I am so sick and tired of companies that go out of their way to cheat people rather than offering a decent product at a reasonable price.",

It seems to me there would be more secure options out there. This device isn't securely fastened to the ladder allowing it to slide from one side to the other. The seller is good - delivered promptly and accepted the return.",
