I charged it for three days before putting it up, and the only difficulty I had was that it puts out so much power that it was jumping the length of my wire mounts and arcing to the steel fence posts. I did some adjusting and a little extra insulating, and now it appears to be working great.",

Even when weeds grow up touching the line, it still functions. if I can offer advice I'd give you 2 things. First get the biggest grounding rods you can get in the ground. Second place some strips of aluminum foil folded in half over the top wire (like a 4-6\" piece) then smear a little peanut butter or bacon grease on the foil. This will help train the local dear population. Never an issue with this charger, and the battery lasted almost 5 years.",

We installed ours on a 4x4 post anchored in cement (the box is very heavy, much heavier than we expected). We used 3 6ft grounding rods connected by copper wire, and our fence meter says it is working within optimal range. Be sure to open up the protective box and ensure all of the wires are connected, as ours weren't!!!",
