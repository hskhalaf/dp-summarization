The idea is good, but it needs more engineering. If the unit is wet enough to clean, it won't climb- just slips. If it's dry enough to climb, it won't clean. So disappointed... :(",

Very light for its size. If the power goes out, its internal battery keeps it stuck to the glass long enough to be safely removed. Still, this robot is not like the floor ones. It should always be used under adult supervision. Especially if it's outside. Worth Buying replacement Pads. Highly recommended!",

It only takes 4-5 sprays to the bottom pad to clean most windows without getting water all over. It takes about 30 minutes for each 4'x8' panel. I already have friends who want one.

      "text": "I placed the Gecko near the bottom of the window. It climbed to the top and cleaned the entire window including the corners. I used a mist spray of Zep window cleaner. Whatever issues that they had in the past they seem to have fixed them. I did all of the sliders while watching tv. I\u2019m really happy with the good supply of pads too. I also cleaned the outside glass table and it along with the windows looks great and decidedly better then any other method I\u2019ve tried. Very happy with this product!",
