The teddy bear cover is just as cute as the pictures seem, and it works well to both protect you from being burned by direct contact with the bottle, and helps it retain heat longer (I put this at the foot of my bed to warm it up before I get in during the winter). Great purchase, and it\u2019s nice that the cover can be reused when the bottle eventually breaks down.",
