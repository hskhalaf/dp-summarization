Very comfortable.. fluffy fur throughout! VERY CUTE with leggings or snow pants and great traction. Also very warm in temps below zero. Shipping wasn't that great:/. Took them two weeks just to ship because they were a specialty item. Oh'well, worth the wait!!!! Love them.. Thank you!!",

Up to 30mins in cold is when they usually start to feel really cold and have to wiggle and start getting really uncomfortable after a while. Yes I tighten the top and double my already thick socks. Guess the cold air seeps inside from the rubber. That's my only big downfall with them sadly specially if work outside and stand for hours in cold. -Janelle",

The elastic tie mechanism in the front doesn't effectively cinch closed, so these boots don't really secure to your foot, resulting in the boots (which are heavy at baseline) slipping off the heel with every step. There's no loop/tag at the back to grip on when pulling these boots on. The liner on the bottom has come loose so it wrinkles under my sole. I wish I'd spent a few more dollars and just got a pair of Sorels.",

I think these can last another season, though may buy a second pair just to stock up. I definitely recommend them over Columbia. :)",

I haven't been outside in the cold yet. But they are made with 200 g, 3M Thinsulate insulation. According to the tag these boots can handle up to -40C and -40F.",

I removed the footbeds from the boots and replaced them with my own arch supports. So not only are they comfortable bit I also don't have to worry about my feet or back being destroyed. I also bought a pair of Kamik rain boots this year and they are awesome as well, so I'm thinking Kamik is now my go-to brand for semi-affordable footwear!",
