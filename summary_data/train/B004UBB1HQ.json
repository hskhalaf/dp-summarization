There are quite a few advanced settings that you might want to have a close look at and play with to get your own preferences for this app, some are a bit hidden away but having these advanced settings is amazing. I set the App to use my NAS server to sync the comics over and automatically download the new comics to the tablet which is something a lot of other apps miss, it's also possible to link to some cloud storage.",
