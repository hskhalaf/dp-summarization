You do need some common sense when building it, and if you have that then you should be able to build it. The build doesn't seem super sturdy after making it, but its holding up just fine for now. Will edit this if it does break. Another thing is that there are no extra screws/parts, so don't lose any of it! It came with the screws for my TCL 65 in 6 series tv which I was very happy about.",

I am stuck with the tv stand because I don\u2019t have a box to send it back with. I had to open the box in a way that the box Cohen not be saved. Please don\u2019t buy this if your tv is 55\u201d.

All items were properly marked to conduct a good inventory. Instructions for this manufacturer are all photos, pretty easy to follow. A couple of steps seemed a bit out of order as far as accessing the screws, but nothing major. Ideal for corners. Total assembly with 42\" tv mounted comes to my neck (I'm 5'7\"). Glass shelf is sturdy enough after simple installation for Verizon Fios Cable box, newer thinner DVD player and XBox 360 console. You can easily hide the cables behind the stand.",

I am fairly savvy when it comes to assembling furniture but it took me and my husband nearly 5 hours to actually get it all assembled and the tv mounted. So buyer beware.",

Another thing that is a huge thing to me is it moves easily on the floor. My old unit would not move at all. This is a thing because our dogs are always loosing toys behind or on the old unit under and I\u2019d have to move it to clean it out.",

This thing does take a while to put together, so plan on spending 3-6 hours with it. Instructions aren't terrible, and if you have IKEA like experience you should be fine. Only minor complaint was that the mounting screws didn't fit my TV. However, at the price I can't expect them to include every possible variation.",
