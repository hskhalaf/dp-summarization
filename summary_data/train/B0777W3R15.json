Most stores only carry the smaller Kind bar, This one seems much more satisfying. I have been following the Metabolic research diet but cannot eat many of their products bcuz they have soy in them and I am allergic to soy.. my reaction to soy is hunger\ud83d\ude41. The Kind bars also have soy but it doesn\u2019t make me hungry. Anyway, it seems to work with me and I\u2019ve lost 39#\u2019s in the last 18 months!",

They have a PB coating only on the bottom and drizzles on the top. I wish they'd make it Subscribe and Save, because I will be getting them often. You should at least try them.
