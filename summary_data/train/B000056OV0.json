I did purchase the yellow baby bath sponge for additional support. My only con was that i was unable to use this tub over the sink like the other baby tubs - i use it on the bed for now because I'm recovering from a c section and bending over a tub is too strenous.",

Also want to highlight that the Primo bath is made in the USA, another reason I choose this product as I want to support our country's economy (and no I am not political).",

The grooves on the side are wide enough for you to get where you need to but tight enough that the baby can\u2019t roll to the side. The recline was so much better for washing her hair as well.

One side for your laying down, small baby, and the other for your sitting-up baby. The only real complaint is that the side where baby lays down is hard on her head. When baby starts moving around, the hard plastic, the curves in that area, hurt her. We've taken to putting a folded towel under her head so the hard plastic doesn't hurt her when she's wiggling around. Otherwise, like I said, it's great. It fits in nicely next to our cabinet or we just leave it in the tub to try, only taking it out when needed.",

      "text": "I'm so glad to find a baby bath tub large enough for my baby to have play room. Unlike the other ones on the market, which holds the baby but leave no room for toys and play, this tub offers two sitting positions and it's wide enough so I can easily move my baby from one side to the other in the water. It's great for babies 6 months and up. Thumbs up!",

Our little guy is allergic to lots of soaps, so having this I don\u2019t feel like I have to clean the shower the rest of us use every single day before he gets his bath. Love it - worth every penny!

Also, the plug to drain the tub is within baby grabbing reach and because it's black it really stands out in a white tub - it proves irresistible to the baby.
