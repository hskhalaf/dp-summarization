Clean, bright white, soft cotton, and completely wrinkle-free after washing. My afghans have never had such spiffy storage. I plan to buy more and will use some on actual pillows, not just for blanket storage.",

      "author": "wrj, Owings Mills, MD   This is an addendum to an earlier review of my recent purchase of the All-Clad stainless steel kettle.  I've noticed there are several negative comments about this kettle, such as white flecks in the water, to a filmy discoloration on the interior of the kettle.  After daily use, my interior is as shiny as when I first bought it.  One thing though, I use bottled water.  I find that I don't get like scale on my pots, this kettle, my clothes iron or my drip coffeemaker.  I'm thinking that the reported white flecks in poured water could be that scale flaking off the inside surface. Distilled white vinegar can help eliminate limescale buildup.  As for residue on the outside, I remove my kettle from the stove before frying/sauteeing to avoid free radicals from settling on my kettle. Just a thought. ",
