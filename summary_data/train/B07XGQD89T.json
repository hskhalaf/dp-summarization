      "verdict": "The classic SK8-Hi silhouette receives a couple of upgrades in the form of the Vans SK8-Hi Pro, which aims for longevity and enhanced performance on the board. As its name implies, this model's improvements are based on the demanding sport of pro skateboarding that involves repeated stress and blows when perfecting a trick.\u00a0This kick now incorporates the brand's Ultracush HD insole and Duracap underlays for enhanced comfort, impact protection and durability \u2013 two essential features that the original version seemed to lack.",
      "pros": [
        "A lot of shoe users appreciate the lightweight comfort of the Vans SK8-Hi Pro despite its high-top profile",
        "Most wearers admire the kick's high silhouette as it provides ankle protection and support especially when skateboarding",
        "Some people use this kick for skateboarding, BMX riding, and longboarding due to the outsole's excellent grip on pedals and board grip tapes",
        "Majority of the purchasers are pleasantly surprised with the addition of the Ultracush HD insole as it provides an enhanced in-step comfort",
        "A significant number of loyal Sk8-Hi fans express their fondness with the classic Vans kick and added that it has grown with them and suited them no matter their age",
        "A number of skaters and casual users of the shoe notice the pair's more durable construction thanks to the Duracap underlays added to this Pro model",
        "A higher number of consumers share that the shoe fits as expected",
        "An overwhelming majority of reviewers applaud the pair's stylishly classic design",
        "Some fashion-savvy customers like how easy the pair is to match with a multitude of casual ensembles",
        "Offered at $70 a pair, the Vans Sk8-Hi Pro costs a couple of bucks more than the non-Pro version, which some buyers deemed to be worth it as this model offers enhanced comfort and durability, and remains relatively cheap when compared to other sneakers"

I really love these Vans, because they're extremely comfortable, light and much slouchier than other Vans which can feel quite heavy and restricting due to them being made for skateboarding! I'm sure these would also be great for skateboarding too, as long as you're experienced! The color of these were exactly what I wanted and I love the \"Vans Off The Wall\" logo on these, it looks very sweet!! The sizing on these is perfect also. Will definitely be buying more of these in different colors, an awesome shoe for us Ladies!",

Really?! C'mon! Honestly sometimes I actually think she just wants me to get beaten up at school.
