      "text": "This product really works great on my MacBook Pro 13\". It doesn't slide around, or make the keys hard to use. Also, it really seals the keyboard from dust. I LOVE the color, as it is very bright and cheerful. However, in several places, little specks of color are missing, or an opposite color has been splashed on a key. Furthermore, the 'caps lock' button does NOT line up with the indicator light. Therefore, you cannot tell whether caps lock is on or not. For the most part though, it is a nice cover. I would buy it again, because of the pricing and functionality.",

I'm basically a touch typist, but still it's nice to see the lettering on the keys. While the yellow allowed the letters printed on the rubber to be seen, the dark colors did not. It was miserable. After five days, I exchanged it with Amazon for a yellow one and boom, I can see what I'm doing again. Nice fit on the keyboard of a 2015 MacBook Pro. I like that it prevents key wear.",

And it fits well, like a moshi keyboard cover I've had- but there are two things I don't like about it- It completely covers the entire top part of the key, so this means that you can't see the caps light on at all when you are using it. Likewise, because the letters aren't clear, it completely blocks any of the keyboard light that is standard on the macbook pro. If using the computer in the dark, having those lights can be a big help, and this cover would block all of that. Overall, very colorful and pretty, but would like them to fix at least the caps lock light.",

My other one I bought at the Apple store, and it's perfect, but was $25. This one is more opaque, colors are vibrant. But the space bar edge is warped. Kind of annoying, doesn't affect the use of it though.",

The buttons are colored, but the rest of the skin is clear, unlike many of the solid-colored ones, and that gives it a neater appearance. The fit is pretty much perfect on the alpha-numeric and function keys, but I took away one star because the fit isn't quite as tight over the space bar as it is everywhere else. It doesn't affect performance, but you can see it.",

      "text": "I just received by rainbow silicone cover skin for my mac. The delivery was very speedy and I appreciate that very much. I absolutely love the design, it's amazing, but the skin is very very thin, which doesn't sit the best over the keys. it kinda has gaps or hills and doesn't all the way lay flat. I have ordered other inexpensive ones that were a little bit thicker but hey for $6 including shipping you get what you pay for... overall I love it so far just wish it was thicker to protect better.",

Do not use my Mac Book out in public much, but when I do, more people want to find out what I did to the keyboard. Heck, I even got some sign-ups to join in my down line in GVO \u201cMeetCheap Conference rooms.",

One drawback, the keyboard lights don't shine through, so when she's looking for a key in the dark she has difficulty.",

However, you should be aware that the backlight does not shine through the letters, as the letters on the cover are black. There is still slight luminescence around the border of the keys, though. I have had this cover on my laptop since Christmas and none of the paint or letters have rubbed off even with everyday use. I love this product and would definitely recommend purchasing it.",

It would have been nice to pay a little less for shipping (since it costs only cents to send, in a larger flat envelope), but that's my only complaint.",
