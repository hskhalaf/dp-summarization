Once you go up past a 7 inch blade the prices jump quite a bit and the pork bellies are about 10 inches and I like full cuts. They also can tear up the pork belly. This is a Hempler center cut bacon slab which is much denser than the pork belly after smoking and it cut through this like butter! Tried some tomatoes and other items and I\u2019m so glad I went this route! So bacon buddies out there this is a great knife for slicing up your pork bellies!!!",

The handle is made of a material that prevents your hand from slipping which is really nice. I purchased this knife upon Cooks Illustrated recommended and they were right.",

    "description": "Style Name:12-Inch Granton| Design:KnifeA TRUSTED FAVORITE\nPreferred by both home chefs and culinary professionals, the 12\" Victorinox Fibrox Pro Slicing Knife can handle nearly every kitchen task imaginable. Crafted with a comfortable handle, superior weight and balance, and a razor sharp Granton Blade that rarely requires re-sharpening, this knife is an essential tool for every kitchen.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n\n *  High-quality, lightweight European steel.\n *  Handle design reduces hand and wrist fatigue.\n *  Fit for slicing both firm and soft meats. \n *  Long, straight blade for maximized cutting performance.\n *  Granton Blade to minimize friction and prevent food from sticking.\n *  Non-slip patented Fibrox Pro handle for a secure and comfortable grip no matter the hand size. \n *  National Sanitary Foundation (NSF) approved and dishwasher safe. \n\n\nCARE AND USE\nBe good to your knives and they\u2019ll be good to you. Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife! \n\nCLEANING\nVictorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately. \nWhile Fibrox Pro knives are dishwasher safe, we recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.\n\nSHARPENING\nFor optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent use of a honing steel will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best. \n\nFORMERLY FORSCHNER\nIn 1937 Victorinox began selling cutlery in America through a Connecticut distributor called R.H. Forschner & Co. A well-known manufacturer of butcher scales, Forschner soon became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Victorinox knives, and was the name by which Victorinox knives were known.",
