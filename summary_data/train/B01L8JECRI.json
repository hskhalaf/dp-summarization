I filled them COMPLETELY with ice, then filled them up to around the 2.5l mark with water, and the water would STAY COLD all day long! Even after refilling with water along the way! There was still ice in the pouches in the evening when I dumped them out. So refreshing to have ice cold water during a long hot hike.",

Snacks, extra clothing, keys, phone ... it will hold it all comfortably. The pack also seems to keep the water cool in hot weather. I often end my hikes with ice cubes still in the reservoir. My only wish this pack was supplied with an insulated tube, since the tube heats the water quickly in the summer months. The water tastes so much better when it\u2019s cold - the hotter the weather, the more ice goes it. I\u2019m investing in the insulated tube for this reason.",

It's really just a matter of righty-tighty lefty-loosey. Weight distribution is awesome, pockets are awesome, i'm 5'11 and it sits very nicely on my back. I have only stress tested the bladder and taken the bag on a short run to test the weight distribution. I will be using the pack for 72 hours straight in the coming weeks and will update then. For now, 5 stars all the way. Excellent material too.",
