It's hefty, and looks menacing, like something the A-Team would strap to their van wall. It cuts pretty good. I only used it to cut a light weight swing set chain, and it/I did so with only a slight grunt. Well worth the price, and a good thing to have around as one of those \"I wish we had a bolt cutter...oh wait we do!\" items.",

Forged of heat treated, hardened Chrome-Molybdenum steel, the jaws resist damage and dents as they bite through the toughest applications. Blade clearance is factory set, but is easily adjusted by turning the two eccentric bolts at the tool's head. The textured grips are easy on hands and angled at their ends to maximize leverage. Finally, the satin finish of the blades provide an attractive contrast to the black matte finish of the handles.",
