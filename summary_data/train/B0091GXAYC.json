When it came time to buy a new one, I bought the same model. It grinds fresh beans (and can also use ground coffee) and drips the coffee through a gold filter into an attractive container for serving. I can make from 2 to 12 cups of coffee at a time with three different strength settings to choose from. My husband and I generally keep it set on \"medium\". When our nephew visits, he pushes the button to \"strong\". The coffee is delicious either way.",

Save your receipt. You will need it. Still, with all that, I still recommend it and will buy another when the time comes.",

Lastly the water reservoir is so small I spill water all over my counter every morning. I should have re-purchased the Cappresso machine I had in the past. :( Live and learn",

It grinds well, allows a wide range of cup selections and choice of strength. There\u2019s a little extra clean up as the ground beans are dumped into the filter through a lid covering the filter, but removal and a quick rinse is easy. I haven\u2019t yet needed to clean the grinder so I don\u2019t know if that will be a pain but I don\u2019t imagine having to do it once a month will be too big a burden. Overall very good coffee maker that grinds and brews all in one. Great idea.",
