I purchased these to cover up the original pillows on my sectional, which were getting threadbare and dingy. They look quite nice mixed together, and seem to be of a nice quality fabric. Hoping that they will wear well. Shipping was amazingly fast, I would definitely do business with this seller again. I am submitting pictures of these covers.

Two things I should mention: the color green is a bit more yellow than shown in the picture, and the cover is a bit generous in its fit. It fits the standard 12 x 18 pillow but is a bit loose. So if you like your pillows stuffed you will have to add padding around the pillow. Since I am using these as a declaration on my couch, I really don't mind the loose fit. I also purchased them in the pale orange shade and they are just as gorgeous.",

The king size comforter set came with only two Euro Shams and I needed another one to fill up the space in the last row (closest to the head board). I was not able to find the exact match but this one complimented the other two shams and they all look so pretty together. As for the material it seems top notch. The zipper is hidden which makes it look even prettier.",
