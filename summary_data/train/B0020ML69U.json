      "text": "Made in Germany, great....but less than a year problems happened. Hammer hit but not turning on hammer drill mode, have to switch it back and forth to get it engages and when I use the drill for more than 5 minutes to drill some hole onto the concrete then sound like the clutch was stripped....now only use it as the scraper or chisel. My last Bosch last for 15 years, I would expect with technology this day it must improve to this newer version but it\u2019s not. Be careful guys. I\u2019m a contractor and building homes for over 25 years. I have encountered with many brand name tools... Bosch tools wasn\u2019t use to be anymore.",

      "text": "This is a replacement for an old Milwaulkee spline rotary hammer. It has plenty of power, lightweight, and changing bits is very easy. I like the soft start, and the fact that you can rotate the position of the bit. The anti-vibration handle makes it comfortable to use. All controls are easy to access and the cord is a good workable length. In hammering mode the switch locks on so you don't have to hold it. I Would definetly reccomend this tool. I also purchased the spline shank to SDS adapter so I can use either type bit. Shipping time was fast.",
