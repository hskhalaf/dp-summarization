Along with beginners, experienced JAVA programmers, or programmers coming back to Java after a few years away may also find this volume useful, along with the \"Complete Guide\". I fall into the latter category, and found it to be a good refresher of the language and a good introduction to the latest version of the SDK. It provides a lot of \"Hey, I remember this from a previous version\" type Q&A dialogs that help explain what has changed, and why. A great learning and reference tool.",
