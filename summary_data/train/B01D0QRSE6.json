I typically wear an 8 in regular shoes, a 7.5 in the Toms classic canvas (as they stretch so much, which is fair), and an 8 in the other Toms I've owned (Desert Wedge, etc). So I had my boyfriend order an 8 in these cute sandals. They're definitely too small. I just wore them around the house to test them out, but already the straps were rubbing me on the ankle, and my toes were pretty much hitting the front edge. They're going back.",
