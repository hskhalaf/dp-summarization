However, I'll tell you that the one thing I really don't like is that the back does not go high enough to rest your head; I think that is the true reason why it feels awkward to sit \"back\" on it as if to try and relax for a long time.",

I love that it folds up vs the square beach chairs but for the weight it's not worth it to me. Other than the weight the chair is made very well, sturdy. Easy to fold and get back into the bag. Very comfortable to sit in and love it for low tide at the beach. Only used once so not sure if it's rusts easy. Will update when if it rusts.",

I'm 6'1\" and 220lbs, gf is 5'9\" and 150lbs. We went camping in Zion National Park and it was hot but we only used them at night when the temperature had cooled off. The plastic piece on the back of the chair where the top cross-bar meets the armrest warped on both chairs to the point that both became unusable. You might have better luck in cold weather but I highly recommend staying away from this if you plan on using them in warm weather.",

It is great for relaxing/reading but if you want to keep getting up a taller chair would be a better choice.

It comes w a drawstring carrying bag, and when packed it's an agreeable size and weight to carry along. I'll use this for beach, festivals, camping, and on the porch. I like the design details like the feet and the padded armrests. Wish there were more colors to choose from. :)",

Even though the correct carrying weight is listed, it is still surprisingly fairly heavy -- but of course that means it will hold up to a heavy person sitting in it with long-term use. Worth the weight to me because of the high quality. Reminder, if you have a bad back or knees, it can be difficult to get out of. Worth a carry to the beach! I really like mine and will have it for years!",

My only complaint is, I wish the strap on the carrying bag was longer so I could sling it over my head for hands free carrying. As it is now, it's so short it just slips off the shoulder so I'm constantly fixing it. I will invent a way to make it longer.",

I wouldn't mind a cup holder somewhere or a pouch, but it is designed to be simple. If you have trouble getting up from low places, don't get this. Otherwise, I would highly recommend it.
