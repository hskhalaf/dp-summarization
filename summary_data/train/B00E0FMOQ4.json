I thought the customer service left a lot to be desired. The whole time I owned my original Worx I never had the string break or not feed.",

You have to constantly (like every 5-10 seconds) start and stop the trigger to get the line to feed. I end up having to manually re-feed the spool a few times every time I use it. The metal bump guard at the front makes it very difficult to trim near a fence and get all the grass. Ultimately, I end up going back to my cheap Black & Decker trimmer vs. this one.

This wonder of workmanship weighed little, which wrapped up the workload without undue weariness.

The battery life is excellent on the 32v. I can weedeat around my 8 fruit/oak trees, sidewalks, and flowerbed boarders on a full charge with a bit of charge leftover, but I usually recharge to do the entire fence line on my half acre yard. Im sure I could do the whole thing on one charge if I had the 48v battery.",

    "description": "The cordless WORX 32-volt Lithium MAX Powered Grass Trimmer and Edger has taken grass trimming and edging to a whole new level of power and function. With the 32-volts of MAX lithium battery power, the WG175 provides longer run times and more power. The 12-inch cutting diameter means more trimming in less time. Not only will this cordless trimmer convert to an edger in seconds, but it is also a mini mower. It has dual-positioned in-line wheels that make edging a breeze. The wheels can also be used as a \"mowing-like\" function for detailed trimming around landscape or hard to reach areas. A quick-release trigger lever is convenient for making easy height adjustments to the telescopic shaft for comfort and control. The trimmer head turns with a pull and turn to lock and convert to edging. MAX lithium battery power means more battery capacity, longer runtimes, no self-discharge, no slow loss of power, less weight, more power and quicker charging times. With this 32-volt lithium battery, expect up to 35 minutes of runtime on low speed for normal grass conditions. Charge the battery within 3 hours and it will be ready when you need it with no self-discharge. From function to features, the 32-volt WORX trimmer and edger features 100% single line feed which means no bumping to extend the line. A flower space guard not only helps protect vegetation, but also acts as an edger guide. A front auxiliary handle has 7 locking adjustments for maximum comfort while trimming, edging, or mowing. Weighing in at only 6-pounds, this 32-volt grass trimmer, edger and mini mower will create a professional looking yard with less work, less fatigue and less time.",
