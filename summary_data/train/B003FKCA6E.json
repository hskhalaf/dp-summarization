I was excited about this set as it was heavy and sturdy and also beautiful! Unfortunately, within a week of use, the knives are already showing signs of rust!! I'm very disappointed as the description says \"rust-free\" and I was shocked when my husband pointed out the spots to me. We will be returning these pronto.",

The silverware is very pretty and simple. It is heavier than our Lenox Eternal by quite a bit when I weighed on our scale to see the difference. The knives were the biggest difference in weight, the handles are quite wide. The knives are also sharper than I realized. I cut my finger in 2 places while doing the initial washing! We really like the set and will update should anything change.",
