Took my husband about 2-3 hours to fully assemble. The dresser is a great size, and very sturdy! Love that it can be secured to the wall as well. I'm 5'0 and my husband is 6'3, and the top of the dresser should work fine for a changing pad (good height for us both). The dresser is beautiful too, the color is perfectly white and love the curved lines. Great buy for the price, and I'm sure our daughter will be able to use this for years!",

When it arrived it was very well packaged, but there were apparently a couple dings before being put in the packaging. It was generally a very easy dresser to assemble, took about 1 1/2-2hrs. The biggest disappointment though is the drawer size. The dresser itself is pretty deep, but the drawers are not. Will be trying to sell this now to get something else :( No sense in it taking up so much space in our smaller rooms for the storage capacity of a smaller dresser.",

The manufacturer has starter holes for the screws along one side of the piece (along the bottom in photo) but not along any other area.

All this to say - don't judge storage space by the overall size of the dresser. Also, a couple of drawers barely scrape along the edge when you open and close them.

      "text": "The 6 drawer dresser is beautifully made. Gorgeous gray color. Solid heavy wood. I would recommend had it not been for the difficulty of putting it together. The drawers do no fit flush and opening and closing the drawers are a pain. It's as if the rails are rough making the traction difficult. I ordered because I made a previous purchase with Walmart and what they sent to me was a bunch of broken boards. Thinking Amazon would be the better option it turns out I should've just went to a local furniture store. Maybe the outcome would have been more pleasant.",
