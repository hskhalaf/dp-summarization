Service provider brought out a basic cable box. We live in an area that does not have high-speed broadband or cable TV. Once we move back to the future, this TV will only get better. Hope this review helps those of you who are trying to decide. Sidenote: The remote is a little weird, and I am still figuring out all its features and functions.",

It's especially noticeable at night in a dark room. Apple AirPlay is good for photos and music but very laggy and jumpy for video, which was quite disappointing. Also, there is no headphone jack, so you can only use speakers that have an optical input. But the LG Magic remote control is nice and the TV is pretty good aside from those issues.",

They only drop it off inside so don't expect them to unpack it for you. Light weight TV and my only complaint is the remote has a mouse feature than can be convenient but would like the option to turn it off if need be.

I wanted a replacement even with the trouble of having to repack my first TV set into the box that the second TV set came in. Nevertheless I did so. Unbelievably the blinking, which I assumed was an anomaly, was present in the second TV as well. Unbelievable. I sent back the second television and ordered a Samsung Qled.

Additionally, getting ALEXA to work with this TV was an exercise in frustration, and not something that should occur at such a price point.
