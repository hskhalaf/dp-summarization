I would purchase a Crock Pot or Hamilton Beach slow cooker as I have not had any problems with these brands. This purchase was a disappointment.",

Now I have wasted my time and money on something that has a bad taste in the food, specially if you cook something with tomatoes. I read that if the pot is cheaply made it leaches the chemical in the food when it reacts with the tomatoes, that theory might be true. Since I have tried to cook several dishes and all turned out to have that same bad after taste.",

The 'keep warm' will not elevate food temperature higher that 117 degrees Fahrenheit. That is great if your goal is to grow bacteria. But for food preparation, it is not nearly hot enough. Be sure to use a meat thermometer so you know the temperatures that the three settings can generate. For mine - on the high setting, the temperature gets up to about 170 degrees - which is satisfactory.",
