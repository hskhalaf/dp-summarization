I would suggest this as an improvement to this nice pillow. I like that you can roll it up and secure it into a small size. But a finer foam and an access area would be nice.

This pillow is not lightweight, but it\u2019s somewhat compact, and more importantly, it\u2019s actually useful. I make space for it in my pack, and sleep much better.

It took 5-6 hours for the fill inside the pillow to fully expand out and fill the voids, so to speak. If you have about 6 hours for the fill to expand before you want to go to sleep, it\u2019s all good. If you\u2019re backpacking, don\u2019t even think about having it rolled up and in your pack as it won\u2019t be fully \u201cexpanded\u201d by the time you need it.",

It will fluff up nicely over twenty minutes or so. The covering is nice and soft and the foam chunks work well and are comfortable for me. If you wait and unpack this pillow while you are slipping into your sleeping bag for the night, you will be disappointed. It needs to be shaken and allowed to decompress for 15-20 minutes. Some say put it in the dryer for a cycle, but I didn't have a need for that. Besides, dryers are hard to come by when camping or backpacking right?",

I guess it really comes down to how much room you have for carting a travel pillow in your carry-ons. Certainly smaller than than the u-shaped when compressed. Easy to compress after you get the hang of it... and they fluff up very quickly after the first few uses. So not perfect - but not sure that the perfect travel pillow exists.",

Their comfort and durability definitely make them a great purchase.",
