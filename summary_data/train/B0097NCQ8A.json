I'd recommend staying away from the bison flavor....the gas the dogs develop is something I hope and pray I never smell again! MPE even developed gas after eating a few bites and in a year she had never, until eating bison flavor TOTW, developed gas.",

Darned stuff smells so good, I've been half-tempted to try some myself. She's been eating it for the past week or so, and no adverse affects (well, a little gassy, but I think that will pass once she gets fully used to her new diet). Great ingredients, no grain, awesome food!",

I opened up the box and found the broken cans of dog food. One the seal broke that bugs started to grow. I didn't drop the cans because the cans were already dented and then packed! They were hidden in the middle out of 12 cans there were 5 that the cans were dented. As one knows, the denting of the cans ruins the seal and makes the food spoiled. Very disappointing!",
