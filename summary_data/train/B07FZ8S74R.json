Wish they would add new volume settings is this is going to be the norm going forward. Also, very disappointed in Amazon customer service. I was supposed to have a call back yesterday morning between 8:30am-9:3am CST and it never happened. I will be requesting a replacement device and I\u2019m leaving this bad review in part because of the failed customer service promise.",

      "text": "Alexa is posted strategically around the house via these devices listening for glass breakage and smoke/carbon monoxide alarms! The Guard skill takes seconds to set up, and Alexa sends a text if your window gets broken. Also, Burglar Deterrent makes your house sound occupied while you're away, and you can choose any room sounds you think will get the job done. Kitchen, office, bathroom, you pick, Alexa plays. Alexa maintains lists, sets alarms and timers, answers basic questions, and can set off whatever you have plugged into a smart timer either by command or set to a routine. If you also have a camera which sends you alerts, this is pretty good security for not too much cash.",

After ordering the adapter I have successfully integrated with my Insteon smarthome setup.

      "text": "I replaced a clock radio that was sitting on my bathroom counter. The Dot 3rd Gen is small and will play my radio stations from iHeart Radio or music from Amazon Music. Ask the time or temperature, or ask about my calendar entry for the day and Alexa provides the info (if you allow connectivity to your calendar). Only reason for the four star rating was for the fact that the plug for the Dot is HUGE. You'd think there would be a way the electrical plug (even though the wire is 90 degrees downward) would be smaller. So, one star deduct for that design. Better sound and looks than my Dot 2 version.",

      "text": "It's fairly useful. I like how it lets me know when a package is delivered. However, Amazon thought it was genius idea to ANNOY me with their nagging to rate some recent orders. Amazon, you already spam me with emails to do that. When you throw that into Alexa notifications, it's not useful, it's nagging. UPDATE: I've been informed you can turn off these types of notifications for Alexa. Great. But I'm downgrading to a 1-star for some Amazon rep absolutely spamming my phone number (3 times within 3 minutes!) to tell me this when that could've just been done over email. Yikes.",

      "text": "The Echo Dot was easy to install. We bought it for the convenience of the intercom feature or the \"drop in\" way of using Alexa. We have a family room that is located at an inconvenient place to be able to hear well from other rooms in the house. This feature helps us to be able to keep in touch easier. Alexa's bot qualities are fun to access although sometimes either we dont make a clear question that it hears correctly or its receptive sound still needs more upgrade. At any rate we are satisfied and it does what we intended it to do when we decided to buy a Dot.",

The new color palette options allow you to tailor the color to your personality or space. The speakers really sound great and fill the space surprisingly well for the size and form factor of the unit. Anyhow, it\u2019s a great upgrade if you want to bump the hockey pucks of the past out to your shop where you don\u2019t really care what it looks like, or if you just want to have the latest greatest at a reasonable price... Anyhow, Mrs. F. Loved this practical gift this Christmas.",

However, having a suspicious nature, I manually turn off the microphone before going to bed. I'm partially deaf so the sound seems somewhat muffled even with my hearing aids on. But, I really only wanted to use the Echo to turn my entertainment devices on and off. The Harmony hub now allows me to do that. The only other thing I have problems with is integrating my Arlo cameras with it. It use to work before Echo but not any more. I'm sure Echo can do much more with other devices.",

There are so many things I can do now, it even integrates perfectly with my FireTV. It always understands what I'm saying and usually gets it right. The only gripe I have, is the sound quality. I know they improved it, but sometimes it has sound issues if there's too much bass in a song, but this device is more about convenience and not superb audio quality. There are many other Bluetooth speakers that have great sound (and great price).",
