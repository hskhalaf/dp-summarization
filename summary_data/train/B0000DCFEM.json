For three years, this towel rack was great. Easy to install, worked as any respectable metal circle should, until one day, the bronze portion just fell off of the wall fixture. No rhyme or reason as to which part failed, and nothing I can do will get it to go back on. So... if you want a decent hand towel rack for almost three years, and a surprise one morning, get this one.",
