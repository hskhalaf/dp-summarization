Only complaint I had initially was that the middle of the seat sagged to much, putting pressure on the backs of my legs in the front. I saw in another review a fix that someone figured with 2\" wooden blocks. I figured out a simpler fix that seems to be working so far. Takes the pressure off the backs of my legs by allowing me to sit a little higher in the chair.",

I can feel where the bar is and I can imagine it might bother some people, but it is fine for me to sit in a few hours at a time while I am at my son's baseball games. I love how sturdy it is and that I don't feel like I am going to break it when I sit down, I highly recommend this chair.
