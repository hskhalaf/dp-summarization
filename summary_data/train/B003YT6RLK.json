The wireless doesn't work half the time -- need to reset the printer to get it to connect. And now I can't get anything to print properly even though the ink cartridges are full and I've ran the clean printhead multiple times, even after inserting new cartridges. Decided to buy a new printer for just a few dollars more than what it would cost to buy a new printhead for this printer. Won't buy HP again.",

Even with fresh ink the pictures have banding, and the colors couldn't be farther off. Blond hair turns hellish red, black hair becomes white. It's nightmarish.
