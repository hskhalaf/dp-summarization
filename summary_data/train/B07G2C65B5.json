If there was just 1 grievance, if its even that, is that I wish the tongue was a little more thicker, but really.....nothing at all to complain about. I used a bought insole to help with my walking. Almost all shoes, now days, lack quality or comfort in this area, I swear (At least if you're slightly heavier). But since I have a over-pronation walk, and am hard on shoes, these definitely deliver, with extra insoles used",

For the $40 I paid, I am satisfied. The arch support is adequate, though not awesome. May be flat for some. They are on the firmer side despite their appearance. They have a soft lining so you can go sockless if you were so inclined. The fit was as I expected. I wear a 9 medium street shoe and 91/2 athletic shoe most of the time. I ordered the 91/2 med here and the fit was perfect.",

The soles are flared slightly which is great for balance. They breath great and dry off when wet without any shrinking. When they get dirty I remove the innersoles, tie the laces and throw them both in the washer and dryer. They come out fresh and clean and this is how I can keep a pair for many years. The soles do wear over time but they are still wearable and the tops never break down or fray. Most importantly they have classic styling and go with any outfit.",
