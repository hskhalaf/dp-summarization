The \"pot rest\" on the opposite side of the handle makes it even easier and more comfortable for one person to load and operate when ricing a big Thanksgiving-sized batch of potatoes. Hope to get another 20+ years out of this one. Let's face it, in 20 years riced food will probably be a mealtime staple with me anyway.. ;-)",

This ricer requires a little arm strength and a little forethought in prep time, since it takes a lot longer to rice potatoes than to just mash/whip them. However, this is totally worth it since, in the end, you'll get perfectly creamy and sumptuous potatoes. Just add some whole milk or heavy cream and ample butter to the riced potatoes, then stir for perfect potatoes.",

      "text": "I have never owned a potato ricer before, but purchased one so that I could make homemade gnocchi. Once I received the ricer, I learned it was also a great way to make mashed potatoes. I have not yet attempted the gnocchi, but I have used the ricer for mashed potatoes, and it works great. The mashed potatoes were smooth and fluffy. The ricer itself is easy to use and easy to clean. I'm very happy with this purchase and would buy from this company again.",

One recipe calls to mash the potatoes and it helps having a rubber around the handles. I don't have a strong grip and every little thing helps.

No where on the box or the potato ricer itself says it's 18/10 (look for labels on the bottom marked \"18/10 stainless steel\" for true 18/10 quality products). Besides the false advertisement here, the ricer operates very decently compared to most conventional ricers. The ricer is weighted nicely, easy to press, cleaning was simple, and overall a good potato ricer. It is a little annoying that food still squishes up on the sides of the food press, but these handheld models will do that regardless over a food mill.",

I gave it to a friend with two young children and they use it several times a week to make baby food...they are in love with it. I guess it depends on what you're using it for!",
