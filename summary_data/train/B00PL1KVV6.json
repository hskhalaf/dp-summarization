They use their individual mats for EVERY meal, I just rinse after breakfast and lunch, but do a better scrub after dinner and we\u2019ve never put them in the dishwasher. They dry really fast on the dish rack. We have not had any issues with the mats having and discoloration or loss of suction or odd smells, which are issues I\u2019ve heard are common with other brands. The only negative is that they don\u2019t travel well. My friend gifted this mat to us for my oldest\u2019s one year birthday and I\u2019m so glad she did!",

      "text": "This is great, especially as a combo with the Lobster clip-on high chair. Although the manufacturer of the high chair says not to do it, it seems perfectly safe to clip the chair over this. That means the chair pins down the mat and the baby can't move it. That's great if your kid tends to throw plates. When not pinned by the high chair, it is relatively hard to move--it's pretty heavy and stays in place through friction. However, it is definitely possible to move once your baby gets the hang of it.",

Even though within minutes he had figured out how to pull up the sides (hes 2 yrs old and very smart for his age evidently) we still use this all the time because he cannot knock it off the table and we can stop him if he tries to reach for the sides. Also the mat works great at catching spills that come from a 2 year old learning to use a fork and spoon, which makes clean up a breeze since nothing gets on the table. It sticks very well to all hard surfaces, even the cloth tabletop of his little kid table.",

It over hangs my son's high chair table, but because of the floppy edges it was very hard for him to lift (not impossible) and gave me plenty of time to bust him. It is perfect on our coming room table. Especially if slightly moist. PLUS it helps protect my table from fork stabs. Only suggestion would be to have the raised plate closer to the edge of the mat.",

It is cute, durable, and dishwasher safe. Overall its more cute than functional for the price you pay. I feel you can get somewhat similar things for a cheaper price.",
