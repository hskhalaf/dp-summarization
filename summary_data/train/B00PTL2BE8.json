I was needing to buy three convertible car seats...one for a mini van, one for an 2003 Camry and one for our nannys Altima. I spoke with several car seat experts and stressed greatly. I got a Britax Boulevard for our van but needed something to go three across with a graco booster and an incognito booster. I ended up Getting two of these. My 1 year old likes this. There is room and yet he is safe. I sometimes wish I bought 3 of these Easy install....great price and happy baby.",

I chose this carseat after alot of research as I wanted something safe and reliable that didn't cost a fortune. It looks nice, it isn't too heavy, it's relatively easy to get in and out of our car (Kia soul) and has plenty of growing room.

I've gotten used to driving it like this, but it isn't 100% comfortable for me. She'll be forward facing in a few months so I can deal until then but I didn't have this issue with my last car seat.",

It\u2019s a fight every single time you want to get it out of your car. I have two of these seats and it\u2019s a problem for both. It\u2019s a shame cause the seat is great otherwise.",

      "text": "This car seat was fairly easy to install and fits well in my 09 Accord, even with the front seat all the way back. I do not like the difficulty of tightening the shoulder straps and waist belt; it seems I can never get them tight enough-quite frustrating. Without the shoulder protectors, the straps do dig in to the child's shoulders and cause redness; I wish they would include the shoulder strap covers. It does seem quite comfy and I like the ease of being able to move the straps up and down without re-threading.",

The only cons I have about the carseat is that you can only spot clean, the fabric does not come off to be laundered. Also I find that the adjustable strap between the legs that you pull to tighten does not tighten enough when the child is buckled fully. I wish I was able to tighten the buckles easier.",
