      "text": "I had bought this product after ordering it for my mom, and after hearing about the benefits of gold on the skin. While I initially thought that this product could have been a gimmick, I have noticed immediate results as far as improving skin hydration and texture. Even if I have had a busy day and have been lazy about following my full skin routine (totally removing makeup, doing a facial scrub, etc), one treatment of this mask the next day completely restores my skin. The funny unexpected thing is that not only does it smell really nice, but if you accidentally get it into your mouth, it tastes sweet like honey (but don't eat it!! lol)",

I really liked this mask. It left my face feeling moisturized, and it was easy to remove with a warm damp wash cloth. I do recommend using a mask brush to apply it for better coverage.",
