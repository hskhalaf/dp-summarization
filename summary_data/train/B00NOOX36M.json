With just one issue: it had medium size ear tips installed instead of large ones that I sent it with to them. Reached out again - new set of ear tips sent.

One headphone died before the two-year warranty was up but then that pair also died in about a year. The warranty is only good from the time of the initial purchase so I was asked to pay $80 for an out of warranty replacement, something I can't justify based on the fact I don't think these have a long shelf life with regular usage. I have yet to find a pair of wired earbuds that can last a long time, so the search continues.",

These worked well, but within 6 months the gray mesh on the back of each had fallen off and last week the casing fell off the right earbud exposing the wire which frayed and now doesn't work. These pieces are simply glued together and normal stress caused them to come apart. For this price point, I was hoping to have these for a while. My search for quality earbuds that last continues.",

Also, because they are noise isolating (not noise cancelling, mind you), they \"plug\" your ears, creating an effect where you can basically hear yourself breathe, walk, etc. But you get used to it and the quality of the sound more than makes up for it.",

      "text": "Once you get the right ear plugs chosen, the seal is quite good enough to produce good bass. And the retention loop scheme works well and is very comfortable. These are a pleasure to have in your ear, contrasted with some earlier ear plugs I had that had to go into the ear canal. Limited listening time so far, but the sound is clear, analytical and broad. Does what I want in a compact and comfortable form.",

The sound quality rivals that of a $400 pair of bulky Sony headphones I have. Not bad for under $200. Tip: Ensure you try out all the different caps. You must use the right ones otherwise sound quality and bass levels drop.",

The only bad parts are (1) that the 3 button remote lacks actual buttons & is hard to use accurately and (2) the loops still feel a bit strange, although they do hold the ear buds in place very well. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.",
