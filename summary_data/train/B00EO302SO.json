I use mine for mirror back-up of my primary laptop. I don't use the software for this purpose that came installed on the My Passport so I can't speak to that feature. The USB 3.0 on this provides for faster data transfer than the USB 3.0 on my. There's nothing about this that I don't like and I'm very pleased with this purchase.",

There is a metal plate on the top of the housing; the rest is plastic, as with the less expensive My Passport. About the only difference I could find between the Passport Slim and the My Passport is that the Passport Slim weights about 2/3 of an ounce more. I own lots of these little WD drives and they're great. But unless there's something magical here, you're paying a premium for a metal case that's mostly plastic and a tiny bit of extra weight.",

I've owned this one now by WD for 18 months and it has backed up my Macbook continuously (sometimes several times a day) and retrieved files when needed -- flawlessly. Never needed reformatting.
