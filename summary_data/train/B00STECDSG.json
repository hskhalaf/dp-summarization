I was able to wear my backpack under the poncho comfortably. I looked ridiculous but it kept everything dry under downpours (see photo below). Besides, is anyone really wearing a bright red rain poncho because they are trying to be super cute???? Running down the sides, under both arms are snaps. These snaps can be fastened to create arm holes or unsnapped. I'd say that its pretty durable for multiple uses. The reusable mesh baggie it comes packaged inside is great for keeping things organized.",
