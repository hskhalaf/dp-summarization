We were very surprised when it arrived at our front door, no shipping damage beautiful oven and it fit perfectly. I installed it in about 30 minutes My wife is a baker and she could not believe how well her baked goods turn out. This oven preheats in no time and is a pleasure to use. I would recommend this oven to anyone who is considering buying a new oven.",

Immediately installed the unit only to find it didn\u2019t turn on. Had a professional electrician come out to confirm it was the device itself that doesn\u2019t work, not the electrical hook-up. I\u2019ve now been dealing with Frigidaire\u2019s warranty service trying to get the unit fixed for the past 4 weeks. Many appointments set - resulting in No call no shows, showing up with the incorrect parts, etc. Overall terrible experience. I would not buy this unit or anything else from Frigidaire.",

No problems, easy to operate and the stainless steel still looks great. The cooling fans noise is the one thing that could be improved, they are on the loud side.",
