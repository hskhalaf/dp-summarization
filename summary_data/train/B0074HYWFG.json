This table is lighter and easier to transport than the more expensive portable sewing tables. The legs are not in the center of the table depth so you can put the roomier side at your lap/legs and there is plenty of room for a foot pedal. Love it for sewing at classes and workshops.",

It's lightweight but so far is very sturdy - I have TWO monitors on it, a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse. For anyone looking for a standing desk that won't put you out close to $500, give this a try!",

The table is height adjustable 21\", 24\", 26\", and 28\" The Possible Issues: Latching method to both close the table and change the height is potential failure point, it feels like the most flimsy portion of the table.

Btw- once you unsnap the legs ya squeeze the bar together that has the thingy m jig to chose the height of the table... lol I plan on buying another one soon. Great little/sturdy table and not terribly heavy to move. Love love love this table.",

The main drawback for me is that I'd planned on setting some stacking trays that are 24 inches wide on this table, with an inch to spare at each end. The ends of the tray table are so rounded that the main sides are only 20 inches wide -- so my stacking trays will slide off. I can still use the table, but not for the original purpose.",
