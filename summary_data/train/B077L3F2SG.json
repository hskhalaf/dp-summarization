      "text": "After wasting so much money on other brands blenders which always end up breaking after 1 to 2 months, I decided to invest and buy this one but to my surprise, I have only used this blender to blend fresh red pepper and tomato for sauce for about 5 to 6 times since I bought it, the pitcher is already turning red, this is upsetting and doesn\u2019t worth the price of this machine. I also think it should come with additional pitcher that is wide enough to make something like dough.",

No programmable buttons but that version costs $150 more although it is 3.5HP rather than this one at 3.0HP, which is plenty. It has a 10 year \"no hassle\" warranty and that is why I bought it over a Vitamix. Before this I bought a Cuisinart that broke in 3 months.",

Unfortunately I have lots of low cabinets and the blender is too tall to find under so I store it in my pantry. The pitcher is plastic which was surprising considering the price point. I expected glass but the plastic is very thick and sturdy. Blends and grinds with ease just as I expected. I found that using a bottle brush is the easiest and safest way to clean the blades and underneath it. Overall, extremely powerful, heavy duty and sturdy blender.",

The controls and settings are simple to figure out. Nice solid base. The blades were tough and made blending ice for margaritas a breeze. Easy to take off base and a quick clean. Easy to read measurements on the side are really helpful. If I do get a second one I will search for a longer cord.",

I thought I would see if the Kitchen Aid would be just was good for almost half the price! Yes it delivers and will be used for many years to come. Crushes ice like nobody\u2019s business!

And you won't want to be dragging it out of a cabinet, because it weighs a lot. Not a criticism, just a statement of fact . I expect a quality blender to be heavy. The cord is surprisingly short, my only real criticism. Worth the price of you blend a lot, probably not if you use occasionally.",
