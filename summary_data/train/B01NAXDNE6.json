Like i took one pill this morning and felt nausea and my heart is doing strange pulsating rythm like every couple of minutes for the past 12+hours.... For real, dont recommend this to anyone and also they dont offer Refund! Glad i got amazon prime and they got my back. Because this company is selling overdose on a pill calling it thermogenic... Im used to thermogenic but this was that caused the worst reaction, i dont know if it was the 20 coffees caffeine per dose or the yohimbine or other ingridient! RUN",
