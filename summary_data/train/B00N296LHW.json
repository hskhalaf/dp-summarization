We've only put 50 pages through it so far, but the shreds are so tiny it makes strip shredders look silly. Take a look at the photo-tiny shreds. Happy purchaser.",

Removed the whole jam and it worked for a second and the motor just spins again. Upon review the motor uses a steel worm gear (looks like a drill bit) to spin a large plastic gear. When it jammed it cut a hole on the side of the plastic gear and whenever it rotates to that point it fails. Really???? Metal driving plastic when has that ever worked. Engineered to fail.

Also, I don't like that you have to remove the entire top, including the motor, just to empty it. I would not recommend this shredder.",

Decent speed, not too noisy, no jams so far, no overheating, and it shreds paper into tiny pieces. It does slow noticeably when you try to feed several pages at once, but feeding about 4 pages at a time works well. I did not try any credit cards or CDs.

      "text": "After reading other reviews on this item, I was somewhat skeptical of buying it. But it seemed to be closest to what I wanted (cross-cut and CD/DVD capable) at the price I wanted to pay, and so far it works great. It's not as loud as I expected, and it has shredded everything I've fed into it, although I have kept the number of sheets down to less than half of what's specified. Taking a bit longer to do the shredding sure beats having to replace the shredder!",

Gray plastic on the top of the unit must be opened to insert paper, however it only opens slightly making it a bit difficult to place the paper in the machine. It does a good job of micro-shredding paper and credit cards. However, CD's are only sliced several times .",
