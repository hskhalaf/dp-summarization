I was having a bit of trouble with accuracy my first day (long time since I used one of these) but by the next day I improved quite a lot! But yeah, this thing certainly packs enough power to be lethal for small game, pest, rodents, etc. Regardless for why you purchase this slignshot it will provide you without countless hours of enjoyment and that\u2019s really what it is all about :)",

It comes loose and never fully tightens down, plus the flashlight isn't the best either. The slingshot on the other hand is amazing, took a little getting used too, since I'm use to single band style, but once I dialed it in I was nailing soda cans and water bottles at 8 to 10yds. Going to take it squirrel hunting next! Buy this slingshot you'll love it!",

It also comes with a hundred x 3/8 steel ammo bearings, and I easily shot it through several layers of the Amazon cardboard box it came in, from about 15 feet. I\u2019m sure with a little practice it is going to be pretty accurate. I recommend setting up a sheet or similar behind the target because when it guess through both layers I couldn\u2019t find the BB in the grass. lol",
