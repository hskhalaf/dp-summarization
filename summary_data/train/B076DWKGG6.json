One thing I noticed an interesting aftertaste almost like when food is stored in a cheap plastic zipper bag and then it tastes like the bag. These kind of had an after flavor like that. We buy goldfish all the time and I haven\u2019t experienced that before. My kids still ate a bunch of them and enjoyed them. I would buy again.",
