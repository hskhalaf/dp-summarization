The Gel they provide 1 tube of helps keep the buds sealed within the ear, and there are different size fitting to fit big and small ears. The only reason not a 5 star is that it does not accept the standard Itunes format, so you must reformat the songs to MP3 before loading which is a bit tricky (typical Apple) and time consuming. It may be easier with purchased software to convert to MP3, but it can be converted via Itunes if you are patient and have time to research.",

Average BPMs passed from 125 to 140 I'm burning mor cal in the same training session. I'm in my 50ties and I swimming just to be fit from 3 to 5 times a week, very happy with this accessory but I do get anointed with the setting up very time but once everything is in place no problem swimming.

For example, if I charge the unit today and not use such until two days later, there's no battery left. It only works well when I charge for 20 min right before I use such. Quick charge to use immediately, but not quick charge to hold the same charge for days. Nevertheless, I love the product for its price point. I give 4-star rating because I don't want SYRYN to be falsely comfortable when there is clearly room for improvement. At this price point, we'll be a returning customer.",

The short earbud cable works well, although to stop the buds coming out during a racing turn I had to pass the cable under the goggle strap, but that wasn't an issue once I worked out the best way of doing it.

You might need to adjust the fit during rests but it holds up well otherwise. The audio is quality isnt Bose but is decent enough for the purpose. Would recommend.",

I have been delicate with it in the water by not pressing the buttons so hard, and I try to keep the headphone insert fully fitted in the aux port so water will not get into the unit while I am swimming. With these things in mind, my unit has not broken for numerous lap swims. I highly recommend this product.",

Earbuds are not very comfortable... go too deep into the ears and feel like a little stabby, but if you don't swim more than 1h is bearable. Sound is ok but wish it to be a little louder (you can't manage it). And finally sound sometimes go on and off in some sides, it depends if the earbud moves a bit... So, overall, I'll go for another one more sturdy, but if budget issues, this will make its function average.",
