The recipe I used was gelatin based and these molds were just the right size for the recipe. My granddaughter had no problems using the included dropper to fill the molds. Removing the gummies from the molds was easy to do once they had set sufficiently. We initially didn't wait for them to fully set and the first one we tried came out in pieces. We let them set a little longer and they popped out no problem. Clean up was easy. All it took was some warm water and a little dish soap.",
