You don't have to rub this stuff into your pits after applying like with Schmit's, and it doesn't feel sticky under your arms like Primal Pit Paste does. It keeps me smelling fresh all day long without a trace of body odor seeping through. Ravine is my favorite scent so far. It will sting if applied right after shaving, but what can you expect from a baking soda based deo? UPDATE: Im back to buy more. Just want to let you know that one stick with everyday use lasted me 3 months!",
