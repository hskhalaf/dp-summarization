The buzzing noise temporarily disappears when I press the remote control. It seems to me the HDMI interface may have a defect. Returned the product and will look for another TV box.",

The unit often hangs, causing the user to exit from an app entirely and restart it in order to get it working again. One can tell that it is just another hastily programmed piece of plastic that is quite inadequate for the job at hand. The Fire Stick from Amazon is better than this thing, and it sucks.",
