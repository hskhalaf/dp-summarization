      "text": "These are good thermals. Very warm and comfortable once your second layer is on. By themselves, they seem to fit very strange. The chest, arms, and legs are all the right size but the top fits tight under my armpits and the waistband sits right at the top of my buttocks and will not come up to my waist no matter how hard I pull. However, once I have on my second layer of clothes, they feel like a perfect fit and don't slide around at all underneath my top layer. Definitely follow their directions when it comes to ordering sizes. I usually am an L but I ordered an XL and it's the right fit.",

XL in other brands normally is somewhat large on me, but I like that kind of fit. On the Rocky top, the sleeve length was good [on me], but the body length comes only to my navel, which makes it very uncomfortable to wear.",
