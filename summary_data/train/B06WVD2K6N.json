They even scalloped out some of the threads on the inside of the lid so that if somebody were to try to remove the lid while it's under pressure it will vent out the side instead of exploding only product I've seen that on. It holds whip cream without leaking any of the gasses over days. Smooth flow and a smooth trigger, the decorating tips are amazing, especially the injectors. Built for the serious professional and so easy for home use. I am rarely impressed with a product, but I am actually incredibly impressed with this one.",

Pour in your cream (and other ingredients), close the top, screw in a nitrous cartridge and just like that you have fresh whipped cream. This unit is a little more expensive than others, but it is made of high-grade metal, has a bunch of alternate attachments. It even comes with different colored rings if you're trying to match your whipped cream maker to the decor! Recommended for those who want the best whipped cream maker that you can buy!",

Suggest you buy a Viton or butyl rubber O-ring to place under the plastic cap after charging. Make sure you use a small amount of silicone grease on the ALL SS threads so they do not gall. I use Dow Corning High Vacuum Grease. It is food grade.",
