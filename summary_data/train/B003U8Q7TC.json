    "title": "Sony Alpha SEL1855 E-mount 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 OSS Lens (Silver)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nE 18-55MM F3.5-5.6 OSS STANDARD ZOOM LENS\nThis 27mm wide angle to 82.5mm medium telephoto equivalent (35mm full frame format) range in a compact 3x E-mount zoom that is suitable for landscapes, snapshots, portraits, and more. Built-in Optical SteadyShot (OSS) provides approximately a four-stop image stabilization advantage, and an internal drive motor ensures smooth, quiet autofocus and aperture operation.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nCIRCULAR APERTURE\nWhen changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. \u03b1 lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.\n\nASPHERICAL LENS ELEMENTS\nAspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.\n\nDISTANCE ENCODER\nThe distance encoder plays an integral part in ADI flash metering, which delivers high precision flash metering that is unaffected by the reflectance of subjects or backgrounds. The distance encoder is a lens component that directly detects the position of the focusing mechanism, and sends a signal to the CPU in order to measure distance to the subject. During flash photography, this data is very useful in calculating how much flash output is appropriate to the scene.\n\nLENS-BASED OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION\nGyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nINTERNAL FOCUSING\nOnly the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if you\u2019re using a polarizing filter.\n\n\n2010 Sony Electronics Inc. All rights reserved.
