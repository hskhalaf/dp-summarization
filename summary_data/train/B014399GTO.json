      "text": "Well they are fantastic sounding headphones, without a doubt worth the price. My one issue with them is that they are a bit tight. My ears hurt a little bit after having them on for longer than 20 minutes. I'm sure that's something that will go away as the plastic stretched to better fit my head. I do have a big head after all so I can't blame the headphones too much!",

      "text": "Least would have to be that sometimes there's a small fuzzy sound or hum when it's quiet vocals only in a song, but it's not too noticeable so I'm not really worried about it. They're great as far as I'm concerned. Nice sturdy aux cable with a good length, headphones are durable with a good weight to them, the turning ear pieces are really handy, the cushioning is plentiful without being overbearing, the sound is clear as well as spot on, and the travelling case is a nice sturdy material as well with a great fit for the headphones and the cord. I have no real complaints other than I wish I could have gotten them in purple.",

      "text": "I was hopeful for these, having read reviews for them elsewhere, but they were not what I expected. The carrying/storage case they come with is nice, and I like that the cable is detachable, but the headphones themselves feel flimsy and the sound is really flat and tinny. They don't cancel out ANY noise whatsoever, so you have to listen to music at a higher volume if you want to drown out your morning commute like me. Would not recommend.",
