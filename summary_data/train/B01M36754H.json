My complaint is that one of the plastic screws you attach the fins with fell out what else we were using it for now not the second time. Good luck finding a replacement for that! You may want to add some water proof glue to yours when attaching!",

If I was anything less than center, one side of the board went under... could just be my inexperience too. Absolutely a good purchase for a kid with some athletic ability.",

They are beginners and this board floats really well and it's very stable due to the width.",
