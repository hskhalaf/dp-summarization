And then you think, it can't be that stupid, and you spend hours trying various workarounds and other filetypes and over and over again the software chooses to do it's own thing. Simply put, it can READ svg files, but it cannot RENDER svg files. Unless you intend to only cut the simplest of designs, avoid this product.",

She's purchased, or rather attempted to purchase cartridges and the software always shows that she still has to purchase it and wont let her continue, multiple times. Her linked cartridges don't show up in their design space software, and you can't try to link them again. Overall a terrible product from a crap company.",

No regrets in buying this even the International shipping cost is so high. I hope this machine can last long!",

With a machine like this, I've not only reduced the amount of handling time I need between receiving an order and shipping out a product, but I've been able to create more uniformity within my products themselves!",
