They have been in the extreme winter weather for extended periods of time under the snow, they have been in the mud, they have been chewed on repeatedly and played tug of war with between the 2 dogs and they hold up better than any other dog product on the market (well there are 3 other products that are equally as wonderful but that's another review). Even after washing these things in the dishwasher they still retain their scent. I highly recommend this product.",
