After researching Saucony and this particular sneaker, I was hopeful, and it's paid off big time! The Redeemer ISO has become my saving grace. Definitely needed 1/2 size up. For me personally, the muted grey with a splash of green is right in my wheelhouse. Thanks to Saucony, I can keep up with my daily workouts! Soooo very happy!",

I returned the shoe and wrote the company that until the Stabil comes back, they have lost a faithful customer. Stabil was the only shoe that made my arches not hurt. Just a few minutes of the Redeemer inside the house let me know that they do not provide the same support.",

They were comfortable for the first couple days (I wear them everyday for work and walk long hours) and after the third day, the inside does not feel soft any longer. They feel hard and compacted to the point it was hurting the back of my calves and the bottom of my feet were so tender, I could barely walk. Unfortunately, I can't return them because I wore them for three days straight, more than 8 hours each day.",
