I tied four of these to each leg of the canopy and they held it down with ease. I also made a makeshift anchor to keep a couple of rafts in one spot when camping on the beach. These sandbags (unfilled obviously) will have a permanent home in my camping/outdoor gear. One thing to be careful of, though, is the material can fray easily if you are filling the bags with a serrated shovel, like the entrenching tool I was using. This can be avoided with a little finesse.",
