These bully sticks are tiny and they are hollow! I am so disappointed in my purchase. These are in no way worth $25. I do not recommend these at all. You can find thicker and solid bully sticks for the same price. Look at the picture. These bully sticks are slightly wider than a pencil. Unreal. I wasted my money.
