They are a bit old school in their construction (no space age materials or bendy soles) but they are the best for logging miles because they are a quality design that actually works. These shoes are a good balance of lightness and durability and they've done well on road and trail.",

But, as is the case with most shoes, if it works, then the company will make changes. So, here we are on the 3rd iteration of the shoe. There are some things about the shoe that are great such as cushioning and support. As many others have pointed out, though, the upper mesh, just above the big toe, is designed so that in time, it might tear because of constant contact with the toe. Fortunately for me, that has not happened yet.",

These have the right amount of cushion for me and help to correct the overpronation. These shoes are well ventilated and generally hold to my foot without creating any pressure points or uncomfortable rubbing. I'll definitely buy another pair once these are worn out. They are a little on the tight side for the size, so I recommend going half to a full size above your norm.",

Incorporates excellent proven features. This is my fourth pair of GT-1000s and my previous pairs gave over 500 miles of service with only limited wear on the rubber outsole. This shoe is great for running on paved roads since the cushioning protects ankle and knee joints from injury and the soles offer more than adequate traction even on wet pavement. The shoe is also excellent for running on most dry trails although I go with trail shoes with more traction when running on muddy or really rough trails.",

I'm not even sure I can use this as a walking-around shoe. It should be a $30 shoe for people who aren't athletic. ASICS generally makes good running shoes, so this is disappointing.

They are extremely comfortable and provide great cushioning. I'm not crazy about the way they look on my feet, but that hardly concerns me as long as they don't cause any problems while running. They've also held up remarkably well. No fraying of the stitching whatsoever.",

The bouncy SpEVA Midsole has been reengineered to be more protective and cushioned, while the DuoMax Support System and Guidance Trusstic provide excellent support for mild to moderate overpronators. In 1949, Mr. Kihachiro Onitsuka began his athletic footwear company (Onitsuka Co., Ltd.) by manufacturing basketball shoes out of his living room in Kobe, Japan. He chose the name ASICS for his company in 1977, based on a famous Latin phrase \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,\" which, when translated, expresses the ancient ideal of \"A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.\" Taking the acronym of this phrase, ASICS was founded on the belief that the best way to create a healthy and happy lifestyle is to promote total health and fitness. Today, ASICS offers a full line of performance-driven athletic shoes and technical active sports apparel and accessories dedicated to bringing harmony to the body and soul.",
