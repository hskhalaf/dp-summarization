Fast and useful--blows the nexus 5x out of the water in most respects and is a nice upgrade. Impressive build quality, nice set of features with EMU, and overall a solid phone. Downsides would include that the US version is SINGLE SIM and the reception for TMobile seems a tad spotty compared to other devices I've used. Overall it's a good phone, however, the downsides in my case make it harder to keep, and therefore I might have to find something else.",

One year isn't a particularly good return on the investment since it hasn't been abused. Update: Lasted about 2 years before it would hold no usable charge. Had a repair shop install a new battery and it's great again. It's such a good phone at the original price point (not the new inflated prices) that I didn't find anything worth the cost. If I get another 2 years I'll be thrilled. Maybe two more with yet another battery? Who knows. My needs in a phone have plateaued.",

It's a very slim design, fingerprint unlocks easily, and runs pretty fast on most apps. The only downside might be that if you have a micro SD card like me, you can't move apps onto it. Also, it's been complaining about my SD card being damaged for some reason (although there are still 2.5 GB left in memory on the card). It might be a card problem, but it's something to keep an eye on. Overall it's a great phone at this price. Love the color too.",

The only con is not being able to move apps to the sd card, hopefully there is a fix coming for this. I have plenty of space on my phone now, but it could become an issue in the future.",
