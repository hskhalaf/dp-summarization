Thunderbolt 3 is present at this price range. 200w power adapter is sleek. Ports are well aligned. Cons It is 2070 max Q design not full 2070 as advertised Fans are noisy It heats up quickly Bloatware - lots of HP and Microsoft unwanted softwares. Trackpad works but is outdated design and not intuitive. Loves fingerprint. Note : my device computer name was already named. So the laptop must have been opened and used before I brought. But the ad says it's new and not refurbished. .",
