I ordered the XL and was worried not all would fit still. This has been able to fit THEM ALL. A full net, a twin bed covered and more lying around. Best part is there is still space. It is easier for her to get to them as the corner nets I would have to help. Easy to put them all away. Conveniently zips right up. It bit funny when a doll that makes noise is sat on... but overall this is a great way to keep them all but hide them all.",

Now all the stuffed animals are contained and we have a comfy bean bag chair to lounge in. The kids are able to easily unzip the chair and take out their animals when they want to play, but it's so nice to have them all go back at the end of the day. I might have to order a second one!",

With the extra large beanbag cover we were able to fit all of his animals, the two blankets and even have room to add some more animals! It looks so organized and the zipper has a great \"gripper\"so he can open and close it himself. The zipper is also really nice quality and runs very smoothly! Another amazing bonus is the handle! You can pick it up and move it around with ease!!! Best thing I have ever found to store his animals in!! Absolutely LOVE it!!!",

If you have a bunch of circus/carnival stuffed animals you are going to get a misshapen lump. It does the job nicely, though, and cleans up the room so it isn't covered in stuffed animals. My 7 year-old loves it because he feels like he has a bean bag chair in his room that he can sit on. I should have bought one size smaller because the extra large is bigger than I thought and he doesn't have that many stuffed animals (thank goodness).

This way they have full access to it but love the fact that it serves as a seat - probably comfort to them knowing it is close by still. I do have to add I personally sit in them (I have two) while waiting for them to do their nightly routines and putting them to bed, REALLY comfortable!!",

I really didn't like the idea of putting holes in the wall to hang one of those nets, plus I don't love the way those look. I bought the extra large and almost all her stuffed animals are inside with a good bit of room for more. She has a few stuffed animals that have hard battery packs so I didn't put those ones inside, but just having 90% of her stuffed animals put away made a huge difference! The bag is great quality, very heavy and very durable and you can tell it is very well made!",

Although we intended to only use it to store stuffed animals, we figured it would also be a great place to store the backup sheets, blankets, and pillows. That way we have more storage space, and the seat is still comfortable. We plan to buy 3 more for the rest of the kids and get rid of the old bean bag chairs that always go flat. Delivery was fast and product was packaged nicely. Highly recommend product!",

      "text": "I LOVE this thing. It was recommended by a coworker when I was complaining about how messy my daughters room was. It works great! Fits a ton of stuffed animals, we even threw some of her blankets in. She loves to sit and read on it, and she can easily pick up her stuffed animals and throw them in when she's done playing. Worth every penny. I'm going to get one for my son now too :) Bonus that the pink stripes are super cute. Very highly recommend!",

Do you spend more time picking up stuffed animals and figuring out where your child will sleep on their bed than you do on their college fund? This is the solution for you! I purchased one for my 13 yo daughter and another for my 7 yo son because I was at my wit's end. The kids immediately filled up the bags and commented that they are quite comfy to use. The bags seem well constructed (as opposed to some cheaper options with poor reviews), and I've washed and dried on with no issues so far.",

My son's net gave way due to the number of stuffed animals and started pulling out of the wall. Which caused me to go on a search for something else. As soon as my husband saw the bag he said order another one so our daughter can have one too. Way better then the net. Highly recommend",
