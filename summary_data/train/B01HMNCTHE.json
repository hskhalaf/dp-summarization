But the last couple of pairs of Clarks shoes I bought have had much lower quality materials with an inconsistent fit. These boots, for example - the leather was cheap looking (it almost looked like vinyl or a sprayed-on color finish), the toe of one boot was scuffed in several places when it arrived and the boot was at least one size smaller than the stated size. I guess this is how Clarks sells shoes for less than $100 a pair these days - they are obviously outsourcing the manufacturing and just sticking their name on a generic product. Disappointing.",

First, they showed up in a bag, not a box- and unsurprisingly, they came with odd scuffs all over. Visible marks and wear are unacceptable for brand new shoes IMO. Second, even after sizing a whole size down- these are still too big! Lastly, after lacing and walking a few steps in them the creasing was odd, and not in usual places. The leather is far lower quality than my old Clark's desert boots. I am returning these, even for the price- I don't even care to wear them at all.",

Some people will put insoles in because the sole doesn't really soften up and that is admittedly not so comfy. These boots also last for ever, I wore my last pair probably over 500 days before the bottom sole wore through. The top leather still looked fantastic though.

These are not breathable, so you may want to swap out the insoles if you have sweaty feet.

Just an all around solid boot. The fit is about a 1/2 size larger than I expected and for the first few wears, the material is unforgiving and downright uncomfortable. That said, I'm 100% confident that after a month of regular use, they will have softened and broken in enough that these will become like a second skin. Very happy with the purchase.",

Will buy another pair. Oh, and the price is crazy good. I'd priced these in a large department store and they were double the price. Win, win.",

Lack of eyelets makes them feel they are barely on your foot too. Since I like the way they look, and they were so cheap, I'm going to not return them and suffer for a while to break them in.",

You can add an insert but make sure to order your true size and not size down half down a size as suggested by reviewers - there won't be enough room for an insert.
