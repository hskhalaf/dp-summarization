After my latest keyboard died I decided to browse Amazon for a new one. This keyboard only costs a little more than a basic one so I thought I would give it a try. The back lit keys are pretty cool and I definitely like the sound and feel of them. The clicks are loud. Came with a tool to remove caps but I haven't tried it. I will definitely update after some prolonged use.",
