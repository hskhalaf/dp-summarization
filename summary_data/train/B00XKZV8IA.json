This pillow actually delivers on that, which is something I've found other brands/models don't live up to.

The directions claim to take the pillow out of its case and let it air dry for 24h-48h. The smell wasn't too overwhelming for me so about 10h seemed fine, then you're supposed to wash the case as well. (If the smell stays, you can spray a bit of perfume/cologne to the pillow case to help mask it.)",

I personally couldn't use it after unwrapping it the first week. It is a great pillow for those who enjoy a cool pillow (although it last about 10 mins per side) and sleep on their back (the design is meant for it).",

The cooling gel started to separate from the pillow, stick to the pillowcase and created a mess. While the pillow is nice, it's not worth the cost for the poor quality of production.",
