But bathing him every day is not practical, especially since it's getting cold! I had been using the wipes, which work, but are very expensive and time consuming. The spray is quick, effective, and smells great! Ranger LOVES getting his rub down while I work it into his coat, and I incorporate a deep tissue muscle massage in at the same time. It has actually helped him get up and around more often, because I think it helps him feel better. And he looks great!",

Even after a crazy hiking day, spraying this on her makes her feel like a (85%) clean dog! Nothing beats a bath, but this is great for between times when it just isn't possible. We have probably used this about 5 times for her full body and still have some left over! So it lasts a while.",

I've used dry shampoos on myself before, and let me say, this isn't exactly like a human's dry shampoo... first off, it's wet, and stays on wet until it dries naturally... secondly, it doesn't leave my dog's fur feeling like it's been cleaned to the point of having no oil left in her fur. Thankfully, it's also not too fragrant. My wife and I despise perfumes, scented candles, etc., so this product is 'lite' enough to smell pleasant without smelling like we just sprayed our dog with Fabreeze, if that makes sense.",
