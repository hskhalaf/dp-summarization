      "text": "I searched far and wide to find the perfect 800\u00a3 laptop, and after three sleepless nights of scouring the internet, i decided that this one with just a little help from a second 8gig RAM plate would be an incredible machine until i save some money on something a bit more...desktopy. It could also suit a girl's needs (basically it's not bulky is what i'm trying to say) it has an amazing slim design, matte colors...it's just pretty! The specs are really good, you cannot get any better than that for that price. Thank you!",

      "text": "The steady state disk rather than the older type hard drive makes a huge difference. I edit graphic, audio and video files and the faster disk makes a real difference. At 250gb the disk isn't massive. I use an external hard drive to store files I'm not currently using. I may add another card of RAM. But this isn't difficult. No problems at all and I'm impressed.",

      "text": "This laptop has a fast cpu and the ssd allows you to open files and boot up quickly. From my research it can run most modern (2016 -2018) games at around 45 fps on low settings so I would describe it (the gtx 1050 4gb version) as an entry level gaming PC. Unfortunately, when I bought it the touchpad was not working so I returned it to amazon for a refund.",
