Initially it smelled kind of plastic-y, but over the last 3 weeks or so, there has been a smell in the bathroom like a cross between onions and body odor. I practically sterilized the bathroom, including taking the guts of the ceiling fan down and cleaning it. Finally figured out it was the mat. I use \u201c Clean Shower \u201c spray after showers, so maybe that caused a reaction. No matter the reason, that mat is gone. I don\u2019t even want to try to wash it in the washer.",

Otherwise it's wonderful! Have to edit this post, unfortunately from 4\u2b50 to 3\u2b50. Still like the product- though I need to clean it sometimes more than 2x a week. After about 2 weeks of use, the mat (I ordered clear) started to yellow, despite my constant cleaning. I'm not sure if this would be the case with the colored mats. I don't use any products (bath or cleaning) that would cause such staining, so I'm not sure what's going on.",

So if you are already having this issue just throw it out & watch your bathroom go back to smelling normal & clean. I will NOT be buying this product ever again.

One, it does have that industrial plastic / rubber smell that may bother people with sensitive nose. I would suggest washing it first before using. Another issue is it left color bleed on my brand new bathtub. Its faint in color so its not an eye sore per se but it did mar my tub so be careful when choosing color. Functionality wise, it did its job and I would give it 4 out of 5.",
