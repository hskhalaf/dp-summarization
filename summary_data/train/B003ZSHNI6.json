I like to have buttons. Pic quality is low too. I got a fuji finepix which seems to do much better and half the price. Like I said I have one nikon that is a nikon coolpix L12 that takes much better pics. Also battery life is low for this camera, especially if you use the projector.",

He even called me from his girlfriends Christmas dinner and asked if I could order one for her sister. (To her dismay prices had risen quite a bit.) He drove over 800 miles on a road trip this past weekend and used it without incident. We have a DSLR so our familiy is used to both point and shoot and fancier digital cameras.",

Touch-Screen technology also sets this Nikon compact apart, as its 3-inch, high resolution (460K-dot) Touch Screen provides fingertip control of key camera functions. The S1100pj features a variety of photo editing and drawing functions to add additional fun to the image-sharing experience. Also offers a 5x 28-140mm Zoom Nikkor glass lens, Optical VR Image Stabilization, ISO up to 6400, Motion Detection, HD (720p) movie recording, and Smart Portrait System and Touch Shutter. \n\nBuilt-in projector brings fun to any gathering\nThe Coolpix S1100pj features a new built-in projector that allows the instant sharing of both still images and movies at the touch of a button. Images can be projected up to 7 feet 10 inches at an image size of up to 47 inches diagonally. Projected images can also be viewed simultaneously on the camera's high resolution LCD screen, you can even \"draw\" on the camera's touch screen while projecting an image! In addition to photos and HD movie clips, you can also project data stored on a PC. This adds potential for use in business situations as well as for livening up gatherings and parties. Powerpoint(TM) slides when saved as JPEGS can be projected as well. Use the S1100pj as a mini-projector! \n\n\n\nVR image stabilization in action Sharper results with five advanced Nikon image stabilizing features*1\nNikon's 5-way VR Image Stabilization System utilizes both Optical lens shift and Electronic VR image stabilization systems to help produce blur-free images. High ISO 6400*2 capability allows faster shutter speeds when shooting in low light or capturing fast-moving subjects. Motion Detection automatically controls shutter speed and the ISO setting to compensate for subject movement and camera shake. And, Nikon's original BSS (Best Shot Selector) function automatically shoots a series of sequential frames and saves the one with the sharpest focus. \n*1 The camera selects and uses only the features required to optimize each image.\n*2 ISO 3200 and 6400 are available only for image sizes of 3M (2048 x 1536) or smaller. \n\nNikon's Smart Portrait System with Skin Softening\nFace-priority AF helps produce more satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure for as many as 12 faces in the framed shot. Skin Softening function detects and analyzes a framed subject's skin, and then adjusts smoothness to produce enhanced results. \n\nSmile Timer automatically releases the shutter when the subject smiles, while its Blink Proof function shoots two sequential frames, then saves the one in which the subject's eyes are widest open. Blink Warning presents an alert when it suspects that someone in the shot has blinked. In-Camera Red-Eye Fix automatically corrects any perceived red-eye effect before saving the image to memory. \n\nIntelligent automated shooting modes that promote carefree shooting\nNikon's Easy Auto Mode makes it faster and easier to capture the moment by eliminating the need to manually select a scene mode to match the intended shot. This intelligent function determines the subject, analyzes the surrounding settings, and then automatically selects the appropriate scene mode for optimal results. Subject Tracking enhances the shooting experience by following the subject's movement to ensure clear focus and quick response when that special shutter opportunity presents itself. \n\nQuick Retouch\nQuick Retouch automatically adjusts the contrast and saturation of selected photos to create an enhanced copy with the right finishing touch. \n\nSuperior Image Quality  * 14.1-megapixel CCD sensor for stunning image quality. \n * 5x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom-Nikkor Glass Lens. Versatile 28-140mm lens ranges wide to capture landscapes, zooms in to get close to the action. In the Nikkor tradition of precision optics, the high-quality glass lens delivers superb color and razor-sharp results. \n * 5-way VR Image Stabilization System \n * Optical VR Image Stabilization by lens shift minimizes the effects of camera shake. \n * Hybrid VR Image stabilization by lens shift and electronic VR. \n * Motion Detection automatically detects moving subjects and adjusts shutter speed and ISO to compensate for camera shake and subject movement. \n * High ISO up to 6400 for optimum results when shooting in low light or photographing fast-moving subjects. \n * Nikon's Best Shot Selector (BSS) automatically takes up to ten shots while the shutter is pressed, then selects and saves the sharpest image. \n * EXPEED C2 continues to expand the possibilities of photography with improved levels of image quality, fine detail and processing speed. Custom-optimized for each Coolpix model, Nikon's renowned digital image processing engine ensures outstanding images. \n\nAdvanced Functions  * Incredible Built-in projector.

Or connect the camera to a computer and project whatever's on the computer's screen. \n * 3-inch Touch Clear Color Display. High Resolution (460,000-dot) display for still images and HD movies that come alive with rich detail and improved contrast.
