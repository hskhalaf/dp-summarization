When I contacted JOOLA, they told me that they wouldn't honor their one year warranty on the table and that the damage was caused by me. After a lot of back and forth, I settled for their offer of a couple of free paddles to close the claim. I didn't have the time to go on arguing with them any longer. Next time I will choose a different brand. Beware.",

The holes were also stripped. Returning and will try to find a table that is engineered to last longer than just unpacking.",

A few weeks later, a piece that came already assembled snapped off while setting it up. It wasn't roughly handled, or forced. The table is pressboard and not made well. The piece pulled out of the pressboard - 3 of the screws just slipped out, and the other 3 crumbled the pressboard with the weight and fell out when no one was in there. You only get a 30 day return window. I've had it for 60 days, and it has only been used a few times. Don't get this brand.",

At this point you realise it's made of horrible quality pressboard and they used a handful of small screws into the pressboard to hold things together. Complete joke, waste if money, and now I have no idea how to return this massive piece of junk. Also, the halves are not actually connected... Two separate pieces which I can only imagine will get bumped and separated easily. Finally, the table bounce is totally dead. I played on it backboard style and balls barely bounce off the surface.

That isn't necessarily a bad thing but you do need a fair amount of room. It took Grandpa longer than 10 minutes to set it up - when I asked if it set up in 10 minutes he said \"Maybe 10 minutes to get it out of the box.\" We all highly recommend the table.",

First of all, assembly was really simple! It comes almost completely assembled, all you have to do is assemble the wheel brackets. It is very well made, and feels/looks really solid. It's a 2-piece table that stores so easy. The two halves line up perfectly. Very easy to roll and fold up for storage. This table is great for the average recreational player. I love playing with my kids. Great price but doesn't look cheap at all. Great quality table! Highly recommended!",

Two caveats: assembly required the proper tools to handle tightening the provided nuts and bolts, but if you have those, you are set! Also note, if it's going to be anywhere other than the ground floor, it will take two strong people to lift and move to destination, and you'll need to check your staircase dimensions to assure clearance. Storage is a breeze; very compact when fully collapsed; also love the solo play feature with half the table in storage position.",

One of my friend & neighbor bought few months before me and my son (9 yrs) started playing with friend's son and picked it very well. I simply went ahead and bought Joola for gameroom and I am very happy with my Joola. We play Table Tennis very often, even when we have 15 min before dinner or bedtime. Its our Family tournament game now. If you are looking for good quality Tennis Table I simple recommend Joola.",

So, all in all, if you want a cheap/decent table, this is fine. But if you will put many years of use, want decent customer service, more reliability, I would say put in more money and get little better table.",
