It is a good-looking neutral road shoe but its fa\u00e7ade is merely one-half of its usefulness. The other half is comprised of its features and functionality, making it a highly effective running and gym companion.",
      "pros": [
        "Based on several reviews, the Puma Tazon 6 Fracture is a shoe that has a stylish and eye-catching design",

        "Apparently, it needed a week to be broken in, and that was too long a time for them",
        "Several testers noticed that their feet easily got hot while wearing this shoe",
        "One user\u2019s opinion focused on the level of comfort from inside the shoe",
        "He said that the in-shoe feel is not comfortable enough for long runs or half Marathons",
        "The soles of the shoe felt thin, said a few testers",
        "One of them experienced the sole coming off after he ran on rough terrain"

They are slightly more padded than the previous iteration which is nice for wearing them around but not so great when lifting weights. They are comfortable but billed as cross trainers but the heel is too narrow to make them great runners and the forefoot bereft of any protection or padding for running. If you are looking for a nice black shoe to wear around these would be it but for serious cross training they are not quite the shoe you are looking for.",

But since I bough it to use as everyday shoe, I would definitely would buy same one again.",

The shoes have soft materials, and the outlook seems like $200 shoes. I would buy PUMA shoes in the future if they keep on producing products with this quality vs. price.",
