Never again. These little individually wrapped chunks of edible magic will not let you down.",

Neither box has an expiration or packaging date on them, but NO WAY are they fresh. Both boxes are going into the garbage. Horrible.

He\u2019d look excited to see what each day would bring in this calendar, but was disappointed with the monotony of the same old thing. He said the chocolates were good.

I believe that THIS was indeed the calendar from my childhood because the gifts and chocolate are exactly the same, just the calendar looks a bit different. So happy to have found this brand again! Chocolate is wrapped up and protected from absorbing any nasty plastic taste like some advent calendars have! And each window you open has a cute little story line to it! Will definitely be getting this every Christmas going forward!",

This one was fun with the little rhymes inside, especially for my 6 year old who can just read them. The boys thought the chocolate was great. It would be more fun if the chocolate came in different shapes, but we were fine with what we got. I liked that I could recycle the paper and the plastic of the packaging when done. Overall, it was fun, and worth the experience.",
