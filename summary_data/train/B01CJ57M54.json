I have someone of an anterior pelvic tilt in my lower pack which can cause pressure there and I've noticed this helps support my lower back especially when I'm squatting and deadlifting. I like that the belt itself is pretty discrete and isn't too noticeable when wearing it. I though it would start smelling from the sweat but the material is easily cleaned just by wiping after use.",

What I have noticed is, that it does create heat when worn next to the skin or over a t shirt.. It has helped support my back given its wide surface and excellent Velcro gripping power.",

It depends on how much a person sweat if the individual would need to wear a small shirt under the Fitru belt, so it does not irritate their skin. I like it because it's thick and hold in place great. I would say if you have a short body structure that it might be hard to wear. I am 5'8' so if someone was under 5'0' feet might need a shorter waist trimmer belt by width. I knew what I was ordering and it fit me the way I wanted it too. Thanks great product!",

It fits okay - Velcro works fine - just doesn't give you the robust feeling for almost $25 price you might expect. I would not recommend on price alone - there are better for less. Another lesson learned - in some cases you don't always get what you pay for. Nice transaction - quick ship - well packaged: a plus for the item.",
