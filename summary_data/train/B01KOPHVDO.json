All together these pieces should be right around $55. Get them directly from the LEGO company--they're being sold at ridiculously high prices on Amazon.",

With half the batteries gone it runs slow enough it wont jump the tracks.",

The same Power Functions kit also powers much larger train sets. On this set, we're talking Warp 9, engage!",

The details are awesome: smoke coming from the stack, functioning wheels, one train car has a tree on it that revolves as the train moves, with a miniature train circling! There are also mini 'toys' included that really added to the theme perfectly! I fully recommend! I also purchased \"LEGO City Flexible Toy Tracks Set\", since the kit has only circular track pieces, and I wanted an oval layout. Everything fits, everything works.",

Overall: A must for any LEGO fan during Christmas time. I bought this December 2017 and it really completed the Christmas tree, but the best part is that it's a LEGO Christmas train! Only thing to note is that f you want the train to encircle your Christmas presents, you will need to buy more track to enlarge the circle. The provided track is around 3 feet in diameter,so it will be hidden under the tree and by the presents.",

The train is detailed and you'll want more tracks if you intend for it to wrap around the base of a big tree. I think the amount of tracks included were the circumference of a small hula hoop.
