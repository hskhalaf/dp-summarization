Better to give as a gift than using when you know that there is missing elements (being fooled).",

I did not have several hours to figure this out although I'm pretty sure I could have installed myself. My friend took about 45 min and had everything working great! I love how my doors lock and unlock when I start the car and shut off. The horn chirp is perfect, not too loud and annoying. Keyless buttons work great. Little hard to activate but I assume it's designed to be that way so you don't accidentally hit the button, takes the tip of your finger to press correctly.",

I had never installed an alarm before in my life but I had purposely purchased this alarm since it basically had the same functions as the existing one and simply replaced it piece by piece and ultimately, it worked. The keyless entry devices have a strong signal and I can arm/disarm from a good distance away and I have never had a problem with it.",

Instead, the circuitry to interrupt the starter is integrated into the main unit. I was skeptical of this and decided not to use it on my install 3) The remotes are preprogrammed and so you dont need to worry about programming them.",
