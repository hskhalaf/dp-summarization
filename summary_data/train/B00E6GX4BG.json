Only 4 stars for versatility because the cable to connect to the computer port is rather short. The device comes with an instruction booklet, which is hardly necessary, but might be helpful in the odd case of problems. However, the booklet has a typo in the \u201cConnection is slow\u201d troubleshooting section. It refers to needing to plug the unit into a USB 2.0 port. This should say USB 3.0. This is probably a holdover from the instruction booklet for a previous version, a bit of sloppy editing. A very minor flaw in the product.",

They plug in, they are recognized. The hub's power supply drives them all quite well (including moderate loads -- short LED strips, sensors, RF, etc.). Improvements I'd like: A longer USB cord (to the PC) and a power supply that wasn't a wall wart (one that had a short power cable to the AC outlet as well as a longer power cable to the hub). But, for $18 or so, I'd definitely buy it again. And the next time I need one, I definitely will.",
