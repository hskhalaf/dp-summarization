Will not recommend. Even for smaller children, not worth the money to get less than two minutes of entertainment. You failed on this one ALEX.",

My daughter has just been to a henna party and we bought this \"Totally Henna\" from Alex so she could make henna tattoos at home for herself and her friends. The \"henna\" looks nice when it's first applied but after one washing it's gone. This is not henna. This is an overpriced package of washable magic markers. My 8 year old is in tears because she's so disappointed with the product.",
