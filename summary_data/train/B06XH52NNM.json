And the replacement would've been more expensive. After trying all the Haier codes (none of which worked), I attempted to do the \"Automatic code finding method\", which found the code for the TV. So if none of the codes provided work for your TV, don't give up! Try the automatic code finding method in the manual. I love the sleek design and small form factor. It feels nice in the hand. Definitely recommend and will buy more if I need spare remotes in the future!",

It consistently lost stored codes, and the only code for the sound bar did not provide any functionality beyond volume control.

Both of them worked with the first Panasonic TV code in the instructions: 5821. I was instantly able to power on/off, change changes, scroll through channels, adjust volume, change input sources, recall previous channels, etc. As a bonus, this remote also directly controls the Amazon Fire Stick without any additional setup so that worked immediately as well. The remote itself is small to medium sized (bigger than a streaming device remote like a Fire Stick but bigger than normal TV remotes I am accustomed to), very light, and easy to use.",
