      "text": "My wife bought these for me after I was going insane spending 20 minutes every time I needed to find a right sized Tupperware for leftovers. This set only has 3 sizes of lids and the lids stack and lock to each other as well as the bottom of the containers they cover. The containers stack as well, and the different sized containers can nest inside each other. However, I like to keep stacks of containers that fit specific lids in separate stacks so I don't have to pull containers out of each other. These are perfect for people who are OCD about their food storage containers and like to keep them in nice stacks.",

Not very thermal or microwave proof. In the dishwasher they have gotten thermal cracks. In the microwave they get that old plastic dish scuffed up dirty wall look (not sure how else to describe it). Pros 1. They stack really nicely and clip into each other which prevents them from falling and getting disorganized. 2. All different shapes and sizes really do accommodate most needs. Overall I might buy this product again but would probably prefer stackable glass storage supplies for the cons listed.",

The sauce/topping size ones are particularly useful even when you're going to consume something right away. Great for putting ketchup in and chomping down on some fries!",

Hey, Rubbermaid, I dare you to publish a video of someone trying to attach one of these lids. It will, no doubt, end with the container being thrown in the trash.

They're inexpensive and will serve a temporary purpose, but if I had to do it all over again, I would have looked for the more substantial containers.",

I've always liked Rubbermaid products and they've helped me organize my kitchen. Some of these containers will crack if they're full and dropped from 5 feet off the ground (I'm a little clumsy) but that's honestly to be expected. Dropped from a shorter distance and they're fine. I'd honestly choose Rubbermaid over Tupperware every time.",

(As long as I don't use the original black lids in the microwave, they are fine for safety. I don't recommend using lids in the microwave anyway. Use wrap, a paper plate or a plate from the dollar store.)",

In fact I use them more often than the larger containers; to mix small amounts of sauces in, to hold small measurements of ingredients while I'm cooking, to store small amounts of leftovers or snacks. The larger containers are exactly what I expected and wanted originally, so overall I'm very satisfied with this set.",

I have more little sauce things than I know what to do with; I feel like this set was made for someone preparing several lunches, and while I appreciate the small containers for snacks, I really don't need that many. This was however the best price for plastic ware I found, and I really like the easy find lids, which make storage so much easier than my previous dollar store containers.",

There are many, many small ones, so this set is best if you save smaller quantities of food and don't cook for a large family. They are nice for taking lunch to work. Also, they include super tiny ones that seal well for soy sauce, mayo or other condiments.",

They hold sandwiches, small salads, and salad dressings to pack with lunch These make good lunch containers and for holding small amounts of leftovers. Not for serious amounts of leftovers.
