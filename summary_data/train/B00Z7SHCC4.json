The only thing I do when I get these is I remove the clear plastic built in screen protector. If you want a screen protector then put your own on the screen and skip the built in one (I recommend glass). All the built in one will do it get dirt under it and scratch your screen anyway. Just make sure after you remove it to make sure all the glue tape it removed as well. I just run my phone with no screen protector and everything is fine.",

      "text": "Great case so far. I've already dropped my phone several times from 3-4 feet high, and this case managed to protect my iPhone as expected. No cracked screen, no scratches. Love the convenient belt clip as well. FYI, if you plan on using a tempered glass screen protector, then this case won't fit unless you remove the screen cover on the otterbox. After removing the OtterBox's screen cover, it will fit your iPhone + tempered glass screen protector with no problem.",

It does require a smaller/narrower \u201ctip\u201d on the charging cable (the AmazonBasics braided cable is too big to fit the space for the charging port.)
