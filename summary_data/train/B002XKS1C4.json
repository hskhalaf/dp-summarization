The cases are well-built, good looking, and we will buy another set when we are ready to travel because now that our first two are out of the house, they've ended up taking all our luggage with them.

The zipper snagged a bit, but I decided to keep it, as that it wasn't that big of a deal. I inspected the case further and located a section of the rim about 2\" to 2 1/2\" long that had not been sewn together (see photo).",

No issues with the pull handle either. I think as long as you have normal use, this product is great.

All the rolling bags fit inside each other so you can bring an empty suitcase as checked baggage very easily. The wheels feel solid. The interior is very plain with very few compartments and organizers but there is little wasted space. The locks included are useless but the product overall is priced very nicely even if you don't have to count the locks. Would buy again. Will update the review if any problems occur.",

The largest suitcase seems to be much sturdier in all aspects of construction, but the small rolling bag is cheap and not very reliable.

It broke on the first roll out of the car to the airport. Will be attempting to contact manufacturer as well, since these products are supposed to be guaranteed for workmanship and quality under normal use for a short period.",
