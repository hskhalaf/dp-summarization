My previous cover had straps that went under the boat, and they were a bear to put in place. If you need a longer strap you can put two together. So far, quite impressed! I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because invariably boat covers wear out or are blown out after a couple years. You may consider getting the next larger size.

      "text": "The 17-19\u2019 size fit my 18\u2019 open bow ski boat lengthwise very well. It is plenty wide, which required the use of taller support poles than my previous cover. Actually I like the extra height. Also I like that it includes straps to go over the top as well as straps to tie down to the trailer. So far The quality seems much better than the last 600D 2year warranty cover it replaced. This one is a different brand and hopefully is more durable. Time will tell. I will update you in 2021.",

Of course it's back in storage now that it's fall. I have a 21in Chris Craft and it fit perfectly! It's worth every cent! I wouldn't waste my money on anything else.",

The only thing I was disappointed with was that the bag would not fit over my kicker motor. I have an 8 horse mercury trolling motor and the cover was just barely too small to fit over the motor.",

Strap positions in good spots and work great. Can strap either to trailer frame, or run long straps under boat belly when not using for trailering. Material is heavy and should hold up well. So far, rain beads up and runs off nicely. A couple early snowfalls didn't affect it at all and there was no sagging. Lastly, this cover does indeed have an air vent (to relieve trailering wind pressure) on each side at the rear. Very happy with purchase.",

However while the measurements I took were correct for the size cover I needed I didn't factor in the the railings on the front of the boat which made the cover too tight to fully cover boat (the width ended up being too short). I fully recommend this product based on the quality and feel but just make sure you factor in things like that into your measurements.",
