But, for now, it is a good watch for the price point that it is currently at.",

Only the wrist band is short enough to call it a kid's watch. I think it's bulky, but my daughter still loved it. Unfortunately, the second hand was broken right out of the box. It came loose and just dangled there. We returned it for a replacement. That new watch worked fine for only two weeks. The second hand again fell off it's mount. With the exact same thing happening twice in a row, this is clearly a manufacturing defect. I would recommend shopping for a different manufacturer.",
