However after one pizza cheese mishap, scrubbing with paper towels and washing 3 times in the dishwasher, this non stick pan is stuck on dirty mode. As seen in the pictures, it's not coming clean! A non stick pizza pan should at least be able to handle a little spilled mozzarella! Went from 4 star to 2 ..and after I bought 3 of them. Getting good better pan next time.",
