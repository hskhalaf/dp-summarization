As long as you know what to expect from a table in this price range I don't think you will be disappointed. If you compare it to tables of similar construction you will be happy, if you compare it and expect balls to roll and bounce off the rails as a higher priced slate board you will be disappointed. Balls don't roll as fast and the bounce off the rails are not as strong. However, if you are aware of that you will be happy.",

Once fully assembled everything works great and function as promised but after awhile the legs seem to get a little wobbly. It's great for practice and if you're looking to have fun, but if you're competitive and want a quality pool table I'd recommend looking for another. The ping pong table worked great and was easy to set up on top of the pool table. Great for party games too!",

When I purchased this, I didn't really care about the table tennis aspect -- it's just an added bonus. I will say, though, that you will definitely need to get some better cues than the ones that come with the table (I went to Sears and picked up a couple for $20 each). Highly recommended!",

The plastic pocket nets are warped and not staying trimmed properly around the pockets. Also, the pocket nets are only large enough to hold about 3 balls before you have to spread the balls out in order for more to fit...otherwise leading to a missed shot.",
