      "text": "This scanner is only ok. Since the feeder is short, the pages often end up skewed. You can try to unskew using their software but it's less than ideal. The bigger problem is that within two weeks (and probably only after scanning 25 pages, the scanner constantly reports there is not paper in the scanner. The auto holder has the paper, but the machine doesn't register that it's there. It can scan after alot of manual adjustments to the machine, but now it's page by page and totally inefficient. Will be shopping for a better scanner. Would have returned if I had kept packaging.",
