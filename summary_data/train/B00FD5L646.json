It was fine at the start, but then started to lose its shape. Before long, the outer edges began to get very loose and annoying when handling the iPad. The outer case became so stretched, I had to try to use the \"boiling technique\" to return it to its original form. Although it was better for a short period of time, the outer case bagan to stretch worse than the first time. I've since given up and now looking for a new case. This one is not worth the money, sorry to say.",

The case is very durable and protects the IPad nicely, it even has a built in screen protector. The screen protector does affect the touch screen sensibility slightly but not enough to make a big difference and is a acceptable compromise for the protection it offers. The only downside is the cost. For some reason the price of the case for the 2nd generation IPad Air is a lot more than the other IPads.",

The case is substantial and hefty leaving me with a secure feeling about my $500 apple investment. The tilting function is a nice feature that will get plenty of use. Would have been nice to be able to access that function w/o removing the lower shell, however that is a minor complaint. Very happy with this product overall and would definitely recommend it.",

The screen cover is translucent and does not effect the touch sensation. I have not used the stand by it's nice to know there is a stand if I ever need it. You could also use the back/stand to cover the iPad completely. At first I felt the cost was a bit expensive but now I believe it was worth the price.",

After hobbling down the rest of the stairs I was sure to discover a shattered screen, at best. Rather, I found the IPad and case in perfect working order.",

The only thing I don't like about it is that the otter box screen sticks to my screen protector in the inside of the case causing this bubble effect.",
