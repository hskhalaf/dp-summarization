      "text": "I bought this horn at the beginning of the school year, in September 2019. My son has been learning on it all year. The horn is surprisingly nice! The valves are all well tooled and work well. There is a bit of a challenge for new players to figure out where the spit is to empty, but all of the loops are easily removable as long as you have them greased. The instrument has a good sound. Mouth piece was junk, after putting a small bore 6 1/2 mouth piece on the instrument, the sound was very rich. For the price, this instrument is a good little investment.",

It sounds good and is quite compact. I started playing brass instrument way back in 1973 starting with the sousaphone so I know my brass instruments. It's A nice sounding horn that's worth it's weight in brass.",

My only and major issue is that no matter what I do, I am unable to clear the spit or condensation that is created from playing it. There is only 1 spit valve and that doesn't clear the spit. I have continuously removed all of the slides in an attempt to rid the instrument of the spit however nothing works. After 10 minutes of playing the instrument, it crackles terribly due to built up spit that can't seem to be removed.",
