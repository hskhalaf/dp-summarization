Always use a test strip before waxing to make sure the temperature is not too hot. It heated the wax up quickly and kept it at a constant temperature.

As a licensed esthetician sanitation is very important to me and from a sanitation standpoint this just doesn\u2019t cut it. Dust & dirt can get in through the holes and contaminate the wax. Also, the auto-shut off mechanism is unpredictable and doesn\u2019t make it easy to use. You have to wait for it to turn back on regardless if the wax is completely melted or not. I definitely would not recommend buying this for professional use",

I put my hard wax beans in & turned it on high & within about 5 or so minutes my wax was ready to be used! Love, love, love it & would recommend you to buy it....",

      "text": "I ordered this on July 18th and it got to me August 5th so it did take a little while to arrive but it wasn't terrible. The box was kind of beaten up, it wasn't secured too well and I was worried about the product not working. It worked fine, heats up pretty quick and the removable container makes it easier to clean out any wax. It's very simple to use and pretty self explanatory. I wouldn't say it's the best wax heater I've seen but it's definitely worth what you pay for it.",
