I use it once when we first got it and it worked for all of 3 minutes before it stopped osculating. I reached out to Greenworks and that was a month ago, still no reply and the nozzle has rust on it from ONE use for all of three minutes! Are you kidding me? Bottom line is the pressure washer seems great for the money. Just hope you don't need the turbo nozzle or Greenworks to back the product!",

This was our first power washer though so we, perhaps stupidly, did not realize that when you turn it on nothing happens. You\u2019ve got to turn it on AND start spraying for the power to engage. Once we figured this out it was all down hill from there. Perfect for brick facing, side walks, and even getting old paint off the deck.",

It also never mentioned in the manual you need pump lubricant for pressure washers. This one received the best rating on Amazon for all the Greenworks units.

Easy to assemble out of the box, I was up and running in 5 min. The cord is pretty long and they don't recommend using an extension so that's a bit limiting but that didn't cause an issue.
