      "text": "Overall the bag is good. Plenty of storage and the club slots are great. The cooler pocket can hold about four 12 oz. cans, I would avoid putting ice in the pocket though cause there is a ventilated hole at the bottom and it will leak water into other pockets as well. The base of the bag is not the best as well, I learned not to load the bag with balls and accessories, that helps with the stability. It\u2019s worth buying, great cart bag, not a great range bag.",
