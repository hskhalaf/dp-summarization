I have looked everywhere for a fix and tried everything to roll back to previous firmware and it still doesn't work. My biggest issue is that I called customer service, and not only was the guy who I spoke with VERY rude, he hung up on me. I was never rude to him even though he was extremely condescending. I am disappointed that I gave this company my business. So beware!",

Very frustrated and disappointed in this product and it seems someone needs to figure out what is doing on!! At this point I would not recommend this product to anyone.

Filled with owners reporting the same issue. DJI doesn't care. DJI wants $300 to replace gimbal/camera. Won't cover under 1 year warranty. DO NOT buy a DJI product. They do not honor warranty.

The pictures and video from this drone is very good quality and the camera is easy to operate once you get used to the controls. My suggestion would be to take this to a football or soccer field and practice flying this before going full on flying.",

I use it a lot at the beach and couldn't be happier with this drone. 4k video is exceptional without fisheye effect. Previous drone was the Parrot Beebop which can't even compare with this one. Great range with lightbridge controller and very very easy to fly. You can't go wrong with the professional 3.",

My only regret is not getting the second battery. I will have to pay extra and get a second battery later on. If you are about to buy this quad - step up and take the option with the second battery.",

    "title": "DJI Phantom 3 Professional Quadcopter 4K UHD Video Camera Drone",
    "description": "The Phantom 3 Professional continues the proud tradition of DJI's Phantom series and brings several important innovations to the Phantom's rich feature set. The Phantom 3 Professional carries a fully stabilized 3-axis 4k UHD video camera for smooth, crisp videos and still photos. To allow you to see what the drone sees, DJI has engineered a new generation of their Lightbridge technology that allows 720p HD digital streaming of live video directly from the drone. You can control the camera and see video in real time as you fly and you can even share the video using the DJI Pilot app's advanced features. To aid indoor flying, the Phantom 3 Professional includes an integrated array of optical and ultrasonic sensors call Vision Positioning that allows you to fly precisely indoors without a GPS signal. The Phantom 3 Professional includes all the tried-and-true features you'd expect from a DJI drone, including GPS navigation with auto takeoffs and auto landings, intelligent high power flight battery, a built-in safety database of no fly zones, and a powerful mobile app for your iOS or Android device.\n\nNote: DJI has locked your Phantom from being able to even start the motor if you live within a 15 mile radius of the White House. This encompasses not only D.C. but much of Prince Georges County, Arlington, Fairfax, Silver Spring, Falls Church and Montgomery County. DJI does not warn you of this prior to purchase. Outside of this 15 mile radius, the drone works great, but be aware, that if you bought it and live within the restricted zone, you will not be able to fly it, even on your own property. \n\nSET CONTAINS:\n\n\n * Aircraft Body (1)\n * Remote Controller (1)\n * Propeller Pairs (4)\n * Intelligent Flight Battery (1)\n * Battery Charger (1)\n * Power Cable (1)\n * Phantom 3 Professional / Advanced Safety Guidelines and Disclaimer (Manual)\n * Phantom 3 Professional / Advanced Intelligent Flight Battery Safety Guidelines (Manual)\n * Phantom 3 Professional Quick Start Guide (Manual)\n * Gimbal Clamp (1)\n * Vibration Absorbers (4)\n * 16GB Micro-SD Card (1)\n * Micro-USB Cable (1)\n * Anti-drop Kit (2)\n * Landing Pads (4)\n * Propeller Wrench (1)\n * Stickers (5 - Gold, Silver, Red, Blue, Pink)",
