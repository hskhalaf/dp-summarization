Causes frustration to a point they don\u2019t want to wear the shoes, despite prior versions being their favorite. Holds up well from hiking in New Zealand to general playground wear.

Next the insoles came loose and my son has to painstakingly smooth them out want time he wears them. And now part of the side sole is separating from the shoe.

      "text": "I have purchased Keen's for my 10 year old son since he was about 3. The shoes have always been great. I recently purchased this style for him and within a couple of weeks the tightening strap that goes around the side of the shoe broke. I am going to attempt to a warranty claim, but not expecting much. Of course, the local shoe store was going to be out of stock for over a month, so I bought them online.",
