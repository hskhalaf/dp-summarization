They're squared off at the end so about 30% of your taco actually hangs off of the back of the dinosaur and with the tacos being a loose fit inside of it as well means that they're more likely to fall off onto the plate or the floor then they are to end up in your mouth.

Pros: Strong plastics Perfect serving size (2 tacos) Decorative Definitely met expectations Cons: Functionality Ability to hold toppings is poor (Reason for only four stars)",
