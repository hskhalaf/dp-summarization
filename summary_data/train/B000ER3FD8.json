Organic foods are produced without the use of potentially harmful chemicals and synthetic pesticides or growth hormones. This is even more important when we consider infants. For four to six months following birth, infants receive most of their nutrition from breast milk or infant formula. It is so important that these formulas contain the safest ingredients.\n\nIf ingested, potential toxic chemicals or heavy metals can lead to compromised immune system development. Likewise, young infants consume disproportionately high levels of fruits and vegetables when compared to adults. This increases their risk of exposure to potential contaminants found among non-organic products. Finally, Earth's Best products do not contain genetically engineered ingredients (GEIs), made by inserting genes from one plant into a strain of another to produce more crops or control pests.\n\nWhy organic? It is better for you, your child and the environment they will grow up in.\n\nThe Earth's Best Difference:\n * Organic ingredients grown without harmful pesticides\n * No Genetically Engineered Ingredients (GEIs)\n * Most items made only from whole grains\n * No added salt, modified starches or refined sugars\n * No artificial flavors, colors or preservatives\n * Kosher (excluding meat varieties)\n * Rigorous product testing\n   \n\nAs your little one grows, you'll have to make a lot of choices.
