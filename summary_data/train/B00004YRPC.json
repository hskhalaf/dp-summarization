I teach elementary PE and I have several of these models for my older elementary student's (even as low as 2nd graders who are more experienced use them). These compared to the lower weight version provide more bounce for more advanced kids or my heavier kids. I'm 6' 0\" and 180 lbs. and these actually allow me to demonstrate (with minimal bottoming out). I've had advanced students weighing as little as 60 lbs. using these pogo sticks just fine and they can actually sky fairly high (a foot high or so :) ).",

Unfortunately he does not use it much because it hurts to use. He loved his old one and we couldn't get him off it. Bounces great though and right size for his age.",

As it arrived damaged in handling. But in 8 business days I received the replacement completely padded & unharmed, two thumbs up to sender. He got to try it out finally & mastered no hands by the end of the night! He's excited to grow with his new Flybar pogo stick! Durable, high quality, just the right amount of springy. Thank you!!",

      "text": "My son loves the pogo stick but need to mention 1 thing. 80 lbs is the min weight, much lighter and you can't actuate the spring without a lot of work. I guess it will last longer this way but would have been nice to know ahead of time but it may be our fault for not reading description accurately. 1st update: after a solid day of use, our son has mastered the technique and is really enjoying the stick. I agree, with more weight you will get more bounce but this way he will have to master the pogo before going crazy.",

Well mine is 65 pounds and she can't get it to really bounce- just not enough weight. Actually i'm not even sure 80 pounds would do it- i am 135 and it was perfect for me so if you have little ones, don't waste your money, go buy a smaller stick. This would be fantastic for a bigger kid. Seemed to be good quality though. i guess i will put it up until she gets bigger.....much bigger.",

The sleeve is a very cheaply made plastic covering, that appears to serve no useful purpose other than cosmetic (otherwise I would have given a much lower rating). If that sleeve is designed for protection against anything pinching in the main spring, then I'd rate the product quite differently. The plastic sleeve was rendered useless after about 2 minutes worth of basic use. Otherwise a very solid product.",
