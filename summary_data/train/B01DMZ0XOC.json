It is for me, by far, a well-made product that stands out far from the others in value. The features are nicely thought out with quality in mind. It is functionally superb and appealing as well, the mounting methods and hardware included makes this possible. I would highly recommend this range hood to anyone! I will post pictures soon when all is completed and in addition, more details of its use of effectiveness.",

This one works! Very happy with our purchase and have recommended to others. Instructions were \ud83d\ude12, but a quick call to the company answered our question of where the small rubber pads were to be screwed in. Turns out, there are already screws in the spots.

      "text": "I was unable to purchase the carbon filters at my initial order. I was instructed to receive the package, collect the serial number of the hood, then order the filter based on the serial number. This suggests to me that the filter was changed mid-production run and there are different styles of filters based upon the serial number sequence of the hood. Maybe in the future, when the old style filters are phased out, the filter can just be included or specified for the ease of customer ordering?",
