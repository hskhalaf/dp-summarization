It's basics are easy and the strategy in designing your ranch is really fun. Plus it's great for all ages even a six year old I'm confident could do alright with enough challenge for older adults in optimizing the game. Great game for kids and adults. I bought this copy just because I wanted a physical one for my shelf and to support the developer who added tons of content to the game for free after release.",

If you're into farming games this is a very unique experience that I wouldn't pass up. Highly recommend.",
