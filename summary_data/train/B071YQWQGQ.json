The pieces are smaller than the Purina Dentalife dental treats that we are currently using. The Purina chews are more ball shaped whereas the Feline Greenies are sort of flat. For us this was a total bust. I will try returning these as they just can't be used.",

They're harder than basic dry treats, but not rock-hard like some brands. Overall, I was happy to find \"Greenies\" they liked -- I've tried a couple of other varieties (including Greenies' hairball version) that they wouldn't touch. Also, chicken is the first ingredient, unlike a corn-forward brand I tried and discarded. Recommended for treats, but unclear on how well the dental aspect works.",

The dentist recommended these after, to avoid more plaque and better overall oral health moving forward and the price was right so I have it a whirl. They are sort of hard, and I may have introduced them to said fat cat too soon after her dental with her tender mouth, because she loved them initially but she isn't a super fan of them anymore. That being said I mix them in with her dry food and she sucks them down like a Hoover vacuum. So far, so good as far as dental health. Will continue use.",
