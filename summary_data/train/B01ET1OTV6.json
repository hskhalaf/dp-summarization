Although it was initially a little tricky getting the orb to \"float\" over the base, I was able to do it on one try after a few more tries. (You have to lower the Orb from above the base ( about 6\") until you feel the base guiding you to the ideal \"float\" location.) It will practically take the Orb out of your hands. The sound is very good, and it was easy to pair with my tablet or cell phone. Sent the following video to my friends.",

It's one of those 'we're not in Kansas anymore' experiences, over and over again. One thing that I really like is that if you spin the globe in one direction or another, it will keep spinning at about 15 revolutions per minute forever. At least over a three day weekend. Using it with my iPhone as a speaker is just a plus. The sound is great. I've had it about two months, operating continuously since I bought it. Now I would like a big one, like three feet.",

To use the charging feature youll have to use tge cord they give you so dont get confused with the magnetic platform as a charging base.

Advice for future customers keep fingers under the speaker to avoid from magnet making connection with speaker.) And amazingly cool product!",

It does take a little practice to get it in just the right spot for it to float but once it's floating it looks really cool. We cranked it up and the sound is great from such a small device. It looks really cool at night and it's a great decorative piece too. I will probably get one for myself too cause it was such a good little speaker.",

The magnetic base comes with a port which charges your speaker ball directly so that it keeps floating while playing your favorites tracks for long hours. That\u2019s not just it, the port can also be used for charging your smartphones and acts as a charging hub. So now instead of having multiple wires on your work desk, the base can be used to act as a powerhouse for your smartphones. It also houses the 4 green balancing LEDs, which are used to balance the speaker ball when getting it to float - making it easier for you to balance the floating speaker by following the flickering of the 4 green LED indicators.\n\n\n\n\nBluetooth & NFC Bluetooth and NFC Connectivity lets you connect your smartphone/tablet to the 7 Arc Star in more than one ways! Simply select the 7 Arc Star from your list of available Bluetooth devices or tap your NFC enabled smartphone on the top green indicator on the ball and that\u2019s it! It\u2019s connected!\n\nSmartphone Charging Dock With a 1500 mAh built-in battery, the magnetic base can be used to charge your smartphones even when the speaker ball is floating above it, letting you play your music with the 7 Arc Star and charge your smartphones with it simultaneously. Its acts a charging dock for your 1A rated devices.\n\n360\u00b0 Sound The 7 Arc Star has no so-called \u2018back of the speaker\u2019, letting you use it anywhere without having to worry about your music getting obstructed or the sound being subjected to a unidirectional projection from the speaker system .
