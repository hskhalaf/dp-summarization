I've used the snot out of it ever since, especially for pruning and keeping the trails in my woods clear. It was a pretty good saw, not quite as heavy duty as the old milwaukee. This new one is very heavy duty, I've already done quite a bit of work with it, you won't be disappointed. It is kind of aggressively vibraty, but not a problem (or a word)...",
