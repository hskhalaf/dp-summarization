The coffee if good as long as you get the grounds into the right place but if it's even a little damp they stick and clog so you get no coffee. Picture shows how much sticks if it's dry when you start",

      "text": "Although I am not an advocate of keeping brewed coffee hot in the carafe for an extended period time, it would be nice if this coffee maker could provide warmth to the carafe for a determined amount of time, to keep the freshly brewed coffee hot. Perhaps a timer, the consumer could set, that a heating element could keep the coffee at serving temperature. A suggestion: heating element to the carafe could be turned off or set to work, up to two (2) hours, after brewing. Other than this coffee maker is extremely difficult to clean, the flavor it provides, is stellar. If this functionality is available, please let me know.",

Also; remove grinding mechanism and thoroughly clean/dry after each use or eventually you won't be able to remove the unit at all, as we found. Coffee has reasonably good flavor but grinds don't get evenly soaked, so some coffee grind waste.",

The grind option hasn't been used yet but so glad I read the instruction manual before I attempted to make coffee. My advice, read the manual first.

All that would be ok if the coffee was decent, but I have to put in almost 2x the coffee beans, there is no way to adjust strength.

      "text": "First, the design is so inefficient it uses twice as many beans as what would normally be required for a typical cup of coffee. That gets expensive. Second, it's utterly frustrating to use if you're attempting to make more than half a pot because randomly at times, the works just seem to jam up. The last thing I need to hear is the \"finished\" beep going off and all that's in the pot is hot, clear water, and the filter swimming with un-dripped coffee. An absolute horridly designed piece of junk. I'm tossing mine off my roof when it stops raining.",

I think it's probably a problem with the lid off the carafe, but when I check everything for obvious causes, I can't find anything. Looks just fine until you try to make coffee again. I don't see a return or refund option anywhere, so I will just have to swallow the loss of $99 for a coffee maker that doesn't work after five months and get an old school cheap glass carafe-one at the store today.",

The quality of that water is as important as the quality of your coffee. If water doesn't taste good from the tap, it won't taste good in your coffee. That's why Cuisinart has added a water filter to the Grind & Brew Coffeemaker. The charcoal filter removes chlorine, bad tastes, and odors, for the purest coffee flavor, every time you brew. \n\nElement 2: Coffee\nWhile coffee is 98% water, all of the flavor comes from the beans. To achieve the same great taste you enjoy at a coffee bar, you need to use the same quality of coffee. \n\nBuy the beans fresh and whole, only about two weeks' supply at a time for maximum freshness. Once the coffee bean is broken, its flavor degrades very quickly. That's why the Grind & Brew grinds your coffee just prior to brewing. If it is not practical to buy small supplies, separate larger amounts of beans into one to two week portions immediately after purchase, and freeze them in airtight containers. \n\nThe best way to maximize freshness is to minimize exposure to air, light, and moisture. So, once beans have been removed from the freezer, maintain them in a sealed container at room temperature, since damaging condensation occurs every time the beans are removed from the freezer or refrigerator. Note that some coffee experts advise against freezing dark-roast beans, because freezing can cause the oils to coagulate. Other experts disagree. We suggest you experiment and decide for yourself.\n\nElement 3: Grind\nThe grind is critical for proper flavor extraction. If the grind is too fine, over-extraction and bitterness will result. Too fine a grind may also clog the filter. If grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too quickly and the maximum flavor will not be extracted. The Grind & Brew is preset for a medium grind, the optimal grind for this type of coffeemaker. \n\nElement 4: Proportion\nCoffee that is too strong or too weak is always a disappointment. Follow the recommended portions of ground coffee in the instructions included with every Grind & Brew, and later adjust the amount to suit your taste. The Grind & Brew makes up to twelve (12) 5-ounce cups of coffee",
