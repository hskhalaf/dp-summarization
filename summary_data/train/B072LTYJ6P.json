      "text": "This Sauna is fantastic! Don't worry if 15 minutes pass and you have not started sweating, because at 20 minutes you begin to sweat like crazy! If you place a white towel on the chair in the Sauna, you can visibly see the toxins that come out of your body. I feel very refreshed after exiting the Sauna. I love it, so I spend 45 minutes in it. Just get out if you start feeling uncomfortable. I'm am going to buy another one right now to gift to someone I love dearly.",

I sit in it for 30 minutes at 135 and only my back (where the heat element is located) gets sweaty. 2. The smell hasn\u2019t gone away. It\u2019s a heated plastic odor that is a bit obnoxious. 3. The chair that came with it broke. Specifically, the plastic corner screw cap and it looked like it stripped possibly due to the heat exposure. Overall it\u2019s an okay device for body aches but should not be considered a true sauna by any means.",

I usually sit in the gym steam room and dry sauana and dont sweat nearly as much as I do in this portable sauana. Highly recommended!",

I used one of those airplane pillows to hold my head up and I just pushed it up against the wall. I almost fell asleep it was so comfortable. I have never sweat like that in my other sauna.
