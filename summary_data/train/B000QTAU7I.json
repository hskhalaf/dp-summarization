      "text": "I needed a shredder at my home to destroy mail. I recently become paranoid about identity left after a special on CNN.. but I digress. This little guy packs a big punch! I have used it to shred whole pieces of mail without even opening them and credit cards. It was able to handle both without any trouble. Due to its small size it isn't great for shredding stacks of paper, so it is better for the once in a while user. I attached some photos to give you a better idea of the size. I give this 5 stars because the manufactures description is spot on and the price-to-value-ratio can\u2019t be beat.",

So I\u2019m happy to say it\u2019s SUPER strong. My neighbors has the amazon basics one and I\u2019ve used it- this white Aurora one is slightly less loud and slightly more strong! I can tell it\u2019s higher quality and I love that there is a storage space for the power cord with the divets up top. Buy it you will be happy like me !",

      "text": "If you're looking for a small shredder for light use, this one is well-made and fits perfectly on the corner of a desk. The key words are small and light use. Agree with other reviews that the opening is an odd size - an 8-1/2x11 sheet of paper folded in half is just slightly too big to fit. But it works fine for shredding typical mail folded in thirds. For a few pieces of junk mail a day and the occasional credit card, it's great, since the mail comes pre-folded and I can empty the container every few days. But if you have to shred full-size sheets, or a large volume of mail, I would recommend a standard size shredder.",

If you place them in horizontally, the shredder will cut them in lines of text, while vertically results in just random letters.",

      "text": "This didn't last one week. I fed it half of the maximum amount of paper the manufacturer suggested and it jammed instantly. There's a \"feature\" on the shredder that says it assists in clearing jams, it doesn't. The worst part is that when the shredder jams it will still feed so the paper will be forced into the only open side of the shredder, jamming that side. I was very careful and never overfed the shredder and it jammed over and over. Don't waste your money, this is the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon.",

Catalogs have envelopes with a sticky flap to seal it stapled in the middle of it with the customer name on them. With this shredder, I have to be more mindful of sorting what can be shredded vs. what can't. Another plus is that it takes up less space. It's perfect for my needs.",

The individual shredding operation is fast, a little noisy, and the shredded paper catcher easily separates from the machine. I would give it a higher rating if the slot were wider. It is good for small operations; but, in my opinion, not for medium ones unless you have too much time on your hands.",
