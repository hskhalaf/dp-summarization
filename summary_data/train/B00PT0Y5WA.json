      "text": "I normally don't play games that have elves and fairies in them, but I make an exception for this one as it's a solid tower defense style game that's surprisingly captivating with lots of options and upgrades possible to keep things interesting. A round can last fifteen minutes or so, making it a great time-killer. Easy to learn and gameplay is challenging but it can be won, with three levels of difficulty. The game plays smoothly and well on my Kindle Fire HD. The original game in the series is still free if you want a sampling, but this more highly refined version offers bang for your buck, and it's a keeper!",

I tried this one first and then went on to play the other two Rush games and liked them all. I don't really think the order you play them in matters much. They have a little humor and require a little speed and strategy to complete each level. I finished all the games with the base characters so that was a pleasant surprise. Works well on Gen 2 and 4 Kindle Fires. Highly recommend!",

I think maybe the feel of it, being a tad more mythically Medieval (focusing on Elves and all) really drew me in. The levels look more like they belong in Middle Earth, and are very pleasing to look at. I also feel like this one was a bit more challenging than the first (although it has been a while since I played the first one). Either way, of the two of them, this is the one I find myself going back to time and time again.",

Most of them have to be bought with real money instead of unlocking. I feel like instead of paying for it you could unlock them in a series of harder and harder challenges. You only get about 5 free hero's out the whole gallery. Something to think about for the next installment developers.",

I highly recommend it. The one down side to this game (if you are familiar with previous games), is that it is a bit short.",

However, I will say that the near-dependence on micro transactions isn't necessary; if you're going to make us grind for gems, at least explain what conditions are necessary to obtain them easily, rather than making it random. Other than that, though, this game is great, and for 99 cents, it's a bargain for what you get.",
