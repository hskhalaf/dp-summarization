I started to use the cream full of good expectations.. but unfortunately from the first trial my eyes and also the area besides my eyes became etchy sensative and red. I had tears throughout the day.. and the area besides my eyes became red. After several days with out using the product I tried it again. Just to understand if this was the cause for the problem. It happened again immediately. Even after I washed the cream still again for the next few days I got red around my eyes and tears and my eyes were really painfull.",

I use it in the morning and it makes me appear more awake and alert, smells great, and definitely brightens up the under eye area. I've only been using for a few days, but noticed a small difference very quickly. Can't wait to see how it works long-term!",
