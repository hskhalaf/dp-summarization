It does take me some times to build this, 2 hour maybe, this can be shorten at least 1 hour if you use the real tool( which I had and stupid enough not to use it) instead of the small tool that came with the package. I did not found the needle that required to pump the basketball, but in has the hand-pump. The electron device that is programmed for many games and up to 4 players. Game rack can be lift and upright for storage and transportation. Save lots money to play with friend at home instead of outside. Overall great buy and recommend.",
