These clubs look great but are just poorly made and dangerous. I bought these for my 18 year old son and the first time at the range the 3 wood head flew off a full swing. This could have seriously injured someone. Needless to say these are junk and are going right back to Amazon. The Callaway Golf company should be ashamed of themselves for putting such a dangerous inferior product out on the market.",

Great bag...also includes 2 head covers. I replaced the driver with an upgrade, as soon as I got it...grips are good. I don't see too many sets in the $200 range that offer this much. If you're just starting out and/or don't play a whole lot of golf, this is a great value...I will be upgrading my fairway wood and adding a few more clubs, but this is a great set.",

I was able to go a full 18 course without any problem. The clubs are good for beginners. If you are more experienced then i suggest buying other club sets or building your own.
