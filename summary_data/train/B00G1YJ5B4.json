However, the tablet it self is great, the problem that I have is with Windows 8.1 on a really small screan, then it is difficult to use it and there are very small apps that you can use, it is not like Android that there are apps for everything. Thenit is unfair to give 3 starts to the tablet because it is a great machine, I am giving 3 starts for the mix of tablet and software",

OTG micro USB wasn't included in new box.(as pervious models) 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

This is apparently a common enough problem that I was able to easily find other people reporting the same problem with a simple google search.

Then I reached Acer via chat (which is in India and is not 24/7) and they said I'd have to call back during the 7-hour window when their senior tech support works. (Must be nice.)

Let them fill this up with the strange downloads that come with all those online games. I will come back and update this review if they manage to crash it or bog it down. As I said, nice tablet - I am a hint envious and if this continues to work out well - I may come out of the dark ages and get one of these for myself :-)",
