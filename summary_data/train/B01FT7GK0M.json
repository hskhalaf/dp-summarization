The fit was perfect! Both hats fit snugly on my boys' heads and we didn't even have to adjust the draw string in the back. The chin strap worked well, and even though the beach was very windy, they never lost their hats. The hats were comfortable and my boys enjoyed wearing them. I included some pics that I hope will be helpful with sizing.",

My kids are 3 and 5 and you can adjust the brim to fit their heads just fine. The chin straps are pretty useless though - they're too long and aren't adjustable. But these hats provide a good amount of coverage from the sun and are lightweight and flexible.",

Plus, you get two hats, so you can keep one in the car/backpack and one at home. The only downfall is that I washed this with a white polo shirt and the color seemed to bleed over from the hat to the shirt. Other than that, I'd recommend these.",

Only complaint is that it is so light weight, the sides seems to flip up a lot with even a slight wind. I'd buy these again for the value, cute look and functionality.",
