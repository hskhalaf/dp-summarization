      "text": "I purchased these as I wanted some lightweight headphones to use while working long hours with my hands. After about an hour, these hurt. I tried to figure it out, and there is no cushioning rim of support around the earpad, but rather it presses directly onto your ear. This is fine for casual use, or perhaps if you don't wear glasses (I do). But for longer hours of listening, I wouldn't recommend these.",

In the process of trying out different headphones configurations, I previously bought both theandalong with the,, and lossless audio files, and honestly, the $200 difference isn't worth it. (Even though the HD598 sounded wonderful on my digital piano, the pair of headphones and its plug were sooo bulky. The M50 had awesome isolation, but was extremely bulky as well.) This pair is light, looks futuristic, and the sound quality is more than acceptable. Thus, I'll probably stick with this one.",

The headphone is too tight and the ear cushions are too thin that you can easily feel the plastic inside, which could hurt your ears if you were thinking about using them for hours non-stop. I could use my other headphone JVC-HA-S650 for hours together and it would feel like cotton on my ears. The JVC also had a very well balanced response. I think I'm going to return this Panasonic cuz its not very comfortable, even though it looks great and sounds good.",

Good sound, though sometimes people cannot hear me clearly if I'm on my cellphone (I have an academic editing business and teach part time so I'm often having to talk to clients or students). It may be my cellphone! I searched high and low for headphones with no memory foam because I'm deadly allergic to the stuff (migraines, body aches, and severe eye reactions). The trade off is, of course, comfort. The pads are really hard, so I can't say they are the most comfortable headphones I've had. Still, overall, I'm happy with the sound when I'm listening to films on my computer or Audible books on my phone or tablet. [...]",

They aren't really loud headphones, and they do not block out the noise. They are comfortable and stylish. I think for the very specific purposes I have mentioned they are ideal!",

They're hip and cool looking with a great colour selection (I choose the black with pink) without being too \"young or out there\" for this grandmother. They're lightweight, and the padded head rest is a plus. The sound was really clear. The rectangular ear covers are a bit unusual and may take some getting used to but overall I give them a big thumbs up,",

This pair allow me to hear the sounds outside of my cubicle and still enjoy my music.
