Overall, I am very impressed with the optics Canon, and wouldn't go back to former Sony, Casio or Minolta brands. At first I was concerned with the lack of manual features, yet the macro and exposure adjustments for night shots works well. Also, the IS feature and Wide Angle lens is a must have... In addition to taking amazing photos, I occasionally took some video clips, which I just together into a short video. I was able to get some solid video without lugging around a big video camera.

Clear crisp images, whether people (thanks to the facial recognition feature) flora, fauna or the spectacular landscapes and ocean panoramas. It is very intuitive to operate and is easy to extract the pictures. I did purchase a 4gig chip and had over 2000 pics available which allowed me to film the entire trip and still have space for a family gathering upon returning home. I am very satisfied and highly recommend it to anyone for similar use. I suppose a professional photog might have different criteria, but it suits my needs perfectly.",

      "text": "This is my third canon camera, and my favorite. I decided on this older model because of the wide angle lens. It really helps to fit everything in for a group shot or large subject (house) shot. You will notice some barrel distortion (curving of image around edges) if your subject has long, straight lines (bridge or rooftop) and fills the frame. That's just how a wide angle works. You won't notice it at all if you are taking shots of friends/family. Pros: Small, Light, fast response time & great pics Cons: When pointed close or directly at sun or extremely bright object, the screen will show green and black patches. The picture will be fine though.",

Its compact size allows it to go everywhere, and its technical performance is superb. I bought it for its wide angle capability. There is a little barrel at the widest settings, but that's OK. I can capture the image with the 7.1 megs, and work on it later. The life of the NB-5L battery pack is quite long, and the 120 VAC-240 VAC charger made it very convenient on my recent European trip. The SD card is a very inexpensive memory, and I already invested in two 2 GB cards. 5 stars.",

The image stabilization is great, so are the colors, but for me the biggest surprise has been how useful the wide-angle turned out to be both indoor and outdoor, hence I'd recommend the SD800IS over the SD850is anytime. For those of you interested in a little 'experimentation', search google for a 'CHDK wiki' and you will discover a very interesting group of Canon enthusiasts who have unlocked a bunch of hidden features, including shooting and downloading RAW images, 1/40,000 shutter times, camera programming tools, remote control, etc.",

I might have considered buying another camera, but Canon has this cute trick where they have a different waterproof housing for every new year's models. Nice merchandising tool. I will probably not purchase another Canon product for that very reason.",

On the other hand, there are a lot of things to like about this camera: 28 mm (equiv) wide angle lens, face detection really works, good low light/high ISO performance, and many other great features.

WHat matters is how WIDE ANGLE the camera is. When you take group shots indoors, no more telling people to smush together. The 28vs35 will give you another 30% of your scene! Add to that the image stabilizer and your wides will be MUCH smoother (a wider camera will be less jerky, add IS and get great results) Also the Canon is by far sharper than most other Point and SHoots.

First it does not have an ongoing battery indicator - it only comes on when there's about 2-minutes of battery life left. This problem got me once when we were at an Ice-Skating event and battery died :-( The other issues is that there's no optical zoom (only digital zoom) when using the movie mode.

The scene modes give great results, especially the indoor and night snapshot modes. My dog's eyes usually turn out great with this camera's flash on indoor mode, instead of turning green.",

    "description": "This is the Digital Elph that's raising the bar. There's everything you'd expect from a camera of this caliber: a 7.1-megapixel CCD to render images in magnificent detail, and a DIGIC III Image Processor for stellar quality and fast operation. Yet what sets the SD800 IS Digital Elph apart is its wide-angle, 3.8x optical zoom with Image Stabilizer technology for rock-steady zooms. The Canon SD800 IS Digital Elph, it's the Digital Elph that's a step ahead.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nManufacturer Description \n\n This is the Digital Elph that's raising the bar. There's everything you'd expect from a camera of this caliber: a 7.1-megapixel CCD to render images in magnificent detail, and a DIGIC III Image Processor for stellar quality and fast operation. Yet what sets the SD800 IS Digital Elph apart is its wide-angle, 3.8x optical zoom with Image Stabilizer technology for rock-steady zooms. The Canon SD800 IS Digital Elph, it's the Digital Elph that's a step ahead. \n\nPowerShot SD800 IS Digital Elph Highlights \n\n\n\n7.1-megapixel Digital Elph with elegant stainless steel Perpetual Curve design The PowerShot SD800 IS features a high-resolution, 7.1-megapixel CCD to give you images of uncompromising texture and detail. With it, you'll capture what others miss - the delicate strands of a baby's hair, the intricate petals of a wild flower. Plus the camera is as beautiful to hold as the images it takes. The Perpetual Curve design has the look of fine sculpture. Yet it's practical, too. Its unique form is engineered for the shape of your hand. \n\n3.8x optical zoom in action Wide-angle 28-105mm (35mm equivalent) 3.8x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer technology Engineered with Canon's sophisticated wide-angle 3.8x zoom lens with integrated Image Stabilizer technology, the SD800 IS Digital Elph gives you the \"shake-free\" performance that makes your pictures sharp and clear. No matter how close you zoom in, the SD800 IS Digital Elph keeps everything stable. All you have to think about is your subject. \n\nDIGIC III Image Processor with Face Detection technology The DIGIC III Image Processor is the latest advancement to Canon's proprietary DIGIC technology, delivering superior image quality, ultra-responsive performance and extended battery life. DIGIC III provides a speedier interface for the SD800 IS Digital Elph's SD memory card, as well as higher definition for its LCD monitor. \n\nFace Detection makes it easy to snap the perfect picture DIGIC III also empowers new Face Detection AF/AE, which finds all the faces in the frame and sets the most suitable focus point, when the shutter button is depressed half-way. Exposure and flash are controlled to ensure proper illumination of both the faces and the overall scene, eliminating the common problem of darkened or overexposed faces. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nLarge 2.5-inch LCD monitor with wide viewing angle The SD800's 2.5-inch LCD monitor gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture and wider viewing angle to make shooting, playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient. The clear and bright LCD also features Night Display mode for easy viewing in low light. \n\nISO 1600 to reduce image blur and expand low-light shooting capability The PowerShot SD800 IS Digital Elph features new ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater flexibility for shooting. \n\nImproved Movie Mode with fast frame rate With the SD800 IS's Improved Movie Mode, you can shoot extremely high-quality, full-motion movies at 60 fps QVGA (320 x240). When you want to save space, you've also got Standard Recording that lets you shoot at 30 fps VGA (640 x 480). There's even a 15 fps Compact Movie Mode that's ideal for creating movies you can attach to emails. \n\nPrint/Share button The PowerShot SD800 IS Digital Elph's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD800 IS Digital Elph to a Canon CP, SElphY or PIXMA Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own photos in 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SElphY Compact Photo Printer. \n\nDirect Photo Printers\nFor desktop large-format printing, try one of the Direct Photo Printers that allow you to print without a computer in one of two ways: plug your compatible PowerShot camera into the Direct Photo Printer using the supplied USB interface cable, or simply insert a memory card into the supplied adapter. You can also connect the printer to your computer for more options. Print high-resolution, borderless images as postcards or 8.5 x 11-inch sheets within minutes. \n\nCompact Photo Printers\nCompact Photo Printers let you produce versatile, fun 4 x 6-inch postcards, 4 x 8-inch wide greeting cards or credit-card size prints in just two easy steps: connect and press/print. Control the printer right from your camera's LCD monitor. You get durable, dye-sublimated prints quickly with or without borders. Assorted paper types let you create mini or credit card size labels. You can even take the SElphY ES1 and CP730 Compact Photo Printers to a party or an outdoor picnic using an optional rechargeable battery.",
