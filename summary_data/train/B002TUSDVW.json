It has room for ammo, magazines, any other range needs. It has pouches for large AR-15 or AK-47 magazines but they are just the right size for three 50 rounds boxes of 9mm. The 25\" case comes with six felpro straps for securing the rifle. I have read some negative feedback on the zippers not starting easily and I found that if I grab the \"D\" ring next to the zipper and pull out slightly the zipper moves freely.",

My only gripe is the main rifle compartment won't accommodate two rifles unless you meet certain criteria ie..no vertical grips just AFG bipod or barrier brace. Two verticals will overlap and mar your rifle, just not enough bag top to bottom. Plus my Sig will only fit with a 20\" match barrel if I fold the stock but otherwise a standard(16\")AR with collapsing stock should work just fine.",

I'm not in love with the strap system, it takes some effort getting them situated correctly and you can't mount any horizontally (diagonally is a bit difficult too), but there are enough straps to still provide a secure hold. The shoulder strap is a bit odd as the mount points are at the middle of the bag ends, so I'm limited to carrying in vertically on my shoulder. Not the worst thing, but would have liked the option to have a more comfortable mount to carry horizontally.",

When the case is completely unzipped the folds in the corners made it very difficult to zip the case. I loved this case so I kept trying to figure out the trick to easily zip it up -- but never did. So I returned it. Finally, when a range manager order me to leave the bench with case unzipped, I decided it was time to return it.",

It's very discrete and doesn't scream gun..well made product! It's not a go to the range every week product but it didn't cost $100 either.",

Will only hold 30 round clips, my 40's won't fit in the pockets. I'd like the handgun clip loops to be offset so I could carry more. The last is a matter of preference...my Ruger P95 doesn't fit well in the pistol compartment...I may get it re stitched.",
