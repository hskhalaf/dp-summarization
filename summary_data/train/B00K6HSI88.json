An easy-to-use container, that is see-through, with a lid I can operate with one hand and can be opened in the cupboard (if you have room above it for when the lid flips up). You can see how many tea bags I can fit in there. The bamboo is smooth and light weight. The lid isn't real heavy-duty, but if you don't bang it around, it is just fine. I would call this elegant.

So far this has helped and I like the looks of it very much.
