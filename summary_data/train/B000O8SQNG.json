Admittedly, AM reception in general is subject to environmental interference so I would say this antenna is no better, nor necessarily any worse than other antennas.",

Once I found an acceptable lay-out I taped it down in place. I have not tried powered antennas so I can't compare. But I get pretty good reception from my head unit on my motorcycle with this passive (and super cheap) antenna.",

      "text": "This was the perfect solution to our questionable decision to not have purchased our Bass Buggy with a radio. We couldn't see paying $3k or more JUST for a radio to be added to it. My husband researched and found we could do this at a much more reasonable price. We bought the housing, radio, speakers, speaker line and antennae and installed it for under $300 <<<<all name brand marine quality equipment - most pieces from Amazon>>>> saving ourselves $2700 or better and were able to set it up how we wanted it, not the manufacturer standard. The pricing was perfect!!!!",
