I love Rowenta and have used there irons for 15 years but this item broke after 6-8 months of use...the company replaced it with a new one in July and now in the middle of October it is malfunctioning. The steam function only works intermittently, it drips hot water on your feet and clothes and somethimes doesnt event appear to heat that well... I am all for envioronmentally friendly products but an iron that only works for six months and then winds up in a landfill is the opposite of that...",

    "description": "Size:1700-WattIron more efficiently with this energy-saving Eco Intelligence DW6080 steam iron by Rowenta. The 1700-watt iron saves 25% more energy (compared to standard irons) while delivering professional results. With its exclusive Eco Steam system for optimal output, the iron offers three settings: Dry for a perfect finish without steam, Eco for superior steam while saving energy, and Boost for added steam when tackling thicker fabrics or uncompromising creases. An ergonomic rotary trigger makes activating the Eco Steam settings comfortable for both left- and right-handed users, and the steam output can be manually adjusted as needed. The iron\u2019s scratch-resistant, stainless-steel soleplate features over 400 micro holes for thorough steam distribution, plus offers a unique 3D design that creates concentrated steam between the soleplate and fabric, reducing steam loss. Powerful steam with less waste means getting the job done with less energy. Gliding effortlessly across all fabrics, the rounded back end of the iron\u2019s soleplate allows for a smooth back and forth motion without creating creases, while the pointed front end makes easy work of getting into tight spots like pleats or in between buttons. The versatile iron can also be used in the upright position for vertically steaming anything from hanging garments to drapes or slip covers. Other highlights include an anti-drip system to help prevent spitting or leaking at low heat settings, a self-clean system that flushes out loose mineral deposits for long-lasting performance, and three-way automatic shut-off for safety\u2014the iron turns off automatically if left unused after 8 minutes in the upright position or after 30 seconds in the horizontal position or tipped over. Get through piles of shirts, slacks, cloth napkins, and more in no time with the Rowenta DW6080U6 Eco Intelligence steam iron.",
