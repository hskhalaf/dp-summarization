This thing is amazing! The technology built into, the accuracy of it....all just wow. Even has a built pencil for marking the center and comes with 3 extra pencil refills tucked behind the battery. I do encourage anyone buying this read the manual!!! If you don't then you will miss out on small features that would of made the task simpler or you simply won't know what the beeps and symbols mean.",

It was so hopelessly wrong that I threw the device in the bin immediately. Do not waste your time or money! P.S. Nothing special or funny about my walls, just drywall on wood studs.",

I was hoping for the money it would work better. I'm sure it would work fine for drywall. What I was really disappointed in though is that the AC detection doesn't even work on my walls.

    "title": "Zircon MultiScanner i520- Center Finding Stud Finder with Metal and Live AC Wire Detection",
    "description": "Style:i520 Backlit DisplayThe Zircon MultiScanner i520 center finding electronic wall scanner quickly and easily locates studs, detects metal, locates live, unshielded AC wires. Complete with the latest technology in density detecting software and circuitry, as well as an ergonomic body design. Unlike other wall scanners and stud finders, the Zircon i520 stud finder has a 4-mode switch makes it easy to change functions while the ultra-bright LCD screen, SpotLite Pointing System, and audio tone all indicate the location of the target. This Zircon stud finder also comes equipped with a Signal Strength Indicator helps to distinguish between shallow and deep targets. A weak signal can also imply other non-stud objects, like wires and pipes, are present in the area being scanned. The MultiScanner i520 includes ACT (Auto Correcting Technology) that automatically corrects common user errors, such as when scanning begins over a stud, in addition to a low battery indicator to alert its users to replace its battery for optimal performance results. The tool constantly scans its surroundings and recalibrates itself if necessary. In StudScan mode, the Zircon i520 locates the center, edges, and direction of wood or metal studs up to 3/4 (19 mm) of an inch deep. Switch the i520 stud finder over to DeepScan mode and double the scanning depth to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep and enables scanning for joists in some ceilings and floors. Metal Scan mode of the MS i520 provides the ability to locate non-ferrous metal, such as copper pipes, up to 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep and ferrous metal, such as rebar, up to 3 inches (75 mm) deep. Using Metal Scan mode, this Zircon studsensor can find studs behind lath and plaster walls, tile, drywall and stucco walls by identifying the consistent pattern of screw or nail heads in the studs. Additionally, the MultiScanner i520 is programmed with a WireWarning Detection feature that indicates the presence of live unshielded electrical wires up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep when using the stud and metal scan modes. To detect, locate, map, and trace the live wires, simply switch over to the AC Scan function which acts as a live wire detector and finds and traces live, unshielded AC wiring up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep. The Zircon MultiScanner i520 is a perfect choice for serious users, such as home improvement hobbyists and professional contractors. With the Zircon MS i520, you can safely maneuver through the most complicated of projects with the professional confidence that comes from owning a Zircon.",
