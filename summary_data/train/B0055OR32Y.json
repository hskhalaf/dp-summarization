      "text": "Nice Quality for a kid's gumball machine. Easy to assemble...My 10 year old and his 2 friends put the entire thing together quickly and without a hitch. Got this for son's 10th birthday gift. He wears braces so I got peanut m&ms and skittles instead of gumballs to fill the canister. The canister is glass and holds a large amount of gumballs/candy. We filled it with a giant party bag of m&m's and a giant bag of skittles. It takes any coin denomination and gives anywhere from 1 - 3 candies. My son just loves this nice gumball machine and so do his friends! I would definitely recommend this machine over a cheaper model. Worth the extra money.",

Sadly mine came with hairline fractures right at the neck of the globe. I didn't trust it one bit. But it didn't matter, the coin mechanism jammed up every 3 or 4 turns. So dissapointed because I was using it for a potty training reward system. Don't waste your money. It looks nice ,but will not function for long at all. I'm currently shopping for a new machine all together. Amazon was quick with refunding me. But it makes me sad that the entire thing is just garbage.",

      "text": "We are happy with the product, however dissappointed in the way in which it was delivered. It was suppose to be a gift for christmas for my husband, and it was delivered in the regular merchandise packaging, with only a shipping label on it. I would have preferred it in an unmarked box, or wrapped in brown paper to disguise the contents. My husband was home when it was delivered,... So, it spoiled the surprise. We are otherwise happy with the quality of the machine. The kids love it too. It was put together very easily.",

    "description": "Style:Gumball Machine Bank with stand\n\nIf you are in the market for an antique style gumball machine, stop looking! The Great Northern Gumball Machine and Bank brings back memories of an old fashion candy shop with the penny gumball machine. This exquisite replica from the 1920s is constructed of premium quality components and is guaranteed authentic by Great Northern--Don't settle for cheap imitations! The Great Northern Gumball Machine will enhance any decor and is certain to be a conversation piece for years to come. It is perfect for businesses, dorm rooms, kid's rooms, and it completes your game room / home theater.\n\nThe base is constructed of a heavy-duty cast metal base and the globe is made of real glass--not cheap plastic. The heavy duty construction provides added stability and feel and prevents the machine from tipping over like some of the inferior units sold in the marketplace. Great Northern has incorporated an innovative dispensing mechanism which is fully adjustable so you can vary the amount of candy/gum that is dispensed when you turn the handle. In addition, there is a unique anti-spill cover which will keep your candy/gum in the tray and not on the floor. The machine also operates as a bank and has proven to be an effective tool for teaching kids how to save money.\n\nFeatures / Specifications:\n\n * Real glass gumball machine globe - not cheap plastic\n * Premium Construction. Cast metal gumball machine base, lid, and coin mechanism\n * Accepts any coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)\n * Includes instructions for \"free spin\" to work without coins\n * Works as a gumball bank - retrieve coins when full\n * Anti-spill gumball dispenser with door cover\n * Dispenses small gumballs (.62\" or smaller), candy, or nuts\n * Gumball capacity: 5 lbs. of .62\" gumballs\n * Dispenses Gumballs, Peanuts, Jellybeans & More\n * Choking Hazard - Not for children under 3 years\n * Color: Classic red finish\n * Weight: 10 lbs.\n * Machine Only Dimensions: 15\"H x 8\"W x 8\"D\n * Machine on Stand Dimensions: 37\"H x 18\"W x 18\"D\n * Full 1 Year Warranty!",
