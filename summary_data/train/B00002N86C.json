CAUTION: In order to tilt the fan up or down, I suggest you remove the small plastic cover on the side of the fan head, loosen the screw, tilt the fan to angle you wish, then tighten the screw and replace the cover.",

Speaking of better quality...I don't believe this fan is worth 50 bucks. Perhaps 38.00 dollars sounds more realistic, based on the quality and rattling noises it makes (and believe me, I tried everything to make it stop rattling and nothing worked).

Too, it both oscillates left to right and adjusts up and down. Try finding another such fan for this price. Worth a shot.",
