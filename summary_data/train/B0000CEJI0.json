I'm using the same two batteries originally purchased (I switch them out to charge) and an upgraded card, also purchased right after I got the camera. It also has its own cushioned Lowepro bag, that I purchased years ago as well. This camera has been great for everything and now I'm purchasing a wide-angle lens to use with it. After all these years I still have not cracked the surface of all the settings ... should get to work on that, eh? Haven't needed them, love this great camera!",

      "text": "I was initially attracted to the Olympux C-5000 by the terrific Amazon price - $310 or so. This was my first venture into digital photography: I wanted to migrate from loyal old familiar 35m equipment but at 5MP. and when the price was right. Only after purchasing the camera in May did I read some of the reviews and the negative comments alarmed me. Had I bought a discontinued dud? Absolutely not. It's a superb camera. Very ergonomic, easy to use and wonderful picture quality. The automatic setting is so reliable that I've been lazy so far in exploring the range of manual options but look forward to it. A very sophisticated little machine.",

But in my experience I've taken my camera on field trips, weddings you name it and the pictures came out great. The quality of the pictures are excellent indoors and outdoors. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have audio on the movies. Other than that this camera is terrific. Some of these people need to get a life.",

      "text": "I thought my camera was faulty after the first video taking, never had I thought that anybody would like to record videos without sound. Yes, it is mentioned ONLY in the reference manual. The camera is very good overall, except that there isn't any built-in microphone, therefore, when you record video clips, they become silent movies! DON'T buy this unless you don't mind silent clips. Usually, batteries in the camera will be taken out after use to avoid leakage, but the date setting will have disappeared when it is used again. So far, I have not seen any camera comes with small battery that can keep the date setting after the big batteries have been taken out.",
