I also ordered the matching coat hangers (with the bar for hanging pants). The coat hangers are slightly larger than these shirt hangers, so I use them only for coats and vests. Note that the color of the coat hangers is not a perfect match to the color of the shirt hangers, but it is close enough for me. My closet looks so much better with all of these matching wood hangers. I'm pleasantly surprised.",

That being said though these hangers do feel on the cheaper side, but at the moment I don\u2019t see any signs of woodboring insectcs or any major damage to the product. There are a few areas where the wood is knicked and isn\u2019t smooth. The divets in the hangers on either side also vary in smoothness. Some are very smooth some of them are not. So be careful when hanging delicate clothing from those. All in all not a bad products and for bargain woof hangers I\u2019d buy again.",

That said, the vast majority of them look and work great. At about $1 per hanger shipped, you can't really ask for much better. Dinged one star from the sloppiness, but still good value.",

They are good looking, well finished, smooth and unblemished, and they fit on the closet rack and slide easily. Our clothes look good after hanging on them for quite some time. What else can I say? Oh yes, the price was very good as well! Strongly recommended. We'll be buying more as we trade out all our old hangers for them.",

Every so often I\u2019ve had one with some nick or blemish but nothing that impaired the use. HOWEVER, if you are ordering the cherry color be aware it changed in the past 6-12 months. Amazon has not updated the pictures, still showing the dark cherry color. Actually Amazon has no idea it has changed, based on my interactions with customer service. I had to contact the company to verify. I\u2019ve attached a picture of the original cherry (top) and the new, lighter cherry color.",

They arrived all intact; none were broken. They also seemed well-made (at least so far). The wood was smooth with a glossy coating. There were no splinters to snag the clothing.",
