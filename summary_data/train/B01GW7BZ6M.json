It is non-obtrusive meaning it does not look funny behind my couch with a table lamp right in front of it. It has a sturdy base so it does not wobble. My only complaint is that the joint of the lamp appears to be plastic so I am not sure how long that will last with multiple movements. I have mine set where I want it and don't move it much so I think mine will last.",

The base is very heavy and feels sturdy, so at least it probably won't be knocked over. I do really like the gold finish.

The head of the lamp also swivels so that you can adjust it to your exact specifications. It also comes with felt 'feet' to put on the bottom of the base so that it does not scuff your floors! I would definitely recommend, especially if the company can speed up the shipping time.",
