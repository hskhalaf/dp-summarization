Mostly, the design, the price and the majority of its components favored well to them. It\u2019s a road shoe that worked well, according to neutral runners.

I have gotten lots of scuff marks near the front of the shoe. But there are no torn areas on them. The souls are not orange out after 50 miles of walking on them. That is a huge plus for me. Although the inserts that came with the shoes are not the greatest to me, I have bought my own inserts.",

My feet became swollen and it was difficult to even walk far for about two weeks. So, I looked for shoes with better support and the first brand I turned to was ASICS. I can definitely say that it's really contributed to my overall physical health. My feet still hurt occasionally but it's much better now. Also I want to add that these shoes are really airy so no sweaty feet :). Thanks for making a superior product that can last, provides support and can be worn casually.",

The biggest downside though is the nearly non-existent cushioning in the sole and rather structure-less fit. I couldn't recommend this shoe for anything other than casual wear. Even long walks might require more cushion and support than this shoe has to offer.",
