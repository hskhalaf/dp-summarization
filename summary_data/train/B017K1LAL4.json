And I am a Michael Kors fan of all his products. The picture shows a pinkish color but the bracelet that was shipped to me was gold. Others say they see a rose tint but I do not. Regardless, it is a beautiful bracelet and I will keep it. I am glad I ordered it and will order more products like this soon.",
