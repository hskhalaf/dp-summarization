Well after 15 months duplex portion has a possible bulb burn now I can only scan one sided images because on duplex a thick black line appears on right side rendering scan useless. FLAT bed scan also has that same THICK BLACK LINE rendering ALL SCANS useless. This should be a class action suit as it seems ALL scanners have this issue after at least 14 months. DO NOT BUY!!!!",
