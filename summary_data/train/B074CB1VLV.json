Slips on, no laces, looks adorable, especially with pants that are ankle length or shorter.

I wasn\u2019t disappointed :) Let me add, I have narrow feet and these definitely fit narrow feet better. If you have a wider foot, I would recommend going 1/2 a size or a full size up. Anyone who wants these should definitely just get them. It\u2019s worth it! Update: I brought it down to four stars because the customer service wasn\u2019t great, kinda disappointing :(",
