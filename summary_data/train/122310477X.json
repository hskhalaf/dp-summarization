Personally this item is way too expensive for the size of it, and i would be able to find larger products for cheaper. I give this product a 3/5.",

It is adorable in that Japanese Kawaii way -- adorable in a way that's difficult to describe. As pictured, Pusheen is flat, front and back, with protruding whiskers, feet, and tail. It's about 4\" thick. It's perfect tossed against a pillow on a bed, sitting on a shelf or desk, or just sitting in a lap to pet. It was well-made, not a surprise given the Gund name. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",

Then I decided that the smaller one is just too cute, so I\u2019ll probably end up keeping it for myself.",

Please buy this product, this is my all time best stuffed animal I have ever ordered and I am planning on buying many, many, more stuffed animals from here!
