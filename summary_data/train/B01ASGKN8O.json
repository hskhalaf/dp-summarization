Both slow down the ball just enough to allow you time to execute good technique, but these balls are the best by far if you want a workout that allows you to drive through the ball without fear that it will come back too fast. I would expect these to be perfect for the ball machine as well because they give a nice bounce at just a slightly slower speed than a regular ball.",
