Like some others, I have found it a little more difficult to manoeuvre, compared to my previous roller-ball. I have found however, that turning down the suction resolves this. The design of the nozzle attachment is much better, far less likely to get clogged up, like the last one did, and I also prefer the way it comes apart to use the extension pipe for stairs etc. It does feel a little flimsier than the last one, I guess time will tell on that...",

Compared with previous ones the advantages are easily manoeuvred , lightweight to use and much easier to empty. On the downside it feels very fragile to use and perhaps not as strong a suction as my last one. Maybe I will change my mind after more use.",
