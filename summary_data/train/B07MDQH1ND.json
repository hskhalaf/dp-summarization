It drinks butane like no other even at its lowest setting. It's a sloppy flame wish it was more pin point and it's very loud so stealthiness is out of the question. The base it comes with fits snug at first but after a few days it slips off all the time! Save your money up for a Blazer or other higher quality torch.",
