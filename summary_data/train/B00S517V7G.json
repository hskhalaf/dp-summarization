We scrubbed and scuff sanded the tables and dresser before painting. The coverage was good. It needed a light second coat of paint. At the same time we refinished another part of the side tables with Sherwin Williams Solo paint (the blue) (also only scuff sanding). The Sherwin Williams paint came out smoother and didn't leave brush strokes like the chalk paint. All in all, I'm not completely sold on chalk paint, but for the price, I think it is effective and close in quality. On a budget, I would use it again.",

      "text": "This is my first experience purchasing chalk paint (I usually make my own) It was a little more difficult for me to get a smooth finish without sanding. I used the entire 32oz on a small twin bed with slated head and foot board. It didn't seem to have the best coverage for me .I did 4 coats and then sanded between coats to get the finish I wanted. I have been using chalk paint for 6 years on pretty much all my diy projects and ihave never used so much paint for 1 frame. This would be ideal for someone who wants more of a really rustic brush stroked look to their furniture.",

I used a very cheap chalk paint on my other projects and was hoping this one would look better and a bit smoother. It did but it was really hard to get the second coat to go over the first without lifting the paint completely off the dresser.",

I didn't even use the entire container for a round table and 4 chairs. I used the remainder for a small 4x4 bookshelf. I loved the results so much I ordered another 32oz container, Ivory Tower, for our fireplace. We have an electric fireplace and I couldn't stand the brown color. I decided to use it without sanding...mainly because I was done sanding things. It went right on. Doesn't peel or flake. I gave it a few coats of clear wax and it looks fantastic!!!",
