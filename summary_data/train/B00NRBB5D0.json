Despite that he was friendly, and affectionate even with our 2 year old twins. I wanted to find a grain free food with the majority of its protein coming from meat. I came across Nulo and after researching the food and it's company decided to give it a try. He loves it. He devours everything in his bowl at mealtime and even seems to prefer it to treats. He has been flourishing since coming into our home and transitioning to Nulo. I highly recommend it!",

So for us for now on we will stick with grain included. Not bashing grain free, but sometimes the ingredients used in lieu of grain causes issues for some cats like mine. They price was right. The kibble size was great and they gobbled it down when they were on it.",
