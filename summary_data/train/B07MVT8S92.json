In games like Final Fantasy 15 for instance, night time scenes would have huge blooming around HUD elements and lights. While blooming still occurs here, the X1 Ultimate chip handles it better with its fewer dimming zones as it more intelligently handles brightness.

      "text": "I am very pleased with the 65\" Sony 950G I purchased. Out of the box, the picture was excellent; after messing around with the menu settings and adjusting to my tastes, it is incredibly good. The upconversion works very well and the black levels are the best I've ever seen on a non-OLED television. It does take some time to learn/understand the menu structure, but once you've got it down, things can be adjusted quite easily. Overall, it's a great tv that I've been watching happily for several months now. Highly recommended.",

Just be sure to switch the picture mode to GAME mode for the lowest input lag. I had 0 issues setting up this TV. Connected it to my wi-fi and in seconds I was online. Updated the firmware with ease and signed into my streaming apps. This is by far the best TV I have ever owned. I would high recommend this TV to anyone within this budget.",

      "text": "The Sony X950G is worth every penny, a premium LED LCD television with outstanding picture quality. My only critique would be in a pitch black room and having a dark scene you can see a slight blooming when you have a bright image. Otherwise everything is amazing, motion, color, contrast and detail. Android OS works like a charm, the X1 Ultimate Processor does its job on making the TV run smooth. Out of the box the calibrations are very good, of course you can always modify the settings to your liking.",

Great picture and it has been working fine since I bought it. Unfortunately, these newer TV's do not last as long as their predecessors. I hope I can get a couple of years from this one.",

It is amazing and I did a lot of research before pulling the trigger. Too bad I didn't get to enjoy it. This TV was shipped from WA state to PA via UPS. Genius idea. It seems it was stabbed with a forklift and then kicked several times at every location it stopped on the way. The result is self-explanatory - cracked screen and a return, followed by a trip to local Best Buy to buy something that is delivered with care.",

At times I cannot log on to you tube yet I can get into Netflix.",

The down side is: This TV comes with legs to help stand the tv in say an entertainment center, dresser, etc. These legs are a ROYAl PAIN in the heiny to install. Much so, I opted not to use them resting the tv on the dresser and towards the wall which is a risk. The remote has a built in mic which picks up your voice very well. Update to 10/7/19: it\u2019s excellent and legs hold it in place.",
