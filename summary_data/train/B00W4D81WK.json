I had 2 king size cotton filled mattress toppers I was going to throw out so i figured one of those would be plenty. I used one entire topper and 1/3 of the other packing it very tight. Hardest part of stuffing it was getting down to the feet, after that its not bad. But I already knew that from other reviews. So far only thing I noticed is for certain submissions is the arms could be longer so i took off 1 star.",

This product allowed him to practice all the moves and then directly apply it to class. This product work exactly like I hoped it would. It was very easy to stuff and get it ready for use. I would suggest buying bulk Rags at Walmart or an auto parts store that you can use the stuff the body with or any clothing that you no longer use. Overall great product!",
