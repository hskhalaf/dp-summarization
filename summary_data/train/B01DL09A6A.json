The user will need to make a shim plate about 1/16 thick that is wedged-shaped like the blade of a knife. In fact, you can use a blade about 3 inches long, drill the holes and carve out some steel with a handheld grinder. The bike is a single speed and with tires inflated to 20 PSI, still doesn't coast very far. Brakes will not be required very often unless you are riding down a hill.

I was thinking maybe during shipping the box might've gotten a little crushed and squeezed the fork too tight. Anyway, the 2nd came in with the same issue. I returned both. It could've been a good bike, everything else seemed to made ok. I'm debating if I want to try a 3rd,,, they say 3 times is a charm. \ud83d\ude1c",
