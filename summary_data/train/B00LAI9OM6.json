Pros: - NOT translucent / no see thru shadows - Smell good (the bag, DOH!) - Holds a lot - Roll of 15 easily fits in your pocket Cons: - You have to tie the bags yourself. There is no self-tie. I personally spin them to help keep odors in, then knot and pull. Works perfectly every time. The bags are large enough.",

My bf says he prefers the scented ones and can\u2019t ever smell poo so might just be me and my sensitive nose. For context, we have a 1.5 year old boxer who poops a lot. We live in a townhome community with shared green belts - that\u2019s a lot of poo to pick up daily. Good quality and I recommend.",

I'm standing in the middle of the sidewalk trying to open the stupid bag while my puppy runs off to try to eat something or step in his poop. I have to spit on my fingers or the bag to get traction to open the thing - which is not very covid friendly. I definitely don't recommend if you don't have the patience.",
