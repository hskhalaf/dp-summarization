The description and instructions say do not submerge in water, but you really can't even run the black top portion under water real quick to wash, as water still gets into that section. I needed to because my hands weren't clean and rinsing/cleaning raw beef off the top was necessary. Also when you put the clear plastic protective lid back on the air tight pressure causes water to exit the rim of the where you push down.",
