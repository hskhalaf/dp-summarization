Symmetry can be an issue with cheap handlebars, but these were almost perfect, maybe less than 1/4\" difference on each side measured from center. Paint seems good. Finish is a slightly dull gloss. Thickness of the tube material seems good, about average. My Shimano Altus shifters and break levers slid on just fine and my Ergon grips also slid on perfectly. So no problems, quality seems good.",

So, I decided to see if this could be remedied. These bars were the answer. I am amazed that this simple bar swap could make such a difference. I now sit more upright and the pressure on my back and hands is gone. If you are even thinking about this I highly recommend doing it! Installation was pretty simple and straightforward. This is one of those simple changes that is worth it !",

A little tricky transferring the gears over since it's so much higher than the original bars but fairly easy to do. I angled it so it's not just a rise but it goes toward her a little bit. We had bought another bike (sold it now) and if this didn't work we were going to try buying another one. Now she's comfortable riding and I got new grips to match her bike, very pleased.",
