I also have been hanging my purse abd gymbag on them instead of just throwing them in the floor or seat. I am sure they would work great for small grocery bags and store trips as well! They are strong and sturdy and went right around the metal grip no problem! Definitely recommend them for anyone with kids or just to have to keep your car more tidy and seating available!!!",

      "text": "Tired of having my purse on the floor of my vehicle (especially in winter when floors are wet from snow) or my purse falling from the seat with contents strewn about, I searched for a solution. These hooks are perfect. While driving, I slip the hook to the front and hook my purse securely in the passenger seat. The headreast is not effected in the least by the hooks. With four hooks included, I have two in each of my vehicles. They lie flat (unlike some others available), so there\u2019s no worry of them catching on something. Wonderful idea and very useful.",

Also, the strap let's them hang closer to the seat, so they are only dealing with the weight pulling down.",

I actually like to be able to spin it around. If I have no passenger I leave hook hanging toward the front , but if needed, I spin it to hang in the back so it doesn't bother my seat mate. Really do like them",
