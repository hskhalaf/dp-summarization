So I added my acog scope and grip and got the little \u201cmagazine\u201d ready. And the next day in 84 degree temperature at 10 yards shot at a target the size of a large dinner plate..... and MISSED!!! I thought it was the sight so I took it off and put the default on and shot still missed I got closer 5 yards now and shot right at the center. And it hit the very very edge of the target. I immediately knew it wasn\u2019t me. So returned it and got other stuff.",

With proper handling, especially while charging the pump, this rifle should last for many years. The style is great and the rifle feels hefty and well balanced. Accuracy is good with pellets, thanks to the rifled steel barrel. Shooting BBs will eventually wear out the rifling and reduce the rifle accuracy.

      "title": "Great First Airgun for New Shooter",
      "text": "Love that you have the ability to use BBs for all-day economical shooting but have the option of loading pellets for better accuracy and harder hitting to knock down those pesky soda cans. Pump action gives you the ability to control the power level so that you can shoot in the garage or the backyard... and you won\u2019t have to keep buying Co2 cartridges. Lots of fun for not a lot of money... and greater satisfaction than pretending on a video game console!",
