Other than that, it\u2019s a quality product that is well built and will last a long time. I recommend the silver so that the color doesn\u2019t rub off as that may be an issue.",

Substantial weight in your hand, good feel, it works pretty well. Comes with a pretty nice little zipper case that I'll probably use to keep track of thumb drives and such. Nice little bonus.",

They without hesitation sent me a new one to replace it. It as well didn't move smoothly. However, I believe it is due to the machining of some of the hinges are slightly larger. I used some lubricant and worked on it for a while and now it moves like a dream and doesn't break when it is dropped on the floor. Although I have worried that it would dent my wood floor. Great product and great customer service.",
