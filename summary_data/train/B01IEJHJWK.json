      "text": "This is a great product if only for the fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do...support whichever appendage or area you need. The fact that it is twistable/bendable to aid in the support you need, especially when you are not in the comforts of home, is a big boon; period! If you have ever felt cramped in an airplane seat and desperate to get some shut eye, riding in a car, or contorting your body into those universally uncomfortable airport seats during a layover...it's wonderful to have a \"neck pillow, etc.\" that can bend to yours needs at the time you need it.",

The pillow is very flexible and moderately comfortable, but the wire inside that maintains shape is covered with an inner pad that is rather hard. If I had to guess, I would say the wire is coat-hanger-like and the inner pad that covers it is like a small pool noodle. The pillow flexes easily but will not hold a position against a little force or weight. It did not work for my wifes needs.",

      "text": "Best travel pillow I have found. It is especially good if you sleep in window seats on the plane (or car). It is sturdy and comfy and you can literally bend it into the curve of what you are leaning on and then the otherwise around your neck to sort of hook you in. I hate the standard U travel pillows of the same shape, but the bendy part is the key. I am a light sleeper and can't sleep on planes, but I actually managed to get sleep with this on an international flight. Even my husband liked it in his aisle seat when he tried it.",

That being said, I think side sleepers or window seat users might find it more valuable: if you are an aisle seater, don't spend the extra money, as it will not keep your head upright any better than other pillows I've tried ( and be less comfortable).
