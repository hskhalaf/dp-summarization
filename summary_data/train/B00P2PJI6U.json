I first thought the sensor was defective, but the second one I bought has similar behaviors. I don't believe the battery level reading because I think the battery would explode if it was discharged as quickly as the reading indicates. Next, I wish to the touted programming features of these sensor was more open so that I could actually try adjusting parameters. Finally, like 90% of the zwave devices out there, it is finicky to set up. Contrary to what many claim, zwave is harder to set up than zigbee.",

However, a battery monitor app I used showed the battery level has dropped sharply in only a few weeks. So I connected the sensor to a power cube. Even though it provides a terminals for external power connection, it does not provide a way to route the wires out of the sensor. Then I couldn't get the unit to pair to the ST hub as a moisture (flood) sensor. It wanted to pair as a generic switch. I finally took the device off external power and used just the battery. Pairing went fine then.",

      "text": "This works great with the Smart Things Hub. It is a Z-wave device, but does work on it's own to alarm you if water is present. It has dry contacts inside to connect up to an alarm. I connected an external power supply. This allows for the battery to be just a backup during power failures. Once connected to the Smart Things Hub, I was able to configure the hub to text my cell phone when the sensor sensed water and the Smart Things Hub continues to alert you hourly via text until you clear the alarm. Worth the $60.",

      "text": "It's simple: Out of 5 different water sensors, this is by far the best. Fantastic features, great range, easy to setup and use, works great with SmartThings, etc. My only concern is that, like all water leak sensors, the batteries don't last as long as in other types of home security devices that use the CR123 lithium cells. Still, at most I'll need to change them only twice a year.",

What a waste of money! Also not the easiest to set up with the Nexia system. Still have an unopened one left, but stuck with this junk because I didn't open and set them up within 30 days. Stay far away from this - get the FortrezZ sensor. While not as pretty, the battery on the FortrezZ has been functioning for 2 months and is at 99% yet.",

    "description": "TILT SENSOR Detects tilt and movement over 15 degrees. It will also alert you of any attempt to move or tamper with the device. ALARM SIREN Built in alarm siren will help you react quickly in case of a flood, rapid temperature change, or attempt to tamper with it. TELESCOPIC PROBES Fibaro Flood Sensor is the only one in the World to perfectly work on uneven surfaces thanks to gold telescopic probes, which are flexible enough to compensate for uneven surface levels. IN / OUT Input terminal allows for connecting an external probe and installing the sensor in any location. Output terminal allows for connection to an alarm system. VISUAL INDICATOR LIGHT Aside from the alarm siren, the device can alert you of a threat using colour displays from the built in RGB diode. TAMPER PREVENTION Specially designed enclosure contains a tamper button, protecting it from being opened unintentionally. BATTERY POWERED A single battery is enough to power the Sensor for 2. 5 years. TEMPERATURE SENSOR Built in temperature sensor may be used to manage a floor heating system or serve as a fire alarm sensor, by detecting rapid temperature rise. Hard wired Power or battery You can power the Flood Sensor by 12/24 VDC or a battery which will last 2, 5 years The Sensor allows for integration with almost any available wired alarm system on the market. The Sensor allows for sending alarm notifications via wires or wirelessly. Visual Colour Display One look is enough to find out what happened, thanks to the coloured indicator light. Depending on the Flood Sensor's built-in LED illuminated colour, you will know whether the Sensor has detected water, or a decrease / increase in temperature. With its built-in Z-Wave range tester you can easily determine whether the place you chose for the Sensor allows for communicating with the main controller or maybe you will have to use an external wired probe, to ensure the Sensor's proper operation.",
