      "text": "Upon listening to these earbuds more in depth and comparing them directly to all my other earbuds, I can say that they actually are alot clearer than the rest of the headphones I own. However, they are a bit to sybalant (don't know how to spell that) for my taste. They are very clear and high quality though, despite that. My only remaining con is their size. I know the large drivers provide their great sound but they're extremely hard to fit in my ears, and I know anyone with relatively average sized/small ears will have similar complaints.",

I usually put these in my pockets or shoved in my backpack, which I didnt find as a problem. But in July, the wire broke from the bottom of the volume adjuster. I taped it up, but now only one side of the earbud is working. My recomendation: buy earbuds with braided wires for better durability. They m sa y tangle a little bit more, but that's a price I'm willing to pay to keep both my earbuds working. Plus, their pretty big too.",
