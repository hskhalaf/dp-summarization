Honestly I was put off by this company a few months ago when they changed the pill color and my mom and I got different answers as to why...quite troubling.

I was impressed buy all the positive reviews on Amazon and ordered it. What a difference. I've been taking it for about 3 weeks and am already loosing weight and able to get into the evening with just a short afternoon nap. Believe me, that's a big improvement.

I chose this one over another popular brand because of the combination of natural ingredients and lack of fillers (plus it was cheaper than the other brand) - In just a few weeks I have seen AMAZING results, including my hair growing back and increased energy. It's rare that I see such immediate and profound changes from a dietary supplement - I HIGHLY recommend this one to anyone who is struggling with hair loss, fatigue, or other thyroid-related issues.",
