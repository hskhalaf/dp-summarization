No. That's how you lose an eye. Just don't. Wine, water, juice, whiskey...no soda guys. Come on. Didn't notice any weird flavor imparted by the stainless steel, but my wine wasn't in there too long. Girls weekend at HSB doesnt let alcohol sit too long. Not super insulating; kept the reds room temp and the whites cool but not cold. Throw it in an ice chest if you want it to stay cold.",

Aside from that, the blanket itself was warm and soft, however it is smaller than I had hoped. If using it while sitting, you can drape it from your shoulders and it covers you nicely. If you are using this while laying down, it falls short of my feet at least a foot (I am 5' 5\") so it was irritating. At this price point, I think it's adequate, but not the best for the money spent. Quality was what you would expect from Columbia, hope this helps.",

I re-checked the colors to re-order and did not see rose/pink as a selection, so am afraid if I return and re-order, I will just receive the same color if I select stainless steel again.
