The 10inch queen memory foam mattress I bought fits perfectly. I'm so happy I bought a bed online instead of getting ripped off in a furniture store. These matresses/platforms are affordable, comfortable and they come with crystal clear instructions...no tools needed! The only reason I docked a star is because it creaks slightly on one side. I just replaced a bed because it squeaked, so I hope this one doesn't get worse. Still, recommended.",

All of the included components fit inside of the headboard so it is easy to break down for moving. The frame itself is a combination of wood and metal, and seems very sturdy. The box it came in was very large, heavy, and awkward to carry. Our UPS carrier had trouble pulling it out of the truck and asked for my help. Definitely recommend bringing a friend if you need to move it a long distance or up/down stairs.",

It was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy. The one additional thing I had to purchase was a non-slip mattress pad to go under the mattress. The bed (Ghostbed) fits perfectly on this bed and did not require a box spring. After a year, it still looks and functions as it did on day one. Also, we have moved his room around three times this year and this bed moves nicely. Would definately recommend and purchase again.",

This bed is the opposite experience. There is a lot of attention to \"ease of assembly\" and it really pays off. It is sturdy and seems to sit a bit higher off the ground than previous beds.
