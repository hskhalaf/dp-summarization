I did like the weight to the razer but what good is it if it doesn't work. Unsure if this was a defective one or what. I guess you get what you pay for. Hope this was helpful to others considering purchasing this item. Contacted seller and let them know of the problem. They offered to replace the defective razor at no cost or refund. I figured might as well give it another chance so i requested the metal finish razor. It works great! Great customer service!",

A fresh blade will cut you also. After a couple uses of the same blade and practice it goes smoothly over your skin without cutting you. Get a blood clotting agent like shaving chalk to stop the bleeding. Recommend watching YouTube videos on how to shave with a straight razor.",

How difficult it is to open and close is also a big safety issue. If you're changing a razor blade you don't want to be struggling to get it out.

It allows you get a quality straight razor barber style shave without all of the maintenance of a fixed straight edge razor. A new style of shaving without investing a lot of money.

It works with single edge razor blades which you can easily snap your favorite double edge blade in half to create one.\n\n\n\nClassic Samurai Straight Razor Instructions :\n\n * Prepare your face well for the shave.\n * Taking a hot shower or washing your face with warm water helps remove the natural oils off your face allowing your beard hairs to absorb more water and soften.\n * Also use a pre-shave oil underneath your favorite shaving cream. This will help lubricate your skin so the blade slides easier and reduces irritation.\n * Pull you skin tight, especially in problem areas like under your nose or on your chin. This will help reduce nicks.\n * Using a 30-degree angle, take slow, strokes with the grain. Going against the grain can cause razor burn.\n\n\nCompatible With : Astra,Shark, Lord, Derby and all other single and double edge safety razor blades.",
