Nevertheless, unboxing, charging the batteries, and then sending it up for its first flight was a little unnerving. Will this thing come back? Will it crash? Will I get in trouble somehow? Fortunately, the Mavic Pro is so intuitive, it just about flies itself. It certainly knows its way home and that's the most important thing.",

    "description": "Style:Pro| Configuration:BaseWherever You Go The DJI Mavic Pro is a small yet powerful drone that turns the sky into your creative canvass easily and without worry, helping you make every moment an aerial moment. Its compact size hides a high degree of complexity that makes it one of DJI\u2019s most sophisticated flying cameras ever. 24 high-performance computing cores, an all-new transmission system with a 4. 3mi (7Km) range, 4 vision sensors, and a 4K camera stabilized by a 3-axis mechanical gimbal, are at your command with just a push of your thumb or a tap of your finger. POWERFUL Fly for miles. From your pocket. Inside the Mavic\u2019s pocket-sized remote controller is DJI\u2019s brand new OcuSync transmission technology, with a range of 4. 3mi (7km) and Full HD 1080p video streaming. No bumps and scrapes When you know what\u2019s in front of you, you won\u2019t bump into it. The same is true of the Mavic. Using Flight Autonomy it can see obstacles as far away as 49ft (15m) in front, so that it can fly at up to 22mph (36kph) while avoiding the things it sees. Absolute Precision Flight Autonomy technology means the Mavic can hover precisely in more environments, and automatically land almost exactly where you took off. Stay flying longer Why fly for 10 or 15 minutes when you can fly for up to 27? With the Mavic you can. Use every single pixel The Mavic is the only drone of its size to carry an integrated high-precision 3-axis mechanical camera stabilization system, giving you crystal clear photos and smooth videos, without losing a single pixel. Operating Frequency FCC: 2.4-2.4835GHz; 5.150-5.250 GHz;5.725-5.850 GHz CE: 2.4-2.4835GHz; 5.725-5.850 GHz SRRC\uff1a2.4-2.4835 GHz;5.725-5.850 GHz.",
