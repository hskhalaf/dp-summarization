This morning, the robot lost the boys bedroom icon designation and the bathroom icon designation, and would not let me re-assign without a whole house map redo. Then, it refused to clean room #2, after asking the robot to clean areas #1 & #2. Then it failed to find the docking station. After placing two calls to tech support, I've got nothing. One tech support guy told me to reboot my phone. Extremely disappointed. Terrible tech support. I'm not going to spend $600 and get a confused robot and then no one that can help me through the issue. Going back...Very disappointed in the company.",

Actually the roomba probably worked better. I attached just a couple of pictures of what the vac has completed when it alerts that it's done with its job and it's ready to find its charger... then it doesnt.",

The mopping mode is useful, just you\u2019d better completely wet the cloth before attaching to Deebot, otherwise it would take a while before it can mop evenly. The AI part is also great, the app allows you to customize your cleaning area, the feature I like most is to leave the area not for mopping.",

It also does not say at a constant speed, so the faster it goes, the more streaks it leaves. In my opinion, the mop is more of a gimmick.

      "text": "Vacuume works very well and it\u2019s a hoot to watch it while vacuuming or mopping. Easy to use software app but does need a few improvement. The only problem I\u2019ve found is when you first try to connect it to your WiFi router. What a pain. After talking to customer service for an hour (yes they actually answered the phone) I finally got it connected. If you have a dual frequency router like I do, you have to shut off the 5ghz In order to connect with 2.4ghz after connected then you can turn back on the 5ghz. Weird. All I all, I really like this DeeBot. Time will tell.",

If I tell it go to back to the charging station, it will take the most curious circuitous route going around in circles before finally settling in. She bumps into things rather than using her camera to avoid objects. Other than that, she works and picks up a lot of dust and dirt. I'm not sold on the mopping feature. The streaks would suggest an uneven mopping.",
