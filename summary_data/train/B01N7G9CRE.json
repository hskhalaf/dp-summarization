This did come with extra switches so I was able to replace them, but I still wouldn't expect them to fail in just a few months. EDIT: Another failed switch in about 6 months. Update: I. Hate. This. Keyboard. Constant issues with the switches, dropping letters in emails, constant typos in messages, unresponsive in games. This is the worst piece of hardware I've ever owned. I'll be buying a different keyboard soon and will make it my mission to steer people away from Redragon keyboards.",

They also offer browns for the ones that hate the feedback. I recommend buying noise suppression rings.

Minimalist design, I knew that going into it, but you can see right underneath all the keys, and the light filters from underneath it. So for me, it's less minimalist and more just saving money on production costs. Is it worth the price, yes but is it high quality with good tactile feel No, it is not. I can't say it's gaming ability because I don't game.",

So upgrading to this mechanical board was a huge improvement. It has the blue switches, so if noise is an issue for you, you may want to swap out with brown or other ones. It does come with a key/switch puller and some sample switches for you. The software that you can download from them works well to switch the color pattern. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this board for gamers or anyone that enjoys a mechanical keyboard.",

Although you can use a myriad of available switches, I've found that Outemu teals work great on wasd, shift, space and control. The replacement of switches also allows you to repair your keyboard for a fraction of the price when the switches wear out-without soldering! The per key rgb per key is also nice for games and the custom color schemes are perfect for night typing. Overall, this keyboard allowed me to eliminate my wrist strain from a membrane keyboard without straining my wallet. It made typing for whatever reason enjoyable.",

I can't think of a single complaint, other than the font etched into the keys makes it hard to read them at lower light levels. I'm a touch typist, so this is really only an issue when using seldom used keys and symbols. It comes with a good length cord and replacement switches. The macro function is a little confusing to figure out... it's not intuitive at all, but it works well once you suss it out. At 1/2 to 1/3 the price of other mechanical keyboards, this little guy is a winner!",
