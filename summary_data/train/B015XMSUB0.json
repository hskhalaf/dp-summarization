The 950 filter lets almost no light in at all, so if your camera does not have ISO 3200 or greater you are going to struggle to get anything useful. Also know that different lenses act differently with these filters, so don't be to annoyed if you purchase this and you can't seem to get a good shot.

The only thing I might change is to swap the 720 nm for a 670 nm for larger wavelength separation. In my Fuji IS Pro the 720 and 760 nm respond exactly the same. If you have a camera that can use these, get them. Well worth it.",
