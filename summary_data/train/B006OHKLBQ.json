Pour in a little water and it is ready to go. Drop in a dirty ball and work it around. Out comes a like new, clean ball. Also works get for dirty irons. Would highly recommend to all serious golfers.",

      "text": "It's functional in its current design. It retains moisture and clean balls and clubs. HOWEVER, the opening should have a elastic band instead of a solid non-elastic stitching. The non-elastic band/stitching makes it difficult to fit clubs and difficult to flip it inside-out for drying. It is a simple design change and I would love to purchase this again if it had an elastic opening.",
