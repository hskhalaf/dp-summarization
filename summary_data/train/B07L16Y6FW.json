For $8 it's no Dupont but certainly performs (and looks) better than any zippo I've owned. The only slight issue I have come to notice is that it is near impossible to light a pipe with it, due to the arm swinging up when you ignited it is very hard to get the flame near the pipe. With that being said, this is a wonderful little lighter and I would certainly recommend this to anyone who smokes.",

Its bright and has three modes (flash, high and low). The lighter is the only downside. First, the lid gets in the way of lighting a lot of things. So you have to get some paper to light harder to reach items. Secondly, using the lighter seems to drain the battery rather quickly. I can usually light the lighter after a full charge 2-3 times and then it starts to act wonky. It is a nice idea, but I think I might go back to a separate lighter.",

Other than that even after about a year it still worked and held enough charge to last atleast a day. Still beats how many regular lighters I would have bought, lost and had stolen in that year.",

Great for windy conditions as the plasma arcs cant blow out in high winds or rain. He used it every day during our camping trip and had no issues. Fact it also has a flash light makes this lighter versatile in any condition and is rechargable saving on cost of expensive batteries. Over all he was very happy with this product.
