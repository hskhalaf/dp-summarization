      "text": "This little fan has FAR exceeded my expectations. The battery that came with it will last an easy 2 to 3 hours on high. It moves plenty of air and keeps a little one cool during those hot days. We use this all the time at the theme parks. An excellent investment. Just a suggestion purchase yourself some extra 18650 batteries. Another tip, you are external phone charger/battery pack will also charge and run this fan for many many hours. If I could give this thing 10 stars I would. It is durable and I was also survived multiple drops off of the counter and several times and we have gotten caught in heavy rain storms.",

Battery last a good hour on high and much longer on low takes a couple hours to recharge so long recharge. Doesn't run on full power when plugged in though meaning when you turn fan on high it doesn't run as hard as when it's not plugged in (weird huh?) Only thing i don't like is the \"special\" battery. Did Amazon search and doesn't seem to be any here. So I guess if battery breaks in a few years I have to re-buy the fan? Hope not, I'll have to come back here and update review.",

If I'm traveling with one of our dogs, it works great at getting the AC air to the back of the car to them. I just hook it onto the divider. Wonderful for the summer heat! It's also very quiet.

We even used it as a cooling fan when sleeping at night, attach right to the headboard, as one of the hottest region in Italy hardly has any A/C when doing air Bnb.

Prior to this the fan worked fine - someone on the assembly line was probably overtired and inattentive. I suspect Sky Genius has closed up and reopened under a different name to avoid issuing replacements or refunds, because they have not responded to my emails, and do not answer their phone when Amazon CS tries to contact them. The Amazon people were quick to respond, and nice enough to issue me a credit. So, I recommend avoiding \"Sky Genius\".",

It still holds a charge that lasts through a whole soccer game + walk around the park, while on high power.

You think there are tons of places in your car, but there really isn't. The flexible neck helps, but the fan is heavy enough to droop out of position, such as; sliding down the seat belt, clipping it onto the carseat mirror takes the mirror out of position, clipping to the carseat is to close so she plays with it, clipping to the head rest neck (shaft?) blocks vision of the rearview mirror. We liked the fan, but placement was tough. And it ate the batteries!",

We charged it when our generator was running, and it worked great for two nights and ran about 6-7hrs each night, which helped to ease the heat over our heads while sleeping. There is a little wheel to adjust the speed and to turn it off. After two nights, the wheel no longer works to shut off the fan. The only way to turn it off is to take out the battery. This is so disappointing because I was thinking of other ways to use this! Will not be purchasing this one again.",

The clip base means you can only attach it to certain things, however you can turn the fan and it may be able to work for what you need it to.",

I will gladly update my review to five stars once summer hits as we just moved to the desert and will definitely need the fan. Great until it didn\u2019t work while we needed it the most. The battery seemed fine when connected to a charger but as soon as it was disconnected the fan stopped working. We bought it for our Florida trip and it was useless for us. We used it a handful of times before our trip. I do not recommend this fan",

      "text": "We bought this for Disney and it was great! I used it while I was strolling my child (They had a fan) I would clip this to where it was blowing on me while I was pushing the stroller and it was a lifesaver! I will be buying another one as I left mine plugged in at the hotel on our last day there. :-( The battery life was pretty good considering I had it on full blast for about 5 hours with turning it off (when I remembered) when I wasn't using it. Love that you just have to plug it in and not worry about batteries.",

Highly recommend this fan.",
