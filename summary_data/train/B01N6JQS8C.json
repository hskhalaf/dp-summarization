If you have and you can, plug this into intel (or amd, whatever) native chip, not 3rd party chips. My mainboard also has asmedia Sata3 6gbps chipset, but it's about 20% slower than Intel chipset even though they are both sata3 6gbps chipsets.

      "text": "I needed an SSD to fix a client's computer. Worked as it should. Faster than a traditional mechanical hard drive for sure. However, there are other brands out there like Silicon Power, ADATA, and even Crucial that are the same capacity, are less expensive, and utilize 3D NAND technology - which makes them a little better in terms of energy efficiency and speed. I got this because it offered next day delivery. Don't get me wrong, it works and works well - I just feel there are better options out there.",

      "text": "I have used many of the 120gb and 240gb models for desktop and laptop builds. Some have many hours on them, no issues with a single one. I don't think you can go wrong with these for the price. The Samsung 500gb EVO SSD would be a step up from these, and would be better if you are storing critical data. Otherwise, for gaming or basic use, these Kingston SSDs are more than adequate.",
