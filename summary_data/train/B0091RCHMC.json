If you've never driven in\\on snow ice with tire chains there's no way you can imagine the difference, its literally night and day. Crazy easy to get on and off once you get a system down, far superior told old school chains with the stretchy tensioners. Just make sure to hang them to dry once you remove them or they WILL start to get some surface rust",

After about 10-15 minutes sitting in the snow my two daughters finally got them connected. We kept them on for the 3 days we were there--they held up great and felt very secure as we drove up to the ski area, to our mountain condo, etc. This was our first time driving in the snow and using chains.",

Driver side: Route the red end from the front to rear This is so that the locking module faces the correct orientation. This is with a 2016 VW Tiguan SE 4Motion with the factory 16\" steel wheels with 215/65r16 Nitto SN-2 winter tires. Hopefully, I will never have to use them",

    "description": "Size:Series 1500 - 153005Auto\u2011Trac can be installed without moving (or jacking up) the vehicle! The patented, ratcheting tightening system automatically tightens the chain while driving. Just connect the inside cable, attach the two outside selftighteners and drive! No additional chain tensioners are necessary or recommended. Auto\u2011Trac will meet Class \u201cS\u201d clearance requirements on SUVs and pickup trucks, as well as normal passenger cars (matching the capabilities of most of our \u201cZ\u201d cable products). This is possible because of a highly effective, patented tensioning system. Auto\u2011Trac cross member links are made of manganese alloy steel, allowing them to be shorter, narrower and lighter than conventional cross members. This reduces \u201cfly\u2011off\u201d during operation and provides more gripping points. The low\u2011mass \u201cD\u201d cross section of the links also contributes to longer wear because the impact of the cross members on the road surface is reduced and the surface area contacting the road is increased.",
