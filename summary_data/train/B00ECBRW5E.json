I scanned my artwork and was blown away by the quality of the scanned image; I need to spend time now to see how the various adjustments affect the finished scan & also to try out the stitching function for an A3 original. So far though this scanner has outperformed my old Canon 5600F.",

Did quite a lot of research on getting the best one for my needs This is configured for my Mac so software works fine with no issues. Am running 10.12.6 on my Mac just incase you wanted to know.",

I don't know much about the Digital Ice feature except that it works. Another bonus is the fact that it is quite simple to use, not being a genius with computers and things i have soon got the hang of it even using professional mode and i am currently scanning for Britain!....Marvelous don't hesitate!",

This machine coped very well and results were fine for my requirements. Much better than the old Canon 9900F film scanner. The downside was no 5x4inch option and I had to mess about scanning these negatives to get most of the image. Prior to buying the V600 I borrowed the V700 to try out. It's not worth the extra money. Regarding scanning prints, I still use my Canon LiDE 210. It's much better, quicker and easier. So if you are only going to scan prints, don't bother.",

The V600 with ICE Technology for both film AND prints sold me. The results are truly superb - The software included (Epson Scan) works well on my iMac, but the buttons on the front don't function for some reason on a Mac (OK on a PC though I believe). The ICE Technology works like magic - Removing dust spots and scratches. The penalty is time. A scan with ICE enabled probably doubles the scan time - Something worth considering if you have a large number of negs/slides to scan. Highly recommended.",
