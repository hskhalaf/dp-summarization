The picture is really stunning. I have never owned a tv before, and I have to say that investing in Samsung (over Vizio or other smaller brands), the larger size, and 1080p were definitely worth it. I can see the quality in the image. Easy streaming and no lag. The sound is great, too. The only thing, that others have complained about too, is that the tv needs a few minutes (5 at the most) to warm up and connect to your wireless network.",

It has to load everything through whatever bandwidth you have and it's 100% video content which is the largest thing you can possibly be trying to download and upload. It works just fine. When my bandwidth is sufficient there's no lag or choppiness; when I have low bandwidth it stops a lot. This is because of the bandwidth, not the television. The television is awesome.

My house is 115 years old with slanted floors and my Samsung TV is standing solid and secure on the stand I have for it. Super happy with the smart functions and how well it displays the local channels. I use an antenna with it and my Samsung tablet that mirrors so I'm free of cable and the huge monthly bills! Thanks, Samsung! You saved me $120 a month!",

The shows on Hulu are constantly buffering and I my internet Upload speed is 62.46 Mps. I have contacted Hulu, but the rep seems like this was the first time he heard of this problem. I explained to him that the reviews are all over the internet. Since, I can't watch Hulu without the buffering, I just use my amazon fire tv until Hulu fixes their buffering problem. UPDATE as of APRIL 7: HULU is now working good on the Samsung tv, which is why I change my stars to 5.",

Lost another star due to start up being slow. At start up we have to wait 3-5 minutes to use the apps, but this being the bedroom set it's just a nuisance that we'll live with.",

The internet connection is strong and fast, it is the TV shortcoming. Only way to exit Netflix is to unplug the TV. If you exit Netflix using the exit tab, then it freezes up. After Netflix the TV will not turn off, so have to unplug it. Terrible \"Smart\" TV. The other brands in the house work great.",

If your cable box is running slow, chances are it's not the TV. Light weight and great for easy hanging on a wall.
