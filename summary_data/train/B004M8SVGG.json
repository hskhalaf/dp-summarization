Get over yourselves with the auto-camera everything needs. I came from the insta tiny cameras family generation with stinky photos. They were fine. Did the job. Were fine. This camera gives tons of manual camera benefits, not so extensive zoom/but good zoom but is a very great camera! Not for basic camera users who won't take the time to take advantage of it's many great options. So glad it has stayed on the market! Yeah!",

Although a small camera, it has a large sensor and takes superb photos which are near-DSLR quality. It has fully automatic modes, semi-automatic and fully manually modes. Now that my original P300 is getting a little old after taking thousands of images, I purchased a used-like-new replacement of the same camera. The one on Amazon looks like \"new old stock\" and shows no signs of ever having been used. At 65 dollars, it was a wonderful deal!",

So great to be able to tuck such a powerful camera into a pocket or purse. The lens on the P300 is amazing. The ability to get short depth of field shots in such a compact camera makes me wonder when I might feel compelled to lug around my SLR when not working on an assignment. The only advantage SLRs have, in my experience so far, are the ability to zoom to lock a focal point and then recompose, as well as save in RAW format. But those are perfectly acceptable for a compact camera. Lovin it.",

If you can afford the extra $$$$ I would still buy the Canon S95. (NOT the S100)If not, this is arguably the best camera for your money. Feature sets of both cameras are remarkably similar. As always, with all the point and shoot cameras, take multiple exposures when possible to help to insure you get the best photos.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCREATE IN ANY LIGHT.\nTHE FASTEST LENS EVER IN A NIKON COOLPIX.\nThe COOLPIX P300 camera does justice to your photographic talents with a 4.2x wide angle, f/1.8 maximum aperture NIKKOR glass lens. This is the fastest lens Nikon has ever designed into a COOLPIX camera\u2014it offers a 24-100mm optical zoom range and impressive telephoto performance for razor-sharp images. Plus, its maximum aperture of f/1.8 assures exceptional low-light results and minimum depth of field. This outstanding lens will showcase your skills whether you're shooting portraits, panoramas, weddings, real estate, products, publicity stills or any other challenging compositions\u2014and will do so with still images or Full HD (1080p) movies. Simply put, this high-performance lens catches detailed images while displaying Nikon's proud tradition of producing precision camera optics.\n\nADVANCED FEATURES FOR CHALLENGING CONDITIONS.\nIts 12.2-megapixel CMOS sensor provides superb image quality, high speed operation and exceptional low-light performance. The back-illuminated CMOS lets you shoot true-to-life pictures with remarkable detail and color clarity. The COOLPIX P300's four-way VR Image Stabilization is also a boon for handheld shooting. Custom optimized for this COOLPIX P300 model, Nikon's exclusive EXPEED C2 processing engine enhances professional quality images.\n\nYou'll also love Motion Detection's ability to identify moving objects in frame, adjust shutter speed and ISO, and freeze the subject to create stunningly sharp photos. When activated, Best Shot Selector automatically records up to ten shots with a single press of the shutter and then selects and saves only the best image. The camera's high ISO speed of up to 3200 with advanced noise reduction assures brilliant still images of dimly lit and fast moving photo subjects.\n\nMANUAL CONTROL FOR THE SERIOUS PHOTOGRAPHER.\nThe COOLPIX P300 allows photographers to stretch their creative limits with an impressive range of manual control. There's a Mode Dial for quick and convenient control over select settings, including shutter/aperture/programmed and manual exposure. Exposure Bracketing automatically brackets exposure for three shots. And the ISO can be set as high as 3200 at full resolution to control image quality in low-light conditions or when shooting fast moving subjects. \n\nHigh-Contrast Monochrome The COOLPIX P300 also features several new in-camera special effects, including High-Contrast Monochrome for sophisticated black and white shots. Nostalgic Sepia adds character and mood or creates shots with an antiqued look. In-camera editing functions such as active D-Lighting restore details and contrast. This camera comes with several filter effects like Painting, Fisheye, Miniature, and Cross Screen. You can also control images with a creative slider that adjusts brightness, intensity and hue. \n\nFULL HD MOVIE RECORDING AT 1080P\nHD movies have become the standard for web posting, website design enhancement, publicity clips and real estate property tours\u2014or simply for capturing action that delivers so much more impact in high quality video. With the COOLPIX P300, you can shoot Full HD (1080p) movies while recording full stereo sound. The One-Touch recording button allows instant moviemaking, while the optical zoom control creates a variety of cinematic effects. Slow and fast motion HD movie options for 15, 60 and 120 fps*. Viewing and sharing your movies is simple too, with an HDMI-CEC output that allows in-camera playback or convenient hookup to an HDTV or computer.\n\n* reduced resolution\n\nTHE COOLPIX P300 TAKES THE GUESSWORK OUT.\nAdvanced Night Landscape mode Every shooting environment comes with its own unique characteristics, and the COOLPIX P300 has intuitive features to help you master each one. It optimizes settings for up to 20 common scenes so you simply point and shoot. Turn on the Scene Auto Selector and the camera automatically recognizes the scene you're in and selects the best one from among seven choices. With Nikon's ingenious Easy Panorama Scene Mode, just pan in any direction and it will automatically detect the movement, then combine and assemble the various shots into one seamless 180-or 360-degree panoramic image.\n\nNikon knows that night and low-light shooting present tricky challenges. Advanced Night Landscape and the related Advanced Night Portrait are invaluable tools that eliminate the guesswork by shooting consecutive shots at fast shutter speed and composing them into sharp depictions of night scenes.\n\nCONVENIENT FEATURES\nPhoto ops often arrive without warning, but your COOLPIX P300 is always ready with invaluable features like ultra fast start-up and autofocus\u2014plus automatic High Speed Shooting that can capture up to seven shots in a second at full resolution. You can compose your shot using the large, three-inch LCD Clear Color Display.

Smile Timer automatically releases the shutter when your subject smiles, while Face-Priority AF detects and focuses up to 12 faces at once. When activated, Blink Warning alerts you when a subject may have blinked and suggests a retake. The innovative in-camera Red-Eye Fix\u2021 addresses the problem by correcting for red-eye while the camera is shooting. Uneven or ruddy complexions can also be corrected with Skin Softening, which smoothes skin tones at three different levels and can be applied while shooting or during playback. Your close up shots will also be enhanced by the COOLPIX P300's Macro Shooting capabilities, taking clear, sharp pictures as close as 1.2 inches.
