      "text": "I used this deep repair masque just once, and I noticed a difference immediately. I have curly, thick hair, so most \"deep\" conditioners aren't effective. I need a very deep conditioning treatment that seeps into my hair, rather than sits on top without penetrating. This conditioner seeped into my strands, and after rinsing it out, my hair was softer. And the scent is great, it's very light. I'm looking forward to my hair's improved condition as I use this conditioner repeatedly over the next couple of months. I would recommend this masque to people with thick or curly hair like myself, but not for people with thin or fine hair, as it would likely weigh it down too much.",

The usually pleasant, light scent was now very strong. Instead of an off-white color this one had a pinkish tinge to it. It also weighs my hair down which is the exact opposite of how it made my hair feel previously. I guess there's a reason it was so much less expensive than buying it at my local department store. You get what you pay for....",

It also has a nice smell. If you use it as a deep conditioner, it works best to apply a generous amount, wrap your hair in a plastic bag, then wrap your head up in a hot towel or to apply heat in some other manner, such as the hair dryers at the salon. The heat will improve your hair's ability to absorb the conditioner and the results will be longer lasting.",
