Later that day, I surfed up to Amazon.com and bought it. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the gorgeous, iridescent shades here, which match every single piece of clothing I own. The shades are like a shimmering (not glittery, overdone or tacky) green, purple, peach and blue. OWIE gorgeous. Of course the colors will look different on various skin tones, and I happen to be SUPER fair. Even so, I think these colors would look great on darker skin, too - more dramatic.",

Sephora just got the palettes restocked, and they probably aren't going to last long. People do this gross buy/resell at a higher price because it's hard to find all the time, and greedy people know they can cash in on it.
