I drilled four mounting holes all the way through my bench back about an inch from the forward edge, wing nuts on threaded bolts let me pop the whole thing on and off in a jiffy. Make sure the bike bike hangs out far enough so the pedals can be spun without hitting the bench. The front wheel will rest on the floor. Perfect!",

I worry about the plastic where the arm intersects that if you were to do some heavy work on the bike like tighting bolts and such that might be a weak point.

My use is more cleaning and small adjustments. If that one piece were more metal or heavier material would be better.",

I was a little leary about how hard I had to crank down on the knobs to get it to keep from twisting or tilting at times, but it held up and was solid. It made working on crankset, freewheel, brakes etc. a breeze. Definitely recommended for the casual rider, it's solid and very well made for the price.",

I will be taping and possibly using zip ties to ensure it wont break. If they create a 90 degree piece with aluminum and sell it, i will buy it, then change my rating to 5 stars.",
