Use - the device constantly displays a low signal/bobber out of water warning when its in the water and 3 feet in front of me. 75% of the time it\u2019s in this unusable state. Accuracy - very suspect. Once while kayaking it said I was in 20 feet of water when I was clearly in 5. Water temp, when not fluctuating wildly, appears accurate. Those two issues cause me to seriously question if the fish it\u2019s displaying are \u201creal\u201d. If this item is defective, cool. I hope they offer a swap.
