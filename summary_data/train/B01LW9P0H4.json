I have a T-Mobile SIM in mine now and it works just fine. Anyway, the phone itself is great. Beautiful display, a loud, clear front facing speaker, runs incredibly smooth and of course the battery is a beast. Plus, you get a free style mod in the box. For 400 bucks (though I got mine for 350), you can't go wrong.",

I barely used the functionally for about one year but really started using full functionality in 2018. It is 2 years 8 mths, and the battery has started to drain at a mind boggling rate without much warning. At 50% it just shut itself off. It could be something else but the apps are stable. Motorola phones supposedly have long life spans so I am a little disappointed. Maybe 2 to 3 years is expected? I don't know but that's what I got out of mine. Overall though I really loved this phone.",

Ok, I think you get the picture now. And yes, the picture - both the quality and mechanism are first rate and quite easy to use. There is no need to spend more money on the so-called \"high end\" phones unless you are into sophomoric bragging rights.",

My only complaint is that I purchased this thinking it was fully T-mobile compatible, but there's apparently some proprietary libraries that T-mobile only puts on its own branded phones. This phone can use T-mobile SIMs, but it won't run T-mobile apps or do native T-mobile wifi calls. Fortunately, the 4g reception on this phone is great, so wifi calling is less important.",

This is an error on their part as originally they told me it would not be an issue. The phone worked perfectly and arrived in perfect condition. Fyi for verizon customers, you HAVE to buy Verizon's of the phone. I spent three days back and forth between my local Verizon store and verizon IT trying to get it to work tried 3 different SIM cards etc. They ended up telling me it wasn't possible after three days of promising it would work.",

It would have static/skipping during the conversations that would end up with me having to ask people to repeat themselves over and over. If it works with other bluetooth systems, I don't know. Everything else on the phone was pretty awesome, too bad about the bluetooth.",
