I will use the rake for a different application then what I wanted it for. I belief a leaf rake should be strong, but light weight. It should have a firm but flexible and springy action that is suitable for leaves and thatch. This rake is too heavy and has little or no spring. The handle is to big around to be comfortable. For heavy duty use it will have some function. But definitely not what I wanted.",

Sure they bend slightly at the tips, but not in the way a leaf rake is supposed to bend so that you can pick up leaves in a big clump. I'm not sure what the maker intended with this rake. It's too heavy, inefficient and clunky. I plan on returning them.",
