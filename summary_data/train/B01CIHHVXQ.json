I love that the music player has a choice for so many songs as well as full length songs- so often you get stuck with a 15 second clip of song that your kid repeats over and over. We've had the table for about a month now, and still have not even used all of the features! Absolutely great buy for the price!",

It is great for a new walker who can stand at it and play music and dance or it is great for a toddler who has better motor skills and can work on the activity cards. My only complaint is that if you buy separate additional learning cards, the ages on them aren't too accurate. Our 3 year old aged beyond the 3-5 year old cards much quicker than the age range suggests. So, if Vtech makes more age appropriate cards, this is a must have! If they don't, then make sure you buy it as soon as your child starts pulling himself or herself up to a standing position to maximize usage.",
