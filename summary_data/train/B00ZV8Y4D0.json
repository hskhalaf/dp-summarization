      "text": "I bought this product since it contains food grade hydrogen peroxide, and is not tested on animals, but on friends and neighbors. It has a subtle yet refreshing minty taste, and I have noticed that it seems to have reduced any gum inflammation that I had before. It is somewhat expensive for a mouthwash, but I must say, it is worth it. It is best to order 3 or more bottles at a time, to get the best price. I hope that as this company has success, that they will continually lower the price more, and that way more customers can enjoy it. I advise you to try it, as I am sure you will like it.",

I have been through one container of this mouthwash along with the original tooth paste and have seen noticeable improvements in teeth regeneration, whiting, breath, and my gums are less swollen and lighter pink. i i use the tooth paste twice a day and one cap full of the mouth wash three times a day along with flossing once a day. love it and cannot wait to see further improvement.",

The company was wonderful to deal with - my order arrived quickly, was packaged well to insure no leakage, and even came with a sample of their toothpaste. I love that the mouthwash is organic and does not contain things I'm trying to avoid (gluten, fluoride, and other nasty chemicals). It seems like it's really good for your mouth and the taste is pleasant - not too strong. Yes, it's pricey, but you don't use that much at a time and it's worth it.",
