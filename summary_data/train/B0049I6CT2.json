The roaches do this sort of \"heroin\" stand using one or two legs to hold on to the wall, cabinet, whatevs. That's when you know they ate the bait.

We would always use Reid and spray everything down but the dang bugs would not go away. I bought this because I realized that spraying a chemical all around the house was not very safe for us. I put this stuff in all the corners of the house, the cabinets, the rooms and the closets. I kid you not within a month we started to see a major difference. Now 1 year later I'm proud to say we are 100% free of cockroaches. Not a single roach has been spotted in the house. Amazing product definitely recommend!",

If you use the gel correctly you will begin to see roaches that are dying or dead within a matter of 24hrs. The gel draws the roaches out of where they are hiding and once they eat the gel they begin to die. This roach kilee saves you so much time and once the roaches die they are gone for good. It not only kills the roaches on the spot but it fights to keep them away as well!",

This stuff works! and you don't need but just a tiny - smaller than garden pea size - dab in multiple places to fix the problem. I even used this stuff in my garage where massive huge \"Palmetto Bugs\" and even mole crickets were everywhere (cat food and litter box areas) and I now have ZERO roaches - ZERO bugs! I love this stuff! Packaging could be better, no padding and the box was crushed. Fortunately, none of the gel tubes were broken. Rockwell Labs, please do better!",

You must pay attention to your four legged critters in the house, even though I could not detect anything attractive about the scent of the bait, my dog sure was interested. Bury the bait behind furniture or deep in crevices etc.... I am so excited with the possibility of controlling earwigs!",
