It comes in a nice little bag for storage. Whenever the kids have to potty, I can have the potty and the bag ready in a few minutes. Disposal is simple and mess free. You just pop the bag off, tie, and discard! We leave it in the car and use it for short trips and long trips! No more nasty convenience store bathrooms!!",

The pee either goes right over the pee guard and all over the floor, or it hits the pee gaurd and splashes up and over, all over him and the regular toilet seat.
