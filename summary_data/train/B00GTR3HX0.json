      "text": "Nice unit. We use it in our bathroom so that our five kids all have their own bathing, grooming stuff in one place, and a hook for their own towel, and it's worked great for that! The reviews saying the shelves are made of cardboard are wrong. They're made of some sort of thin balsa-like composite. They're not super heavy duty, but they are a rigid, solid material and not cardboard, so won't get soggy if wet (which was a concern of ours).",

The reason there are not pre-drilled holes is because you need to find the wall stud to hang it. My hubby had this put together and hung in my daycare in about an hour.",
