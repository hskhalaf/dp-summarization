The glove did great, I didn\u2019t have to rotate gloves at all, which I was expecting to need to do. I will purchase again, only a large next time.",

It's the longest lasting glove I've ever played with, and I wear it from 1st tee to 18th hole-in. It gets stinky after three or four rounds, but throw it in the washer and it's ready to go again. I get at least 10, maybe 15 rounds before the palm pad wears out or splits, which is what usually fails for me on other brands after three or four rounds. I just hope the supply doesn't run out!",
