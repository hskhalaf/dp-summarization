      "text": "This 4 letter combo lock is a great idea. It's pretty easy to set up and use. However, after 5 months of alternate daily use at a middle school, the lock jammed open and would not budge. There is apparently a design flaw inside the lock that allows it to easily get jammed after it's been opened. I used pliers to force it out of its jammed position after spraying silicone lubricant inside the lock. This particular incident doesn't leave me with a whole lot of confidence in the lock. And Master's 2-4 week replacement timeframe for warranty replacements is totally unacceptable.",

I was unable to work out which letter it might have been. After trying all the variables I could think of, I threw it away, since it was unusable in the locked position. Plus, it was a very heavy lock compared to my two other ones. Overall, not a good experience.",
