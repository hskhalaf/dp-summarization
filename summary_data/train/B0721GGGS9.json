The controller is still the same size, but the good thing about the console being smaller is that you can easily find a spot for it. You will want to purchase one of the recommended controller extension cables, so you will not have to sit right up on it, when playing. It still has that old school Nintendo look, without any fuzziness. It brings back so many great memories!",

MUCH better than the aftermarket ones you buy to plug into your computer. The only negative thing about this product is that the controller cables (although longer than the NES Classic) are STILL rather short. Maybe I've just gotten spoiled by the modern wireless ones, but I bought two extension cables so that my son and I can play it from the couch rather than sitting on the floor. Other than that, GREAT PRODUCT!!!",
