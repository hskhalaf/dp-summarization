In my original thought, I\u2019d figure that would be a lot easier.There are other ones where you have to connect each pole together individually. So yes, it was easier, but I can see why this idea is flawed because it didn\u2019t make an arch. As you can see in the picture, it ended up making this rectangle shape. I would not recommend it if you are looking for that perfect arch. Still disappointed because the manual that came with it shows that perfect arch as well. And the table it is used on in the picture is a 6.5 ft table in case anyone was wondering.",

It stayed up perfectly using non-helium balloons. I loved the rings it came with - so you didn't have to tie the balloons together, just slip them on the rings and then slide the ring down the pole. So easy. The hardest part is just tying the knots on the balloons..... Glad I made this purchase and will be looking for some addition balloon related items.",

The balloons won't hurt nybody but if the arch falls over someone could get injured trying to get away from a falling object. I try new things all the time, this one is not safe to use.",

My one suggestion would be if you are using this outdoors or indoors around kids to secure the rod to the base with extra tape (like duct tape) around the base and the balloon bar itself. It looks secured to the table but the bar just kinda sits in the base so it came flying out at us with a strong wind, it was horrifying and popped a ton of balloons. After we re-did the balloons and secured it to the base clip with tape it was great.",

I'm surprised by all the bad reviews as we loved this! I can see myself using this again, many times, now that I know how easy it is! For the price I may even order a second one.

Great alternative to other balloons, and we can use this year after year and avoid that massive bill on helium filled balloons. Also it is so festive and fun, Our daughter is super excited!",

Only issue we had was someone had to hold the clamp on the opposite end when attaching the second end and the arch is full of balloons. But the worst that happened is some of the rings slid off and we just put them back on, problem fixed. Would 100% recommend!",
