      "title": "You have to twist your head to read the scans",
      "text": "I purchased this item so I could quickly scan receipts and other miscellaneous paperwork. It does scan the items, however, most of them come out crooked and have to be adjusted in editing software. I have tried everything, over and over, to try and get things to scan straight. The little clip to adjust paper width is not only hard to readjust by does not do the job of holding paper while the paper is being scanned. So, if you don't mind crooked scans and have lots of time to adjust the scan in post editing software - this is the scanner for you.",

      "text": "Love the extreme portability of this unit. We use it only very occasionally to copy printed documents at remote locations. As long as it's charged up ahead of time, there's no need for computers, cables, or power sources. Just the base unit itself with the microSD card inside. This whole thing actually will fit in my pocket! We've copied as many as 180 pages without needing to recharge; don't know what the limit might be. Only problem we've had is occasionally truncating docs on the left and right sides for no apparent reason. This can be detected by watching the tiny display screen, so the document can be re-scanned.",

The scans are good. The one that came first didn't lock the micro sd card into place, but the company replaced it with no problems for me.",

Plus it was not very good with pictures as it seems to scan a white line in the picture and even though I cleaned it and followed directions to try to correct the problem, it still did it. I do like that it is great with paperwork, like receipts etc. and I like that it is rechargeable. I also like that it is lightweight and portable and can be taken with you where ever you may need it.",

Bought it in anticipation of upcoming Family Reunion focussing on Genealogy. Will probably be using the scanner very hard for those Four or Five Days. Will have a much better measure of its utility by the end of that event.",
