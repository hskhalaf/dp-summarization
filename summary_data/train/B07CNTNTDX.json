The seller was great to work with as well and provided lots of great email updates to minimize the concern over the gift arriving on time. She busted it out immediately after unwrapping it and- before we knew it- her jewelry was sparkling like new! We've tried a few other jewelry cleaner solutions and this one is by far the best one we've used. I highly recommend this product!",

Definitely recommend if your pieces are looking dull and lackluster, this will make them shine like new again. I wish I had thought of this much sooner. The machine is super quiet. I will need to get more solution as the bottle isn\u2019t too big and won\u2019t last long. Overall totally worth the money.",
