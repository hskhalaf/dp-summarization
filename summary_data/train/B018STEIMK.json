After a month, I noticed that I had a hard time controlling where the mop went. This mop doesn't go under or behind furniture so there's no real wear and tear but I noticed the green plastic piece at the bottom is broken (as pictured) and I can't use it anymore. Since I can't tighten it, the mop is all over the place. It's unfortunate that it broke this easily. I'm not happy",

I also was not happy with the velcro on the Norwex that didn't hold the mop properly and often folded over on itself. Not only is the Lynkyo floor mop as good or better quality microfiber, the system for attaching it to the mop head is genius. No slippage and the mop glides effortlessly over the floor.

I ended pulling the microfiber part of the mop along the side of my mop bucket to push out excess water prior to mopping. It wasn\u2019t perfect but better than the design - Due to the inability to effectively wring out excess water, the maneuverability sucked. I had to push down on the handle to ensure the large flat portion would stay on the floor instead of flipping 90-degrees onto the side - Based on availability of reusable products, I would buy this again",

I cannot imagine I will ever actually wear it out. I also really like the extra long handle. I am 6ft and while I did not need it, I find it be wonderful.

I have just used warm water and usually rinse out the pad three times so I am not just pushing a dirty pad around. Probably would not be good on a rough surface. For the price, I am very pleased.",

The extra wide mop head is definitely another plus. Tomorrow I'm going to clean the kitchen and bathroom floors with it. I just tossed the cloths in the washer and their ready to reuse.
