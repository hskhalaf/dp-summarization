Really convenient to for use to use as we can deflate it and put it in the truck for travel. That being said it's very easy to set up, and now that we've done it a couple times, 1 person can have this inflated and in the water in about 20 minutes. Works great with 2 people in the boat, we use a 55lb thrust electric motor with it. Looking to up grade that to an outboard at some point. I definitely recommend this product.",

Despite my vessel being out of warranty , I inquired about a leek that seemed to be a factory flaw and the folks at Newport vessels could not be more helpful and professional. They could have easily hidden behind a recently expired warranty but instead went above and beyond and shipped a new vessel to replace the faulty one free of charge. I don\u2019t know many companies that would do this and I would recommend Newport simply based on their character and integrity.",

I also use it for maintenance, fishing and for setting and pulling 2 lobster traps. This boat is a beast! Seems bulletproof but very roomy and comfortable. I bottom painted it and have no worries leaving it at the dock (secured). Almost passed on this purchase as I didn\u2019t know the name. Well I know it now and it is awesome",
