Also the switch comes with a interchangeable rocker plate, it comes with white and light almond choice. If you are putting 2 switches in one box don't forget to buy the 2-gang rocker face plate in the color you want.",

Just installed them - found out they don\u2019t work with LED lights (which are required). Not only do they don\u2019t dim - they don\u2019t even turn on or off the lights. Contacted customer support - after 30 min on hold - they rushed me off the phone after telling me the LED lights are the problem. Title 24 in california requires LEF. We are out of return window. Very expensive light switches that don\u2019t work. Don\u2019t buy these if you use LEF lights",

Even though we have already installed 4 of them; we will definitely buy it again, for additional areas.",

Just plug in the module to the receptacle, plug into the receptacle what you want to switch, and set up control on your phone. The most time-consuming part of the process was hunting down my wifi password. Foolproof setup steps through the app, easy tap on/off switching, and it works flawlessly. I can even switch off the light I'm controlling from across the house! I'm looking forward to incorporating more from the Decora Smart series into my increasingly smart home.",

This model ramps from \"on\" to \"off\" in the same manner, but the ramp from \"off\" to \"on\" jumps straight from \"off\" to 80%-90% brightness, which appears to your eye to be essentially \"off\" and \"on\", like a standard light switch.

I originally chose Leviton Decora Smart Wi-Fi switches as they are the only switches that support more than 3-way switching, I needed 4-way for my setup, and have since gone to the Leviton Decora line for all my smart switches and outlets for my Alexa smart home integration. The only hard thing with multi-way switches is finding the last switch before the light. that switch will be the main switch with all the other \"way\" switches being the follower switches but other than that, install is easy.",

The delay to turn off other devices talking to my hub is slightly slower than my other z-wave switches but still below 1 second. The delay to turn those same devices on is still very slow. It's possible this has to do with the other devices and not the switch. So far I'm relatively happy.",
