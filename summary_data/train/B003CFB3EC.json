Excess washes off in the shower and you are left with the perfect sun-kissed tan. I have purchased this product over 5 times, and have had no issues with it.

And that only lasts 2-3 days before it's completely gone. Yes, I follow the exfoliate and moisturize instructions. Having to apply 2 days in a row, with only 3 days in between, this bottle will barely last a few weeks. So it's worth it if you're going on vacation or have an event but if you want a long lasting regular use product, this will be an investment, so I guess you choose if it's worth it.",
