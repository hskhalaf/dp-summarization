Avoid washing in IPA to prevent clouding, instead use a detergent and ultra sonic cleaner but this holds true for all resins. For the best results cure with 385nm light to prevent yellowing and paint with a spray on clear gloss for a glass like finish.",

Up to about 100 degrees C you won\u2019t notice the effects. It can take quite a bit of strain before breaking.

I have increased exposure times to ridiculous levels and added many more supports but the parts come out of the machine soft and rubbery- this is a sign of bad formulation since the components are not properly reacting when exposed to UV light. I come from a chemical background (reactive polymers) so I know what I am talking about. This is simply poor quality control.",

I've also noticed that the grey resin starts getting white streaks in it as its printing.
