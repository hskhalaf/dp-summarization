The toe box is slightly roomier with the width, heel and arch support remaining with the same great version 3 fit, and additional padding has been added...all of which add up to New Balance taking the best features of their version 3 and making small improvements that make a big difference for their best 990 version ever, and it is still made in the USA...YAY! I highly recommend the New Balance 990 version 4!!!",

I can really feel its weight/warmth, in comparison, to my Nikes, Hokas & Asics. 8oz vs. 10oz makes a difference over time, esp on your ligaments/tendons, & when you exercise in warm weather, your feet swell.

      "text": "Because I have worn this shoe in the past, the shoes ordered on Amazon were almost identical to those I already had which were purchased at the NB Store near me. I like the shoe and the discount on Amazon though the shoes purchased at the NB Store are sturdier and crafted better than the shoes I recently purchased on Amazon. The shoes from Amazon are lighter and crafted differently than the NB Store shoes. I will see if they hold up as well as the NB Store shoes have. I like that the shoes are of a lighter weight than the first pair I bought.",

I could have worn the width on the other pair but the length was way too short. I highly recommend these shoes.",

The cost wasn't really any higher than any other atheltic shoe in this category..and worth every cent tp me and my feet ! Highly recommended.",
