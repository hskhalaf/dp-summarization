There\u2019s also a water can and two sizes of buckets. It\u2019s hard to believe how much fits in this cute little bag...and so easy to stuff all of it back in the bag when done.

If the bag had remained intact I would have given this product 5 stars. The manufacturer should reinforce the straps!!!",
