But, when I got the product in it looks nothing like the one above and was much smaller and had a little clear area of the tube that shows the color of the product inside. The difference? The amount of product. My old tube was .88 and this is .11. This leaves me wondering if this retailer is using the photo of the larger product to sell the smaller size. Let the buyer beware!",
