The instructions are a joke. I can use it with HDMI cable on my mac air, but no matter how often I try, I cannot get it to connect to my WIFI. I've written to them and heard nothing back. But I'm going to keep trying, because as I said....it looks great!",

For example, a 10 second video in my photo album took about 20 seconds to load up and start playing. The quality was very bad too... lots of artifacts and distortions on the screen. In my opinion the airplay/wifi feature is useless, which is why I bought this device. I'd rather have a cheaper, plug-in only device.",

Took off one star because the included tri-pod is not as stable as I had hoped, and the instructions weren't the easiest to follow.
