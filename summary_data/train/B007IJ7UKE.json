This Thunderbolt adapter is much, much faster than the USB3-SATA adapter. I have both. With the USB3, I was getting hard drive throughputs of 30-35 MB/sec. With the Thunderbolt adapter, my throughputs jumped to 120-140 MB/sec (copying entire hard drives). I just copied a 182 GB folder in 22 minutes. Of note, this is being done on a 2012 iMac. 3. Thunderbolt cable not included. 4. Relatively expensive, but allows you fast desktop access to all of your old SATA drives while maintaining good throughput speeds.",

I use it with my Macbook Pro with an SSD in it and a non-desk version (STAE121) with an SSD daisy-chained off of it. I get sustained reads of 500 MB/sec and sustained writes of 250 - 274 MB/sec to/from both of the external SSDs. My only complaint is that the Desk version (STAE122) is larger/bulkier than it needs to be, much larger than the (STAE121) and the only addition is the extra Thunderbolt port. While it is plenty small for a desktop device, it doesn't travel as easily as I would like, which is important because the smaller STAE121 does not have an extra Thunderbolt port for a daisy-chain.",
