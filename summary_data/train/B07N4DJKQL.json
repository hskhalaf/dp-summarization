      "text": "My monitor started showing these vertical lines 6 months after the warranty expired. Though it was out of warranty, I still thought that ASUS might help me figure out what went wrong and if it was fixable. But as it was out of warranty they felt that their obligation to me had ended, and apparently feel no obligation to the environment, so they weren't interested. Any large reputable dealer has a repair centre, where repairs are free when in warranty and charged outside the warranty. The fact that ASUS won't repair their own products shows either a lack of faith in their products or complete contempt for the environment. Probably both.",

Hung off my 27\" iMac 5k as second screen, using Display Port for connection leaving HDMI free to connect laptop if needed. 27\" screen is bright, colour matching exceptional (proved just how far the old screen had drifted - and how mediocre Apple's 27\" 5k panel is). Superb detail, no obvious delay, excellent for photo/video editing al the way down to watching TV from streaming apps. Is it expensive? Yes - but you get what you pay for. Would I buy another? Of course.",

After reading many other reviews and computer magazine articles online as to what would suit my needs and workflow this one came out on quality and price. The colour calibration on the screen is excellent, making scanned images and design artwork much easier to process. So finally from my personal view point, based on my experience these past few weeks of constant use it has proved to be a valuable addition to my workplace.",

We are not experts, but there seems to be little, if any, colour or brightness variation between centre and edge. So far, we would recommend this monitor.",

As some other reviewers have said, the picture is rather bright, but I soon became used to it. I've not done much Photoshop work with it yet but spent several hours virtual flying and viewing many scenery items that I formerly didn't know existed. A quality product, very flexible in usability and for my money, it is worth the extra cost.",

There is some backlight bleed through in the bottom right of the screen on start-up with the BIOS pages, but this is not going to affect my use. Colour quality is excellent; I might buy another one if it is available at a similar price.",

Amazon unfortunately don't seem to be in any rush to actually ship a replacement to me. Not a great experience and I am unlikely to keep if the replacement is of a similar sub standard quality.",
