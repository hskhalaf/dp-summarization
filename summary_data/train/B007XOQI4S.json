It sounds really loud and clear, and pairing with my iPhone 6s is frustration free. After two years, if I had to buy another portable speaker, would be this, even over a Bose, not only beacuase I consider it's as good, but becouse is that good at a fraction of the price.",

Also makes a good speaker system when playing movies on a projector or iPad. So versatile, rich sounding and just loud enough that it has to be turned down occasionally! Would recommend.",

This is perfect to fill the place with good quality sound. Definition of fill and good could be up to date, but the i add value. This is $100, and I just guess they are not providing 60% better output. Only desire is that it be chargeable via USB - like all the phones and tablets streaming it bluetooth mp3. would be nice not to carry a small power adapter.",
