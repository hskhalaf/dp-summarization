I put batteries in it today, it powered on, I was able to see to set the time and date. It will record, stop and play, but no more screen display. When I press Menu/Disp, the display goes crazy and then disappears. I know it's been almost three years since purchase, but considering the minimal use (about an hour total), I would not recommend purchasing it.",

She records his lectures then listens to it again where she can rewind, take detailed notes, and really sort it out. She LOVES it and so do her classmates who have asked that she send them the digital audio file as well. She can save it on her computer, burn it to a CD, listen to it in her car. Perfect for learning a tough subject! The device works great, picks up the audio wonderfully and is small enough to not be intrusive. I am VERY pleased with this purchase!",

I wish it had a wrist strap attached to it. I am a songwriter and if I lose it, I have lost a huge sum: It can hold over 125 - 400 songs at one time. So one really has to be careful with it.",

You can put the recordings in different folders to keep everything organized. With out added micro SD card the preinstalled 4GB hard drive gives you 43h 55m of record time. If you need to you can add a Micro SD card for extra record time. But what puts this aside of the rest of the voice recorders is that you can connect this to your computer and transfer all the recorded files for later reference. This is a must for every student that is able to record there teachers lecture.",
