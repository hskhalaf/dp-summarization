But the best feature is the pocket plates that we ended up using much more than the waffle plates! This machine does a great job and evenly cooking everything you throw into it. Sometimes and wrap different things in pizza dough and it looks like a big mess when I set it into this thing, but when its done cooking and I open it back up it reveals a perfect pizza pocket! I don't know how it does it, but it does it well!",

We've been using for several weeks and although it is not as strong as it was in the beginning, it still has an odor when it heats up.",

Our old one did not which made cleaning it difficult. This one works perfect. No problem with uneven heating. Easy to clean. Nov 2015: After some use I noticed cracks by the handle. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this. I contacted the company and was told I can ship it in for repairs.",

The only messy part, which is not necessarily the fault of the gadget, is that if you pour more dough than needed for waffles, the excess drips out of the sides and kind of makes a mess of the countertop. With the fuzzy logic of your hands and head, you will eventually figure out the amount to pour in the waffle die without making a mess, not making skinny waffles with holes in them.",
