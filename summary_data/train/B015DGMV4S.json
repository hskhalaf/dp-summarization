Red circle is flashing, but it is sometimes recording, sometimes not. Unreliable junk. I also cannot manually record important events that I want to save. Junk.

The high end stuff gets a nice camera but most are way over priced and the low end well the old adage \"You get what you pay for\" is true. There is a lot of junk out there. However, the iTrue X3 gives excellent pictures, great features and the best bang for the buck. I use it with my Dodge Challenger at the race track. No need for expensive sport cameras just attach your X3 to the windshield and run the 1/4 mile track. Lots of fun. I would highly recommend this product.",

I was able to test and understand most functions in a relatively short amount of time. One thing that seems counter-intuitive to me is that the USB port is located on the top side of the camera, so the power cable must bend 90 degrees before it reaches the cigarette lighter receptacle which sits near your knees, and it wouldn't have to if the port was located at the bottom. However, once it's hooked up, you probably won't notice it until you need to detach the cable or camera unit.",

      "text": "A very good small camera. The video is pretty clear. You can see things clearly when driving in the night in the urban area. The field of view is good. The cable is long enough so that it can be hidden in the gaps of the window and go under your carpet. There is a USB port hidden in the plug. It is convenient to save an electric output if you have other devices. Though it didn't automatically start for 3 or 4 times since purchased in this Apri, it is not a problem with me anyway.",

I immediately swapped the included 8GB memory card for a 32GB, but if you don't mind a two hour overwrite cycle, the included card should be fine.",

While in MSM you can not access the menu or manually stop recording, you have to hold cam perfectly still or cover lens until recording stops. Then you can access menu to change settings. Nothing in instruction about this. While in MSM the camera tends to lock up and must be unplugged until battery dies to reset. I did buy the 32g card and formatted it as instructed. Still I am happy with unit and have captured some really good scenes.",

Two issues: overheating occurs when its hot outside and the camera freezes/prevents recording... and the night quality. Its okay at best, very hard to read license plates and street signs",
