It sucks them up, especially my bathroom mats. And it is a short little thing. I am not quite 4'10\" tall and I hang on to the very end of the handle. I would think anyone taller would find it very uncomfortable. Also, because the \"cup\" part sits so low on the vacuum, you really can't get it under the edge of cabinets. I like the long cord and the power.",

The Hoover was just clunky and literally couldn't really pick anything. The Dirt Development had one button, easy to empty out and actually picked up dirt.

When turned on the sweeper actually blows away the dust, so you are never able to suction up the dust. Exceptionally poor design. In fact, I will ALWAYS question reviews of products, and never use that as a measure to purchase a product.",

Also, the cup doesn't attach all that securely on the front of the unit, so that generally falls off when the unit falls over. Kinda frustrating, but it works great and was reasonably priced.",

It easily picks up hair, dust bunnies and crumbs from hardwood and tile floors. I also use it on a couple of area rugs and it performs decently. It is worth the price for sure. It is small enough to store in my small kitchen pantry.",

I don't know how long it will last as I use it almost daily but so far, so great.",
