By the time I received it from the UPS delivery man, it had broken out of its box with the pointed end showing. So, as he handed it over and was shaking his head in dismay, I apologized for the shipper's lack of thought and promised him that I'd provide feedback on this point! Please greatly improve the packaging to prevent this potentially dangerous item from doing damage to humans or property during shipping!",
