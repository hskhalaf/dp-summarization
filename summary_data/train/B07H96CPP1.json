      "text": "Bought these shoes for my 22 year old son. Within 2 hours of putting them on they developed a small hole. Within 2 days they had holes all over them. As he was at school and I needed to wait to get them back we missed the return deadline. Filed a claim with NIKE. Guess what? They give you a claim number but they don't tell you where to send them back too and when I called their Customer Service couldn't tell me either. I do not recommend these shoes. Save your $$$ and buy water shoes for $20 - these aren't worth $79.99.",
