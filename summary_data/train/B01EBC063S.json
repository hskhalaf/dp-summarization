      "text": "it works great. The only reason that it is not getting 5 stars is that it has a hair trigger that likes to spit out 2 or 3 nails at a time when used with the trigger continuously held in. I have been in construction for 25 years and used to swear by Dewalt. I am now slowly moving toward Milwaukee because of the warranty policy. However they still make a great product 95% of the time.",

      "text": "The last time I did a roof was for a 10x14 shed. I did that with a hammer. Never again. Especially now. This nail gun worked great!! I did a complete tear off of a 15x24 hip roof. This roofing nailer helped me to get the entire roof done in a day by myself. It was easy to load and use. The trigger is very sensitive and double fired a couple of times. It jammed once but was very easy to get the gun unjammed. I think this is going to be VERY helpful when I put an extension on the garage and build my workshop.",

Loading the coil is simple and quick, the quick depth setting knob is very useful when switching from shingle to flashing and back. It does tend to double tap easily, but the 2nd tap does not advance a nail which is nice. The last nail in the coil is always discarded and it didn't come with a belt/rafter hook which is why I took off one star. Otherwise this is a rock solid gun.",
