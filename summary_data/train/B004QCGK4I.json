      "text": "I'm coming off a very old inner tube style Caddis float tube. Almost everything is positive about this new tube. - love the ease of entry vs inner tube style - The U-shape allows for better paddling because your legs don't hit the tube - back support is great - Good quality tough material - Easy inflation Things I don't like are primarily because I think the U-tube should be longer: - not as much flotation in the front: - the lap mesh is very small and crowded - I tended to slip forward and had to periodically shift my butt back",

      "title": "Mixed Bag",
      "text": "I like the size, weight and sturdiness of this inexpensive float tube. It has literally no built-in back support or back-up flotation, unfortunately. The fly-holding pad on the outside is attached only by velcro so blew away as soon as I hit the water. The seat was fine for me, but would be tight for someone broader in the beam. It's also difficult to put the bar in place to hold the sides apart. Once in place, it becomes challenging to move around, possibly leading to a safety hazard. Okay for someone practiced in float tubes, using it for short periods of time, and fishing on small ponds.",

I am 5-3/145, its not over inflated, not abused, cleaned and stored properly. Should not have had a seam just come apart. So far with 3 emails, multiple phone calls to just get a phone tree that goes no where, I cannot get Caddis to respond to my warranty inquiries. I have sent pictures of the damage. Poor customer service, poor product.",
