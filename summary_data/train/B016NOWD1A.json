On a side note, it fits my 5 year old twins (boy & girl) with some tightening. Great harness!!!!",

That is to say, it fits comfortably, even on long 150' rappels, is durable in wet/muddy conditions, and kept me alive. It worked well in a multiple rappel slot canyon with 8 consecutive rappels. It was fine for caving descending/ascending short vertical shafts. PROS: Inexpensive Durable for occasional use Comfortable in the air, even on long rappels/decents CONS: The nylon attachment can collapse and bind when using multiple carabiners under load.",

I believe, however, as the loop in front nicely grabs upward, that it would work well as a climbing harness. All the connections and webbing are very sturdy with reinforced ends.",

But i personally don't like how the Black diamond ones scrunch you up with the double loop. I felt comfortable enough to do a 150' repel with this thing on.",
