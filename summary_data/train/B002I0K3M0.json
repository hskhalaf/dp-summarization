I played a few of the games this evening and it was pretty fun! There are a lot of different games to choose from. My only 'con' would be that a lot of them are 2+ player games. Since he is often playing by himself, he had to wait for someone to be free long enough to be able to play those specific games. I would recommend this for any Nintendo lover.",

This has many mini-games to play as teams with your family or solo play. Depending on the attraction, players can play solo, compete against other players, or even team up to play as a team. When using the Game Pad it brings another experience to the game. You can play with up to five players. There are also multi-player modes. You may need to buy additional accessories for multi-player mode. My daughters are 20 and 22 and want to have game days now. Great for all ages.",

Really a gem! I hope Nintendo comes out with version 2 and adds new games and options and more cool uses for the game pad, too. We love to play as our Mii characters in the game and have friends and family come over and play as their Mii. Even grandma! In my humble opinion, Wii Resort and WiiU Nintendo Land are the best games we've found so far that kids and adults can play and enjoy together!",

We go through the process of syncing the controller at the main Wii U home menu/ His gamepad is the only controller that can be used. Can a ProController not work on this game for a second player. And if so, what other controller do I need for a second player, nunchuck, or a wand, or a remote. I'm so confused!",

Each mini game also utilizes a feature of the new Wii U controller to show off some of the neat new features that can be fully utilized in the future. Don't be fooled, just because it is several mini games doesn't mean that each game is short. The Metroid and Zelda mini games for example have several levels (Metroid having over 20) that one to five people can play cooperatively. Like most of Nintendo's games this one truly shines with having more people playing together.",

Each attraction features unique and innovative gameplay experiences made possible by the Wii U GamePad controller. Depending on the attraction, players can choose to play solo, compete against other players, or even team up to play cooperatively. Up to five players can participate in dynamic multiplayer modes in select attractions. The experiences change depending on whether players are using the Wii U GamePad, a Wii Remote controller or just watching others play on the TV screen.

There are 12 attractions in all.\n * Different activities take advantage of the second screen of the new Wii U Gamepad controller in different ways.

In Donkey Kong's Crash Course, tilt the GamePad left and right to safely navigate an elaborate obstacle course.\n * Dynamic multiplayer that offers different experiences in the same game. Even in the same attraction, the player using the GamePad will have a completely different experience than players using the TV: In Luigi's Ghost Mansion, the player using the GamePad is able to control a ghost invisible to players using the TV.
