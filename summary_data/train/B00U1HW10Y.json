Comfortable, light weight, and easy to adjust. My only complaint is that it isn\u2019t what I\u2019d call pewter and it definitely doesn\u2019t look at all like the picture. It\u2019s more of a silver. Look at my picture. I didn\u2019t want something quite as bright because I didn\u2019t want something that would draw too much attention. I\u2019m not a flashy person. But I still wear it and wasn\u2019t a deal breaker. Just know what you are getting. Great product!",
