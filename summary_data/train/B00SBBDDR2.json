      "text": "So, looked at all the verified reviews. And yes these are a great set of headphones. They produce such clarity, in the crisp high and mid sections but also have a reassuring clarity in the lower frequencies. Now these are not bass busters! but very much from this, they are not lazy on the bass like many other closed ear headphones, but the lower end is so crisp that you could forgive it for not knocking you head together. They are not true audiophile headphones (you need to pay a lot more for that dynamic range) but for general music listening, Netflix, Sky, YouTube or on a tablet or smart phone, these are awesome and well recommended!",

Paired with iPhone in seconds and even faster if you have an NFC device. The sound is good and the extra bass button works well. The main reason I was bought them was for the size as I did not want some of the massive over the ear headphones. They are also very comfy you could wear them for a long time without any problems. The only thing I don't like about them is the plasticy feel of the strap.",

The bild quality isnt super strong, but it is flexibls and good quality and despite its old style plastic headbamd and foam ear covers theu are also well designed and comfotable not to mention they look good, again two qualities that surprised me.
