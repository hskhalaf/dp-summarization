They have little suction, they make a cloud of dust when you empty them, and they die within a year. Finally, I gave up and went back to the old tried and true Mighty Mite. It is so much more powerful than the best reviewed tornado-style vacs and emptying it is clean and easy. Highly recommend this over any of the newer designs.",

Make sure you change the bag when you need to, or you may not have enough suction for some jobs. When using on stairs, make sure it doesn't fall down the stairs, or it could break. Overall, very pleased. This is my third, and all are still working, except the one I broke on the stairs!",

The hose is stiff and is often kinked, stopping all suction. It happens so often, it really is irrtating. What should I do with a vacuum that doesn't suck up dirt? Now I believe poor reviews more than great reviews.",

The brush has shorter bristles in the front so the floor stuff has room to be sucked up, not pushing the stuff around or trying to tilt the brush up. Small, light weight, powerful. I have laminate and linoleum floors. There is not beater, this is not for wall to wall carpeting. Appreciated the snap together assembly, no tools required. Also, it came with a bag already in it!!",

      "title": "Worst purchase - broke within a month",
      "text": "After lightly using the machine for a month, it broke. Not only that, it killed two surge protectors. Other issue: The floor attachment does not work on carpet. I have short, packed carpet. Yet the floor attachment cannot roll over, and I have to continuously lift the attachment to initiate new strokes. Even worse, the floor attachment reduces the suction a lot. Pro: (1) It is light weight. (2) The suction is decent while it worked. Do not use any attachment so you basically vacuum a dollar coin size area at a time.",

      "text": "I have owned Eureka Mighty Mites over probably a 20 year period. I use it daily to vacuum tile, laminate and carpeted stairs. It has awesome suction power! This one is the best so far, because one complaint was always that the plastic hoses kinked ALOT. On this one they have really corrected that and I rarely get a kink. The switch is smooth and it seems quieter as well. It is lightweight to carry from place to place, especially when doing all my stairs. They last years! I usually only get one when my husband needs a new one in his garage.",

They let you buy two other attachments if you want to add to. One of them is the more appropriate head with brushes on it. So do you think you\u2019re getting a good deal but then you have to order extra.",

Hope this one from Eureka lasts much longer :) All attachments, hose, floor nozzle & canister look great; operate properly for the most part.",

The new Eureka Mighty Mite 3670H just received appears to work as described, except for one very annoying problem. On the old unit the crevice tool slides into the handle of the vacuum, and pressure holds it in place. Has never fallen out. On the new one, there is no pressure, the tool just sits loosely in the handle, then falls out when the unit moves. So, this storage feature is useless. I called Eureka Customer Service, they said that it is not a covered issue. They will not repair or replace the vacuum.",

I wish the attachment for floors worked better on carpet, but it does and excellent job on our wood floors. It does clean the carpet, it just doesn't roll like a typical carpet vacuum; however, this is a small issue given how well it works otherwise. I've used it to clean floors, ceilings, walls, and furniture. Very versatile vacuum. Highly recommend this vacuum.",

The bristle brush attachment (which you can purchase online for about $10) is a must in my opinion if you want to use this for hardwoods. The canister is lightweight and easy to maneuver. Hope this lasts as long as my other one where the cord plug became faulty. Would buy again",

    "description": "Size:3670 w/ 2bagsThe Mighty Mite canister vacuum is equipped with powerful brush rolls to deep clean carpets and a full set of tools are provided for specialty cleaning such as stairs and upholstery. This canister vacuum can pick up dust and pet hair easily. It has also made cleaning the insides of a car more convenient as it sucks up dirt and other small particles from under the seats as well as the sides.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\nThe Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite canister vacuum is a sleek new compact canister that makes bare floor cleaning easy. This lightweight canister vacuum weighs less than 9 pounds and gives its customers value for money. While it does well on carpets or rugs, it is ideal for vacuuming bare floors, wood floors and tiles. This small canister vacuum is extremely easy to carry and is appreciated for its maneuverability. The 20 foot power cord with quick release allows you to take it with you wherever you go. Storage is never a problem because of its compact size.\n\nLIGHTWEIGHT & MIGHTY\nThe Mighty Mite canister vacuum is equipped with powerful brush rolls to deep clean carpets and a full set of tools are provided for specialty cleaning such as stairs and upholstery. The Mighty Mite comes in a shipping box wherein the dusting brush is located at the top of the box and the crevice tool is stored within the handle of the item. This canister vacuum can pick up dust and pet hair easily. It has also made cleaning the insides of a car more convenient as it sucks up dirt and other small particles from under the seats as well as the sides.\n\nIdeal for vacuuming quickly and efficiently\n\nEquipped with a 12 amp motor, this canister vacuum not only creates powerful suction but also makes cleaning quick and efficient. The onboard tools such as the crevice tool, upholstery nozzle/dusting brush and carpet/bare floor nozzle provide easier access to even the hard to reach areas. 2 extension wands also help clean the drapes and pull out cob webs from the ceilings. This bagged canister vacuum includes a triple filtration bag system. The vacuum comes with a limited 1 year warranty.\n\nGETTING THE BEST RESULTS\n\u2022 Connect the hose to the front of the canister and attach the wands to the hose handle. Extend the telescopic wand by pushing lock button down and pulling on the wand until reaching desired height.\n\n\u2022 Adjust to maximum suction by closing the slip ring on the hose handle. Attach combination tool, crevice tool and turbo nozzle to the end of the hose. If additional reach is needed, place the wand on the hose handle first. \n\n\u2022 To use the blower port, detach hose from the front side of the canister and attach it to the blower port on the back side of the canister.\n\n\u2022 The dust bag and motor filter play a very important role in the efficiency of the vacuum cleaner. If the bag or the motor filter becomes clogged, no air can pass through the cleaner and no cleaning can take place no matter how powerful the unit is. To keep the cleaner operating at maximum efficiency, change the dust bag frequently and clean the filter as needed.\n\n\u2022 Some fine particles can restrict the airflow very quickly and will decrease performance even before the bag appears to be full. For that reason, when vacuuming carpet fresheners or cleaners, powder, plaster dust or similar fine substances, the bag and filter may need to be changed more often.\n\nThe 20 foot cord and long extension wand provide for full room cleaning Light weight makes this vacuum easy to carry throughout the house The blower port blows debris from garage or workshop for maximum convenience The extension wand provides extra long reach to remove dirt from every surface Easy empty dust bag comes out easily for a no-mess clean Cord wind makes for compact and convenient storage",
