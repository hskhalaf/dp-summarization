Also helps with the sweat smell too. It just doesn\u2019t smell good initially, but that fades quickly after I put on deodorant and body spray. Works well, for body sent and especially acne.

Rectangular reddish area on side of face (where tea oil drop soaked bandage). Reddish rectangle became dry skin and sloughed off days later. I will try it out on another wart. But so no 1/4\"x1/2\" retangular reddish area - will just use a tiny piece of cotton with bandage tape. Will edit this post with results.",

I didn't care for the smell, not sure what is was, but.... We both like the John Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo & bar much better. I don't think we will buy this again even tho the all natural was a plus. I just did not care for the smell and one must enjoy the smell of their family.",
