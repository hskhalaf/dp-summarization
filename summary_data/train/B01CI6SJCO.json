Only disappointment, because it is such an expensive product.",

I have flown with it several times in the little travel case, and they've never even counted it as a carry-on. When you first get it, it is coated with some powdery stuff so you will think its slippery at first, but when you wipe the powder off you will be so amazed. Best grip ever.",

Initially the mat had a yucky (formaldehyde smell-to me). I don't smell it as strongly after having for a few months unless I'm in childs pose.",

The at home mat is much heavier. It comes with the carrying case, which is great for the run around yogi. It doesn't have any pockets or anything.
