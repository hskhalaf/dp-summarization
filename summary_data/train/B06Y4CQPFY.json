      "text": "6'2\" and he fits perfectly and comfortably. Easy to assemble and disassembled. Perfect for ocean or lake. We use it here in Florida in the intercoastal waterways. We take it all around. Fits in the back of our 4 door jeep along with everything else we need for the day including a second Oru kayak. We bought a cart to pull it around, it's just a little easier to take it more places. Would definitely buy again and when they add an insert to make it a tandem we will definitely be buying that as well.",

I bought it so I could put it in my car to transport. I put it in my car in pieces because I can't lift the kayak and the bag together. I like that I can store it stacked and in the bag. It doesn't take much room.",

I reckon carrying her downstairs is the only drawback but it still beats carrying a whole kayak! At 5'11 I feel snug in the cockpit, but the placement of the seat seems to really support my back, exactly where it really needs it! I was worried I may need to get a new seat for it but right now it feels as if I'm going to SHRED some water everywhere I go! My car trunk needs some permanent space cleared away so she can be ready to go.",

No leaks, easy set-up, and stows away safely inside my home. We will eventually be looking at a second one for my wife, so we can travel wherever together! While it's not cheap, it is worth every penny. I'm 5'11\" and fit perfectly into the 'cockpit.' Any taller and it will depend on your leg length.",

They stored them in their condo, they can fly them anywhere (with an oversized luggage fee) and bring them to places that may be harder to access with a conventional Kayak. You miss nothing of the conventional models either; they look and behave even better then a lot of regular ones. Customer service too is top notch. You WILL NOT be disappointed !!!!",

I roll it in its case to the water\u2019s edge and assemble it there, as it is heavy, but glides beautifully in the water.
