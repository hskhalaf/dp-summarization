After the first few uses (and downloading NO ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS) it's slow. Like. Really slow. It takes a half hour to open up, draft, and send an email. And randomly getting kicked off wifi in the other reviews is accurate. It's barely functional for any purposes- I don't know anyone can use it for anything, let alone stream or for kids to use for e-learning.",

I thought it was memory, saving space, internet... one by one i ruled out all issues and realised processor was the one. I thought, since its for minimal use, this should do but the processor turned out to be a disappointment. Additionally, you don't have keyboard lights, which i didn't realise while buying.
