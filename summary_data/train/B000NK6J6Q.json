I used the original on a 35,000 road trip, traveling by myself, where I literally pointed it in the general direction of the shot I wanted as I drove along. I have thousands of photos in my collection from that little camera. I love that it barks when I take a picture and tweets when it starts up. It's the perfect little camera for one who is now a little old lady and still points it the general direction of what I want, and it takes the perfect picture!",

This is not the one, if you are looking for \"A camera\", as you will need to spend a little more and choose something with better optics. But for that travel camera pocket point and shoot.... perfect. You won't be disappointed.

It powers on and is ready to shoot in like, a second, so you'll never miss that shot (as long as it's not in the case). I highly recommend ordering a 2GB (or bigger?) SD card, the one the camera comes with is a joke. So far, that's the only weakness.",

It takes great pictures, although the zoom lens gets soft towards the long end. Best sharpness is at the wide end, but there is some barrel distortion. 3\" LCD makes it easy to judge focus and to share pics with friends. Movie mode is quick to access via hard switch on top of camera, and is pretty good quality. I've had this camera for about 4 months, took it on several trips, use it everyday, and am quite satisfied. The SD1000 is the same camera with a more square body and a smaller LCD.",

(But all cameras at this price are made for children's hands.) It's a good buy for anything less than two hundred dollars. (Don't buy it from DBROTH though)",

While watching photos in this camera... if you rotate the camera from horizontal to vertical... the picture rotates also (just like iPhones).

Not a problem the whole time. Not only is a good camera, the video it takes is great! No time limit on the video either. The only limitation is your memory card size. When viewing your pictures the screen auto rotates, so if you want to see a vertical picture full screen just turn the camera. Very cool!",

Also, the Zoombrowser photo application works so much easier than the other brands photo navigation tools also.",

The only negative feature is the proprietary battery which is required to accommodate the small camera size. I simply purchased an extra and keep it charged, just in case. It would be nice if Canon could develop a \"quick look\" menu button for battery status. This is my 5th Canon digital on top of two previous analog APS units. I love Canon quality.",

We are so happy we chose this camera!",

Although I ordered on 12/18, it did not ship until 12/21. Also, I payed for express shipment, and although the package was on a DHL truck ready for delivery, it was returned to the warehouse. Now it won't be here in time for Christmas! Never had a problem with Amazon before - very disappointed this time!",

They fixed the last camera and I'm sure they'll fix this one, but I am surprised and disappointed for this to happen not only again, but so quickly (and I promise I did not drop it.)",
