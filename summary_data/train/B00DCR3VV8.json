As is always the case, I looked at it, I thought it's too expensive, but I gritted my teeth and ordered it anyway. It came a couple of days later, plugged straight in, worked immediately and all my gear recognised it and started backing up over a fast connection in a couple of clicks.

Range has now extended to most of the house now and Apple TV is more stable however it has not made any difference to the speed of wifi. Despite getting 36mb at the router I never get anything more than 20mb over wifi. Disappointed as all the reviews I read suggested it would improve the broadband wifi as well as range.",
