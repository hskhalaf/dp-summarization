But the worst thing is trying to keep the ropes clean for their sugar source and after using it once the screw broke the plastic off in a chunk as I was screwing hook back on. Due to this defect or bad design I will be returning it and not buying another. Overall, they need to at the very least change the hook assembly to a more sturdy, durable design to hang like all my other feeders have.",
