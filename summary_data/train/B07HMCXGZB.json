We were SO THRILLED to find these in my sons\u2019s favorite Star Wars characters at such a great price! We bought Darth Vader first for his birthday, and then after a few weeks of getting good at riding, he decided he needed to add his favorite little droid to his collection. We bought an off brand for our 8 year old to ride along, and this quality FAR EXCEEDS brands that try to copy.",

I did not go into that store with the intention of purchasing a board, but I had to once I saw this Penny board. It's a 27\" inch board, got it for $129. Looks just like the photos here. It rides great; it's very fast, smooth, and quiet, comparable to a longboard due to the type of wheels. I love that even the wheels are customized with text. This is actually my first Penny and I love it. It easily has better portability due to its size, as opposed to a regular skateboard or longboard.",
