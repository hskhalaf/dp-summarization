      "text": "I absolutely love these headphones. I was looking for something over-ear, and these were less than $100. The NC isn't really true NC. This is my third pair of NC from different manufacturers, and its more of making the speakers louder. Same has been true of other manufacturers, so not an issue for me. I have big ears, so the headphone foam around the speaker is a little lacking. I just stuffed some rolled up packaging foam around the edge. This is so my ears don't touch the speaker. Other than these two minor issues, I couldn't be happier with the price point and purchase. Puts out wonderful quality music. Forward/Back buttons help, along with the volume control.",

Well built, solid connections with a good weight. No cheap plastic feel. Nice braided wire connection option when battery dies or whenever you want to save battery life. Clear bluetooth sound. Bad: Bluetooth distance is very short. Maybe 4 to 7 feet. This was no wear close to what they claim but not a deal breaker for me. I keep my cell phone close and my laptop usually right in fron of me. So i love these.",

The noise-cancelling element of these headphones is fantastic! My biggest complaint is that this has USB-micro charging. It's a pain to have a different cord for every device. If it had USB-C, it would be virtually perfect. I wrote to the company to inquire about USB-C capabilities in alternative products/upgrades and received the most ridiculous form-letter response, so it's clear that customer service is not their thing. Overall, I'd recommend this product, particularly at the price point.",

Not an audiophile either but the sound is great. The package is nice and the accessories are great as well- though a longer charging cord would have been nice. Set up was a snap on my devices though my PC bluetooth adapter took some time to configure - but that was more the adapter drivers than the headset. Happy with price/performance!",

They went for a design element that truly takes away from the enjoyment of the product. - Noise cancelling sounds more 'tinny' than others I've tried. I get it you have to boost trebble in this mode (since noise cancelling really only works for low frequency) , but it goes a little too far.",

The sound goes up when you turn on noise cancelling, and the base also seems to get better as well. Bluetooth connects well. I had a little skipping every now and then but not often (mainly when in another room). In all very happy I choose these over Bose! Saved a-lot of money. Carrying case is good and the same size as Bose's carrying case. Note: They still have that pressure feeling that all noise cancelling over ear headphones have but not as much in my opinion.",

My primary use of them is on flights and they work very well for drowning out background noise. When using them in other environments i agree with many of the other reviewers. There is a distinct difference in sound between the noise cancellation being on and off. I personally prefer having it on which helps boost the highs. They can sound a little muddy with noise cancellation off. Quality of construction seems good for the money and the accessories that come with them are very complete. Overall I would recommend to anyone.",

Pros: Very good sound (apt-X codec seems to make a difference,) active noise cancellation works as well as any I've used, including Sony and Bose, Bluetooth 4.1 helps with connection stability. Good build quality. Cons: Headband is a little tight for my head. This may loosen up over time but in the early days is somewhat uncomfortable. It's hard to find the forward/reverse/pause buttons when they're on your head. Manufacturer should pay a little more attention to ergonomics. Overall, these are a good value, compare to headphones costing $100 more.",

But I bought another one because the sound muffling qualities are great, and - best of all - it has a rolling volume control (the only one I found like it). When you're half asleep, and the \"white noise\" is either too soft or too loud, that is the best/easiest type of UI to adjust.",

What I really dislike though is the plastic connector piece -- the piece that connects on the sides of the headphones and allows you to adjust it and swivel to fit your head. It is a cheap plastic that chips, cracks, and breaks easily. I have had these headphones for about 6 months, only with normal to light use, and these connectors have completely broken off. I've had to use superglue to hold it together, which means I can no longer adjust the fit, making them quite uncomfortable to wear. This one flaw drastically reduces the lifetime of these headphones.",
