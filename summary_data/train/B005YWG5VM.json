Beeswax is far on the ingredient list. However, the color of these are beautiful. My 15 month old love them. They glide easily on paper and the color payoff is wonderful.",

These beeswax crayons leave rich and lovely colors on the page, and they blend beautifuly (if you rub the picture with your fingers, the heat from your hand kindof melts the colors together). The crayons are thick, which makes them easier to hold if you are a small child. However if you are a supposed adult, the thickness makes it a little challenging to get the color into small areas so you must aim very carefully ;) I tested these out and enjoyed them enough that now I will have to purchase more for my nieces and nephews. Would have given them five stars if they would have come with a sharpener.",
