If it is outside, you will be lucky to get one whole season out of it. Best place is a sunny window in the house or protected porch",

This is medium long and was easy to hang. We love the colors so far. It takes only a light breeze for it to make a sound. The sound, though not very melodious, is fine to us and unique so far as wind chimes are concerned. Has not got tangled so far. What else could we expect? Five stars.",

They have a soft tinkling sound, like thin shells clanking. These are lightweight enough that me heat/AC on is enough for a slight tinkling sound. Turn on a fan and its a a bit more sound. So pretty! Fantastic set of chimes for my needs.",

I have had them hanging outside in the Florida sun, wind, and rain for about 3 months now and they have held up great! The color is still vibrant and none of the \"shells\" have broken (and they swing around A LOT)! I love these wind chimes!",
