The built-in sounds are not that pleasant to listen to, which can make waking up jarring. I would suggest going with smart lightbulbs instead, as they can connect to your phone and you would have more fine-grained control and automation.",

      "text": "Ive had this since October of 2017 and I do like the product, but Ive noticed some features no longer work. About 1 year after I put this alarm to use I noticed the sunrise feature could not be adjusted to anything but the 30-minute setting. I also realized recently that the auxiliary battery in case pwr is cut no longer works, trying an unused good battery didnt help. Pwr outages are more of a thing for me now and it kinda screwed up my alarm for work one day...Super fun! Cheap Chinese crap, but its nice when it works",

The softly increasing volume of the alarm also helps you wake up gently. This alarm helps me wake up better and feel more rested because I'm not hitting the snooze button until the last minute",
