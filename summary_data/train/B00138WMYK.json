I USED THE ENCLOSED CREAM TO SOOTHE IT WHEN I WAS DONE, BUT THAT DIDN'T DO THE JOB. I HAD TO USE AQUAFOR FOR SEVERAL DAYS TO RETURN MY SKIN BACK TO NORMAL. DOESN'T GET ALL THE HAIR OFF THE FIRST TIME & MUST REPEAT THE PROCESS IN A DAY OR SO. I FOUND THAT IT ONLY REMOVES THE LONGER HAIR AND ANY SHORT ONES REMAIN. IT'S BETTER THAN USING NO PRODUCT AT ALL.",
