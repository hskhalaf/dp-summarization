The spray nozzle looks nice, but it is cheaply made. I commonly take it on and off and if any water it left inside it rusts. So prior to spraying anything with it, I always have to push water through the nozzle for about 5 to 10 secs until it is clear/clean again.

Not as much volume as our 3\u20444 rubber hose, but all we do is hand watering of potted plants and it's more than adequate. When not in use we tuck it into a 14 inch clay pot. A word of warning: don't pressurise it while in the pot. It's really hard on frogs who reside there!. I wouldn't drive my car over it, but it's great for washing the car. Don't yank on it if it's tangled on some obstacle. Treat it with respect and it should last several years. We're on our second year and it still seems new.",

Big bonus is the valve next to the male threads. It allows me to turn off the water at the hose end, and attach it to my engine to flush it, and then turn the water back on. Saves me some steps from the boat to the faucet and back. Great product for a fair price.",

Very disappointed, because I was happy with it until now, it's been outside in full sun and I just use it at least 4x per week to water plants and spray down outdoor furniture. It still looks new, I like the plastic hangar that came with it, but very disappointed it has holes in it.",

Since the hose expands when water is going through it, as soon as I turn the sprayer on, the house starts to retract. It might have something to do with the water pressure at my house but next time I would definitely get the 100 foot option.",
