It spins a little more slowly than the same looking model with the 250 watt motor does but it has more torque, meaning it doesn't get bogged down as easily. The pedal is very responsive. It would also benefit from having a base to put it on. I'll probably make a base similar to what I saw on YouTube. If it had plates I'd give it 5 stars.",
