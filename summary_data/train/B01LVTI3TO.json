The mechanical click of the keys is very satisfying and don't get annoying after a while, unlike other keyboards. The RGB is very vibrant and very customizable with Razer Croma.

For instance, the period key would normally have the right arrow printed on top, with the period printed on bottom. On this keyboard, the period is printed on top while the right arrow is printed on bottom, making this keyboard awkwardly different from every other keyboard I use.",

Right now I have it customized to where the keyboard flickers like a fire, but everytime I hit a key or click my Razer mouse it radiates color down the keyboard.

Only thing that made me think i was going crazy is that the shift-characters (all the special characters you'd normally use the shift key to type) are on the bottom of the key, not the top like every other keyboard on the market.

Super rare for them but I was the lucky one who didnt have warranty left :P This was a cheap alternative and honestly I really enjoy it. I dont really keybind/macro my keys too much other than in World of Warcraft and it works for that. For FPS it also has good reaction time. I enjoy the color and being able to customize - As I was able to with the widow. 10/10 Keyboard and great price for what you get.",

Well in a word not worth it!.. the \"back lighting\" on the keys is so freaking bright that the entire keyboard is lit up like a Christmas tree when you are in gaming mode and only want specific keys to be lit.. It makes it near impossible to tell which keys are lit. Returned it and spent the money on the Chroma!",

The keys on this keyboard really 'bounce back', there's no dead zone on the upstroke where you have to consciously let off the key, subtle but you'd understand if you've used a keyboard like that before. I prefer this keyboard much more than my mechanical keyboard with blue switches. Really something you have to try if you've only tried regular switches and want something new. The keys aren't too loud either though they're not exactly quiet. Keyboard lasted great for over 2 years until I spilled pepsi all over it and got a new one.",

However, a mechanical click that reassures the user has selected the key still exists within this keyboard. The ability to use color settings provided by the Razer Synapse only furthers the appeal of this keyboard. It is a very well designed and quality piece to add to your computer desk and possibly your Razer Chroma Array.",
