I am not sure if it was something in the ingredients, or if it was because he was able to chew off a whole big chunk and swallow it. The reason I bought these was because they state that it is unlike rawhide. Although it is digestible, big chunks can be swallowed. After a horrible night of watching my dog both throw up and have diarrhea, I took him to the vet. Long story short, $700 dollars later, he is doing fine. An X-ray demonstrated that it had not gotten lodged in his intestine or colon. If your dog is a big chewer, do NOT purchase this product.",

Behaviorally, this makes her act out less intensely as well (eg: no jumping, whining, pacing, etc.), and I think that is a very reasonable expectation for a fairly natural solution.
