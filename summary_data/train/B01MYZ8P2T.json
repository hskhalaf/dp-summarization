Were easy to put together, and came very well packed. It took more time to strip the packing off than to assemble. When we have visitors, they head to the bar stools instead of chairs. I like that the base is large enough to make them really stable. Now the price is $20 less than I paid. I recommend you snap them up at the current price. It would be hard to buy them at a second hand store for this price.",

My only concern is if the foam at the leading edge will last over time as that's where the most pressure is from legs hanging over. No reason to believe it won't. The foot bar is strong enough to adjust in seat but I'd be careful got that weld joint it's a lot of torque to put weight on that skinny bar. I'm 180 lbs. Overall I like this very much and the back support is strong and reasonably ergonomic enough for what it is.",

To adjust the seats you have to raise before you sit in it and to lower you must sit in it. If your legs are short you cannot lower the seat without getting in the seat first which complicates the problem.",
