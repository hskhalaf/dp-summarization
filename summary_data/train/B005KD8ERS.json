I installed it in a business bathroom with tile and metal studs which I imagine is what most people will do. I needed about ~2 centimeters more. A trip to the local Lowes fixed the problem though. Other than that the item is as described.",

Also, be sure to make a template for your holes, they are round holes, not slotted, so there is no room for error, holes must be drilled precisely. Could have been made a bit more user friendly.",
