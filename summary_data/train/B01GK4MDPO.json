Sets up in minutes, super light to pick-up and move around, yet does not tip over with the tee just feet away and power hits (without using the stakes). We have had it up for a month and it has stood up to 3 kids playing for hours almost daily. I considered buying the 5x5 and am so glad I purchased the 7x7 - the extra space has been helpful for the 8-11 age group. Gives target practice for throws, adjustable, as well as hitting off the tee.",

I also had to move it over to my back porch a week later to get it out of the way so the lawn man could cut my grass. It stayed intact and I have no issues with it. Great product.",

I put two small Velcro straps on either side myself to help this not happen but honestly if you are hitting the ball like you should this shouldn't happen.",

This net is fast set up (a minute or two) easy take down and very stable. Really don't need the included pegs. The quality of the product is indisputable as well. Put it behind the plate and you have a catcher for batting practice. Put it at 1st base, a first baseman for infield work. Use it as a target for relay throw practice. It is a great product.",

      "text": "This group of products from Rukkett is perfect for practicing at home when your child wants to practice batting. It was easy to assemble and light enough to move around. Get yourself a good tee and you are good to go! My son also enjoyed the practice balls that came with this set. He says and I have to agree that the balls make a difference with his swing. He can feel the difference when he makes good or not so good contact when he practices with these balls. He has also been using the weighted balls for practicing his pitching. Great products! Great purchase!",
