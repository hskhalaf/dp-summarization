And, you can add a light second later to the more difficult areas without flaking or discoloration. As I get older...I am 39...I have more and more problems with acne, and wearing foundation to try and cover it up just made the acne worse. This product isn't at all oily and it keeps the oil at bay all day...reducing my breakouts. And, as others have pointed out...a little does go a long way with this product. I will continue to use this product!",

It does seem silly to expect your skin to improve by wearing makeup, but it truly does do the trick. I've always been prone to breakouts even without the make-up, which only increases once the make-up is applied. This helps mitigate the breakouts with the active salicylic acid ingredient in the make-up. I finally decided to purchase this item on Amazon versus Dillard's due to better deals. This truly depends on what type of specials are going on with Clinique when purchasing through Belk's, Dillard's, etc instead of through Amazon.",
