    "description": "The WORX cordless 20-volt MAX lithium powered grass trimmer has taken grass trimming and edging to a whole new level of power and function. With the 20-volts of MAX lithium battery power, the WG160 provides longer run times and more power. The 12-inch cutting diameter means more trimming in less time. Not only will this cordless trimmer convert to an edger in seconds, but it is also a mini mower. It has dual-positioned in-line wheels that make edging a breeze. The wheels can also be used as a \"mowing-like\" function for detailed trimming around landscape or hard to reach areas. A quick-release trigger lever is convenient for making easy height adjustments to the telescopic shaft for comfort and control. The trimmer head turns with a pull and turn to lock and convert to edging. The MAX lithium battery power means more battery capacity, longer runtimes, no self-discharge, no slow loss of power, less weight, more power and quicker charging times.Charge the battery within 3-hours and it will be ready when you need it with no-self discharge. From function to features, the 20-volt WORX trimmer and edger features 100% single line feed which means no bumping to extend the line. A flower space guard not only helps protect vegetation, it also acts as an edger guide. A front auxiliary handle has 7 locking adjustments for maximum comfort while trimming, edging, or mowing. Weighing in at only 6-pounds, this 20-volt grass trimmer, edger and mini mower will create a professional looking yard with less work, less fatigue and less time.",
