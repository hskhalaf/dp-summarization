First, I wash my face using Avene cleanser (the blue one), I spray this on and let it dry, and then I use the Embryolisse lait-creme concentre moisturizer. It is a perfect skin care routine that works and is actually a lot less expensive than most other alternatives. Try it. I bet you will be pleasantly surprised. One small thing to bear in mind is that this is a large container; it didn't fit in my medicine cabinet.",

It takes a couple days to kick in but even if you only use it once a day, you'll see a difference. For the best results, I definitely use several times a day, usually four (morning/evening plus two more times). It provides some instant relief but for the most part, takes time to work.",

I can still see the dark patches, but they are slowly being healed. I use it after I cleanse my skin, and sometimes during the day when those areas become irritated.

I like to use it after cleansing and before putting on moisturizer. Any good skin care expert knows it's best to apply moisturizer to damp skin as it absorbs better and locks in the moisture. This stuff is perfect for the purpose of dampening skin before applying moisturizer. I also take this on vacation with me and keep it in a fridge for days I am at the beach, it feels great on the skin after a long day of sun and ocean water. I highly recommend!",
