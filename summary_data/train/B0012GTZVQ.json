These bowls are sturdy. I bought the 20oz ones and the 1 quart ones. The diameter doesn\u2019t change, just the depthness of the bowls. If the bowls don\u2019t come off as easily you can always widen the sides by pulling them apart a little. Just takes a little common sense. The bowls also do not tilt once you attach and screw them on the crate, even with food and water they are held in place pretty good.",

The bowls are kind of a pain to get out of the holder, but if you give it a smooth twist while you pull at a slight raised angle, they come right out. I always put them back empty, then fill them though because I'm certain they would spill while snapping back in place. I recommend, unless you have arthritic hands.",

Some reviewers complain that it is difficult to slide the bowl in and out of the bracket. I agree that you have to be very careful inserting or removing the bowl in this way, especially if there\u2019s water in the bowl that could slosh out. I have found it easier to just set the bowl on top of the bracket arms and push it straight down firmly. The bowl is still held very securely and it\u2019s a lot easier to lift it out vertically rather than sliding it out horizontally from the tight arms.",

This dog also moves a lot when she sleeps (much like myself) and despite kicking and flopping about hasn't spilled any water!! Great buy.",

Then having mostly male dogs I always end up with someone peeing in their bowl, a quick snap and a rinse and back up it goes. I love these, they're not for food bowl packers. They can be removed by those kinds of dogs. But for a kennel situation or a crate situation I've been very happy with them.",

    "description": "Size:20 Ounces (2.5 cups)The Snap\u2019y Fit stainless steel pet bowl by MidWest Homes for Pets features a patented design that holds the dog bowl firmly in place but still allows the pet bowl to easily be removed for cleaning. The pet bowl comes with a rust resistant e-coated bracket that attaches to the dog crate / cat cage / bird cage or small animal cage with two wing nuts. Since the food bowl / water bowl attaches to the dog crate wire mesh it promotes healthy elevated eating and conveniently keeps the pet bowl from being knocked over (no-tip design) by pets and pet parents alike eliminating potential mealtime messes. The Snap\u2019y Fit pet bowl comes in 4 different sizes; 10 oz. (1.25 cups), 20 oz. (2.5 cups), 1 qt. (4 cups), 2 qt. (8 cups) making this a great food bowl or water bowl for a variety of pets including dogs, cats, birds and many other small animals. The stainless-steel pet bowl is dishwasher safe for easy cleaning and does not hold bad odors or germs like plastic food bowl does. We at MidWest Homes for Pets understand that your pet is a part of your family and that\u2019s why we ensure our products are manufactured with the highest quality control standards creating a safe home for your pet that you can feel confident with. MidWest Homes for Pets stands behind the quality of our products with a 1-year Manufacturer\u2019s Warranty.
