I set it up in my kitchen breakfast nook and do a set of 50 whenever I happen by, several times a day. It is very effective. I saw an improvement in the ease in climbing stairs very quickly, my endurance on my daily walks has improveed and I have also noticed my daily lower backaches have eased, an unexpected bonus. This machine would be more for someone more like me: older, impaired or less fit. It would not be challenging enough for a young, athletic person.",

I don't use it as much as I should, but when I do I can feel a difference especially in the lower belly and thighs. The best thing is that it takes up very little room and easy to maneuver. Highly recommend if you have a hectic schedule and can't be precise with a workout schedule. A couple of days with this stepper and you can feel a difference.",

It does not fold up , but it has a small footprint and is movable. As other reviewers said, it did start squeaking by the 3rd day of use, so we'll put some WD40 on it. For the price, its exactly what I wanted: good for a basic cardiovascular exercise & to keep legs strong.",

If you loosen them, you don't really get any benefit, and it's still uncomfortable because of the design while it's compact.",

      "text": "Are you kidding??? I was so pleased with my stepper. I used it thirty minutes each night for a little under a month. The past week I noticed the timer and calories burned were a little off, but I just used my phone. Tonight the resistance bolt (which I have used twice) went into the machine while I was on it. I now have zero resistance and the bolt is stripped. The machine is USELESS and beyond repair. I am so disappointed. Way to ruin my nightly routine and hard work. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!",

I may investigate the more expensive types, before purchasing another. Maybe not a problem for someone younger, and it is really well built.",
