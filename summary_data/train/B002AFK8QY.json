      "text": "This product is AMAZING! I'm a homecleaner and needed to find a non toxic product that actually works, and this does! I've found that it needs to be diluted (1/4 simply floored to 3/4 water) and put in a spray bottle. This helps with the problems people are having with the floors being sticky (it shouldn't suds up when you're mopping!) So with a little trial and error this works the best! Plus it lasts way longer now that I'm diluting it. And the scent is really light and clean smelling without being terrible. Definitely buying again!",

It has a nice light minty/citrus scent that does not affect my allergies, because its mostly essential oils! I use it around pets and children with no side effects, and the duty it does on grimy floors is amazing! I have used it on tile, pergola, natural stone, laminated surfaces, porceIain, hardwood, and still trying out more! Highly recommend this product and company!!",
