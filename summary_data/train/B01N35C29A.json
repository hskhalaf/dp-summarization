I always had trouble getting close to the base of the plants - I would nick or cut the stems if I got too close, but if you can't get right up to the base, you will have weeds growing there. I learned about these hoes from a person who used to supervise groundskeeping at Disneyland, where they use them to perfectly groom their amazing flower beds. They are fairly expensive for a hoe, but you will have it forever, and you will wonder what you ever did without it.",

The size and design makes it easy to work in between plants. Also, depending on your method, you can either cut the weed at the root or pull the weed (root and all) out. I hesitated buying it for a few days because it seemed a bit pricey; however it is super strong and the handle is solid wood and very comfortable to hold. This little tool appears it will last a lifetime.",

    "description": "If you've never tried a circular hoe hand weeder and cultivator, you are in for a treat. Makes weeding by hand much easier as you use the pointed end to drag at ground level and cut off weeds at the roots. Super strong solid steel shank and blade with beech hardwood handle. Circle shape of the hoe with sharpened edge lets you pull the tool through the soil to cut weeds and loosen the soil without making a big mess or creating piles of dirt. Edge is sharp on the bottom only, so it cuts roots under the ground. All other edges are rounded, so it won't hurt nearby plants that you want to keep.",

      "Solid steel blade and neck. Innovative design of circular hoe weeder makes weeding by hand easy. Also cultivates the soil without moving it around -- it passes through the circle.",
      "Drag at ground level to cut weeds at the roots. Bottom is sharp and sides are dull, so you can use it near important plants and only cut weeds. See graphic in the photos for more information.",
