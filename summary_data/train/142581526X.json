      "text": "I ordered this for my daughter to use for our homeschool. I liked how it gave specific tasks for each day rather than just a writing prompt. The topics are interesting to her and challenge her to write about things she wouldn't naturally choose to write about. But why I'm really leaving a positive review is because it comes with a CD-ROM!! NO MORE Xeroxing papers! I can just print them directly from the disc! The entire workbook is on there. I can print pages as needed for her to complete, but have the book next to me. Maybe I'm geeking out a bit... but it's something I wasn't expecting in my purchase but am so so thrilled to have!",

      "text": "This is an amazing resource for teachers. You do need to have prior knowledge on how to teach narrative, informational, and opinion forms of writing. The curriculum spirals and aligns to CCSS which is great for students with limited attention spans. You can teach the content in small bites and it is really evident if the student is making progress or has mastered the standard. It is also a great tool for gathering standards based data and using the data to plan next steps for instruction.",

I don't consider putting check marks next to boxes a day of writing. So many of the exercises in these books had absolutely no writing in them. The kids would draw lines or underline something. In the beginning my kids were excited to have something new for writing, but by the end of the second week they were dreading doing these books. I have put them on the shelves and will not be using them anymore. I'm not sure how these books got such a high rating. What a waste of money!",
