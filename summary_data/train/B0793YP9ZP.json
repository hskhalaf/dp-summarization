      "title": "Good backpack",
      "text": "This is a big upgrade from the last backpack I bought. It is big and holds a lot of books. The extended handle is smooth and hasn't gotten stuck. However, it can be a bit loud when rolling on concrete. Also, the top handle seems a bit flimsy especially when the backpack is full. Wish it was made of thick rubberized material. I'm always worried it will rip but with legendary warranty from JanSport, I'm not too concerned. Good overall backpack.",

Jansport has a lifetime warranty, too, which I have used before on other packs. You just pay for shipping and they will either fix the bag or send you a new one.",
