Will definitely be sticking with this brand for the future. Also, the replaceable 'top strap' (as feet grow taller) is WONDERFUL! Easily a shoe that could last a year of wearing non-stop for school.",

Daughter seems comfortable in them and wears all day at school etc. I saw another review saying they didn't last long, but feel if that were to happen Amazon would stand behind their product. They seem to be holding up perfectly, but I will admit my daughter isn't playing soccer, hiking Mt Tam or kicking rocks in them : )",
