Tub is no bigger round than my thumb, and my thumb is a size 7 ring.... don\u2019t get baited into it just because it\u2019s good product.",

It is not meant for a lot of coverage, just a little bit of evening out the tone. It is a little oily feeling at first, but it is actually a really nice moisturizer and makes you feel comfortable going outside without doing a full face of makeup. I really like this stuff (when I buy the right color) for my 'no makeup makeup' days.",
