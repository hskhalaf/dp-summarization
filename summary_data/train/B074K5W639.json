I wouldn\u2019t even think of buying another brand of tweezers. This pair of tweezers, however, did not meet any sort of quality or craftsmanship! I wonder if they were knockoffs. They were not made in Germany. All of my other products are made there. Anyway, I totally agree with so many of the other reviewers! These did not tweeze anything! Mine were so bad that they didn\u2019t even cut the hair off, as other reviewers stated. They just did nothing! These were returned. Disappointing!",

I must buy at least three or four, in order to find one that really performs well. Further, as I use the product, it loses its ability to \"grab\" a hair. Further, Tweezerman no longer offers to sharpen the tips. Please advise me as to how to have the tips sharpened, so that I don't need to spend a small fortune on tweezers!",

This product is great because the tips actually stay touching each other after many uses, so that it can pull fine hairs out with ease. There are some better tweezers out there but it's really expensive at ~$50 so I'm content with these. Will buy again.",
