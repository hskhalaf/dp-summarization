Was pleasantly surprised by how lightweight these are. They're definitely a \"fashion shoe\" these days but are much, much better than a typical Puma shoe was in the 1970s, including the Roma. Suede & heavy rubber were the brand's norm. You could do short runs in these, and I plan to (just for fun) with my local running group. The colors were slightly darker than I expected but it could be my screen/settings. Still fun & vibrant! Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.",

Unfortunately, this pair started falling apart within 6-8 weeks of purchase. The toe cap is separating from both shoes, and I doubt they'll last the summer. I'm really disappointed. After contacting Puma, they don't seem interested in standing behind their product. Won't be buying Romas again.",
