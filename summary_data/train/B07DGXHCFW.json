When I got to the second package the last 2 (of course) did not have the little hole on the side of the torch to put the key chain/ top holder on. It looked weird to have 6 with lids and 2 without, so I had to throw those 2 away. I wasn't going to go through the trouble of emptying the oil and sending them back. Lastly, don't screw the lids on too tight. They will only get tighter as they burn and you will have to use pliers to get the lids off.",

I'm using Tiki citronella fuel oil but maybe my wick height is not right, or thats just the way they burn. Nice torches for the money, I paid about 45 total for the 3. Was going to buy another set but they were 99 just a week later and I don't think they are worth that much.",
