      "text": "Do not purchase from this vendor. I purchased this desktop for my son and in the product details, it says that the graphics Coprocessor is a NVIDIA GTX 1070. We noticed that the desktop was not running at the frames that it should for gaming. When we check the computer it says that the graphics coprocessor is actually a GTX 750. Now, the vendor isn't helping. Dell isn't me and Amazon is pushing the issue to the manufacturer. Normally, Amazon is great, but I am very frustrated and disappointed with how this is being handled.",

One couldn't build a similar rig for much less (1539.99$ (at the time of purchase)). There are rigs with better specs and hardware, but you really won't need them for gaming unless you want 8k everything (you know, for all two of the games that support that). The only drawback is the SSD is a bit small, but the wonderful thing about desktop computers is they're expandable.",

So I try to reboot and get an error, I google the error and get it fixed. Once I get it up and running I realize that it won't pick up my monitor unless I plug it in with hdmi. I also now realize I can not access my SSD at all. Fun while it lasted $1600 wasted. Update: I got ahold on dell and sent the computer in to be fixed... apperantly it was a motherboard crash! Will keep you all posted on how it is when it gets back.",

Fast to boot, Fast browsing, fast games, fast fast fast. Oculus had some issues with some Windows updates in the beginning, but no issues now. I do not regret this decision one bit.
