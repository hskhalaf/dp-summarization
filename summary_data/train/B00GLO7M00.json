I usually run it at night as we are going to sleep, but even the no light setting puts quite a bit of light off. My husband usually puts something around the base by the power button just to make it a little bit more dim in the room. I love that it shuts it self off when it runs low on water so I don't have to worry about it if I fall asleep before it is done.",

This is a problem if you don't yet have it covered when you plug it in after cleaning it. It is a little awkward because you have to pick it up to plug the DC jack in and you will typically do this just after you have filled it with water so you have a high probability of spilling it. A power switch on the power line would have fixed this I think. Otherwise this machine seems to work quite well.",

      "text": "I compared a few different ones and decided to purchase this one since it is cheapest. It is the only diffuser I've tried so I have nothing to compare it to, but it distributes the oils throughout the room with a large volume of mist. I can rinse it out and change oils with ease. I've had it about 2-3 months and no problems thus far. I recommend saving your money and purchasing THIS Now Foods Diffuser over the pricey diffusers found on Amazon. It gets the job done and is well made.",

I also love the colors!",

I called on two different occasions and was told my call would be returned within 24 hours. Not so. The second call was a week later and I was told they would email instructions on cleaning. If that didn't work they would proceed from there. I have yet to receive the email. I might add that I followed the manuals instructions on cleaning the machine. What else could be done to stop the noise if I already followed their instructions? I guess I'll have to buy a different product.",
