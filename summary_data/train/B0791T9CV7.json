I only what channels from 1000 - 1691. so if it does try to change stations it almost always goes to stations from 2- 999 instead of the station I ask for in the 1000- 1691. Like I ask for 1010 if it changes at all it will go to channel 10 but again it usually will not change at all. Terrible Product !",

I'll stick with Apple TV. Thanks for wasting my time. It's pretty sad that a nearly $1T company can't get something this simple correct.",

The sound is a bit tinny from the speaker itself, but most responses come through my sound bar. It mutes the TV input for listening & responses, which isn't an issue, except it occasionally misses unmuting it. I'd prefer if it would play items without turning on the TV & soundbar, but it's not a big concern. Now that it's been updated to work with multi-room sound, it can easily be part of a home wide listening experience.",

Aside from the Sling promotion glitch, a lack of knowledge on my part, I am pleased with Cube.
