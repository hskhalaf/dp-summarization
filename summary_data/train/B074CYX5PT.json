We did register it, but cannot connect using the app that must be downloaded to our phone (in order to operate the Segway). It keeps timing out before connecting.

We have not purchased any of the previous hoverboard products because of how dangerous they are, both in terms of falling and because of questionable battery quality. The Segway miniLITE was much easier to start using, and very stable. The steering-by-knee design is a double edge sword - it improves stability, but it also means that it takes slightly longer to input commands and react. I'm not complaining - it reacts fast enough, and I'll take improved safety any day. Can't wait for the weather to get warmer so that we can ride this thing outside again.",
