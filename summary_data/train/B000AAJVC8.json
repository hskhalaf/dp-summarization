Soooo critical to have this vac for stairs! Its lightweight and easy to carry up and down. The new swivel wand is a new feature from my old vac and makes cleaning the wood floors easier. I also bought another upright Oreck for the carpet upstairs. No other brand for me - Orecks are dependable and are genuine workhorses. Great quality, easily bag replacement with zero mess, thoughtful design in all their products, and they last!!",

First, if you actually hang it on your shoulder from the strap, the exhaust air from the back end will blow any piece of paper (or other light object) you may have on a shelf or table all around the room. Second, The hose is too short and inflexible. Moving the pipe around on the floor makes the whole vacuum swing wildly. I am reduced to putting the vacuum on the floor, removing one of the two pipes,then cleaning on my hands and knees while holding down the vacuum with my other hand..",

I think it would be an amazing upgrade to this product if you screwed the poles to one another and each attachment as you used it, then they wouldn't just pull apart. Just one little notch to hold in place would make me a much happier cleaner with this Oreck.",
