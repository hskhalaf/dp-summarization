I normally wear an XL but had to size up to an XXL, but the jacket was not bulky and fit flawlessly. Really was a great purchase!",

      "text": "Great looking jacket, fits perfectly, and appears to be typical Spyder quality. The front zipper seems to be a design I haven't seen before; it looks wind and water proof. When it's zipped, it doesn't look like a normal zipper, more like a solid material. Many convenient pockets and the sleeve design will guarantee I won't get snow up my sleeves.",

It stays pretty warm at around 9 celsius. The hoodie fits a bike helmet without a problem. The jacket is completly waterproof and looks awesome with vibrant colors. I also bought it at almost half price here so I am super happy :3",
