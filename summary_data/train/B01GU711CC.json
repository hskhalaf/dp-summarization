      "verdict": "For its $100 price tag, the Under Armour Charged Controller delivers great value. What you get is a fully-knitted upper and a full-length Micro G midsole with a Charged foam crash pad that offers a well-balanced ride. It is a versatile shoe that will provide you with what you need when you need it.If it were not for its disappointing traction and fit, these UA basketball sneakers would have been a top-tier performer. All in all, the Charged Controller is a steal for its price; just be prepared to wipe a whole lot if you regularly play on dusty courts.",
      "pros": [
        "The Charged Controller is one of the most comfortable Under Armour shoes, many reviewers remark",
        "Several wearers commend the shoe\u2019s beautiful design",
        "They are saying that it looks sharp and is perfect to wear on casual Fridays",
        "The fit is nearly perfect, almost all experts declare",
        "Majority of the buyers are very satisfied with the Under Armour Charged Controller",
        "They are impressed with its quality and overall performance",
        "The shoe does a good job at delivering both lockdown and support, a good number of users notice",
        "Even if the shoe is a low-top model (like the Curry 6), they still feel stable and experience no heel slippage",
        "A few reviewers notice that these Under Armour basketball shoes are well built and are pretty durable",
        "They say it\u2019s okay to use on outdoor courts",
        "Many players observe that the traction works fairly well on clean courts",
        "A lot of testers appreciate the shoe\u2019s soft and flexible upper",
        "They note that it is light, breathable, and conforms to the shape of your foot",
        "Most testers are happy with the cushioning setup",
        "They observe that the cushioning is soft when standing and stiffens up during play, providing the right balance between impact protection and responsiveness"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Nearly all testers express their disappointment with the Charged Controller\u2019s inconsistent traction",
        "On dusty courts, wiping is necessary since the pattern grabs dust easily",
        "Some reviewers note that the toe box is pretty roomy",
        "The Under Armour Charged Controller runs slightly narrow, a handful of wearers report",
        "A couple of testers comment that the upper feels stiff and needs some break-in time",
        "Players also gripe about the same experience in the UA HOVR Havoc",
        "During hard stops, a few players complain about their toes hitting the tip of the shoe"

I actually use these for indoor volleyball. I'm amazed how grippy it is even with dusty courts. I was so impressed that I immediately bought a second pair. Great shoes, not to high, not too low. I definitely feel confident moving around the court with these.",

The materials are of good quality, and the upper is more durable than I expected given that it's a lighter polyester-like material. The cushion is fairly comfortable. I can definitely feel the UA charged in the heel. It's pretty bouncy, but when standing in place it gets a little stiff. When you're in motion it's much better. I've also found that wearing these with two pairs of socks provides the best fit, otherwise I don't feel as secure and it affects the level of overall comfort.",
