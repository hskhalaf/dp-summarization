The instructions were unclear for set up and there were zero instructions for the application, but it's pretty common sense. Takes a little practice getting the temperature right and figuring how thick/thin to apply the wax. You can't really apply in large swatches as some demo videos have shown, but it works. I've only tried the black wax - can't wait to try the others! It does smell a little, but not bad enough you can't overlook it. Overall, was happy with how well it worked.",

Just melt the wax an apply it to the area you need waxing. So far, we have used this to wax eyebrows. We used the highest temperature to melt the wax and it was hot when applied to the skin but did not burn the skin at all. This wax ripped out all the hair as promised and we are very happy with this wax warmer.",

Once I managed to get it on my arm hair and it was time to pull it off, it did not take off any hair at all. Do not waste your time or money..",

They also don't tell you that once it reaches a certain temperature it automatically shuts off then turns back on later to keep it hot. Not a bad feature but would be good to know ahead of time.

We wish there were more Popsicle sticks. The price was overall fair but we felt like it should be under $20.",
