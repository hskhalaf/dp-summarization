If you put a layer of plywood down and attach with some simple zip-ties through a few holes, it won\u2019t squeak and will be perfectly sound. And by the way, you should put plywood down on ANY bed frame before putting mattresses down. This is just basic.",

This bed height would be good for people with mobility issues, because you can get on an off it with hardly any bending of the body. 4. The bed frame is portable, and light yet very strong. Cons: 1. The bedframe is just about at knee-height. In confined spaces its too easy to drag or smack a knee against it when moving around. I have already done it twice in less than a week. Ouch!",

This bed is perfect and I can easily slide tubs and other storage compartments underneath. My kids love the height, it brings our television closer to eye level. This frame and your mattress is all that you need, I experience and enjoy the same comfort as I did with my platform bed.",
