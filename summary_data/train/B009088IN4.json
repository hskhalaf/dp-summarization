He said as soon as some sores were going away new ones were festering. Also, he had a mouth full of sores when he started using the paste and he said it instantly gave him relief. He started using it in early April. since then, the old sores went away and he has not gotten a single sore! If I could give 10 stars I would. TRY THIS TOOTHPASTE IF YOU SUFFER FROM CONSTANT CANKER SORES! IT REALLY DOES WORK!",

The one unappealing feature is that it almost melts in your mouth and is loose on the toothbrush, you have to be very careful brushing or you make a mess everywhere. I believe that is from the xylitol which I DESPERATELY need. It helps soothes my mouth and I understand it also helps guard against cavities. The same messy thing happened when I used another toothpaste with xylitol (the brand is no longer available). PLEASE KEEP MAKING/DISTRIBUTING THIS TOOTHPASTE, I NEED IT.

But it IS helping to prevent dermatitis as the chemicals that are irritating to my skin present in other toothpastes are not insquiggle. It tastes great and cleans my teeth well. When i need to boost it i sprinkle baking soda on top.",
