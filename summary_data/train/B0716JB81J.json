      "text": "With this \"active\" mini-DisplayPort to HDMI adapter I was able to get a rock solid 4k@60hz signal from my 2017 Surface Pro to my 28\" Samsung UHD monitor. I tried two other \"non-active\" mini-DisplayPort to HDMI adapters that claimed 4k@60hz, none were able to sync higher than 30hz. Nice sleek design, not quite a slim as the non-active adapters, but slimmer than the other \"active\" ones within the same price point. Sturdy painted aluminum construction, good gauge neck. My only complaints might be not having gold plated connectors and the white on black branding. Would purchase again.",

When it initially did not work at 60hz in Linux, I'd questioned everything (cables, mini display port, TV, etc) and finally after wasting a lot of time with numerous permutations, found the problem was with the MS Surface dock not supporting Linux the same way it supports Windows 10. Even after latest dock firmware upgrades, it would not run at 60Hz in Linux. This adapter and a USB-ethernet adapter must be directly plugged into the side of the Surface Pro, for both to function correctly in Linux.",

Once I disconnect the USB cable and plug it back in everything wakes up. I was surprise when I go it that it required me to take up my Thunderbolt and USB port in order for it to work so read carefully if you only have one USB port (an older mac).",
