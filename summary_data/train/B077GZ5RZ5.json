The ants just walked around confused until one-by-one they died. They never seemed to understand that they could eat the gel, they dragged their dead family members to the corner, they started digging a little, but all died in a couple of weeks. It was terribly disappointing and depressing.",

When our ants arrived they were fine and thrived for the first few days but suddenly stopped tunneling. I contacted the ant supplier, and was told these gel farms can get old, expire, go out-of-date, whatever you want to call it. So our poor ants are just sitting in the corner of the habitat in a big \"ant pile\" doing nothing.",

The container was sticky when it arrived, but a wipe down cleared that up with no problems. Very nicely packaged, otherwise.",
