But this convenience is marred by the execution of the tilt-out control panel. The surface material looks cheap and worse, the text is medium gray on black making it hard to read. This could have been easily solved by adding a simple backlight, something I would have expected on a premium product. I was so annoyed by this that I added my own light using a battery-p owered motion-sensing LED strip positioned just above the panel. it works great and even makes the control panel surface look better...",

Although with the Ikea housing this fits into, it isn't 100% flush with the other cabinet doors. That's my only gripe. The \"reheat\" sensor button has gotten every single dish to the perfect temperature. A full cup of coffee doesn't spill a drop when opening and closing the door. Plus the added bonus of every person coming over saying \"holy crap, that's a microwave?!\"",
