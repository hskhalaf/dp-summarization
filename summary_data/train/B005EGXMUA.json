After this happened, we found the \u201cWarning\u201d sheet on the floor. Obviously it, too, had flown out from somewhere in the wrapping. It should have been visible on the box AND on the OUTSIDE of the cellophane wrapping. The warning does not give specific direction for avoiding injury.

The only possible issue is that I sometimes need to reposition it because it creeps about 1/2\" maybe every month or two.
