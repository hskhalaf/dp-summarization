My only issue is the USB receiver that goes into the computer is about two inches long so if you're using it with a laptop you move around you have to unplug and plug it in again. Also it's an old style, so one USB port will be used for this mouse and nothing else. But the performance is fantastic.",

I use recharable batteries and have to charge them every 3 months or so. That's with 8hr/day of use. I don't use a mouse pad and the only problem I've ever had was the mouse sometimes gets confused when used on tables with wooden patterns (like a mahogany, etc table). So, I just used a piece of paper as a mouse pad. I've noticed those tables confuse all optical and laser mouse. Only ball mouse work on them, but who wants a ball mouse anymore?",

A lot of the newer mice out there dont have this hard plastic on bottom, they have some cushion or something for your thumb to rest on. Otherwise, this is a great product!",

Scrolling is excellent, very accurate on almost any surface 4. Mouse feels very comfortable when navigating the cursor or when using as a remote.
