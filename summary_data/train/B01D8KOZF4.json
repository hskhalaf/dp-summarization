The only problem is crimping doesn't work well on solid wire and the ends pull off when you remove the jumpers from the board. They should be soldered on or crimped on stranded wire.",

Pros: Has many components. Has everything you need to experiment with. If you had to purchase these parts you would pay way more. Comes with Cd \ud83d\udcbf Cons: Nothing negative here. Some of the items are cheaply made but they are good for the price",

Most of the parts included in this kit I haven't touched but the reason I'm not providing 5 stars are because of the resistors included. The stripes that denote each resistor value are muddy in color so it's really hard to know what is what once you separate them from their packaging. I've had to use my multi-meter a number of times just to be sure I got the right one.",

Making your own more advanced projects will require learning some basic C++. I also bought a Nano from Elegoo, soldered in the headers, and just leave it on this breadboard that came with the kit. One little tip: everything is packed tightly into the case, so it can be hard to get it all back in. It helps to just remove the breadboard, then put the proto shield in the same bag with the UNO.",

All in all, I did and will recommend it to others for the price and number of parts. I also orderded more leds and potentiometers to continue using it for prototyping. One other thing I may order is more breadboards so I will not have to tear down one project to build another.",
