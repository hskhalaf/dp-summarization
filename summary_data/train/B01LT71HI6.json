My biggest problems are the FSU eat and handles on the sides of the stove too. They aren\u2019t easy to remove when packing up and I need to help him put them on and take off each time.",

The grill that places in case doesn't snap in place so is easily moved by little one. Be careful when applying stickers, you only get one shot, they don't uplift if needed to smooth out. I wouldn't recommend.",
