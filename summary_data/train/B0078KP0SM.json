After using it for another day it the camera shut down and nothing got it to work again. Doesn't seem to happen with most people, but happened to my family and multiple others. On the positive side there is a one year warranty on the camera and after sending it to the company they compensated by giving us the new WG-3. Haven't tested out the WG-3 yet, no warrant this time, hope it doesn't happen again.",

It has held up through many kayak trips and hikes. The only CON is that I thought it had more of a rubbery shell to help with the shock protection but it is just a hard plastic. This does not effect the cameras capabilities but the camera will get a little nicked up. not a big deal at all is a little different than it appears in the picture..",

However, it is possible, or probable, that you will have times when you miss a picture or starting video because you haven't released the shutter. This was a constant problem when my wife was using the camera and occasionally with me. The camera does have shutter lag a little more than I expected. It does have small buttons, which were a problem at times. Definitely practice using the camera before trying to take important shots.",

If I was an extremely active outdoorsman, I may have gone for the GoPro. But as a recreational outdoor fella, this works just fine. For indoor shots, you need to find the proper setting for the lighting. My advice would be to take some test pics before the event you want to capture in order to determine the proper setting. Don't miss out on a great shot of your precious people because of 'operator error'!",
