The only problem with assembly was getting the screws into the keyboard tray, they were really hard to screw in with the provided screwdriver. But eventually I got them in and the keyboard tray works really smoothly. The top of the desk has a lot of room. I plan on getting 2 monitors in the future and there will be enough room to hold both. The keyboard tray is wide enough to hold my keyboard and mouse pad, but only barely. The side shelf seems to be pretty sturdy, it's nice that I can put it on either side. I would buy it again!",

Components are adequate sturdiness for not-so-rough use, and the top is just large enough to place the desktop computer, monitor and a couple of basic speakers.

Pictures were very simple to understand and everything was labeled properly. Only negative thing I can say is that the color isn't exactly CHERRY. It's like a light bamboo. BUT, still very nice quality for the money! I'm very pleased with this purchase and highly recommed it. :)",
