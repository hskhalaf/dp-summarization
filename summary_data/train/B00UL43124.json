I ordered the white mirror on 8/13/18 and the hooks are a matching white. Overall this is exactly what I was looking for and I am happy with the purchase \u2013 especially for the price as I was surprised that most full length mirrors run over $100. This is great for people not looking to spend that much money and need something simple that saves space. Easy installation and you can screw the hooks in so the mirror can be higher or lower. It was delivered via USPS and the box does say something like: caution glass inside.",

Best of all, it was made here in the United States! I was hesitant to buy online since I had one previously that was very flimsy and fell off and broke. I am very impressed and would recommended this to everyone. Looks great too",

I installed it down the hall and it's frightening to approach because my body looks so distorted. I can't bear to look at it, honestly.

The only other hardware provided are drywall anchors and screws for mounting to a wall, so I know that the \"correct\" screws were used. Extremely poor quality control.

Finally the guide template for drilling the holes were at least 1/4\u201d off. Ridiculous that they didn\u2019t get that right or more likely the hole placement on the mirror itself was off.

The cons.'s about his mirror are that the seam corners do not exactly 'come together' like you would expect, the backing is of compressed cardboard (or something of) and it is too difficult to return (hence the 3 rating - I would like to give it a 3.5, but that isn't possible).",

      "text": "The product is very good. I am happy to report that there are no defects or image distortions on the mirror. It was easy to install over the door. ONE ISSUE: The mirror kept rocking back and forth as I opened and closed the door, making thumping sounds. To fix this problem I added a small two sided sticky tape between the door and the bottom of the mirror. Now it stays put and is a lot more stable. I recommend that the manufacturer include a small strip of two sided sticky tape and instruct the user to fasten it between the mirror and the door.",
