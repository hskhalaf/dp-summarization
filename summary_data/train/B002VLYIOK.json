These boots not only hold up, they keep you warm and dry NO MATTER WHAT it is doing outside! I have tried Tuff Boots, Boggs, etc and we are Hooked on Muck Boots for life!

Very disappointed because these are comfortable but for $144 not worth even half of that. I've always heard Much boots were the best I guess they have gone cheap like everybody else.",

The only drawback to these is that they are not good for walking on uneven ground. My son is a field engineer for a site development company, so there are many uneven surfaces. His feet do not sweat as others said they would with a rubber boot. Nice warm, waterproof boot.",

    "title": "Muck Boot Arctic Sport Rubber High Performance Men's Winter Boot",
    "description": "Ideal for outdoor work or leisure activities during frigid weather, Muck Arctic Sport Rubber High Performance Men's Winter Boots will keep your feet warm in temperatures as low as -40 \u00b0F (-40\u00b0C), even when you're standing ankle deep in snow and slush. Offering both support and comfort, these insulated boots have a contoured midsole and warm fleece lining with thermal foam under the footbed. The 5 mm neoprene in these men's snow boots offers numerous benefits: it's waterproof, it absorbs shock, retains heat and prevents chafing by adjusting to the natural contours of the feet. These men's winter boots with molded lugs are built with a fully-sealed rubber shell that extends high above the ankle for extra protection when walking in deeper snow.\n\nMake the Arctic-like conditions your playground in this sporty boot from Muck Boots. Lightweight, well insulated, and sure to keep your feet warm and comfy as the Mercury dips, this sturdy boot offers 100% waterproof protection, keeping snow, ice, and slush at bay with ease. Its upper shaft stretches for a close under- or over-the-pants fit. A breathable lining wicks moisture away for a comfy, dry feel, while the molded rubber outsole keeps you steady on your feet.\n\nThe story began in 1999 with the sole purpose of building the most comfortable, high performance footwear on the market. The need for a more comfortable boot for use in messy and tough conditions led to the design of The Original Muck Boot Company brand footwear. Every boot in the line is expected to deliver the same 100% waterproof quality and comfort that inspired the original footwear. In just a few years, the line has grown to more than 20 styles, all designed to tackle tough conditions in agriculture, lawn and garden, outdoor sporting, equine, and pet care. Today, the Muck Boot brand defines a standard of comfort and quality that goes beyond the expectations of customers around the country.\n\nSee more",
