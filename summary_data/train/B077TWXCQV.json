I recommend exfoliating well and finding a good moisturizer. This soap combined with that, the bumps on my legs and body lessened so much. I also used to get acne around my butt/upper thigh (so. Embarrassing.) and it\u2019s all gone now. So if you\u2019re questioning I\u2019d definitely at least try it.",

It is also non irritating, inserted and does not contain plastic beads. I would't say this is a moisturizing product, not like a neutral feeling exfoliator.",

Well, CeraVe Body Wash and lotion has left me with great results almost immediately. My skin is soft and seems to retain moisture.

      "text": "enjoyed this body wash and how well it helped treat my KP. However, this alone is not effective enough to erase ALL bumps, only 75%. also, you must be consistent with this body wash to see results. If I skipped a day or two from using this, my KP would be noticeable and more pronounced. after using this wash with my cleansing cloth I get SMOOTH SKIN and immediately after I use an AHA glycolic body lotion to further the exfoliation will be ordering again! \ud83c\udf00",
