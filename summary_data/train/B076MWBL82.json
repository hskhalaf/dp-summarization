My instructor said to practice chipping into a circle the size of a trash can lid. This net is a little bigger than that and has pockets to aim at. It seems to stay put and I haven't knocked it over yet. I suppose if you use a driver or iron you will knock it over or damage it, but it's not made for that. Bottom line, I'm happy with my $19.00 investment.",
