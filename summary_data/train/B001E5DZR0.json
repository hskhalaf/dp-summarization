Rinsing with water often will not get nasty pesticides and other harmful bacteria/substances off your food when you are trying to prepare it. This is especially important when you are attempting to eat a lot of fresh, whole foods.

    "description": "Size:6-(Pack)You wash your hands before dinner. In most homes, it\u2019s a standard practice. And just like you wouldn\u2019t wash your hands with only water, the same should go for your fruits and vegetables. Those wondering how to wash fruit properly need only to turn to Fit Organic Fruit and Vegetable Wash, a trusted and certified organic produce wash. Fit Organic cleans 98% more waxes, pesticides, and other contaminants from your fruits and veggies than water alone. Produce is porous.

While water can bead up ineffectively on the surface of your food, Fit Organic produce wash gets down into the fiber of the plant, removing any remaining wax and pesticides. If you want to know how to thoroughly wash pesticides off fruit in the safest manner, look no further than Fit Organic, the only USDA-certified organic and kosher (OU) fruit and vegetable wash. Fit Organic is the best way to wash fruit and vegetables.

Our products are also certified as vegan, kosher, and completely animal cruelty-free. Using Fit Organic\u2019s fruit and veggies wash spray is as simple as can be: spray to cover produce, rub for about 1 minute and rinse under water. You\u2019ll never have to worry about chemicals and contaminants again when you know how to properly wash fruit. Why would you use artificial chemicals to clean chemicals from your produce?
