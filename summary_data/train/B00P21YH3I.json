There was no odor or anything when we unpacked it and it was a fun workout trying to break up the foam inside (because I'm disabled) but once that was done it fluffed right up. The thing is 6ft long and like laying on a cloud \ud83d\ude01 I am extremely happy with my couch sack and so is my husband as you can see in the picture.",

I can only assume that this bag was VERY VERY VERY underfilled... There is NO way they could possible sell a product like this and have ANY positive reviews...

(My wife says no, so that idea is \"paused\" for a while. :-) ) The camel color is neutral enough to go with my woodtone/earthtone home decor. The inner liner plus the outer cover seem resilient and will likely hold up to adult wear and tear. Since it is not waterproof, I'll be guarding against spilled drinks.

It\u2019s not even 24 hours now and it\u2019s at full fluff. Just roll it around a bunch, karate chop it etc and it fluffs up. It\u2019s a bada$$ brown color but with like a bronze sheen? Looks GREAT. As I rolled it around some of the hair on the ground got on it but all you have to do it wipe with your hand lightly and it all just falls off, seems to not hold on to hair which is awesome. Super soft, 100% glad I got it. The 6ft XL.",

We use it to watch movies and play video games. Wont regret IF you are looking for a large bean bag style couch. FYI, it is not filled with styrofoam beans. It is filled with chunks of soft foam, like egg crate or memory foam.",

      "text": "Absolutely love this product!! Very comfortable and the quality is unbeatable. The material is incredibly soft and stain resistant. I bought this for my 9 Year old son who immediately spilled a full soda in it.. the material completely repelled the liquid and I was able to wipe it down with just a damp paper towel.. you would never know it happened, not sticky, still soft! My son loves his giant bean bag chair. Only down side is that it is quite heavy, and requires a bit of muscle to move, but that's ok with me, it means it stays where I want it and doesn't wander. Totally recommend this product!!",
