I originally purchased these earmuffs for ocean fishing, the wind tends to hurt my ears. I now however take them with me everywhere, they are my go to ear protection while fighting the cold weather. The earmuffs are very basic, light weight, they contour to my head, and don't slip off, and I find them very comfortable. They are however not fleece, but more of a velvet feel.",

When I first received this product, the packaging was great with no damages. I opened it up and immediatly put it on my ears to see how well this would work. After walking a bit outside, my ears did not get cold! I use it almost everyday in the winter to counter the cold air of fall and coming winter. Compared to regular ear warmers that go over your head in a headband form, this product simply does not fall off!",

You are able to hear everything around you. Also, they are pretty large, they cover a good portion of your cheek! Cons: Because of their size, they feel odd at first. But got used to it eventually. Another slight issue about these is that they are not actually foldable.. Although they do somewhat reduce in size when not being worn, they do not actually fold which makes them a bit difficult to store away. All-in-all, a great product!",
