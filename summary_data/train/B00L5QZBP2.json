It's not really a matte eyeliner though, it has a sheen, so if that's what you're looking for then this won't be it.",

Same great formula, but I won't be purchasing the skinny stick to help me in the application of my eye liner anymore. It's just too flimsy and difficult to control.

Sort of sucks when you realize it in the morning when you're rushing to put on make-up, but it makes for a great reminder to replace the product regularly since, like any other mascara/eyeliner/liquid product, it's esp prone to collect bacteria fast.",
