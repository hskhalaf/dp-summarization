Let's see: 1) it uses plant-based detergents and still gets my family's clothes cleaner than any other detergent we've tried 2) it does not irritate skin, 3) it is incredibly easy to use (you really can dispense exactly what you need with one hand) 4) it is much more environmentally friendly because you're not paying the manufacturer to ship you a jug of water and 5) it lasts forever. I would give six stars if I could! Bravo 7th Gen!",

The muscleheads in my family can too easily fill the detergent compartment without batting an eye, which leads to sudsy towels and decreased savings for the planet and my bank account. I feel like I'd have to practice over a bowl to get a feel for exactly how the EasyDose cap works. It feels easier to just eyeball a tablespoon of the stuff and lecture my family to do the same. Overall, nice idea, just not a fool-proof execution.",

After using regular Seventh Generation liquid soap for about 4 years, I am realizing it really doesn't clean; it maybe refreshes clothes. But if you have dirty clothes, they come out of the wash still dirty. I have been testing Shaklee's laundry detergent against Seventh Generation and there's no comparison. Shaklee does a far superior job of cleaning. I'm going back to Shaklee.",

The packaging is very innovative. The detergent is super concentrated and you only need a few tablespoons per load. The bottle has a dosing lid, so all you have to do is give the bottle a good squeeze and it stops the flow when youve squeezed out enough. Also the bottles are probably 1/4th the size of a normal detergent jug so less packaging too.",
