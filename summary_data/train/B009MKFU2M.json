In addition to this there's a sticker on the top that warns you to place the contents inside an air-tight dishwasher-safe container prior to putting them in the safe, so you will need to fold any paperwork you intend to store in this safe. The label also warns you to air the safe out ever 2 weeks, which I'm certain I'll remember to do... Hopefully this safe will be worth the hassle should the worst ever happen to my home, but until then it's just \"Ok\".",
