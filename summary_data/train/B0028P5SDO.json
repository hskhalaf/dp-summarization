The product, which is normally thick and provides great coverage, had obviously been replaced with a cheap concealer that was runny and translucent. Total trash and waste of money. Save your money, go to Ulta, and buy the REAL thing.",

Thinner consistency right out of the tube , and when you try to blend it, it comes off completely. Be on the safe side and purchase it from their actual website or from Naimes, even if it cost a few dollars more. It's not worth the aggravation and you're getting an inferior product.",
