But this comb has been incredibly helpful and I ordered a second one just to have around for our nightly flea killing sessions. It works on our short haired dog, short haired cats, and medium hair cat. It probably wouldn't work for long haired cats or dogs with long or thick fur. It catches those little suckers in between the teeth of comb so they can't jump away before you drown them. Very pleased.",

I started at her head and traveled down her neck and several fleas showed up on the comb. You must quickly put the comb into the soapy water before the fleas have a chance to jump, sometimes reaching into the water with one finger to get the ones that were stuck between the teeth.

What I did was let him smell this and then proceeded to comb him and he loved it. Now when I come to him with it he lays down to get his grooming. The comb did a great job of getting the fleas and the flea dirt off. I use this about once or twice a week. I would definitely recommend this to those looking to keep their pets flea free",

This has been very good not only for normal grooming, but especially for removing fleas from my cat. It seems ideal for shorthairs and possibly longhairs with thin coats.",
