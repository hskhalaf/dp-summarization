I have a newer tool rollaway and I barely have the clearance but it dies work. Be careful as older and some newer rollaway boxes may not have the clearance needed. depending on the make and model of screw drivers no all will fit. The longer straight blade screw driver provided in Snap-On screw driver sets is about 1/16 too long for a good fit. For standard and general use screw drivers as in the item photo, this item performs well.",
