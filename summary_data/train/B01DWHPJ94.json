I returned them though as Bluetooth reception was poor and got another set of the Smokin' Buds. Music kept getting interrupted even if I had my phone in my back pocket. I didn't go running with them, but I doubt they would stay on. I also didn't like the charging port whose cover makes it hard to get the cable in.",

The battery lasted me near on 10 hours 1 day last week with gym, a 2 hour walk and then general use around the house. I am so glad i took the plung and encourage anyone who is hesitant about these to buy them!",

Whilst this headset is even lighter than described, it does not display the battery life on my iOS device. So I am back to the low quality experience of guessing the battery level. There are no voice prompts for commands, like some of the low quality headsets have, just a series of beeps. Disappointing. The sound quality is reasonable, but the battery level display made me return the product.",

Disappointed that something which I had recommended in the past has such poor Quality control / reliability. Good stuff : 1. Get a pair of good eartips and this makes commute quite comfortable. 2. Very lightweight and battery lasts a whole day of normal usage. Bad stuff: 1. 1 earbud died after 2 days. 2. Eartips included were too small for me.",
