I\u2019ve dropped this phone 3-4 times which would\u2019ve definitely shattered the screen with no case or a generic hard plastic case. The issue is the clear case turns yellow very fast.

If it weren't for that, I would have given 5 stars, making it a perfect case. Don't get me wrong, it is a great case and looks very nice. Just wish the kickstand was made out of some type of metal.

The mute switch is very easily accessible which is always a plus as some cases you have to have long nails to flip it.

The kickstand does not work under a vertical orientation. The positives? It's lightweight and doesn't slip from your hand. But what's the point when the kickstand pops out literally while you're holding your phone in your hand?",

I have to fiddle with it every time I shift the orientation of my phone, because the flimsy metal pole holding it in just doesn't work anymore.

I\u2019ve bought a couple different cases , but keep coming back to this one. I am hoping Spigen creates iPhone 12 cases just like this one. Maybe a blue trim?? \ud83d\ude2c",

I used the old one for almost 3 years before the magnet on the stand lost its effectiveness, and the transparent case started turning yellowish. The new case is great - very sturdy and the stand is effective. I did notice that sometimes an air bubble will form on the back on case so I would need to \"release\" the air... not sure why. Didn't see that happening in the first case.",

The updated stand only allows for phone to be supported one way (horizontally) whereas the previous model allowed you to support the phone horizontally or vertically. Also, the current stand doesn't seem to hold the phone up better than the previous one, it's tippy. Great case nonetheless.",
