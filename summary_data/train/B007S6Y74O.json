I find myself wanting two shakes now -- whereas before, I could split one scoop into two shakes (and this totally explains WHY they changed it) which amounts to a big reduction in cost/value for us. Will try to post label comparison pictures soon, and you can decide for yourself. If all I wanted from my \"meal replacement\" was a whole food vitamin, I'd take a multi.",
