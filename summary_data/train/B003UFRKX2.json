On way to our destination we pushed them along sideways with our suitcase. On the return journey we put our dirty washing in one as there was so much room. This wasn\u2019t a good idea as it made the case very unstable, and more difficult to manoeuvre. The Uber driver had difficulty fitting them and our suitcases into his big SUV. Managed it in the end though. All told we are happy with them, but the soft bodied, smaller cases are definitely easier to handle,",

I fixed the problem myself by buying a screw, washer, and locking nut. It's not as pretty as their design, but much more reliable and effective. Maybe I received a bad case, but I believe the other fasteners will fail in the future, so I bought additional parts to fix on failure.",

I know airlines are tough on bags but when you purchase a Samsonite product and pay what I did, I expected it to last for years.
