Recently, I decided to do an Intolerant/Nutrient test where I send my hair to the lab and they analyze it. I was shocked at the results! I was low on Vitamin B12, C, D, Iodine, and Boron. Low being a nutritional deficiency level of under 15%. Needless to say, I've canceled my subscribe and save. I just wish I didn't waste over $240 over the last year on this product.",

Less of the ingredients we buy this for - this multi literally pales in comparison to its previous iteration, yet costs the same. As an added benefit - it crumbles and falls apart when exposed to air/moisture/strong-language. The reformulation is an absolute failure - there is no reason to order this product any longer.

However, after their \u201cnew formula\u201d which was supposed to make the pills more easily digestible, the vitamins have begun crumbling into dust before I can even take them. It appears that exposure to the air oxidizes the vitamins, peeling and crumbling them into dust. It\u2019s extremely inconvenient for anyone who likes to leave their vitamins out or carry them in a separate container for taking them on the go. I would not recommend purchasing these until the oxidation issue has been addressed.",
