First you have to try to give clues that are only for your group of cards and none of the other teams. You give a one word clue that is suppose to relate to one or more cards (only you know which ones) and your partner better have the same thought train. The guessers complained we took too long between giving clues UNTIL the next game when they became the clue givers and saw it wasn\u2019t easy. This is not a fun light hearted game and I doubt young children could play at all.",

When we started a new game with the other team, THEY won everything without my team having a chance due to how easy the words were.

It works for parties of more than 4 because you just divide into 1 relatively equal teams. The words the designers chose to include are perfect because most have more than one meaning, giving you lots of options. It's a great gift, a fun time and I just don't know how it couldn't be a hit.

It's a bit tricky to kick off the first time if no one knows how to play. I recommend having one person learn all the rules in advance, so they can quickly bring everyone up-to-speed when the group assembles.

Really you could play with as many people as you wanted if you're up for a challenge because of all the different minds coming together, but I would recommend this game to anyone who is wanting a new game for themselves or for the family.",

Then everyone except the code masters can sit comfortably anywhere they can hear the game. I've played many games with many groups and this one is nice and light and scales well. It's always well received. Intergenerational teams prove an advantage as different connections are made between the words.",

One thing that's nice about the game is that even though it is based on a set of word cards, there is little advantage to having seen or used a card before because of the way that the game works. I have always played with 4 or more players but the box says 2 to 8+. The average time for a round is roughly 20 minutes. You could speed that up by using a timer if you like. Overall I would say that it is a fun game for family or couples that you won't tired of quickly.",

I got this as a gift for my sister, and we had a ball playing with my parents, other sister, and brother-in-law. It's a challenging, adult-friendly game without any of the cringiness that comes from hearing your dad read cards during What Do You Meme (although I love that game too).",

I personally find the challenge fun, and it's so amusing to watch the guessers' trains of thought. It's great for parties and getting to know other people, and I think it's even better with friends that you already know because you can test your friend-telepathy! My favorite thing about it is, despite reusing the limited number of cards, it is incredibly replayable because the map and card locations are always changing.",

The catch is that the clues can only contain a single word and a single number. The word indicates which of the (code)words the players should pick, and the number indicates how many codewords match that particular clue. If you need a party game that can play 8-12 people comfortably, with each round taking about 10-15 minutes, this is a fantastic pickup. Less fun in small groups... I wouldn't play it with less than 6, and it is really best with 8-10.",

One team can get several easy multi-word groupings, while the other team is left with a bunch of unrelated single-word turns and are reduced to blind guessing to stay in the game.",
