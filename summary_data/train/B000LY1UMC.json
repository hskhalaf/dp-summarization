      "text": "Pentax has done it again. They have incorporated shake reduction technology and great image rendering into a well-designed 10MP compact digital. It is small, powerful, sturdy and easy to use. There are also features for the more discerning photographers out there. The video clips are crisp and also uttilize the anti-shake technology! The large view screen on the back is a joy to use. Maybe the one thing I would improve is the battery life. If you're leaving on an extended trip, maybe buy an extra one for back up. The charger is a bit cumbersome if you're trying to travel as light as the A30's body size may suggest. Overall, I am VERY pleased with this product!",

I took a chance on buying a used unit to keep the price down, but I have had no problems with it so far. The shake reduction feature is great. The pictures are much sharper than the M20. I do prefer the battery option in the M20 of AA rather than the charger type, but I'll just have to get a spsre to carry. I haven't yet taken a video, but I expect that function to be at least as good as the M20.",

Loads of features BUT sometimes depending on lighting conditions has a hard time focusing.... Im sure many small compact camera do. BUT 10MP max res and all the other goodies make up for it - ANOTHER DISAPPOINTING NOTE- DIVIX format for video is not supported on MAC - I get video playback with NO SOUND. Terrible when video is kids or vacation! If camera was waterproof it would be even better! Build quality is very good! Not too small to hold. Black shell feels solid and professional.",

I think more than 10 minutes of home video is stultifingly boring, so I don't need hours of capacity. I would never buy another Divx coded camera- do you hear me Pentax!",

    "title": "Pentax Optio A30 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom with Shake Reduction System",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Pentax Optio A30 features 10.0 effective megapixels, a 1/1.8-inch CCD with a wide dynamic range for superior tones, an smc Pentax zoom lens and an image processing engine that gives a rich color reproduction. The Pentax original Shake Reduction (SR) technology in the A30 has been improved by adding both Digital and Movie SR for improved image capture in low-light settings and telephoto capture. A unique Face Recognition AF and AE function offers better results in photographs by automatically detecting faces, and then adjusting exposure and focus to properly capture portraits. \n\n As a DivX-certified digital camera, the Optio A30 also makes it easy for users to create their own media for both business and social purposes. With the push of a button, users can instantly record high-quality DivX video and discover simple playback on any of the 50 million DivX-certified consumer electronics devices available today. \n\n Optio A30 Highlights \n\n High-quality images With 10.0 effective megapixels, the Optio A30 achieves one of the highest image quality levels in a compact digital camera. The 1/1.8-inch CCD features a wide light-sensitive area for superior tone reproduction. The camera features an smc Pentax zoom lens renowned for high resolving power, an image processing engine that makes a rich color reproduction possible, and three Shake Reduction functions. \n\n Shake Reduction Enhancements \n\n * Shake Reduction The new shake detection accuracy of the Optio A30 is achieved incorporating a high-accuracy gyro sensor and a control algorithm used for SR technology in Pentax digital SLR cameras, which consists of an exclusive shifting CCD system. This allows highly corrective effects, equivalent to shutter speeds of approximately 2.5 to 3.5 steps to be achieved when shooting still images. \n * Digital Shake Reduction* The Digital SR mode automatically alters sensitivity according to the brightness of the subject, and effectively reduces camera shake and subject blur. For the Optio A30, the maximum sensitivity has been improved to ISO 3200 to allow faster shutter speeds and more blur free photography.\n   * Image recording size is fixed to 5 M (2592 x 1944 pixels) when the Digital SR mode is selected. \n * Movie Shake Reduction* An electronic shake reduction function exclusively for capturing movies, which effectively corrects distortions in images due to camera shakes through software.\n   * When using Movie SR mode, the field of view is narrower than that during normal video recording. \n\nNew, brighter, easier-to-view LCD monitor The Optio A30 features a high-intensity LCD monitor with an LCD booster function that improves screen brightness on demand. The monitor is easier to view outdoors even in bright sunlight, and with a 2.5-inch screen size and a high resolution of 232,000 pixels, confirming picture compositions and focus is easy. The screen also offers wide-angle viewing of 160 degrees, since there is little change in brightness and colors even when looking at the monitor diagonally.  Face Recognition AF and AE The Optio A30 is equipped with a Face Recognition AF and AE function* that automatically detects and focuses on faces, regardless of where the people appear in the photo frame. In addition, optimal exposure settings are automatically adjusted so that the areas with faces are not darkened even if there is backlighting. *Available when the photography mode is \"Portrait\" or \"Kid\" and the camera is directed at people from the front. This camera\u2019s Face Recognition AF and AE function uses the Face Tracker face-recognition technology from FotoNation. \n\n Swift operation speeds Photography and playback operation speeds are enhanced on the A30 for all-around improved results especially in action settings. In addition to a 0.02-second release time lag, focus and start-up times have been improved. \n\n Intelligent Zoom function The Optio A30 is equipped with a new Intelligent Zoom function, an evolved form of digital zoom, enabling users to digitally magnify images and maintain the image quality of optical zoom. \n\n Video Recording mode enables high-quality recording for longer time periods The Optio A30 captures movies at 30 fps (frames per second) at sizes up to 640 x 480 pixels with image quality rivaling camcorders. Equipped with DivX (MPEG-4 compliant) movie format,* the Optio A30 captures longer, high-quality movies in smaller files.\n*The Optio A30 is DivX certified. Movie playback is not supported on Macintosh operating systems. \n\n A wide range of exposure setting modes With Programmed Exposure mode, the Optio A30 automatically determines shutter speed and aperture. The camera also includes Shutter-Priority AE mode and Manual Exposure mode, which users may set for desired effects. \n\n Compact, lightweight body Despite a large CCD, an SR system and a 3x optical zoom lens with a focal range covering angles of view equivalent to those of a 38-114mm lens in 35mm format, the Optio A30 features a slim, light body with a unique Sliding Lens System* and high-density mounting technology.\n* A Pentax proprietary lens system where the central lens group slides upward and away from the optical axis. Housing the lens in two steps in the lens cylinder reduces overall lens thickness, thereby minimizing body depth. \n\n Other Features \n\n * Auto-tracking AF continuously focuses on a moving subject \n * Compatible with new SDHC memory cards, in addition to conventional SD memory cards \n * mode Palette provides quick access to 15 shooting modes and 15 playback modes \n * A \"Green button\" enables users to assign functions that are frequently used and recall them in just one touch \n * Approximately 22MB of built-in memory \n * Calendar Display function allows image retrieval based on the capture date \n * Easy searching and organizing of images on a PC using the Date Folder function \n * FotoNation\u2019s red-eye correction function for correcting red eye after shooting, which occurs easily when photographing with flash \n * Includes the ACDSee for Pentax image viewer/image management software \n * Supports PictBridge, DPOF functions, Exif Print, and PRINT Image Matching III",
