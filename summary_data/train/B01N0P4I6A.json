True to its name, this sneaker has been attested by many to be light on the feet.\u00a0Considering its materials, it has a reasonable price tag. However, wearers have to be aware that this high-top most likely needs a break-in period. With its appearance and support features, owning a pair of Puma Hazard Orange Suede is recommended.",
      "pros": [
        "Most of the reviews highlighted the stylish design of the footwear",
        "The majority are impressed with the TOMS TRVL Lite High\u2019s lightweight feel",

        "As per most buyers, the high-top TRVL Lite by TOMS true to size",
        "One purchaser said that he was impressed with the quality of materials used on the sneaker"

      "cons": [
        "Some wearers complained that the toe box does not have sufficient wiggle room",

The burgundy ones have lasted me over a year and I wear them almost everyday. The black pair seem even more durable so I\u2019m sure they will last just as long. They give me the perfect amount of support. I walk a lot and my feet never hurt in these. They are by far my favorite sneakers I\u2019ve ever owned.",

The reason I did not give a 5 star is because I feel like the insert made my feet smell - but that could just be my feet and not the product. Either way I will absolutely buy these again. Also, I have washed them numerous times in the washing machine and air dried (take the laces out and insert out and toads everything in) and they are in rear condition! Definitely recommend them",
