I will try another because the tool is very easy to use, and the price is right. I hope this isn't a common theme with these joiners...",

There were times my joints would shift during practice glue ups to about 1/16 of an inch. For the longest time I thought I was messing something up and simply stopped using the tool. I finally removed the blade thinking I was going to shim it to make up for what is suspected was a wobble. Come to find out the blade itself is warped. Not what I expected from a $200 tool. Somewhat disappointed but hopefully the new blade with fix the problem.",

I've also tried the beadlock system (where you drill a 3-4 hole dowel in). It makes a super strong joint, but I find the plate joiner is easier to get a flush joint.",

And whether you're using the joiner clamped down or as a free-moving unit, the retractable, antislip pins help hold your workpiece in place for the perfect cut. And it weighs just 6.6 pounds for easy handling.\n\nFor easy setup, the DW682K features preset depth stops for all common biscuit sizes of 0, 10, and 20.\n\nThe DW682K Plate Joiner Kit comes with a DEWALT warranty package that includes a three-year limited warranty, a one-year free service contract, and a 90-day money-back guarantee.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nDW682K Plate Joiner, carbide blade, dust bag, vacuum adapter, Torx key, wrench, and soft kit bag.",
