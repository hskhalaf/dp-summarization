      "text": "Arrived earlier than expected and no product damage. Nice addition to my office decor. Seems to be well-constructed. Works nicely but when I ordered this, I didn't think I had to push down on anything. Thought I could just slide the paper in and the hole punch would work automatically. I've seen some newly constructed manual hole punchers where they require less pushing effort than the old-fashioned kind but I got an electric hole puncher so I wouldn't have to push down at all. That said, having an electric hole punch where I have to push down seems to defeat the purpose to me. Perhaps I did not read the description well enough before I ordered this particular model...",

When I look at it and press the punch button, I can see that one of the punchers does not return to its' upward position so I can pull my paper out!!!. As a result I end up having to wiggle, wrangle, and pull the paper out with force, often tearing the hole! This is the second time I have purchased this puncher. The first one worked fine but conked out eventually but I liked and considered how long it did last and decided to get the same type. Bad decision. I think this hole puncher is defective!!!",
