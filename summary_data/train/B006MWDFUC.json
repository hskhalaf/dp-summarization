They are not even confirming if this is from US or Canada and forget about the exact location where it is sourced. 3. High price - it is very expensive. 4. Crystal form - I never seen a honey become this much crystal or hard. From raw stage of honey, how it can be this much creamy. Ugh.",

      "text": "I wasn't sure I if I should order this but, after reading all of the positive reviews, I placed the order and haven't regretted it. This has such a rich taste, it puts those bear-bottle honeys to shame! Now THIS how honey is supposed to taste! Also, even though the listing shows how much you are getting, the jar is much larger than I thought. Bonus! I'll definitely be ordering again. My morning tea has never been so good.",

Thanks guys, I'll buy elsewhere",
