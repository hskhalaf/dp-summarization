For the first time I\u2019ve seen a dramatic reduction in my Achilles pain and my knee pain is gone. I will say I am combining this supplement with exercise, lots of water and clean eating. However I was doing those other steps six months prior with no change in condition. I think the combination of both really works to lower inflammation.",
