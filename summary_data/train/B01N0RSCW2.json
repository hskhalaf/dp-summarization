I plan to try more scents in the future because I love these so much! Definitely would recommend. PS. I am sensitive to strong scents (sometimes get headaches from them) and these do not bother me.",

The only explanation I think is necessary for this review is: To ensure this candle (or any other candle for that matter) burns as efficiently as possible trim the wick per the instructions on most candles. If there aren't any see below for common recommendations: Trim wick 3/4 and always trim after each burn. Only burn for 2-4 hours depending on candle. Try not to leave the candle lit in a drifty area or when it's really windy some days with the windows open. Those steps have always led to properly burned candle. Simple as that. Highly recommend.",

OMG...the fragrance is so intense that I couldn\u2019t burn it for more than one hour. The fragrance lingered in my bedroom for hours afterwards. It burns very well, so it will last a long time, therefore priced very well. I bought the grapefruit and look forward to trying more fragrances.",

I will buy again dispute the mistake. Updated rating from 3 to 4 star based on smell of both candles.",

The smell is amazing, light, fruity (almost like pear and peach), and floral (rose and a hint of violet). What I love about this candle is that it lasts longer than other candles that I have owned previously. Once, I left it on for about 8 hours, and was surprised to see how only a small amount of wax had been vaporized (of course this experience may vary depending on the person). I would definitely recommend!",

However, from the moment I lit the candle I have not been able to smell the candle at all. Not even when I'm sitting merely two feet away from this candle. I'm extremely disappointed given the fact that this candle and candle company had high reviews. Do Not Buy This Product. Save your money and just by an unscented candle instead.",

If you are sensitive to things like that, I recommend something different.",
