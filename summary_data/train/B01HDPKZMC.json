The rubber stopper for the neck does indeed keep the fat out of the spout. Regarding ease of cleaning, the spout doesn't clean very easily. You might consider a sponge/wand of some sort. The truth is, this product can and will save you significant time in the de-fatting process. Recommended.",

With a slip-resistant handle, silicone stopper (for an airtight spout), and a solid-catching strainer at the top that makes pouring your drippings in easier than ever, prepping your favorite broth, sauce and gravy just got a whole lot simpler.",
