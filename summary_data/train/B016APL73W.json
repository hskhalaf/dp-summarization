Very bright, crisp, toned voice people will love it and so will you. The headset feels a bit uncomfortable the first times but that's because it's brand new so you have to pretty much break them in. Eventually they feel great. A volume knob at a handy place would have been great. There's a volume dial but it's in the battery compartment and it's not practical. All in all still a great product so far.",

The receiver, transmitter and definitely the headset are far inferior and more cheaply constructed than my old Shure. Receiver made of thin plastic and seems fragile. Headset does not fit nearly as well as my previous Shure. I'm surprised it worked when I hooked it up to mixer. Amazon charged over 8% sales tax or $25 plus shipping. Definitely no bargain at over $325.",
