Very sturdy and colorful. We used them during a 2 day lake escapade and they provided great floatation and support for the kids and adults. Comfortable to use. Taking them on vaca required very little space. Great purchase for a very good price.",

Inflated half of them for a party and one blue one had a hole in it. The three I had for the party were heavily used and held up well. I inflated the remaining 2 and found the other blue one had a pinhole in it. So, both blue ones weren't useable. But for $12 for 6 it was worth it. Would order again.",

We first tried them out in our pool (two adults - one at 138 lbs the other at 180 lbs) and they supported us both allowing for great floating fun. Since then we have taken them on two island trips where we used them every day to float in the ocean. You can position the doodle behind your back and under your arms, hold a beverage, and float for hours. I used to take more cumbersome inflatable floats on our island vacations but now take these because they do everything I want, pack up so small, and inflate/deflate in seconds.",

They rolled back up once deflated and are easily stored. They did seem to loose a little air as the children played with them but not so much that they did not keep them afloat.",

Really more a toy I guess.",
