Only thing I wish is that each band would have the resistance in lbs on the band itself. Instead they go by color and say 'heavy' or 'x-heavy' etc. There's a paper which explains the resistance of each band but I see zero reason why that wouldn't be on the band itself just to make it easier to identify than colors I'll update this if anything happens in terms of durability like a break of a band.
