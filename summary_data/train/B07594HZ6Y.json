I can simply say, it competes with bose mini portable speaker. Highly recommended.",

The sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small and relatively inexpensive speaker. The volume has great range- my kids enjoy turning it up as loud as it will go and having dance parties in the kitchen. The depth of sound is pretty great too. I plug mine in frequently, so I haven\u2019t really tested out the battery life. But if you\u2019re on the fence, I can solidly recommend this one. Just do it!",

This speaker is far better than some of the other affordable, high-ranking speakers on Amazon (like Oontz Angle, Anker Soundcore, Doss Touch). The sound is richer, deeper, and has good bass without sounding forced or over the top. It's even on par with some $50 or $60 speakers on Amazon. Top that off with the fact that it's waterproof, has an insane battery life and a long range, and you have an awesome product well worth the price. If you're comparing this to other speakers under $50, stop looking! This is definitely what you should get.",

Which is right? Seems more like 4.2 from profile obtained via Apple Bluetooth Explorer. Speakers do not display battery level despite other devices such as PowerBeats 3 displaying theirs. I know this is a lower priced SKU as far as Bluetooth speakers go but this is a glaring fault. How am I going to know when I should start charging it again, other than some annoying low battery beep?",

I grin every time I play this because it is amazing that a company can make a speaker of this sound quality for <$40. New low budget king for me, and one of my favorite of 18 Bluetooth speakers.",

The only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is that my first one broke after 9 months. I\u2019ll post an update after I\u2019ve had it for awhile to see if it holds up. Good sound in the shower. Original Review: The sounds is good and the battery life is decent, while it lasted. I primarily used it in the shower. Worked well for 9 months and then it stopped working and wouldn\u2019t charge. Disappointed that it didn\u2019t last. Think of this speaker as temporary and a throw away.",

There's a slight push to the midrange, which makes vocals sound especially present, and when we listen to jazz, you can totally hear (if not feel, obviously) the bass players. Most of the rest of my kit is of the insufferable audiophile nerd variety, but this little guy punches way above his weight, and the price is beyond right. High fidelity on a busy city street is besides the point, but this allows us to enjoy our music with surprising clarity while not annoying the neighbors. Bravo!",

When input resumes it does not start up quickly enough, which causes interruption of playback, particularly while listening to human speech. Because of this behavior, this Bluetooth speaker was useless for listening to a podcast. Also, without audio input it shuts down completely after only a short while, forcing me to repetitively turn it back on. The only good thing about this product is the sound quality. It is very good, the best I've heard from a small speaker. It would serve well for listening to music that does not have silent moments.",
