They arrived very quickly, the packaging and product finish, is excellent, and so now to the performance.. Making allowance for my age,and natural hearing wear and tear, I was still surprised just how much detail I had slowly lost over the years, When playing music that I was very familiar with ( which is always a good idea) it was really nice to hear the full range of the spectrum again. Highly recommended. P G Croft.",

Ive given up on wireless headphones as the charge never lasts long enough so i thought id give these a go as the reviews were pretty good and they haven't disappointed so far! For a start they don't fall off my head when I'm moving around, and the sound quality is really very good. Noise leakage happens, but isn't terrible. Obviously there are going to be better ones out there but i actually prefer these to the last pair of Bose that I had. They are nicely padded and are easy to fold up if needed.",

I have a hearing impaired relative who needs the crispest sound and she felt they were the best tried so far (I ordered her a second set). The headphones look robust but might be a bit bulky for some people and not best for travelling light. I think they are more a professional product design. They are comfortable to wear unless they are put on the wrong way round in which case they pinch the ears somewhat - check that the ear pieces twist inwards to the front before putting on.",

No distortion of sound and reasonably loud. These are quite comfy headphones to wear, I forget they are on. Compared to Beats which feel like an ear corset, the OneOdio feels like an ear glove (comfy instead of squeezing). The design is on the larger side. Slightly dented box but did not affect quality of the product. I am yet to test the Shareport feature.",

Bass hits the middle of your head on these, in fact the sound range and quality out of these is only a degree below being a visual experience. Percussive bass is clean and sharp. High end frequencies are really well supported. Aesthetically they do the trick, they look great and if I'm a judge of engineering quality (I am, it's my job) they are built to last.

For the price I\u2019d recommend it but not if you are looking for a noise cancelling product.",

Unfortunately not even a year later (as of today) the right headphone has somewhat lost tension to keep the headphone close to my ear so now instead of a good noise cancellation and ability to focus on music and the drums im playing i cant do this anymore as there is a gap under my right ear lobe which lets in all unwanted noise and renders them useless now. Sad to write this as these were my favourite by far.. Also 3 star for comfort based on this happening. Overall good equipment",

They are compact because of foldable parts, the ends swivel, so just need to get used to that.

I needed some earphones that will produce the music as it was supposed to. The Bass is good to excellent. You can even hear in the background the other instruments. Very comfortable & light. There is also the additional socket for another person to listen at the same time. Only 'downside' is there is no separate volume adjustment button on the headphones, but that is just me being 'picky' as I had one on my previous set. It is good value & you will not be disappointed as it is quite stylish too.",

Everything the user needs is provided, including -quite generously- a handy carrying bag and a competitive warranty. My music sounds great, background noise is blocked out and I can rest assured the item is under warranty. Highly recommend.",
