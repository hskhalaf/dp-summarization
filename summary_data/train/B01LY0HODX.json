On low it uses 32 watts, over eight hours that is 256 watts. On medium it uses 52 watts or 416 watts over eight hours and on high 72 watts or over eight hours 576 watts. So you will need the appropriate power source that can handle that many watts. You will need to use this with another blanket or sleeping bag to help keep the heat in. It's not a bad item and heats up quickly, just wish it was bigger....but that would require more power!!!",
