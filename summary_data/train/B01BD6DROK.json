After consulting the internet, I found a work around to get it going again, it involves taking out the tape cartridge and turning the take up spindle by hand about 6 revolutions. This does not solve the problem, just gets it working after a jam. Didn\u2019t return it because I am able to get it working and the price was low enough. Would not purchase this again.",

I loaded the black first and tried several times to print labels but they kept coming out blank every time. So I popped it out and loaded the blue cartridge which works fine. So I've got 1 faulty cartridge. As for the blue, the print quality is very nice however appears to be fading well ahead of running out of tape. So overall I would say great machine but the print cartridges need some improvement.",

Now I\u2019m stuck with this non-functioning product and label cartridges I can\u2019t use. Terrible. Horrible return policy on a horrible product!",

The label cartridge and printing is the same quality as a Brother and the maker is very easy to use. I highly recommend buying the power cord since this label maker uses 8 batteries.",

It was a pain to load, and then it occasionally jams or simply just prints crooked or on top of itself. In regards to the feedback that it doesn't waste a lot of white space, I agree and that's not my complaint. It's kind of like the printer in \"Office Space\" in that it's a little finicky on its printing. I also find that the tape doesn't adhere well to handles on Sterlite bins. I didn't take a star off for that, but just a note on functionality or lack thereof.",

The only drawback is, if you want to ;print just one, it does not feed the printed label out far enough to cut it off without the loss of about 3/4\" of blank stock. It would nave been nice if it actually feeds out to the end of the printed section, but it does not. It has to be pulled out.",
