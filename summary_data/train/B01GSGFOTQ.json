I think it\u2019s perhaps a unisex model and that\u2019s why, but if you have narrow feet, this probably wouldn\u2019t be the best option for you.",

But when I get ready to step out of the shower I just point my toe down and shake my foot to empty each shoe of most of the water. I highly recommend these shower sandals !!",
