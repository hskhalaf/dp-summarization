A soon as I could think around my concussion flung my self around the car to see how my baby was. Not. A Scratch. On Her. Seriously, she was briefly startled by the crash. That was it. This was confirmed by both the ER and her pediatrician. You are supposed to replace your car seat after a crash. I got this exact same model again.",

We've been using this for about a month and it remains very stable and has not been loosened over time. It is also easy to install in the Jogger stroller which also uses the Click Connect system.

We also had a jogging stroller that worked with the Click Connect system; this seat fit just fine.
