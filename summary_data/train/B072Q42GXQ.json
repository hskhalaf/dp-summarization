They're very easy to accidentally push in -The power cables should use a 90 degree style plug in to lessen the stress -The power cables are far too short. They don't reach the ground when fully extended -The power cable brick does not fit well in the case",

The carrying cases are nicely padded to keep everything safe. The stands that come with the lights are not terribly sturdy but work perfectly well for what I'm using them for.

I recommend them for anyone needing lights for upping their photography game. 1 light can be sufficient light, but two provides nice spread of the light and avoids shadowy areas. The color temperature control is a nice feature, but I have only used these lights with both white and yellowish LEDs on full power.",
