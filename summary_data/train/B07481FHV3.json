I got it very fast so that is definitely a plus! There was a loose string on the first letter (in picture) but I have not had any problems with that yet. The orange is more vibrant than the pictures show! I did have to punch another hole into it so it would fit my dog properly, but there was enough space for me to do so without getting close to the letters.",

We have ordered another one for our lab and his strap has the leather grain going the correct way for tensile strength.
