I don't like the design of the tip at all. It's thick and just a weird shape overall. I wouldn't purchase this again and I recommend using some coconut oil and a frida baby gas passer instead. That or a little prune juice and water mix in a baby bottle. Don't recommend this",

Use lying down only! I made the mistake of trying to use it on my toddler while he was standing up and it dripped everywhere. Also wish the tip was softer or more rounded?
