      "text": "I used to be one of those guys that carried a Canon MkII. I got tired of lugging all that gear around so I decided that I would try the Sony RX1. What a revelation. Build quality is exemplary, photo quality is excellent, as are control placement and customizability. The Zeiss lens is truly excellent, and having a full-frame 24MP camera that can fit in a coat pocket and go almost anywhere without being an encumbrance makes this camera greatly appealing. One can always find quibbles in any piece of equipment, but the RX1 is more operationally all-of-a-piece and desirable than just about any recent camera in my experience. Highly recommended from an enthusiasts perspective.",

At the end of the day, the best camera is the one you have with you. I would carry my RX1 in places where I could never carry my D9000 + Sigma Art 35mm lens. Some may ask themselves if it is worth the money? My response, good pictures are intended to last a lifetime. The rest (price, AF, HD, zoom, etc.) are secondary. So get a camera that has the golden equation: Portability X picture quality = Best camera.",

Sensitivity selectable up to ISO 25600. (Recommended for still subjects.) \n\nHigh speed Auto Focus\nFocus fast with high speed AF. To improve focusing speed and sensitivity, the Exmor\u00ae CMOS sensor uses its rapid throughput to deliver high-quality image signals to the camera's BIONZ\u00ae processor, which provides intelligent response data to a new high speed actuator motor in the lens. The result is fast, DSLR-like focusing speeds even in low light. \n\nFull frame burst shooting\nHigh speed continuous shooting at up to 5 frames per second (fps) is made possible by the BIONZ\u00ae processor and 24 megapixel sensor. \n\nThree control lens rings\nFull manual operation is intuitive on the RX1. Users can keep their eyes on the subject and concentrate on the composition while comfortably adjusting the dedicated aperture, focusing, and macro switching rings. Conveniently placed dials\nQuick access to conveniently placed exposure compensation and focus mode dials. \n\nQuick Navi \u2013 settings at a glance \nQuick Navi enhances direct control of your favorite functions. Pressing the Fn button activates Quick Navi, which allows the user to check camera settings at a glance and promptly change settings without having to search for dedicated menus. \n\nMemory recall \nMR (memory recall) mode can memorize up to three groups of the user's preferred settings. Settings include zoom magnification, white balance, exposure compensation, shutter speed, drive mode and metering modes. This enables quick switching of settings at the right moment. \n\nNine aperture blades\nNine aperture blades form a nearly perfect circle throughout the normally used aperture range of F2 to F22, resulting in background defocusing that is smooth and genuinely beautiful. \n\nExpandable with multi interface shoe\nThe multi interface shoe allows easy connection with wide-ranging accessories expanding the range of photographic expression. Available accessories include a powerful external flash unit, electronic viewfinder.\n\n3\" Xtra Fine LCD\u2122 Display\nThe 3\" (1,229k dots) Xtra Fine LCD\u2122 Display makes it easy to scroll through menus and preview live Picture Effects. WhiteMagic\u2122 technology increases visibility in bright daylight. The large display delivers brilliant-quality still images and movies while enabling easy \nfocusing operation. \n\nAuto HDR mode\nCaptures more scene dynamic range than a single exposure can handle\u2014and more range than photo film. Combines the best highlight detail from one shot, the best mid-tones from a second and the best shadow detail from a third for one incredible shot (up to 6 EV stops), all in a split second. (Recommended for still subjects.) \n\nDual-aspect ratio recording\nfor still images\nCapture still images in either 3:2 or 16:9 aspect ratio. This provides the freedom to choose a ratio that matches the scene or the specific \nshooting purpose. \n\nBuilt in pop up flash\nEnjoy the convenience of flash photography everywhere you go. Guide number is approximately 6. Choose from Auto, Slow Sync, Rear Sync, Fill-flash and Flash Off modes.\n\nCapture JPEG files, RAW files, or both\nThe DSC-RX1 saves pictures as compact JPEG files and/or ultra-high quality RAW files. RAW files save images prior to de-mosaicing, white balance, sharpness and color enhancement. This retains maximum latitude for enhancing the image on your PC. Three focusing modes \nThis camera has one Autofocus mode, Single-shot AF (AF). It also has Manual Focus (MF) for manual focusing freedom, and Direct Manual Focus (DMF), that first uses autofocusing to focus on the subject, and then allows fast and easy switching to manual focusing for even more precise adjustment. \n\nDigital level gauge\nDigital level gauge to allow easier leveling \nof the camera.\n\nMF assist and peaking\nManual focus becomes much easier because peaking highlights the edges that are in focus in your choice of three colors (white, red, or yellow). This is especially helpful during macro or portrait photography where your focus setting can make or break your shot. \n\nCreative Style settings\nControl how the camera processes your images with 15 finishing styles: Standard, Vivid, Neutral, Clear, Deep, Light, Twilight, Night View, Autumn Leaves, B&W, Sepia, Sunset, Portrait and Landscape. You can even fine-tune contrast, saturation, and sharpness to your \npersonal taste.\n\nPicture Effect mode\nRealize your creative potential with Picture Effect, a fun and simple way to convert ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Effects are Soft Focus, Posterization, Retro Photo, High Contrast Monochrome, Rich-tone Monochrome, Miniature, Soft High-key, Toy Camera, Pop Color, Partial Color, Watercolor Painting, HDR Painting, and Illustration. \n\nMF assist and peaking \nManual focus becomes much easier because peaking highlights the edges that are in focus in your choice of three colors (white, red, or yellow).

Can prioritize children or adults. \n\nAuto portrait framing \nSimply photograph a person and Auto Portrait Framing will save an additional, optimally framed image in portrait or landscape orientation.
