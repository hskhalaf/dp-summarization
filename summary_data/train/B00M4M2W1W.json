I love Costco wipes, but they are a little too big/too thick. These are the perfect amount of dampness and thickness, and smell great.

This clearly varies with each family as some of the other brands that caused problems for our kids do not do so with friends' kids... but you never know. Give them a try if you're on the fence. I'd say the ONLY thing I don't really like is that the wipes don't really separate well from each other as you pull them out. It's a minor annoyance that I usually get around by pulling out what I need prior to a diaper change.",

      "text": "I was very excited to receive this order so quickly and more excited that it was exactly like it was described. At times our two beautiful Schnauzers chew on their paws. Upon reading about this I found they might have a slight allergy to our grass. So every night when I go outside with them and we come back in, I wipe off their paws with these wonderful wipes. The wipes are large enough that I use one side for the female and one side for the male. Thanks for making such an excellent product!",

The wipes are not as moist as I would like, but I think it's just because I'm used to pampers and other big name brands being over saturated. Very cute packaging too! The bag of wipes had purple words all over it from \"cupcake, sunshine, bean, sugar\" just cute little words. The pop up tissue box like opening is very sure and reliable",

I like that these are also gentle enough to use to remove my eye makeup. They come out one by one, not bunched in with others like other brands that are hard to pull apart.",
