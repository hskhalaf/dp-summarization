All the metal of the backers is rubber coated, and it appears to be of pretty good quality. The weld position on the one bottom bracket was off a bit, but no big deal. The hardware they supply for drywall mounting is pretty cheap, but just use your own and you'll be fine. Good mount. I'll probably grab a couple more for future use.",

I'm sure they will work okay as they are pretty simple brackets, but the lack of care in packaging and inspection indicates other issues exist with this manufacturer. A little more care and attention to detail would have been nice. The time I set aside to install these now has to be sent hunting hardware.",
