The screw holding in the cover plate was a little tight, but with some muscle, was able to break it loose with the tools that came with the lock.",

      "text": "So I love this safety bar. The only small downside and I am not sure I can blame the mfg for this is that my steering wheel has a bump in the middle which rubs against the bar (I drive a BMW 5 btw) and that has caused some wear and tear on the steering wheel. Also, due to the bump, it can be difficult to change the wheels for the numbers as they also rub up against the center of the wheel column. So keeping that in mind, I would certainly recommend this product. Why carry another key right? Also, you can set you own easy to remember 5 digit code.",

I had purchased a more conventional wheel lock with 2 keys but could not buy any more keys (I tried, but it didn't work).
