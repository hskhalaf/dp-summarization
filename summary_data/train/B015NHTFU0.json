Easy to use button and easy to flip ends with! Doesn't burn hair and leaves it feeling soft. Also perfect size to reach hard to get pieces!",

I have wavy full hair, I\u2019ve been using ceramic straightest for years at 410 degrees and needed several pass throughs with the flat iron and having to wait til the next day to see if I missed any spots or for the frizz to come down notch Right after using this iron at 430 degrees I saw pretty impressive results with shiny hair that\u2019s soft to the touch and looks like naturally straight hair. It lays well and blows nicely in the breeze without frizzing. Instant results. I recommend using the glove and following with a round brush to help cool the hair down",

I could barely use it since my (fine & thin) hair gets caught in the edges of the end of the iron every time which hurts and pulls my hair out. This makes straightening or curling my hair with it nearly impossible without yanking out multiple strands of hair with each clamp down...not what I expected for the price. I'm sadly disappointed with my purchase. I just donated this straightener and went back to my cheap one, total waste of money :(",

One might be able to prevent this by clipping up any hair that isn't being targeted with the flat iron. However, if you're like me, you're in too much of a hurry to do this and just want to stick the iron in and flatten out any bumps. Whenever you do this, you get your hair pulled.",

When used properly, ie perpendicular to hair and not parallel to hair, there is no hair pulling or breakage. The key elements of proper flat iron straightening with this appliance are: proper preparation of hair with drying and brushing, perpendicular use, slow controlled movements, and not trying to do too large a section of hair each time. The arc shaped tip of this straightener should be used on short hair/bangs, while the body of the straightener should be used for the rest of the hair - ie medium and long length.",
