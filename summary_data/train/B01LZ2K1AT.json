They gave some incredibly strong sticky stuff to put inside the suction cups - HOWEVER - if you try to move it you no longer get that strong hold. So now I am stuck with a net that is always dropping all the toys into the tub because it doesn't stick anymore and I can't seem to find something else that works. It is also a pretty small hammock. Works well in size for a newborn with a few ducks and bath letters but I can't imagine it would hold much more than that.",

We live in a rented apartment so I believe our shower wall is one of those 'all in one' bath insert that goes over an old tub and shower; not porcelain, not tile..maybe textured fiberglass? At any rate, hopefully the adhesive doesnt leave a residue at removal.",

The whale design is perfect. We had bought a faucet protector from target before he was born that was a whale as well so it matches. It is also small enough that if an adult were to shower in the same bathroom it would not be in the way at all! Love it!",
