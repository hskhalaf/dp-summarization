So this 14 cup food processor can comfortably work with about 5 cups of food. If I had a 3 or 6 cup food processor I would need to run multiple batches. 2. Dishwasher safe: You can put everything except for the base (the part with the motor) in the dishwasher. 3. Power: Most food processors on Amazon are about 350 watts. This is a little over 700. That means it is powerful enough to knead 3-4 cups of sticky pizza dough in about 2-3 minutes.",

      "text": "I have many Cuisinart products and this is my second food processor. After 2 years, the metal stick on the pusher for the feed tube has broken off and is now a safety hazard. I have to insert the metal stick to engage the safety latch but now the machine will operate without the food pusher in place. When requesting a replacement, my warranty was void because I use the machine in my bed & breakfast though I would consider the use to be normal wear and tear. Very disappointed in the customer service as this seems like a design flaw since only a small piece of plastic is anchoring the metal stick.",

While I could get the attachments to make the KitchenAid do everything the Cuisinart 14-cup processor does, the cost would have been monumental. Can you whip up some egg whites with this? probably not. But for the bulk of my cooking and mixing, this appliance does it all. I used to have a small Cuisinart, that had a chute for grating cheese. Wish it had that. But I guess with the 14-cup bowl, they figure you don't need a chute for grating cheese. (You really need more than 14 cups of grated cheese?) Very happy with my purchase.",

This machine is way heavier than I expected and it is not even a die cast model. Very powerful, quiet, and starts/stops very quickly. As shown on ATK, the blades are close to the sides and bottom. This recipe had three uses and I didn't scape down the sides at all. If for no other reason, I would buy this one because the bowl is smooth with no creases. It took seconds to wash it out. Which is major because I will not put any processor pieces into a dishwasher.",

If it is basically the same as the old one, I will buy new plastic (the bucket is deteriorating) and give the old one to my brother. The base is still great. The new one arrived.

After daily use, my interior is as shiny as when I first bought it.  One thing though, I use bottled water.  I find that I don't get like scale on my pots, this kettle, my clothes iron or my drip coffeemaker.  I'm thinking that the reported white flecks in poured water could be that scale flaking off the inside surface. Distilled white vinegar can help eliminate limescale buildup.
