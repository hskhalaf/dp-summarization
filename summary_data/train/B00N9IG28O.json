Almost to the day, one year later, it broke, just stopped working. I have written the company asking to return it and get another one. and it's too late to return it to Amazon. Apparently, they only ;last about a year. Poor craftsmanship, poorly made. Save your self money and buy another brand. Thumbs down...",

Second, although it blends smooth, there will STILL be chunks of frozen fruit. Third, the blade screws on and it\u2019s easy to not have it tight enough and your liquid will leak out of the bottom.
