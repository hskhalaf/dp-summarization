I'll keep an eye on the two attachment bolts, as all the negative reviews seems to show those bolts loosening over time and coming apart. I'll update this if it fails on me or the torx bit breaks.

One added caveat is the multi function can be used for different application such as small work on telescopes due to the same size screws, bolts, hex head and straight slots. If major work is required on the bicycle then acquire the correct tools to work with. Good job Crankbrothers. Nice tool.",

The stems of the Allen keys are short but that goes naturally hand in hand with the size of the overall tool-set. It's also a plus that this comes in a smooth sheath of sorts. That way, if it shares space in your saddle pouch with your spare tubes, it won't puncture them by accident.",
