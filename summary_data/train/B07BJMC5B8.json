It\u2019s an everyday use palette, for subtle looks not so much glam.",

I always felt the dark was way too dark, even with all the blending in the world (I\u2019m a nc25). However, this pallets has more choices and variety and easily blends to a seamless contoured/highlight face. The price is excellent and well worth it. I would recommend it to those in the nc25 range. Anything above nc/nw35 and I think the palette would be too light. Sorry I don\u2019t have great pics with the Palette in use. However, I included one pic of me in \u201cnatural makeup\u201d and light for reference.",

A little bit goes a long way, so, you must be light handed when applying it. Easy to work with and blendable. I first purchased Med - Dark by mistake and colors are too warm / deep for me (still works on my skin tone /medium though); Light - Med is perfect for me. Recommended..!",
