The battery is fully charged, I enrolled the same finger in multiple profiles to overcome any scan issues. The mechanism itself is no longer releasing the door, which I find useless in a gun safe. For this amount of money, you shouldn't expect to run into problems in the first year. It's overpriced and unreliable.",

I purchased the safe as a replacement for another brand that houses my nightstand/bump in the night handgun (FNX 45 w/ TLR-H1). Unfortunately I cannot put the pistol in the stand and use the drawer as it is too tall. When pulling the Glock 19 from the stand it hits the drawer but still fits. If this safe was like 2\" taller it would be perfect for my needs. I would still absolutely recommend it. .",
