      "text": "This review is for AWFUL amazon home services. No show! I had called and emailed several times with no concrete service time (out of three I selected). Ultimately, they flaked today, two days before the scheduled time. If I had known weeks ago when I\u2019d purchased and received the product, I would have made an appointment with someone. Additionally most places don\u2019t install pre-purchased equipment. Now my house is cold in the dead of winter without help from Amazon. Awful!!! Still don\u2019t know how the Pioneer system works so I will mark 5 stars for them for now.",

    "description": "Size:Quad Split (4 Zone)Pioneer brand multi split heat pump system, complete set. System components include: one multi zone outdoor unit, matching multiple wall mount indoor units, piping and accessory kits and remote controllers. Pioneer multi split systems are available in 4 versions for 2, 3, 4 and 5 zones. They provide totally decentralized and independent zone control for perfect climate in each zone or room. Each zone can be individually and independently set to be on or off, or to run with different temperature settings (only exception is that system can not run both heating and cooling modes simultaneously for different zones). each indoor unit can be chosen from 3 different capacities 9, 12 and 18000 BTU, to match the zone loads. Indoor units automatically adjust their capacities up and down in real time and as needed to match the zone's cooling or heating loads. The outdoor unit will also adjust its total output based on the total demand it receives from all simultaneously running indoor units in real time. This function results in significant energy savings. Systems use single point power entry to the outdoor unit only and indoor units receive their power from the outdoor unit. Multi split systems and complex systems to install for an individual without proper tools and training. Installation of such systems must be performed or supervised by a capable professional. Systems can be customized for the indoor unit Capacity combination as well as the pipe kit lengths for each zone. The standard price includes the system matched 12, 000 BTU wall mounted indoor units and 16 foot pipe kits.
