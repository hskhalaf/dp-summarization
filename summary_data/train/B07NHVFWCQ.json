One draw back is that the swirling/bouncing motion causes sleeves and pant legs to twist and kind of knot together. In order to avoid excess wrinkling, I had to hit \u201cpause\u201d before the final spin and separate the twists and knots. It is quiet, does not splash or leak. The instructions are poorly translated and a bit difficult to follow. Also, it has no casters and weighs 70 lbs, so you DEFINITELY need a dolly to move it.",

      "text": "Panda PAN56MGP3 Portable Washer Machine operates efficiently at cleaning clothes using a variety of water levels and multiple washing settings. The most crucial step is connecting the quick-release nozzle to the faucet which provides a secure attachement for the water intake hose to the faucet. Once the washing maching is properly connected to the water source, easy programming requires you to simply input water level settings, washing operations, and wash cycle durations. The variety of settings enables you to customize each wash load cycle. Solidly built unit gets the job done in a no-fuss fashion. The Panda PAN56MGP3 is a great choice for a portable washing machine.",

Other than the noise, it's a great little machine. I can fit 4-5 bath towels or do a day's worth of laundry for my family of three. You can change the water levels to save water if you have smaller loads and there is a little lint catcher inside to help catch fuzz etc. It only uses cold water.",

Also, the drain pump is held to the frame of the washer by a small plastic piece. Please inspect the hose and the water pump. These 2 parts are the weakest part of the washer unit.",

It washes clothes very well, easy to use, and I appreciated the multiple cycle options. I did have to purchase some plumbing adapters to fit my sink, but that was a minimal expense.

My towels, sheets and t-shirts come out with loose threads, pulls etc. I did not even try to wash anything delicate. 3. The hose got broken after 1 month of usage...

I don't know the issues. I wash like 10 light cloths max and leave good amount of space for good rinse.",
