Was pleasantly surprised with the weight of this bench and demensions were correct as given in advertisement . I bought strictly for use on flat bench as I found my adjustable bench to be just a tad wobbly and sought more support when lifting heavier weights . This bench so far appears to be one of the few bargains that actually has a quality build . Pleased !",

      "text": "Really solid bench. My weight + weights = 400 lbs, and this is rock solid - it is listed at 1,000lbs and I believe it. No regrets, would definitely buy again. This bench pad is 12\" wide. I'm 6' tall and this bench is as narrow as I would want to go for my size. I mention this because many of the other benches on Amazon are narrower... several on Amazon are only 10\" wide. Unless you are fairly thin across the shoulders, I don't think you want to go narrower than this 12\" model. Assembly was easy and everything went together well. I am very happy with this purchase, just what I wanted for my home weightlifting and exercise.",

Instructions were clear, parts were well packaged, and we were able to put it together quickly with the included tool and an additional pair of pliers. It would have gone a little faster with a socket wrench but did not have the socket size required. The bench is very well constructed..... no rough edges or mismatched parts or pieces. The padding is firm and well constructed the cover has a nice feel and is not slippery. I looked at several benches at local fitness stores that started at $100 higher and this compares favorably. Length and width, as well as construction make it sturdy and stable. We are anticipating many years of daily use.",

Assembly was quick and easy, and adjusting it to be level on our floor was a simple process of lightly unscrewing the bolts, getting it sturdy, and then retightening them.

I looked closer at the instructions and it clearly says to NOT tighten the bolts until you've placed it the bench where you want to use it. The proper order seems to be to tighten the soft part to soft top to the base. Then tighten the soft-part/Base to the uprights. Lastly, tighten the two parts that sit flush to the floor. Doing it in that order resulted in my bench being rock stable. It definitely feels like something you'd expect to find in a professional gym.",

One drawback: Unless you are particularly long legged or flat bottomed, it will be hard to get into a full, flat footed bench position on this bench. It must be taller than the standard issue bench in commercial gyms, as I cannot comfortably get my heels on the ground when benching, and I'm 5' 10 1/2\" and 245# with a 32\" inseam. So unless you are skinny and/or leggy and/or tall, you may need a shorter bench. I nonetheless give it a 5 because it is so solid and well priced.",

The fabric is soft but has enough utility where it seems it will hold together for a long time. Have not had any issues with it so far. Grips on the bottom so it does not slide on my platform. This is a great product and I highly recommend.",

Solidly built, the padding is comfortable enough without compressing to nothing, the width is perfect for dumbbell work and the length is more than adequate. The bench height is perfect for us guys.

I put a 45LB weight plate at each end of the bench and then tighten up the bolts. I used the bench for some heavy bench presses once assembled and it\u2019s fantastic. Highly recommend this bench!",

      "text": "Much like the PR 1050 I ordered from Rep, this came packaged very nicely and assembled easily, and as a bonus it arrived in 2 days. Instructions were far better this time. Bench feels solid and comfortable. Im a larger fella, 6 foot 230, and it accomodates my frame very well. Had well over 500 total on it, i dont see this failing with any weight i can ever hope to put on it.",
