I mean, I spent like 15 mins trying to remove the little fuzz balls from some leggings, and it really just did a poor job. I made sure it was completely charged, and it was extremely disappointing. It only removes about half of what I would expect it would. It seems like the blades just aren't close enough to the guard, and they aren't adjustable.",

The way the switch is located, you can turn it on (accidentally) quite easily when trying to remove the fuzz ball collector after use. If you turn it on accidentally doing so, you can shave your own hand. The fuzz ball collector is very difficult to remove. I'm not sure I would buy this again knowing these things- you shouldn't have to think too much when using a fabric shaver.",
