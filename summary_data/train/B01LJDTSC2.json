The side bars do press a bit on anyone with a wide bottom but again not a deal breaker since we don't spend hours at the dinner table. Over all they appear to be sturdy. Will update if any changes.",

We ordered 2 sets of 4 of the black chairs. They have a nice matte finish with a hint of sheen. I saw some reviews saying they arrived with dents, but all 8 of ours arrived perfectly.

The first brand as comparison, not only came assembled but welded together creating a much sturdier, stronger chair.

We put sliders on the bottom to protect our hardwood floors. I would highly recommend these chairs. The only thing I would recommend is when putting them together, have someone help you hold the back of the chair up as you screw it on. I tried by myself and put a couple knicks on the chair. My husband heard my yells and came to the rescue to help, lol. We will be buying the bar stool types of these when our island is built.",

They are on the smaller side, so be aware before you buy, more like bistro chairs.Also be careful when you put together ,as the parts can scratch the paint easily ,if you aren\u2019t careful. They are metal, so not the most comfortable chair for everyone. We personally find them very comfy and they fit great for our patio table. Would highly recommend.",

I am going to repaint them and then clear coat them since I will be pretty irritated every time I look at them and see the scratches. Also the screws barely match the chair. You get what you pay for, I guess. Not happy but learned to not buy furniture online ever again.",
