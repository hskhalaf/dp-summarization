Fits nicely in the center of my new 55 gal tank. Which is still a work in progress. Besides this, I ordered a set of moss balls by the same company. All green and looks nice. I was going to order more Java Ferns but the price hiked to $8. So I waited for the price to come back down and tonight I see it back to $6.99. So I purchased 2 more Java Ferns and another set of moss balls. I do recommend this to anyone.",

What's worse is that they actually want me to ship it back to get a refund? That's not right.",
