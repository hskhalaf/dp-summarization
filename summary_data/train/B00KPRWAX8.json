The newer CPUs are only maybe 15% faster for 1-4 thread workloads, which makes this CPU all the more impressive. The only drawback I can think of is that Intel's overclocking software (on Windows) seems to cause instability, although regular overclocking through BIOS seemed OK. Definitely better than AMD, which is 95% marketing hype and 5% product.",

They should overclock to ~4.5ghz with air cooling(use a tower cooler, not the stock cooler. Stock heatsink is small.)",

I originally had a corsair single fan liquid cooler that kept my i5-4670 very cool but when swapped out for the i7-4790k I was seeing 80c under load so I decided an upgrade was in order.",

      "text": "Very speedy chip that served as a nice drop-in replacement for an i5 in one of my systems. It handles everything I throw at it with relative ease, and frankly it's hard to find any fault with it. I haven't overclocked it yet, but at 4.0GHz stock/4.4GHz turbo, I'm not exactly compelled to do so. That said, the stock cooler does run a bit noisy during high intensity workloads, so I'm planning to replace it with an aftermarket cooler soon.",

Temps stay nice and cool with Noctua cooler, and CPU is extremely stable. This thing is a powerhouse. Used to have the 3570K and I would get stream stutter due to overworking the CPU. Same game, same streaming settings, doesn't even get close to 70% CPU usage. Definitely recommend.",

There was literally NO packing material in the box to secure the CPU and keep it from being rocked around in the box. Luckily it seems there was no damage to the CPU itself.",
