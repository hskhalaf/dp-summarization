I'd say the sound quality is a tad, and I mean just a tad, lesser than the MA750i wired, which I think are just about perfect in sound. In other words, the MA650 wireless sounds great. Update: Unit failed before a year was up, and RHA informed me that I was not covered by a their three year warranty even though it clearly states on my invoice that the unit is covered. RHA claims warranty does not apply to a new item bought from a third-party Amazon seller.",

I give it 4 stars because of the way the leads to the buds kinda flap around a bit next to your cheeks. But this is not a deal breaker for me. I have yet to go to the gym to test them out but very much hoping they work well in that environment and block out the very bad music played at my gym. Will give further updates in a week or two.",

      "text": "I purchase this Bluetooth headset April 13th and it is June 15 and it is currently cutting out so as I am speaking in the microphone or something cuts out so whoever I'm speaking to cannot hear me . And I have to disconnect it and reconnect it don't know if it's just a fluke but that is just experience that I'm having the sound quality is good it could use a little bit more Bass the microphone on a windy day is bad wish it had wind protection I bought this headset just to make phone calls and sometimes listen to music and it has disappointed me in those two aspects",

Waaaay too niche of a device to be worrying about buying specialty cables. VERY annoying. Also SHIPPING WAS VERY SLOW. Took forever to arrive",

      "text": "This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones, and I'm very happy with my purchase. the headphones are well constructed, provide excellent sound quality, are comfortable and the foam tips are decent for noise cancelling. I'm able to use these all-day for work calls, and then to listen to music while working out in the evening. The drawstring bag is convenient for storing the charging cord, the headphones and extra tips. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for good quality wireless headphones with strong battery life.",

It\u2019s not they are bad in any way, they are just not as advertised.. I really liked the form and style but the sound is lacking. It\u2019s missing depth in sound quality. Not much bass. And because they are not low latency, YouTube audio is not in sync with the video. I will keep searching. Until then I\u2019m going back to my $10 wired buds which sound much better.",
