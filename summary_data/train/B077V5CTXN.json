There is a lot of kick up in the pan (like with ABH shadows), but I don't see any fallout on my face when applying to my eyelids. I wore this yesterday (ofc) and today decided to do the same look, but with the ABH MR Palette, and this Wet N' Wild palette has out performed the ABH palette by far. The WNW shadows lasted longer and were more vibrant in color, didn't crease as much or fade. Will definitely be buying back up of this palette.",

There is a healthy amount of fallout. The bigger pans of transition shades is nice. It is an affordable palette, and would probably work well for someone new to make up to experiment with.",

      "text": "It's fine. There is a lot of pigment when you first apply, only to try to blend it out and it kinda... goes away. I love the color scheme though, it's all in the same kind of range, and not colors that wouldn't work together, or are too bold. The size is nice, and they give you a good amount of product for the price. The color is a bit light then i had expected, but I really don't mind. This product does not cause any irritation to my combination skin. Thanks!",
