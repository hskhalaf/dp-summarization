It spits the balls back at a very nice pace so that if you are working with two balls you have just enough time to set up and shoot again before the next one gets to you. My son has a bad attitude in the video because his dad was trying to give some constructive criticism a minute earlier and that did not go well. If my son shoots with this thing regularly there\u2019s very good odds he will improve his accuracy, and that\u2019s the whole point so, all in all, I am very happy with this product. A little difficult to put together but not rocket science either. The kid really likes it.",
