Luckily, I had bought some heavy duty metal spinner holders as well and they worked together great. However, after having this flag six months in (admittedly very windy Kansas), the plastic connections between the metal pole have worn out and the pole fell apart. For the price that I paid, this is unacceptable and not worth the price. While in concept it works extremely well, the product does not last. Quite disappointed and overall, quality is just not up to par for the price.",

This pole did function better and almost never tangled itself up, but the clips both broke with the winds that came last week. The lack of durability is very disappointing and I would recommend to buy a different pole.",

It is completely unintuitive if your grommets on the flag are large (which most are) and you essentially have to rig it work. I don't have any twist ties so I am holding it in place with a zip tie. If I want to change out the flag I will cut the zip tie and replace it. A larger screw head or washers would accomodate all grommet sizes, but no, they don't include that, you have to mess with emailing them and getting some sent back.

They replied right away, saying they would send out another set of rings and screws. Meanwhile, I used the clip at the top of the pole for the upper flag grommet. For the bottom grommet I used the ring and screw. Works Great! The ball on the end is plastic chrome, maybe aluminum would have been better. Other than that, very pleased with the pole and the manufacturer as well.",

This flagpole solves that problem nicely, The top half of the pole rotates with respect to the bottom half, so the flag always hangs straight down. There is only one minor drawback. If you want to fly your flag at half-staff, the bottom of the flag has to attach to the fixed part of the pole. This arrangement does allow the flag to twist around the flagpole. As long as you don\u2019t fly the flag at half-staff, however, this pole performs great.",
