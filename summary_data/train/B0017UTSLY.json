Capacious interior, temp settings that correlate to actual wok temp, dial vivid enough that I can read it despite being blind in one eye. Glass lid is a major plus for things you want to simmer, like soups or slow-cook items. One of the most versatile tools in my kitchen, and great for frying things like tempura.

      "text": "Pros: Medium weight pan, quickly responsive to temperature setting, nice and stable- rubber on bottom of feet prevents sliding (unlike other presto products I own), easy to clean. Cons: Pan is somewhat shallow. The first time used the pan burned but food did not sear and brown up nicely- hoping as the pan gets seasoned this will change. Creates smoke and fine grease aerosol, will try peanut oil next time as it withstands higher temperatures without burning. Better for cooking small amounts of food at a time.",

      "text": "yes, I bought this because I wanted the surface area and temperature control for making donuts. Years ago, I used my westbend wok for this, but have worn out two. Been looking for a good wok for several years.Because of good reviews, decent price and satisfaction with my Presto pressure cooker, I bought this to use for holiday guests. WOW. Donuts were perfect and clean up easy. Then I made stir fry two nights (following included directions) Again, some of the best cooking raves I've ever gotten and simple to wash.",

I hope I never Have to get another wok again. It cooks really well too. It gets very hot and cooks quickly. If you use frozen stir -fry veggies let them get room temp first or it cools it down too much.",

You can use any utensil in there, scrub out the bottom of the pan, crank up the heat as high as you want, and toss it in the dish washer. All without having to worry about chipping a non stick surface or accidentally eating some of the paint chips in every meal. Fair warning though, you will need a lot more oil than you are used to. And you'll have to keep stirring more often.",
