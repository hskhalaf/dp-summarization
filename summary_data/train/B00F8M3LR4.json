      "text": "The call is of better construction than my previous one. It still requires more blow than I'd like for sound to start, you have to then back-off the blow to get the sound to lower for most buck calls. There is no mount for the lanyard on the call and a metal bracket on the line itself which makes it impossible to just rig the line around the call somewhere. You'll have to figure out your own solution if you want to wear it around your neck.",

Stopped them, they showed interest, but I think they knew I was there and were not coming any closer. These were the only deer I could actually see this season when using the call.",

For the money I would expect it to last longer than that. Over all the sound and convenience of the call is good. I am not abusive to my tools and equipment just so you know. I don't throw stuff around and bang it up.",

      "text": "It is a very good game call, but has one massive problem: if you take it apart to clean it or look at it, the o-ring falls out. However, Illusion Game Call Systems provides a new reed and o-ring on their website for free, just $0.99 shipping. I presume they have had a lot of problems with this and came up with this solution, which I think is an excellent one. It's faster to buy O-rings from a store, but usually you have to buy a pack to find the right size and it will cost you more than $0.99.",
