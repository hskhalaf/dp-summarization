The mac swings back and forth unstable if you don't have anything in the bag to support it. Very disappointing.",

He's super strong, but super thin and he was walking bent over from the weight of the backpack. He just isn't heavy enough to counterbalance a loaded backpack. We told his teachers this and didn't have any problem from the school. His last backpack was also Jansport and still looks brand new. I had Jansport backpacks in college.

There are plenty of handy pockets. I just wish there was a strap to condense the backpack if the extra room wasn't needed yet but that extra room doesn't affect the function of the backpack. So far so good!",

I use it for work as I work between 2 places and need to carry things that I use in my office and may need in clinic. The only reason why I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars was that there is only place for a water bottle. I would be very nice if it had 2.",
