The outside material seems pretty good, so far the balls have withstood being thrown into brick walls, bleachers, and a gym floor. The set came with an over-sized carry bag which also held my soccer ball and foot ball too.",

    "description": "Here's why kids and adults love the sting free surface! The GoSports Elephant Skin Dodgeball (not real elephant skin) uses incredible play and safety technology to remove the \"sting\" you typically get with a regular dodgeball and let's everyone join on the fun. Virtually every problem is solved with this set when it comes to dodgeball: the durable material holds up, the smaller size is perfect so kids can play too, and the softness of this set means no one gets hurt! Thanks to the incredibly durable rubber (\"elephant skin\") exterior these dodgeballs also hold up against extended use by kids and adults both indoors and outdoors meaning you get the best bang for your buck. That's what makes the GoSports Elephant Skin Dodgeball set so popular among schools, camps, parents, and just about everyone! Plus this set includes a bonus mesh carrying bag for easy storage.",
