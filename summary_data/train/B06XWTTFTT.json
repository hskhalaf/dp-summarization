Optimus Prime is a bit more complicated, but the instructions are very clear and made it easier to go through the motions. Articulation is great on both, colors are fantastic shades of red and blue with small hints of color, and it's just a nice tribute to Optimus Prime with two very different toys representing two very different points in his story.",

It's a little sturdy and presents balance problems but the transformation is very neat. The Orion Pax figure is great, nice poseability, vibrant colors and the transformation is interesting but not difficult. The only to make this figure better would be by not making it a headmaster, other than that is perfect.",

The Optimus Prime action figure is one of the most detailed and difficult to transform of any Transformers figure that I have. The colors look amazing. The Orion Pax figure is much easier to transform and belongs with the Titans Return line, being a repaint of the Sergeant Kup figure. I would not get this box set for a younger fan. These are really for the bigger kids and the grown kids.",
