I thought the first one I got was a return that had been bouncing around in somebodies toolbox for a while so I returned it myself, but the next one had the same issue. Just a simple protective film over the display would fix the issue!",

Second, you have to hold it on for a second or two to get a reading. Third, even if you hold it on for a slow three count, and make sure you can't hear any air leak, you might do it three times and you'll get three different pressures. Almost gave it two stars because the light is useful to check your tires in the dark. Too bad it is such a pain to use and gives random pressures.",
