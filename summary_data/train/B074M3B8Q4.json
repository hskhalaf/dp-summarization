I usually finish cleaning 3 bedrooms and a living room, with the battery indicating light still in the middle so that\u2019s good too. I also use the handheld vacuum to clean my car.

I love that it has a light (my old one didn't have that feature). In fact, I recently broke a glass candle holder which splintered all over my floor. So I whipped out my Roomie and put it to a real test as I wanted to make sure every tiny piece was picked up and it did it! Using the vac first and then the handheld. I was actually surprised at how well it got everything! Cleaning it is also incredibly straightforward and easy. I love it!",

Just know going in that you are not going to be pulling out sheep wool from a thick rug with this thing, it has its limitations and cannot be the only vac in a house but nice secondary vac.",

Fast forward 9 months later and the push button tabs that hold the suction cup around the filter is sticking. Now everytime you take the handheld out the whole thing falls apart and dirt goes every where. Time to trash this one.",

Suction is unbelievable, no assembly required, you plug it in, it charges and the charge will last for about 30 to 40 minutes easily. Don\u2019t even bother looking for anything else.
