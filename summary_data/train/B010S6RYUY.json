No one notices any slowdown from being on the bridge vs being on the main router either which is nice.",

Avoid, avoid, avoid. UPDATE: Has not been supported by TP LInk since 2017. They gave up on it. I began having connectivity issues after a few days. After updating the firmware, my password no longer worked. So I had to perform a factory reset. This unit is still losing the 5ghz network every few days. If I unplug it and plug it back in, it finds the network again and lasts another day or two. So be prepared to have to keep resetting it, as others have noted.",

My house is only one third that area and the router failed to provide an adequate signal to the bedrooms. That's why I purchased the TP-Link AC-1900. The set-up was as easy as pushing two buttons. I placed it half-way between the router and the bedrooms, where the Wi-Fi signal is now at its max. The other amazing thing is that all clients are all on the same network. Other extenders would create a secondary network which would preclude sharing of the primary network's resources.",
