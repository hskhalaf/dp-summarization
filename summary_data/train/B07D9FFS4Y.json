My toes reach the edge of the sandals (with a few millimeters to spare). I'm glad I did not go for a size 7 because I have a feeling that it would have been too long. I think one of its best qualities is that the back strap is adjustable; this allows people with different ankle sizes to securely and comfortably wear the sandal. I took off one star because the footbed/soles are harder and not as comfortable as other Addidas shoes (e.g., Adilette Comfort Slides). However, overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.",

The ridge that falls between your toes and the ball of your foot on the right shoe doesn\u2019t quite hit in the perfect spot but I think that is more my foot than the shoe.

There is a little bit of rubbing on the right shoe also. On the inside under my ankle. The edge of the strap where the stitching is rubs a bit rough but I\u2019m hoping it will fade as they get broken in.",
