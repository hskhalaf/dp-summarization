He was the extremely impressed by the precision of the engineering and how beautifully the various parts fit together. The finish is excellent as well.

I have an Ikea Malm bedframe (which is actually slightly wider than 60\") and the slats were just short enough in width that it caused the slats to slip off one side of the bed frame if weight/force was applied to one side of bed. I went to Home Depot and bought 2 lengths of wooden shims 3/8\" thick to fit the gaps on both sides between the slats and the bed frame. This prevents the slats from moving too much to one side but the slats still managed to slip off the frame.",

      "title": "great box spring replacement for thick mattress",
      "text": "I accidentally bought an upholstered bed frame that required box spring -- I thought I was getting platform.... So, I needed a mattress foundation. This had REALLY bad reviews due to not being wide enough, but I had to chance it b/c I saw nothing else similar. I found it to be a perfect size. It DOES NOT replace the wooden bed slats, but sits on top, just like a box spring would. My mattress is super high, so this was perfect b/c a regular boxspring would have made the mattress too high and ruined the look.",

I literally attached the pieces right on top of my bed frame and I was done within 15 minutes, if that. The packaging was excellent. Not a single part bent, missing, or broken. Everything you need is packed nicely inside and the instructions are easy to understand. And the best part, is that it's easy to move around. It comes in a tall box but I was able to carry it by myself. This is literally a life saver",

Like other reviewers have stated, it does not fit a regular sized queen bed frame, however, it appears to do the trick and provide the support that I need, though I have it resting on top of the 3 metal support slats that originally came with my bed when I purchased it years ago. Only time will tell how it holds up, but so far I\u2019m satisfied. One thing to note: it will bring your mattress and box spring higher ( if you use both like I do).",
