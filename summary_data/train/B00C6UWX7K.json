Her headpiece wouldn\u2019t stay on during her enthusiastic race around the house but her costume did. In fact, she loved her costume so much she started biting and scratching when I tried to take it off. A great buy! I bought a small and she is 11 lbs and it was a perfect fit.",

There are some loose threads that we'll have to trim, but overall it seems like a really cute little costume, especially for the price.

We love this costume so so much and we will find a way to make it work but just a reminder that although the measurement chart is correct just consider the muscles on your dog! The top part starts wiggling down right away because her chest area is so big! Otherwise it's great material, it's long and perfect and really is such a nicely made costume!!",

      "text": "Super cute costume! I gave it 5 stars because you can\u2019t beat the price! The material does rub off in some places as she plays but again it was like 15 bucks and it\u2019s still super cute! Beats the 30-40 costumes at pet stores. Reviews saying this runs small are FALSE. She is a 50 lb Doberman and we got her the XXL. I also did buy big on purpose cuz she\u2019s growing like crazy and I want her to be able to wear next year. I\u2019m using ribbon right now to keep it in place. Overall super cute costume and can\u2019t beat the price!",

      "title": "Cute Dog costume - 2XL for 70lb lab",
      "text": "The 2X size fits my 70 lb lab perfectly. Its a nice material, shiny and a little stretchy. It looked huge when I took it out of the pkg, but fits her great. She doesn't really enjoy wearing it - so we will put it on her and take some photos - but that's probably about it. -1 star because our headband arrived ripped. I could fix it, but I dont think my dog wants to wear it, so I will probably not fix it.",

The head band is way to big as others said, so I'll probably tie it or add extra Velcro. The costume is also good material, seems high quality for the price!",
