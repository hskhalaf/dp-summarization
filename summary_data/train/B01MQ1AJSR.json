      "text": "I love this lamp and the color. The price is great, and about the same, at every store you look. I find more color options here on Amazon though. Some people don\u2019t like the ball chain as the switch, but this one is very light and easy to pull, unlike an older stick lamp I have. Very convenient to have a plug as well. I prefer to use 60 watt bulbs in these. The darker the shade, the less amount of light that will go through. Keep that in mind. Mine is teal color and still lights up my room pretty well with just one. Mine had no damages, very well packaged. I\u2019m a happy primer :)",

Also, as some have mentioned, the lamp shade sits on top but isn\u2019t secured, so it moves quite freely. My biggest complaint is that the pull-chain is really hard to pull! I sprayed some graphite in the opening and that seemed to help, and hopefully it will loosen a bit over time. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with this purchase !

The receptacle on the lamp base is perfect for keeping electronics chargers handy. Lamp's pull cord is smooth. Lamp shade sits on the base where the bulb is screwed in, but isn't fastened down and remains shaky. Not a problem unless you're constantly bumping into your lamp. Lamp shade itself is well made; outer colored fabric is even textured with rich color. Nice stylish little lamp, great value.",

The bottom of the lamp is messed up and it clearly leans to one side. I don't know if the padding is messed up or if the wiring underneath is making it uneven, but I am very upset. It is an imperfection to my daughters newly put together room.",
