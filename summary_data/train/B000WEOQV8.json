Tips: Use kraft paper like grocery bag pieces or parts of your charcoal bag and a starter cubes like Katon Cubes and you will have a quick fire. Pay attention when you empty hot coals to get all of them out of the chimney!!!! This goes for any chimney starter.",

It's so simple to use! Insert charcoal in cylinder, stuff some newspaper in the bottom from underneath, light newspaper and wait 10 minutes or so then dump it into your grill. I light mine inside my grill on top of the charcoal grate so as not to damage my concrete driveway, then dump it right into the grill. To me, this is easier than using lighter fluid or having to stack my charcoal like my father taught me. This is hands down my favorite grilling accessory.",

There is no release gate at the bottom, so you have to turn it upside down and dump the embers into the grill. This can get a bit tricky with an Akorn \"egg\" grill because of the deep charcoal grate, but doable. Otherwise, great product!",

      "text": "Works like a charm to get hardwood lump charcoal perfectly ready for the grill with no muss, no fuss, and NO STINKY LIGHTER FLUID. It's huge, so a full chimney's worth is enough to slow-grill a large roast. We use little firebug firestarters rather than paper to start the coals, as then you don't get any ash blowing around. It's worth every penny! They shipped this in the largest box imaginable, which was kind of funny - this giant box that weighed about a pound and a half. Kind of wasteful, but it arrived in perfect condition, which is probably why they do it that way.",

      "text": "What can you say about this that hasn't already been said? Chimney starters are the greatest boon to outdoor grilling since the invention of charcoal. This is one of the best starters. It's very large and holds a lot of charcoal. The handle is far away from the body. There is a heat shield between the body and the handle. The wire bail makes dumping the coals easier. My only nit pick is that the vent holes on the bottom are not large enough to fit a long handled lighter into. So you have to tip the chimney to light it underneath. Not really a deal breaker by any means.",

I also have a standard size grill that I use in my backyard and it's capacity perfectly accommodates the correct amount of charcoal and has it ready for cooking in not more than 15 minutes. It really does only require two sheets of newspaper. In closing, stop thinking about it and just get one!!!",

It is amazing how quickly your coals are glowing red, you then just dump the coals into the grill and avoid the chemicals associated with lighting your grill. Whoever came up with this idea really developed a great product and it's only about $20. You will not be sorry you bought this product.",

A small trick I read somewhere else was to add a small amount of vegetable oil to the paper at the bottom for a more rapid, longer burning initial flame. Because the chimney is wider, you can add more starter fuel to the bottom and more coal/wood to the chimney. I always hated having to add more fresh coals after pouring out the chimney.",
