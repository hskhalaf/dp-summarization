The replacement was easy and not it works just like I bought it yesterday. This mouse is my baby, I love the cracked blue design and everything else about this mouse. Logitech doesn't make this mouse anymore, but if you can get your hands on one of these. It's totally worth every penny.",

The button right on the mouse to change the sensitivity of your cursor movement is a nice feature, and the mouse is very comfortable in my hand and very accurate and precise to use. Very worthwhile if you are a gamer, or if you have large hands and feel constricted by the size of a standard mouse.",

Logitech of course refused to acknowledge a failure of the device and assumed my settings were inaccurate, regardless my efforts to trouble shoot. I had to quit using it and I would not buy another at this price ... why pay Zippo prices for a Bic lighter?",

Even though the customizable weight cartridge is meant for gamers, it also works great for RSI since one can play around with the weights until they feel most comfortable. And the precision tracking means less effort trying to move the mouse to the target. Highly recommended.",

It's very comfortable in the hand and the ability to add or subtract weight from it (by adding little weights that fit inside on the bottom) makes it perfect for the gamer. By adding or subtracting weight you can get the feel and the flow that you are looking for. i love the speed control and extra buttons.",
