The company notified me that there was a quality control issue with some of their pillows, so they were replacing all pillows sold. They sent me a brand new pillow very quickly, along with a personalized, signed letter. That's pretty incredible these days, in my experience. Their communication was excellent, and the customer service impeccable. So I am very satisfied with the pillow and the company.",

It took a little bit of practice to figure out where to sit on the cushion, but I made it through the flight with no issue. My tailbone felt fine! I'd HIGHLY recommend this product if you have similar pain, and definitely this product over other U-shaped pillows (I have a tempur-pedic one as well that doesn't work as well for long-hauls) because the foam in it doesn't get soft and lose support.",

Towards the end I could not sit at all without this pillow, it was a lifesaver. I had my hemorrhoids removed when I was 37 1/2 weeks pregnant (horribly painful, avoid at all costs if you can while pregnant), but again I used this and it helped my recovery.",

It does take pressure off of areas that don't want pressure, but the pillow seems to be too small and tends to dig into my backside because it is not soft enough. I am a tall person, but my butt is of a normal size and it really can feel uncomfortable if I have to sit on the pillow for a couple of hours or so. I would not think that anyone with a big butt would like this product.",

I spend a lot of time sitting and working on the computer or sitting in the car driving and often my lower back and butt/tailbone would start to hurt and feel uncomfortable. I tired sitting on a normal pillow but that didn't hep much. Another great thing about this cushion is that it does not slide around. It stays in place both in my car (leather seats) and on wooden chairs. Highly recommend! I've been using this product for about a week.",
