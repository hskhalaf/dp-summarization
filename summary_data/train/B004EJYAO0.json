The refrigerator door keeps falling out when my daughter opens it. It's really sad to see her open the fridge to put her make believe food in it and the door falls out on the floor. Smh",

Sticker trim around the top doesn't stay on very well Also, ours came without the entire accessory kit and hardware pack, so we had to wait for the manufacturer to send it to us. Our kids don't care about the downsides though and enjoy the kitchen. Just be prepared it will probably be missing something you need from the packaging.",

It's tall enough for the average 3-4 yr old to reach and for 2 children to comfortably play alongside each other. There were many cups, bowls, play food, etc that came with it so as soon as assembly was complete they were ready to start \"Cooking\". The stove has the sound effects and visuals of something cooking, which makes it seem realistic for the kids.",

The wholes are not pre-drilled, but I was able to very easily get the screws where they needed to be with very little effort. There is plenty of storage for the accessories that came with the kitchen, plus plenty of left over space if you wanted to buy more play food. This little kitchen is exactly what we were looking for as a Christmas gift for our daughter.",

I did not get rid of the older one as I had planned as this was much too small for my 5 year old!",

It has all the basics with a few special features (microwave sounds, stove boils, etc.) I was also plesantly surprised at how many dishes and faux food pieces were included. I wish it offered more food/dish supply room. Everything is narrow, so nothing wide will fit into the oven or fridge. As an example a salad plate would be too wide. This means that a lot of after market buys are too large to neatly store within the kitchen",
