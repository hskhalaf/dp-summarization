      "text": "There are only three pads on each strip that tests the water levels. The top one tests chlorine. About 1/3 of the time, just gently dipping it into the water according to the instructions, made the pad fall off into the pool. Using a second test trip 1/3 of the time made these costly and frustrating. I found another brand at a big box hardware store and they are much higher quality for less money per strip.",
