Very pleased with the sheets and this company. Will definitely shop with them for other items in the future. I bought these in 2016 and the colors have not faded which is pretty impressive considering the many washings they have had due to the many messes they have endured from two babies and two toddlers!",

They fit snug but do not pull overly tight. I washed them first of course and saw no noticeable shrinkage, at least not from the point of view of how well it fits the mattress. I bought the two-pack and it was a much better price than buying the sheets individually. The patterns are very pretty too. I highly recommend these sheets!",

Double up on sheet and liner to make night time changes easier... why the heck didn't I think of that in the first place! Will absolutely be purchasing more as I like to have backups. We also use these in the pack-n-play since we travel and my little one is at his grandmas's during the day while my husband and I work. So I'm going to need plenty more of these! :)",

I was so excited to find elephants sheets that matched my child's nursery, but even better than the pattern is how stretchy and incredibly soft these sheets are! They've held up well so far to multiple washes (because kids are messy) and I would definitely purchase again.",
