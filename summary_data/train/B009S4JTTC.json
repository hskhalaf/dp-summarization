      "text": "So. I want to say that the game itself is awesome. It goes right back to the core R&C gameplay while still maintaining a party game's accessibility. Controls are tight, story line is pretty funny, and the game reminds you why Ratchet and Clank is awesome. Unfortunately, PSN says they are no longer providing a digital copy of Ratchet Deadlocked. To be honest, that's why I bought this bundle and I'm really disappointed that it's no longer included.",

      "text": "It's fun, but it's not long enough. It feels like it's about half of a game. It only has five levels in the main mission. Yes, it's a tower defense version of Ratchet and Clank. It's engaging enough on the first playthrough, but only three of the five campaign levels are worth playing a second time (the first and last level are way too easy otherwise). Co-op mode is nice, and well suited for the game as each player can be in different parts of the level (offense and defense). I haven't played assault mode because you can't play assault mode against local opponents.",

That being said, this is not a game for young kids alone, it's actually very challenging and almost nerve racking sometimes with non stop action and exploration. My only complaint is that there is only 5 story levels and one of them is more of a standard Ratchet and clank like level, but it still is worth hours and hours of fun on and offline.",

The average time for this world is 22 minutes; although I played without any assistance from Clank and the Q, which makes the game much more challenging. I failed a lot, but it was fun while failing. Very good game, but no strategy guide is available for it, so I must tinker around and try to figure it out.",

      "text": "I just started playing this and so far I'm loving it. I'm a 68 year-old grandma so my reactions aren't as fast as they used to be, but this game is forgiving enough for me to slowly progress. I DO get killed a lot, but don't have to go back too far to start again. I'm sure a good player would still find a lot of fun in this game. I have played other R&C games and don't remember the Pyroblaster (or whatever it's called); really fun to use on those suckers! Like all the other games, there are lots of funny cracks made by Ratchet and the colors are bright and clear. It's just a fun game.",

It was released on November 27, 2012 on the PlayStation 3 with the PlayStation Vita version delayed until May 21, 2013.[10]",

You basically build up base defenses, unlock the weapons from weapons crates, and do all the fun R&C stuff! Great game for anyone who loves the R&C series, or a great gift for kids!",
