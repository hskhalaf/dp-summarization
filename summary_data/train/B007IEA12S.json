I used the cheaper brand for a few months but, not only did it not work, I lost the good results I got from neuLash. I will definitely stick with neuLash since it's worth the price in terms of the results it gives. Also it takes ages to finish the tube with 2x a day application.",

The only downside is you must continue to use it, but once they grow back you don't have to use it everyday. She uses it every 3 days and they have still remained just as full. Thank you for making an amazing product that helps my mom feel beautiful again.",

I didn't see much for a while and then they noticeably started to grow. My lashes have gotten much better. I'm very happy with the results for both these products, and I recommend trying them if you have thinning brows/lashes. Both products are easy to use. I plan to keep using them indefinitely.",
