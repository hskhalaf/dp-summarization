      "text": "Too small. I wear a 7-7.5 in men and ordered a 7 but these were too small. I tried walking around in them to see if I could break them in but NOPE. They hurt. Also, I was expecting these to be white!!! They were white on one side and cream/dirty looking on the other. I don't understand how they were even discolored like this. There was also a yellow stain on the rubbery plastic part for the shoelaces. I wanted to love them but I couldn't. Nice structure though.",
