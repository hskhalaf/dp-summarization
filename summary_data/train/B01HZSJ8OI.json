I cannot say if it deflated by the same volume each night, and if you are not bothered by it, you can inflate it before bed in aprox 3minutes.

      "text": "I have had this now for about 6 months and have used it about a handful of times. The first time I used it myself with my partner for about four days. Every night it deflated a lot but I chalked that up to stretching out as the directions noted. However the couple times I have had guests over and I pump it up myself to a nice solid level, I come in in the morning and it\u2019s basically half deflated already! It\u2019s so embarrassing. I cannot find or hear any holes. I may just give up and purchase an actual bed or sofa bed. Would not recommend for any purpose",

Could not get it back in its original box (not really a big surprise there) but easily fits in a larger box we had so can be stored away easily. Did not deflate at all overnight.",

Very easy to inflate and deflate but a little noisey so don't wait until too late if others are sleeping in the house. When you move there is a pop of each pocket that is filling back up which is a little annoying but that helps with the comfort of the bed.",

The only addition I would add is maybe the support,lier could include a bag to stow the deflated item in, as deflating and trying to get it back into the box is impossible.",

I will still put a matteess topper to add a bit more comfort. I'm sure it'll be still very good without it. It'd have been nicer if it came with a storage bag. Once deflated, you will need a massive bag to fit it in.",

It appears very well made and inflates/deflates extremely fast, so the inbuilt pump does its job very well. I did lounge about on the inflated bed for a while to test comfort and it seemed pretty good to me. It's worth noting that it's usual for airbeds to react to ambient temperature and it does take a few uses before they take on their proper shape, so I imagine this one will react similarly. So far, so good though.",

It self inflates/deflates in a short period of time by simply plugging in the plug into the mains and turning the dial to 'inflate' or 'deflate' respectively, and the plug can tidily be stored inside a compartment at the end of the bed. It is a good height off the floor (much higher than simply putting a normal mattress on the floor), and is very comfortable to sleep on. I have spent multiple consecutive nights on this mattress with no issues whatsoever. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a high quality temporary bed or extra bed for when guests come round.",
