The handles make them easy to carry and move, room enough for larger plants. This is the first season I'm using them, I plan on getting a few more years out of them before recycling. The water seeps out of these perfectly, no overwatering worries. The price is great and again, the color is just perfect for keeping the soil warm throughout the colder months.",

If you don't care about the one time use then get them. Maybe being in South Florida it takes more of beating from sun and weather..",
