It was great when it came out(the only plug and play on the market at the time) and still easier to use then most other products. The only people that I know that use it is a high end corporate A/V company that uses them for remote log in to test picture quality and trouble shooting, then just tosses them when they crash",

I am not sure if it is a heat problem or just overall poorly designed. With so many ways to stream Amazon,Netflix, HBO, Showtime, My FIOS, etc., I no longer have any need for a Slingbox. I will say that the price paid on Amazon was by far less then any other retailers, including Ebay and other online retailers.",

This device sat on top of the directv box and had a sensor that had to be located near the receiver. In order for the video feed to come through the directv box needed to be set on 720p resolution. This was a pain to constantly be changing to allow the device to work. And if I forgot to change it manually, I could change it once accessed online. So the device became useless if I forgot to make that settings change.",

It is extremely clutch when you are away from televisions during football season (particularly those selfish folks that get married on Saturday nights in the fall). The price has surprisingly gone up about $20 since i purchased mine, but it is a solid investment, and you won't be disappointed. I have used my slingbox in Mexico, Asia, Caribbean, Europe, and Hawaii with no problems. I really do not understand how this is legal. I strongly recommend this for anyone who wants directv on their iPhone.",

Be sure to keep the cable box powered up or else you won't be able to watch anything. Also, if the cable box is located in a place that gets touched or bumped, you may want to get some extra adhesive so the LED things that need to be lined up just so with the front of the cable box don't get moved out of place.

Almost fully automated setup, worked the first time and the audio/video quality over my wireless G network is excellent. Didn't even need any tech support. The controls and applications have been very well designed and work quite effectively. Overall, this product is well worth the price and minimal effort to set up.",

If you have an annoying sound coming from your computer after you have everything setup, discontect one of the audio setup contections. Your computer may only need one of these contections for the audio. Everything else worked right out the box. I have not used the system out of the home network area to state that the travel worthiness of the unit is up to snuff, but so far so good.",

Note that you must use a hard wired ethernet connection for the box (not WiFi) and that there is a consicerable lag,, making it difficult to use the fast forward and other controls.

It's an HDMI DRM issue, so it's not the fault of Slingbox, but they should do a better job warning people of this issue.
