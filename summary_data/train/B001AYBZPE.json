If you get it on your scalp and then rub it off, it can look kind of funny. It can \"sprinkle\" all over the sink / cabinet when you put it on if you're not careful. Overall though, its really pretty good and a lot cheaper/easier than the $15k hair transplant I was considering.",

I tried to phone customer service and got a person in Utah who had no clue and kept apologizing to me. The bottle seems to be made somewhere new too, because it has Auburn/Roux/Rojo on it, rather than the old bottles that just had Auburn on the label. So best to go to a beauty supply where you can inquire about the product.",

I am a female btw so my hair is important...used to get loads of compliments but those faded along with my pretty locks. I am so impressed with this product, that I saw on a TV commercial, so grabbed my phone to see if Amazon carried it...yes, they do! It matches perfectly and looks very natural. I'm a happy gal!",
