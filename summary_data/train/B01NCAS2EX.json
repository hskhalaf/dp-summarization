So, the next time she played with it, we monitored her carefully and made sure that she didn't swallow any of it. As soon as she de-stuffed it, we threw it out. That night, she vomited again. This is the last time I'll ever buy this product again!",

We had a green alligator version of this toy in the same size and it has lasted a long time. But, something must have been changed in the manufacturing, because this one is just constantly losing short brown plastic fur. Unintentionally, our dog is ingesting that fur, so this toy is a NO GO. Haven't returned it yet, but will seek a new company to buy toys from. Like most US companies, KONG has sold us out for profit. Just more Chinese garbage here.",

Best bet: If you know your dog is a chewer / destroyer, skip this and buy a Tuffy. If your dog on the other hand will care for this as if it were their own miniature pink baby elephant, than it will be worthwhile to buy. Good luck.",

I'm happy with how the Kong Cozies have held up in terms of being a plush toy, and will buy another when this one is inevitably destroyed.",
