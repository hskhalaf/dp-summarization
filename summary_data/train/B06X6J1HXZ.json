I really like how comfortable it is for bare feet. Kinda squishy. Color: I ordered RED. It is a darkish bright red. Not a vibrant color which I prefer but you may not. Shipping: Took awhile to ship but after arrived on time and it good condition. Overall great comfortable rug at a good price. I recommend.",

They are a little spendy, but I think you get what you pay for and so far these were worth the money. Two adults and three dogs have been walking on them for a week and you can't even tell. They haven't showed any dirt or traffic!",

      "KNOW US :) We are a professional manufacturer of bathroom mats. And we know what kinds of good mats are needed by consumers.",
      "MACHINE-WASH :) Simply throw the mat into the washing machine, wash cold with neutral detergent, hang to dry or air dry flat at low temperatures. After 10 times machine wash test, the MAYSHINE bath mat still looks as good as the new one. No worry about it getting the fibers off, it's really easy to handle and care. In addition, we recommend that you use washing machine who's load is more than 6kg and wash it at least once a week ,In this way, you can maintain your rug.",
      "TECHNIQUE :) UNIQUE fiber-locking technique, say goodbye to horrible fiber-dropping! The chenille mat is composed of 3 layers: fabric layer, middle sponge layer and bottom anti-skid layer. It is designed to absorb water to dry your feet quickly, its strong water-absorbent ability can make your bathroom floors quickly dry and clean. This soft bath rug is for the outside of shower and the outside of tub.",
      "COMFORT :) The fibers are very dense and not easily turn deflated after use, so it can maintain a new look. Height of the fibers: 2.5 cm; Especially soft and thick microfibers relieve pressure and fatigue on your feet. Every time you step out of the shower or bathtub, you can enjoy superior comfort.",
      "ANTI-SLIP :) Non slip bottom is made of PVC material. The middle layer is 25D6 mm sponge, which is more safe and comfortable for your feet. The non-slip bottom helps keeping the mat firmly in place, that it won't slip or slide. !!!WARNING!!! \u2014 Place mat on CLEAN DRY SMOOTH FLOOR only. Water under mat can cause it to slip. Keep bottom of mat dry. Before using mat, test with foot to ensure it doesn't move."
