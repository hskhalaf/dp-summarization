      "text": "Bought the ScanJig Pro to improve my phone's document scanning. After spending a few minutes setting the unit up, I placed a sheet into position, put my phone into place and launched CamScanner. When properly adjusted there is plenty of leeway for making the scan. I have scanned 8x10 and smaller originals with success. Two issues: 1) I had to add a contrasting color to be sure to pick out the corners of the scan. 2) A costly solution, but one that works. Can't speak to the longevity of this as I've only had it for 2 weeks.",

Using an i-pad makes the stand unstable because the i-pad has to be located off center. The book addition does not allow the use of the i-pad at all--which is noted in the manual but not in the advertisement of the ScanJig Pro. If you wish to scan anything else, such as a large sheet of paper or a ledger type book, the ScanJig is almost useless.",
