The two that did arrive and I had installed are doing its job for the 2 months that have been in use. I have yet to clean the filters out yet. I'll update when I can.",

I expect this part to fail first. - The electrical connection is corded, which is time consuming to remove and connect house wiring to. My main concern is the touch-panel control. When it quits, the unit is shot, even if the rest of the appliance is fine. I would strongly prefer mechanical switches which have served us well for a long time.",

To screw this thing onto the bottom of the cabinet is awkward and challenging. Most cabinet will require extra pieces of woods to build up for the screws.

It did not remove smoke or Steam. Smoke alarm went off when we open the oven and it did not pull the smoke, it just bypassed from the front of the hood. My older $120 version from Home Depot did better than this unit. It\u2019s well-built with a unique look but it doesn\u2019t do the job properly. Extremely disappointed and I Will be returning this item.",

I have actually never seen another vent with only one light brightness and no variation. In terms of the essential, though, it is a great appliance.",

The minimum speed is around 200CFM, and it is around 30Db.\" In reality at the minimum setting, dB is coming out to be 66db and and then it hovers around 70db for rest of the settings. Given that 'db' is lograthmic scale, that is a huge difference between claimed and reality. Very very disappointed.",
