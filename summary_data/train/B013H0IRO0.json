I do warn gamers that play GTAV very frequently that the controls are not the same but you'll eventually get use to them. Even though people claim that GTA series will always be the best open world game, Mafia 3 have a lot of qualities that GTA lacks when it comes to realism!",

I also feel bad for the people that spent $65 on a game that wasn't worth it.",

Once I beat it, I purchased the DLCs. It's a fun game world. The only issue is how repetitive it can be. Sometimes you drive back and forth excessively and mission structures are pretty much the same all the way through...BUT the combat is so satisfying that I loved taking over rackets and building my empire piece by piece. Definitely worth $30 or less.",

The campaign gets pretty repetitive since the whole baseline lies on the fact that you have to draw out mob bosses by destroying rackets, then you kill the boss and assign said racket to one of three associates. Once you beat the game, it's basically like well what do I do now? I own the city and all you can really do is those optional objectives which also get pretty repetitive. I thought that by taking control of the entire city that the police wouldn't care what I do but I guess that's wrong.",

Why buy this when Grand Theft Auto V exists?",

There are plenty of side missions to complete and you aren't contantly in a mission like how mafia two. There is so much freedom to do what you want first.
