I\u2019m really trying to stay away from the sweets and this has been a great alternative for me. I have never tasted a protein powder that tastes a delish as this! Seriously! After reading the reviews & everyone saying the same I had to try. And YES it does live up to the hype. I\u2019ve mixed it with water and it STILL tastes just like the cereal. So imagine with some almond milk. I\u2019m deff going back for the coco pebbles!",

I could drink this regularly and it's not too sweet.",

All in all, its great... haven\u2019t tried any other flavors than \u201cChocolate Peanut Butter\u201d because i just really don\u2019t want to waste money or be disappointed... So im sticking with it. Im halfway through my third 5lb container... Its a rock solid protein brand.

I\u2019m hoping to be able to choke down the rest of the can, but it will be a struggle. I can\u2019t have chocolate, so my flavor options are limited.

I do think it's easier on my tummy, but I'm still looking for a better protein powder.",

If you don't like excessively sweet avoid this brand. It does what it says though, I can go as hard as I want and I'm only a little sore the next day :)",
