      "text": "I used in on a tub that would take an hour to drain after a shower. I did not want to use a product that would harm our septic system, so I tried Xionlab. One bottle was enough to fix the drain. I have since ordered two more bottles for further cleansing and maintenance. TIP: Make sure to use plenty of boiling water after the 6-8 hour treatment. And you may at first think the drain is completely clogged, but give the hot water a chance to work. It worked for me!",
