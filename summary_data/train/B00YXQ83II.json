When you open package there is a strong odor from dye chemicals used. I hung 4 panels and had to air out the room. But the odor has dissipated or I have become nose blind. I could wash them but wanted to decorate with them as soon as they arrived!",

People saying it was small maybe ordered the wrong size? Mine is huge 85\u201d x 80\u201d. Can\u2019t beat it for 15 bucks. The last photo is post washing in cold and drying on delicate. Colors held fast, and the measurements were taken after washing as well. It has a typical tapestry smell. If you\u2019ve ever bought a legit cotton tapestry you know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019ll probably buy more. This is going camping with me and then on a wall. Would be great as a base layer for the beach. Love it!",

The fabric is light weight, the color is nicely saturated and the quality was good for the price. I read many reports about the cloth having an odor. These did not have an odor at all and could be used straight out of the packaging. I would purchase them again.",

The orange doesn't cover as much of the material as it does in the photo, and the area in the middle takes up a lot more room on the garment. The fabric is really nice. Tightly woven, durable. Deep colors. I don't see this fading when washed. I only wish it resembled the photo with the orange color covering more territory.",

I couldn't be more pleased with how well this tapestry fills those needs! Absolutely gorgeous, and highly recommended.",
