We use this in our living room which has a moderate amount of natural light, mostly shaded by big trees - I'm really pleased by the color and picture quality we get without darkening the room.

My low price epson I bought 5 years ago is still better than this. I see rainbow constantly and the picture while watching sports has no sharpness. The brightness feature is also weak. Some calibration settings cannot be used except for the best of signals so you can't correct many TV broadcasts. Thinking of returning. Not sure if my unit is defective but I am pretty sure it just isn't very good. Imo not very bright for the lumens stated.",

Once I got it flipped after some cursing, I was able to slowly figure it out and adjust things accordingly. The picture is lovely and the projector is quiet.

Also, with previous projectors it seemed I could never get sharp text and clarity no matter what I did. But this projector snaps right into focus and stays sharp even when adjusting size.

We have it ceiling mounted (there are 3 mounting holes on the bottom and you can set up the picture flip in the settings)... Also there are many settings to be able to customize the picture for your needs as well as a neat future of eco mode which is supposed to extend the life of the lamp- I don't notice too much of a difference between eco and normal. Good solid projector and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a short throw 1080p projector",

The BenQ MH535FHD, however, is as advertised. If I needed another, I'd get another of these. Definitely recommended. This one is in use in our office, in a room that always has sunlight, and is unevenly lit. It's a great space with character...but it's a challenge for a projector. The MH535FHD is sufficiently bright for viewing in a lit room, it doesn't emit any noticeable fan noise, and text is sharp and readable for everyone in the room. If your needs are similar, this should be a strong consideration.",

The screen fit well with 16.10 setting, I used finepx camera to record the DVD coming via VGA cable 13 feet long and the quality is very good, we need to fine tune it for sharper image, but wanted to try it out before making a complete set. Easy to install, no need to adjust anything except to adjust for distance and invert image. Very satisfied with the performance. The video is king of fast moving with Ce\u0301line Dion in Las Vegas .",

However, the speaker is very weak and it was hard to adjust the volume to a level to hear even in a smaller conference room. Luckily, we normally don't use a lot of sound so we will be okay, but consider the lack of speaker volume if you need to use this projector for sound output. For the price I would recommend if it fits your needs.",
