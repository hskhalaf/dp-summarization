It clearly states in the manual and marketing literature that it supports up to 600MBPS speed while the actual hardware ports only allow 100MBPS. Feels a lot like false advertising when you are buying the device to allow for upgrading your internet lines in the future. This router will only support 100MBPS internet speeds. Very disappointed.",

      "text": "For a daily, albeit unprofessional user, I found this router OK. Setup was NOT intuitive, but accomplished. Attempts to change the factory setup keys to something I wished provided fruitless, so I just went with those provided. Firmware updating the router since production initially seemed to be problematic, but has since settled down and the router hasn't lost signal again. Signal strength and speed appears to now be solely a function of the ISP. Understanding this is an older router model is incumbent on the purchaser, and its performance should be adjudged accordingly. Generally you get what you pay for, and realize you can't put a saddle on a sow !",

Some rooms only get 2 bars at best. This is not what I had hoped. So I am extremely disappointed.",

Features (2.4 and 5.0GHz band, guest networks, NAT settings, security) were in line with the amount you pay for it. 4-port switch is just about what anyone needs (AppleTV + gaming system, etc) next to the device. Minimal footprint and pretty reliable. It does play nicely with a multitude of devices as I have 5 Apple products, 2 Windows devices, an Xbox, Playstation, etc. Supports a number of devices on the network before things go a little shaky (did a LAN with 12+ computers and consoles). If you can get it for <$50, definitely a solid buy.",

This is the WNDR3400 v1, not the latest version 3. Despite configuring it for 300 Mbps, it connects at 144 Mbps or lower. Wireless throughput is 16-18 Mbps, compared to my old Linksys WRT54G which achieved 20-22 Mbps. I gave it a week and no amount of tweaking helped. It's slower than my trusty old Linksys WRT54G v8.

Use online www.routerlogin.net. Then download and use the Netgear genie to adjust the WiFi name and password for your network. One side note. If you decide to use the same WiFi name for this new router as your old router, you need to reset your iphone/ipad network for it to work on those devices (Settings>General>Reset>Reset Network Settings)",

I spent hours on the phone with my internet company, they couldn't get it working either. After hours of frustration, I gave up. I am sending it back to Amazon for a refund, and I am going try a NEW Linksys E1200. I hope that one will work. No more refurbished for me.",

It was easy to set up, basically plug & play. Stays connected even with our sketchy cable internet service. Range is just ok.",
