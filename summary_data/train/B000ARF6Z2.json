They fit great for the first time on! They protected my feet and was able to get out in horrible weather. Needed to get out in the rain and mud to inspect my property. Everything was intact. Was very pleased with my new shoes. Would definitely recommend them and buy them again!",

These Sketchers have lace eyelets up to the top-perfect. They fit as expected. Soles rugged with good safety grip. They are comfortable, sturdy, and reasonably water-resistant. Seems almost all low boots now are made by people who NEVER wear them. Wrong way to design something. These are \"just enough\" across the board for my use. They are also pretty comfortable!",

There is some space between the top of my foot and the boot but I like that because I like to add insoles to all my shoes to make them more comfortable since I am on my feet all day. I also wear them anytime I am going to ride my bike. They are not water proof but I took care of that with Kiwi spray that I found at walmart. I do recommend these boots for casual dress and light work outdoors.",

The insole material smells very chemical/rubbery; it's the only pair of shoes I own that smells like this. I would not buy them again at this cost.",
