      "text": "This is a great tent if you like Camo or are just camping in the woods. There is lots And lots of space.We were able to fit 2 cots in there with plenty of room in between and Also hooked up my ps4 and monitor IT WAS AWESOME! I also like how you could hang a lantern or flashlight at the top. And how you didn\u2019t have to crouch you can perfectly stand up in the tent. The tarp on the ground was very sturdy and easy to clean. The windows allowed for a lot of air flow which is always good. Overall this tent is amazing and I would recommend you buy!!",

Second day out it started to rain, i kept checking the tent for leaks and had no water anywhere. Had plenty of room for my queen sized mattress and all my hunting gear. The open top was perfect for venting on the first night but it got EXTREMELY cold the second night. Nothing a MR HEATER can't fix which they all had and i didn't. Will buy one and have for the next trip.",

      "text": "I bought this as a summer tent. It works well and is easy to set up. My first trip camping involved 3 days of rain. I had sealed the tent using Grip Seal and it worked well. There were still several places where water came in mainly around the stitching of the floor panel and the sides especially where the corners are sewn. The tent has excellent ventilation, thus I would say this is a two season tent. Overall I like the tent, but seam seal everything, then do it again!",

Really great price and plenty room for a queen size blow up mattress and a single mat right next to it and still some room at the entrance to stand up and change clothes if need be. Good luck getting it all back into the original packaging lol. I bought an extra bag to carry the actual tent piece in, but still very worth it. I use it all the time.",

The instructions were well laid out, and the tent was quickly erected. The quality of the materials appear to be as good as my friend had told me, and so, in this early going, all appears well.",
