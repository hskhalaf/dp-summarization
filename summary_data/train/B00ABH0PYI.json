      "text": "Okay...while nothing will ever replace my electric cookie shooter that sadly died after 25 of faithful cookie service, I researched the world over, (they just don\u2019t make the electric ones anymore! Why!, but my conclusion is that the OXO COOKIE GRIPS Press is a good substitute. Easy to use! Easy to clean and the see thru barrel is a must! The cookie dye I used for my spritz recipe worked out great, albeit the cookies were rather small for my desires, but a double hit on the crank fixed that by doubling the cookie in size on the sheet. Good luck! I like this shooter, it\u2019s good.",

I like to freeze on the pan for 15 minutes, to preserve shape, then bake. Merry Christmas from Fairhope, Alabama.",

The packaging is perfect and the shapes come in a nice little plastic container (shown in product picture). The instructions are simple and it even comes with recipes. I followed one of the enclosed recipes and it turned out perfect. I got so many compliments. Definitely would make this purchase again!",

I press the cookies onto either my cutting board or a plate, then pick them up with a small spatula and place them on the parchment paper. The other thing I will mention is the recipes in the instruction book. The ginger cookies don't taste very good in my opinion, but the others are all pretty tasty.",

This does not have a star tip to pipe your own cookies but it does have some great disks. The first cookie I made was a shortbread cookie using the wreath disk. When the cookies cooled I put raspberry jam in between two cookies and dipped them in chocolate. They were delicious! I would recommend :)",

A great product that makes amazing cookies quickly. Highly recommend this cookie press!!!",

The silicone feature at the bottom is a nice design, but be careful if using this on a silicone mat, I had a few cookies refuse to stick and occasionally the press slipped a little. Otherwise, this produced even, beautiful cookies. I love the plastic box for disc storage, what a great idea! Really worth the price.",

I found one the \u201cworks\u201d but it is not the traditional one that usually comes with a cookie press.",

It takes a bit of trial and error to get the hang of gettting the dough to release and stick to pan, but with practice works fine. Came with 12 disks with wide variety of shapes. Cookies came out nice though much smaller than I expected. Great gadget for making decorative cookies.",

It is easy to get the cookies uniform in size since it is a trigger that you pull to spit out a cookie. That being said, the cookies are smaller than other presses which is OK, but if you are using a favorite recipe , you will need to teak and adjust your baking times. I ruined my first couple of batches. It is compact and stores easily. I highly recommend this press!!",
