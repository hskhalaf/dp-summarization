What I don't like about it - the top fits together very poorly and has a tendency to slide when touched; that being said I will be purchasing one for our 11-year-old granddaughter for her birthday. She fell in love with it and it's a great size to fit anywhere!",

It doesn't even match the picture. So the top does not click into the bottom. If you bump it the light and top will fall to the ground. I have it just set on top of the wires for filter and light.

The omly issue i have is there is a small gap in the top back portion of the divider that allowed my tiny betta through the otger side. I was able to fix it with some foam, but if you have tiny fish i wouldn't recommend using the divider.",
