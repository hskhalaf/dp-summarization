We had a reading of about 14.5 pCi/L in our house from this test and then had a professional come in and retest it a few days later, and got a 12.7pCi/L reading. Not too fair off, and still lets us know that we need to have remediation done. I would definitely recommend testing your house especially if you have an open sump pump. My only suggest is if you don't want to wait for amazon to ship you the test most county offices have test available to purchase for about $10 with the Lab testing.",
