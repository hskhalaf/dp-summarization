Good construction, weird smelling fake leather on cans, cheap feeling fake leather for a $400 retail product No app to control is a minus in this day and age Buttons have no audio feedback when pressed.. I did memorize locations of buttons so no biggie but some might mind Did not feel like a good value only because I have better sounding wired headphones from master and dynamic and already have Bluetooth wireless ath m50x bt so this one needed to shine on ANC, which it unfortunately does not",

After the initial 3 hr charge of the battery I put them on and tried them out and I was not disappointed the music was clear and sounded so good then I turned the ANC and Amp on and could not believe that a wireless headphone could be so loud. They are very well built with no plastic all leather and metal they just look and feel amazing I have always wanted a good quality pair of cans and with Blue Satellite I have that for the price I paid for these headphones are worth every penny",

In my first one (black) the volume control stopped working after 2 weeks only occasional use. So I bought a second pair (black). That\u2019s why only 4 stars So far the second pair functions, except that the tiny on/off button needs to be pushed quite energic/hard/long in order to function. The on/off button in the first pair was easy to operate.",

If you are like me and won't remember that every single time, you'll end up using these as wired headphones, which I don't want and I will therefore be returning these.",

Louder than sennheiser and bose even before you turn on the amp. Once you turn on the amp the magic starts. At full volume the music is still crystal clear and sounds perfect. I can only listen to it at full volume for 10 minutes or so before I have to turn it down. These are like sennheiser on steroids. Easily the best sound quality. Only complaint is a little interference when phone is in my pocket.",
