I even found it\u2019s the best shampoo that I\u2019ve found for my thin, easily greasy hair! It smells great, is a lovely cream that suds up nicely but it doesn\u2019t strip hair at ALL. It makes it shiny, full, and clean. My thin hair, and my toddlers, look so great my husband even mentioned it after the first use. We also love the cream bath! Great for my reactive son and his rosacea, dermatitis, eczema, and cradle cap.",

Anyways, I love this product and everything wedela. I use their hand cream and diaper cream and other products.
