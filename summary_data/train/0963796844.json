It's very disappointing because I'd really like to have the more current edition. If you've looked around and are looking for this to be the current edition, you won't receive it.",

The BodyMinder Journal is well laid out with enough opportunity for you to chart your cardio, or strength-training progress. It's compact enough that it fits in your gym bag, and the binder is large enough you can hide a pen or pencil inside the binder. It's well worth the price.",

I take it to the gym and there is plenty of room to write. Much thought has been put into the format of this book and it is easily adaptable as well. Worth buying and a great value on Amazon!",

It's simple, straight-forward and has exactly what I need! I'm on my third journal now and won't ever use a different one!",

Many logs do not contain enough space for a variety of cardio, nor do they have enough rows/columns to fully record a serious workout regime. This log does! Spaces are available to record vitamins & supplements, daily nutrition, hydration, etc. It is a very good buy for the money - in fact, I feel it is worth every penny spent on it.",
