This model has apparently been abandoned by Roku. If you want to access new channels like PBS, you will have to get a newer model. There is no technical reason for this, so boo on Roku for a slimy policy of forcing upgrades. This model also cannot receive new software updates. I suppose that could be due to technical limitations, but per above it's probably Roku trying to force us to buy another unit.",

It's also so easy to use that my mother - who can barely figure out how to turn on a computer - was able to figure it out on her own. To me, that's impressive ease of use. The remote control is also quite a nice, elegantly minimal design. Mostly I use my Roku for Netflix. The app is well-made and the picture quality is always satisfactory and usually excellent (in HD). The Hulu+ app on the other hand is unspeakably bad software, but the picture still looks okay, so can't blame the Roku.",

I actually prefer it over the newer models since it has more audio and internet options in the back. For some reason. Roku keeps excluding features with each upgrade. The original Roku even had an optical out and I wish the newer ones did. I don't connect my Roku to a TV, I connect it to an Epson cinema projector for a home theater. I need to run my audio out of the Roku, It's also wired, which is sometimes a better option than wireless. I love my Roku!",

Documentation is a little vague especially when your trying to figure out how to get the amazon, pandora and netflix codes. This won't stream your music or movies, that's where Apple comes up strong. If I could combine these 2, I'd have a killer entertainment system. THe price of $79 is a bargain!",

I gave up cable TV a while back and use mostly Netflix streaming and Hulu Plus, both on the Roku. More than enough boob tube for me.

I have not compared the picture quality with any of the Netflix-equipped blu-ray players which have the potential to have even better picture quality (if they have superior upsampling processors). If you are a videophile then you probably will want the Oppo Digital BDP-93 to stream Netflix but that costs almost 10 times more ($500)",

If you can insert a plug and read at a 2nd grade level, you can do it. The picture looks great on my 10 year old tv, so I can only imagine how it looks on a nice tv. Definitely worth the money if you need to stream netflix. Haven't gotten around to working with the other channels, but I will eventually. But honestly, all I cared about was netflix, so even if they're no good, it's still worth it.",

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\ndrfugawe3.0 out of 5 stars Nice, But Far From GreatReviewed in the United States on February 3, 2012Verified Purchase I've had my Roku XD unit for almost a year now, and I'd miss it if they took it away - but I think all these glowing reviews are just a little over the top. I got mine because I was watching Netflix on my computer with a cable, and a streaming player sounded good - and it was. Additionally, we wanted our Roku to play music in the background, something we were doing with our Direct TV link, but that quickly became unsatisfactory due to the limited content and repetition. We looked forward to Roku's many options for streaming music.\n\nWe set our Roku up on our home Wifi network, and it installed fine - we almost never lose signal on our problem free home network, but we soon found the Roku would frequently lose signal - most of the time, that can be fixed by assisting Roku to 're-find' the signal - not difficult, but an annoyance. Sometimes that doesn't work, and you must restart the Roku box itself - you then discover that the Roku box does not have an on/off switch - you must pull the power cord out and re-attach it. You won't find any discussion of that fact anywhere - it's just something you're supposed to know intuitively.\n\nFrankly, I'm not much interested in 'buying' On Demand stuff, but it didn't take long to discover that that's Roku's real business, not selling these units! So, if you simply go to Roku's Channel Store, you won't find much free content there - and most that is called free, has some kind of strings attached, like time limits, or limited content, etc. But there is free content available if you are willing to do the digging yourself - go here [...] and read up on how to add free channels even though Roku hasn't approved them.\n\nAnother annoyance of mine is the simple-dimple remote that Roku gives you - it really doesn't do much of anything! Maybe it's me, and maybe I'm just dumb, but I'd love to find a way to have a remote that both controls Roku and controls the volume too. I've tried to program my TV remote to include Roku - Nope! And the Roku has so few controls that I'm actually using three remotes when I have to switch from Roku to TV (The Direct DVR and the Vizio TV can't sync either). If anyone knows how to go about syncing these remotes, I'd love to know.\n\nAs I said above, I really do like my Roku device - but it could be so much more enjoyable ..., especially if they'd cut a deal with the NFL, and begin doing college football - then I'd stop paying Direct $80 a month! Tell me again why we're paying Direct $80 a month.Read more 3 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Amazon Customer4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but...Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2011Verified Purchase I've now got two Netflix streaming devices. The other is a Nintendo Wii console. I was hoping the Roku player would be superior to a game console in every way, but it isn't.\n\nWhat does the Wii do better? It has a better search function. The Roku will only find instant stuff while the Wii will find movies even if they don't stream, and suggest instant movies that are similar to the title found. You can (if memory serves) also search for actors. The Wii has a subtitle function. It could be that I just haven't come across any shows that have subtitles using the Roku box, though. For most people, this isn't a big deal but I'm getting hard of hearing as I age. Subtitles are also good for watching stuff where the actors have thick accents.\n\nWhat does the Roku do better? Way more selection of streaming sources, including Amazon instant (I'll never use Amazon, cause it's WAY too expensive). Red Box is a buck per rental, AMZ is 3.99. The Roku has an HDMI port which does me little good on my current setup. My Sony 5.1 SS system doesn't have HDMI input or pass-through ports, so while I can get a slightly better picture the sound is TV only on HDMI. That's sort of a double whammy, 'cause I have the center (voice) channel volume higher in order to hear dialogue better. So, no subtitles and no surround sound using HDMI without buying a new system. I'll try and configure the Roku box to play on the auxiliary ports of my 5.1 system. So far, I haven't gotten around to dismantling the stack in order to run component cables through the back of the stand I'm using.\n\nThe Roku also shows a series of dots denoting signal strength. When the signal strength is at it's best (or at least adequate for 720p I'd guess) \"HD\" will appear to the right of the dots.\n\nOne more issue. One that's universal one for me. The remote. It's not very good. It's tiny. It's not back-lit. The buttons are not tactile. It does have a cool go-back button where you can mash the button and repeat about ten seconds, though. Good for us OFs who have trouble staying on task. What's the universal part? All remotes should have back-lighting and tactile buttons. Hardly any of 'em have either.\n\nWhich is better? Overall, the Roku is the better streaming player. If I had HDMI inputs and pass-throughs on my 5.1 system, it would be way better as the Wii hooks up through RCA-type cables. Try and run it through component inputs and you get this gray fuzzy picture and no sound.Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States TOP INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS \nmikro-ni4.0 out of 5 stars Good but not ready for the UK marketplaceReviewed in the United Kingdom on January 26, 2011Verified Purchase This is a good little box that was easy to setup with no issues using it. The only issues are that it is not ready to be launched in the UK - The power supply comes with an adapter from the US plug and you can only set US timezones which means you cannot set the correct time. However, I needed it for a specific channel, Sermonaudio, that works really well and is highly recommended.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.
