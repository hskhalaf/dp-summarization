Contacted the makers of the pen they responded once then never heard back from them again. I just asked if they sold parts for it. Pen is solid and works but light lasted maybe a day. Just wasnt up for the challenge.",

Daytime crime is up where I live, and I don't wish to be a victim. I like not having a cap to loose. It's easy to twist the pen for the ink and it locks into position. The LED light is very bright.

It feels very sturdy (all aluminum body) and the best part is there is an LED light on the end. I normally wear a headlamp at night but I prefer to use the LED on the pen when it's just a quick look at something - especially the tachometer which someone installed under the instrument panel. At this price point all of my friends and family are getting them as Christmas gifts. Great addition to my flight bag. Highly recommend!",

It's a LARGE pen so keep that in mind, and I really like it however the only down side is that the light seems to get turned on accidentally and kills the battery life, hence the four stars rather than five. This may or may not be an issue depending on how your pen is carried, for me I feel the light switch could be a tad bit more protected to stop this problem. Still, an excellent pen for every day carry, buy one.",

He always needs a pen to sign the trucking paperwork but then can use the super-bright flashlight to inspect trailers, and have it conveniently handy because it clips securely to his pants pocket. He accidentally left it at a customer location and was really unhappy with himself, so I ordered this exact replacement from TakeFlight,Inc. through Amazon. It arrived next day and he is once again happy to have this great multi-tool.",

The pen doesnt feel good in my hand and is awkward to hold, the use the pen you must twist the end, no biggie, but to close it you twist and then have to must the pen head inside. The light sticks above the DNA/glass breaker, so I see it not lasting long if needed, plus the bulb was already bent to one side. The only plus I could find is the clip, its tight and wont fall out or off whatever it's on. Over all I'd go back to the WUBEN Tactical flashlight pen.",
