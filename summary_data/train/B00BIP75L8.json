I think everyone needs one G-shock in their watch collection. You don't wear it because it is pretty--you wear it because you have work to do that would destroy a lesser watch. The thing is basically indestructible. There are much nicer G-Shocks, but you get less and less additional value for your money as you go up in price through the models.",

It does have a way to light up the dial but the owner's guide states that the battery will only last 2 years if the backlight operation is limited to 3.5 seconds a day and alarm operation in limited to 20 seconds per day. It further states that each illumination last an average of 2 seconds. Finally it says that if the battery power is used more than above, the life of the battery will be reduced accordingly.",

Watch just looks & feels cheap. **** This is the (Black) colored one and maybe the other colors can be seen better??? But I wouldn't bet on that. After all, I chose this color because the display looked the brightest. Not even close to the pics on Amazon's website. Very disappointed!!!!",
