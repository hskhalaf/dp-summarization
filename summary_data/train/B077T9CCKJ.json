It has lifted my 37' fifth wheel, My cargo trailer with my side by side in it and a McCormick tractor. The impact wrench worked on all of the wheels. No you cannot set the torque on the impact but no impact is designed for that. Buy a torque wrench and check the torque when the wheel is back on. My only issue is that the air pressure gauge has never worked. Not an issue I have a tire gauge that I trust. At 65 years old changing tires is a job. This tool makes that a lot easier. Thank you.",
