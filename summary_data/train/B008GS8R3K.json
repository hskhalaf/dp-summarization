The cord is a bit short. I will probably be using this on an every other day basis to cook a meal while I'm in class. It's just the perfect size to cook one meal for one person!",

This would be great for a college dorm, small living space, or tiny house where meals are for one or two people. I have a larger one from a different brand that I use for work potlucks and this one matches with it perfectly even though they have different brand names. Glad I found this little crock so I don\u2019t have to heat the whole house with the oven.",

The 1-1/2 quart held four cans of whole corn (minus a little bit of the liquid) and kept it nice and warm through the whole meal. The removable crock cleaned up with ease. It was a last second buy and arrived on time Christmas Eve just like they said it would (thank you Amazon).",
