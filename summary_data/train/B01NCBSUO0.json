Has a nice extra pocket should I want to take my iPad. After 8 months of use, it still looks new.",

I was looking for a daypack that would be ideal for hiking, and outings with my dog. Two deep water bottle pockets are a must. Surprisingly, it is a rare feature. This bag met my requirement, but I found a less expensive Gonex brand bag, that has even deeper pockets and includes a rain cover. FYI... this seller charges for return shipping.",

On top of the functionality, it is super stylish and fits well, even for me who is 5' 1\" and 110 lbs.

For me I wish there was a way to remove the chest straps because I would never use them, without the hydration pack capabilities you can't really take this hiking... Plus the fabric is too nice for that. I use s-clips to secure the zippers and deter pocket pockets while seeing sights.",

Look at the other reviews and you will see that they all seem to (positively) comment on it being small...so that is something to think about before you buy this. It's great as a bike-commute bag, but it probably would be obnoxious as a school bag.",
