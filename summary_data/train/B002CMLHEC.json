I had a little left of the Its a 10 I bought from Target and used it this morning. My hair immediately went back to its soft and shiny self. Buy Its a 10, just not from this seller.",

My hair looks dirty when it is clean and is heavy and lanky instead of voluminous and healthy. I'm super upset about it. Clearly somebody wanted to cut costs and now your customers are getting shafted. Boo, booooooo!",

When you apply too much, your hair will dry, but have a greasey or sticky feel. It definetly doesnt LOOK greasey, but I cant run my fingers through it because of the added oils. Maybe thats a flaw in the product, or maybe I need to chill with applying ten pumps of hair product!",
