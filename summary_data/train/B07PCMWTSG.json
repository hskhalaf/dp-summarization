I chose e-mail and entered the same address that I sent a similar gift card to, last year, for a birthday gift. This year, they didn't get it. I clicked Resend and sent to same address. Recipient didn't get it. I tried to find another way to send but since I chose e-mail in the beginning that was the only choice. I would like to send in a Text message but that is not an option on a resend request. I don't see a way to cancel the order and start over. Very irritating.",

      "text": "I purchased a gift card for almost $700 to redeem for a large purchase and several other smaller items. I went in to redeem my gift card and the balance is now $0. Essentially, Amazon is informing me that gift cards are not secure and that they have no liability and are not required to refund the monies. My account has clearly been compromised and Amazon is aware of this and still refuses to do anything. I have contacted my bank to dispute the charge per the Amazon representative. So disappointed!",

I finally had to call Amazon, and they just added the amount to my husband's wallet. That really defeated the purpose of sending him an e-gift card in the first place, since I had to tell him to look at his account to see that there was now money there. The Amazon rep had no idea why my card wouldn't go through, and even though he made sure the money got to the right account, it was a disappointment from a gift-giving perspective.",

All in all, the experience was a lovely one and I got to use my Amazon card right away. Incidentally there is a fee for the pleasure of this convience but for me it was worth it.",

Lucky for me I purchased them ahead of the dates needed, so they were actually not late. If you purchase Amazon Gift Cards online, be aware that they may take up to two days to be delivered, so purchase early. You can always specify a date in the future for their online delivery. Either way, they are the perfect gift for when you don't have a specific gift in mind and the giftee can make their own purchase.",

This is to me a great idea as well as a life saver for last minute gifts.",
