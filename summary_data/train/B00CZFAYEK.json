Lots of folks came by to comment on it as the barrel is the perfect setting for a winery! The cheese tools are sharp and quite handy as they're not huge. This would make a great gift for a wine drinker. It would also make a fun gift for a young couple getting married as part of a picnic basket themed gift. It does take up more room than just storing a few little cheese accessories, but it's definitely a statement piece and makes for a fun talking point.",

The barrel is cute enough to keep out on your buffet along with the knives and each knife works they way it's supposed to for each of the different cheeses I tried. The handles feel a bit like wine corks and are comfortable to hold. I was home alone when the product arrived so I treated myself to a private cheese and fruit snack party and watched the sun go down. Very nice way to end a day. I purchased this product at a discount but the opinion is my own and unbiased.",
