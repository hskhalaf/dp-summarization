We left water in for the whole weekend one time and when we went to use it we noticed it was filled with thousands of like fly larva or something. So gross! Had to scrub clean.

A little over three weeks in, the walls began sagging and caving in, and there's no way to keep them up unless you fill it all the way to the top. The walls sag again considerably after some water displacement when someone gets out of the pool. Of course, this all began happening after the return window closed, so I cannot exchange or get a refund, and I'm really disappointed. It ended up being a big waste of money.",
