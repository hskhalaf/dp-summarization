      "text": "To start, the earbuds sound very good and are decently comfortable. However, there is one very big problem that makes these bad. When inserted into your ears correctly and the cord it tapped (even very lightly), major feedback is sent through the drivers. It makes a loud bumping sound. Along with this, any time you even move your jaw or neck, you hear it super loudly, I think because of the way these are designed. At first I thought it was a defect, but I got a replacement pair and had the same issue. If you listen to music only when you don't move a single muscle, these are great. For everyone else, find a better pair.",

So far I'm really impressed with these: -Flat cable -Lightweight/comfortable -Really good bass (They're punchier than my Beats!) -Clear through mid-range and treble Finally, they're clear enough to accurately mix audio (they're $30...definitely not going to stand up against high-end reference monitors, but come on...that price?) but I'll need to remind myself that they're boosted on the low end...not really a problem.

Out of the box, the mid-bass is strong and lacking in all other frequencies, especially detail/presence. The sub-bass is weak, mid is kind of muddy, and the presence is UA (unauthorized absence). You can tell that the focus was bass, mostly mid bass at that. However, with the right EQ you can bring them to life and they're pretty decent at that point.",

I find the bass is also a bit muddy/hollow and meshes too much into the midbass. It some songs, namely songs with not so much midbass, it seems to be good as it comes off punchy. Ok for 30 bucks and sound profile it is going for. Material: 4/5 It seems pretty alright. I like flat headphone wires and these are it, also fairly thin.

The sound is wonderful and I would recommend them for that, just glue the squishy things on or something so they are not lost to the four winds.",

The build quality is amazing, and the confort is amazing. These headphones have been stepped on, flooded, and thrown around a million times, but they still work flawlessly. When these die, im just gonna buy another pair, because they are really are that good. And the bass is the absolute best you can get without spending $250 on some really nice earbuds.",

Although the person that you are talking with will hear the noise, the wearer cannot hear the noise, and will only know about the presence of the noise if the listener should mention it.",

Also they use a right-angle jack, which for my personal preference is a negative. Also, advertised is a \"tangle-free, Y-type flat cord\" and while it is \"flat,\" it is far more round than most other tangle-free cords.",

Note - bought the protection plan but that doesn\u2019t cover anything since they\u2019re still under Sony\u2019s guarantee - don\u2019t waste your money on those plans either.",
