Safe sleep guidelines put out by the AAP recommend that bassinet mattresses be no thicker than 1.5 inches and firm. Your baby does not need a plush bassinet mattress. However, you will need to buy sheets. I'd suggest searching for oval pocket sheets. Pretty much any sheet branded as fitting the Halo bassinet will also fit this bassinet. Pocket sheets are nice because there's no risk of the sheet coming loose in the middle of the night and posing a suffocation hazard.",

Its also difficult to zip up as the zipper goes past a metal bar and then is difficult to get back up past that bar again, each time is a struggle. We bought it to keep the cats off baby at night, but ended up keeping it open and locking the cats out of the room - then after a week we couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and bought a halo bassinest.",
