After relying on them for so long, once I stopped taking them, my body forgot how to pass anything naturally so I started struggling with constipation, hemorrhoids, and just over all painful digestion. These probiotics saved my butt, quite literally, but also my mental health. They are gentle and totally safe and healthy. I would recommend them to absolutely anyone! I even got my family to start taking them. If I hadn't found these I might've fallen back into my old, unhealthy habits, so I owe Rainbow Light a huge thank you!
