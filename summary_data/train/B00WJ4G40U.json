Unfortunately, after about 1 year, the mattress began breaking down making very soft dips where our bodies lay at night losing permanent firmness. We kept it since we were financing it, but now it was time to try Tempur-Pedic. We could not be happier! It's firm and very comfortable providing great support where needed. I have several slipped discs including one in my neck and this has been the best mattress for relief that I have ever slept on. Combined with using the 'my pillow', we are finally getting true rest at night. Hopefully it keeps its firmness more than a year!",

It legitimately feels medium soft and its obvious the first moment you touch it. The design is plush but clean, easy to get bed sheets over it without help. The price though? I feel like you're paying for the brand more than anything else. It's not a miracle mattress, I've had more comfortable beds for lower rates. Much much lower rates.",
