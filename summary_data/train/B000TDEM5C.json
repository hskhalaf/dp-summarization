Music sounded better after I disconnected the sub altogether. Perhaps I got a defective one and the driver itself was damaged or the box itself wasn\u2019t sealed properly. All I know is it was an extreme disappointment at that price point. Returning to Amazon and looking into other brands.",

Greater clarity, more available volume, increased transparency, and superior imaging and sound staging. The Amazon description and the earlier reviews are wrong for the subwoofers made after 2012. The crossover control does work with ANY and ALL inputs. I used the RCA subwoofer output from the inclines to the RCA subwoofer input in the sub, with the crossover frequency set between 85 and 100 hz (per a suggestion from Definitive Technology customer support). Highly recommended combination if you are able to use the Inclines.",

The volme control is a handy feature as are the various ways to connect it to the source. I took off one star because Def Tech rates the frequency response down to 20 hz. In reality the bottom end is 30 hz. Also a detractor is Def Tech's customer support that leaves a lot to be desired. All in all, though, you won't be disappointed.",

    "description": "Definitive Technology Pro sub 800\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nThe Low Frequency Effects (LFE) of a movie\u2019s soundtrack bring excitement, realism and just plain fun to action, adventure and sci-fi movies.

Worry not, Definitive has bass down pat. The ProSub 800 features a 300 Watt amplifier driving a high-excursion 8 inch front-mounted direct-radiating woofer that is pressure-coupled to an 8 inch Low Bass radiator on the bottom of the enclosure. The net radiating area of the ProSub 800 is 27% greater than a single 10 inch woofer but with better speed, pitch definition and control.\n\n\n\nPressure-coupled Low Bass Radiator on the enclosure bottom works to produce deep, soul-stirring bass\n\n\nSide-mounted volume control makes bass level adjustment easy and convenient\n\nTHE ULTIMATE IN BASS PERFORMANCE FOR MAXIMUM ENJOYMENT FROM YOUR MUSIC AND MOVIES\nDefinitive's ProSub 800 is an advanced technology subwoofer with built-in high-power, high-current amplifier and sophisticated electronic crossover in combination with an 8 inch driver of the highest quality.

In addition, tremendous current reserves, high peak-power capabilities and two protection circuits ensure that these subwoofers can never be overdriven. There is also a convenient, signal-sensing, auto on/off feature.\n\nSUPERIOR DETAIL AND LIGHTNING-FAST TRANSIENT RESPONSE\nThe powerful, high-definition driver delivers rock-solid low distortion bass, reaching down to the lowest subsonic frequencies, with an outstanding quality of superior transient response. The special ultra-stiff, low-mass cone (for super-fast transient response) is joined to a butyl rubber surround and long-throw voice coil and spider. The incredibly rigid baskets are engineered to hold the massive magnet structures and large voice coils in absolute alignment. The high temperature voice coil is aluminum wound with triple insulated ultra-pure copper wire and baked in epoxy for power handling in excess of 750 watts.\n\nROCK SOLID NON-RESONANT CABINETS ENSURE PURE LOW DISTORTION RESPONSE\nThe cabinet of a loudspeaker plays a large part in its sonic performance. Resonance and vibration can add unwanted distortion as well as drain away important energy from the system. Definitive's subwoofers utilize monocoque cabinets, which have been specifically engineered to be totally inert and vibration free, to ensure you of absolutely pure sonic reproduction. Monocoque means that the cabinet is of a unitized construction where all panels are permanently joined together into one solid structure. The cabinet walls themselves are high-density MDF fused together by space-age polymer adhesives. The front and rear baffles are extra thick and the cabinets each incorporate multiple internal braces to ensure total solidity.\n\nCOMPLETELY ADJUSTABLE ELECTRONIC CROSSOVERS ASSURE A PERFECT MATCH TO YOUR SYSTEM AND ROOM\nThe sophisticated low distortion electronic crossover is a masterpiece of design and execution. It contains a complete range of hookups, circuitry and features which allow the subwoofers to be connected and perfectly blended with any system as well as adjusted for optimum performance in any room.\n\nThe ProSub 800 features a continuously adjustable low pass filter control which allow you to choose a high frequency roll-off of from 40 to 150 Hz. This unique \"dual stage\" roll-off is extremely steep which ensures perfect blending with your main speakers as well as eliminating unwanted midrange from the subwoofer. This is especially important because it gives you much greater flexibility in placing your subwoofer in your room without being able to hear where it is located. There is also a separate low-level direct LFE input for Dolby Digital which bypasses the crossover network. The subwoofer level control is conveniently mounted on the side of the enclosure instead of the rear panel, making it easy to reach. It allows you to perfectly adjust the volume of the subwoofer to match your system and room as well as to fulfill your own personal sonic preferences.\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n * Driver Complement: One high-definition 8\" woofer pressure coupled to one 8\" low bass radiator\n * Frequency Response: 20 Hz \u2013 150 Hz\n * Internal Amplifier Power: 300 watts\n * Auto On / Off: Signal Sensing\n * Power Requirements: 110 volts Alternating Current (US)\n * High Level Inputs: Two pairs of 5 way binding posts\n * High Level Outputs: Two pairs of 5 way binding posts\n * Low Level Inputs: One LFE input (for SW preout only)\n * High Pass Crossover: Non Variable 6 dB/octave @ 80 Hz: Available only with high level inputs and outputs\n * Low Pass Crossover: 24 dB/octave, continuously variable from 40 Hz \u2013 150 Hz ( Available with high level inputs only)\n * Dimensions: 10-5/16\" W x 15-3/4\" D x 12-7/8\" H (26.2 x 40.0 x 32.7 cm)\n * Weight: 26 lbs (11.8 kg)",
