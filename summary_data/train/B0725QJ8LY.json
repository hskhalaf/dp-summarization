I wasn't able to use that full inversion at first, it took a couple weeks to work up to it but now I don't use the pin to set the degree anymore so I'm glad I got a device that was capable of 180. I do find the ankle cuffs really not comfortable so what I do is use a hand towel over each leg to make it easier to deal with.",

Make sure you have someone with you the first time in case you can't get back up. I was able to get back up without a problem. I felt the pressure off my lower back after first use and I have a severe sciatica problem. I'm very happy with my investment. Thank you",

For the price it would have been great if they put wheels on one end so you cant tilt and move it around like a workout bench. If you are limited on space and need to shuffle things around when you want to invert, I would suggest you pass on this and recommend you look for something that is more portable and possibly can fold up. If you have the space to leave it out, then its an awesome inverter and I love the shape. Looks way better than the cheapo triangle framed inverters.",

      "text": "The ankle holds do not work as I would like. They feel tight when you are upright, but as soon as I flip over I feel like I am only being held up by keeping my feet bent and the area around the ankles is loose. I have meant to try this wearing shoes to see if that makes it more comfortable. I wish the straps were on both shoulders instead of just one. I think if I felt less like I was going to fall out of the equipment I would use it much more often.",
