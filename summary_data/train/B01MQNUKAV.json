The padding is more than sufficient with removable Velcro pieces for the head stovk , neck rest, and base. Making me think this case will fit most guitars. All my personal equipment fits including my tools laptop i-rig cables strings and even my foldable stand. If you need more room they have attached sturdy metal rings to attach other storage. The materiel is thick and feels very durable. And the zippers seem the same. Honestly the bag functions and feels great to carry along with looking even better than it does in the photo.",

Closing the flap securely over the zippered enclosure is an exercise in futility. It's loose and doesn't secure anything other than frustration. It just falls open. There's no way to make this thing latch securely. It flops open as you're carrying the case and offers no security whatsoever. What a STUPID idea.",

The case included velcro attachable padded inserts that allows you to customize the fit of the case to your particular instrument.
