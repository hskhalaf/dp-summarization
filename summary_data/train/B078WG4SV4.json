I ended up finding some great deals at a Reebok outlet with no illusions about the quality we'd get there. I purchased a pair for each of my 4 boys and have been blown away by their durability! These look great, are comfortable, and have held up well. The price was unbeatable! Will only buy Reeboks for my boys from now on!",
