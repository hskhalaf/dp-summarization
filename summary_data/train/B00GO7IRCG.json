Can have as many sd cards as you want so you can have as many calls as you want. Unit is small and calls are surprisingly loud and clear. Remote seems to work well.

Check your state laws...I replace my batteries the first of the season and then about half way thought the season..I have got over 500 yards in range with this call.. Oh yes,, This call works on different sound format too...",

On a semi windy day this thing can hardly be heard on the loudest setting!!! I then bought an external speaker which I tested and it was way louder, only problem is the Icotec won't play to a non ICOtech speaker. Maybe i should just cut my losses and just trap coyotes, this thing is a joke.",

Suggested product ICOtec AD400 or PD200 decoy. Programmability is made easy with the NEW GEN2 GC350. All calls are loaded and played directly from a standard size Class4 SD Media Card. Any custom audio file saved as a .mp3 or a .wav (16 bit or less) file format can be played by the GEN2 GC350. ICOtec has an exclusive FREE audio call library that is accessible from our website. All free calls are encrypted and playable only by an ICOtec programmable caller. The unit requires 4 AA (1.5 volt batteries) and the remote requires one 23A 12 volt battery. BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED.

Light weight, compact, easy to operate, fantastic quality audio calls, very long range remote, low power consumption and one of the lowest prices available for a great programmable call.
