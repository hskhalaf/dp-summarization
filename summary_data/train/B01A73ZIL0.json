      "text": "These Sades headphones are awesome! Very comfortable, even after extended periods. Sound is great, and the digital surround sound is really quite immersive. Keep in mind its not true surround sound, but it's still great quality and way better than earbuds. The headphones are really lightweight despite looking quite larger and bulky. However, the headphones are physically bulky in design. This doesn't bother me though... The micropone which folds out from the left earcup is a little on the under-sensitive side. Meaning you may have to adjust your Mic sensitivity on your PC or concole to fine tune the loudness of your voice. Other than that, these are an awesome budget friendly pair of headphones for anyone.",

I removed the USB and plugged it in again, Win10 states, \"USB Device is Not Recognized\". All troubleshooting measures failed and Sades did not have a specific driver for this model. These headphones seriously died in transmission! I am really disappointed, these are nicely engineered headphones with a fatal flaw on Win10, I suppose..",

In regards to this, keep in mind, these headphones are also bass-oriented. I had to get a separate windows equalizer to change my trims, as there seemed to not be enough treble going through the USB audio driver. Other than that, I'm pretty happy with them.

Sound quality is quite sufficient for my needs - the occasional movie and youtube video. I'm not looking for audiophile quality, but this had good depth of sound.

      "text": "I've had it for about 7 months Picked it up because they were cheap with positive reviews and wanted something to listen with at work. At first, yeah, sorta noise canceling and comfortable but that only lasts maybe 1-2 hrs into wearing them. These are definitely for teenagers or adults with small heads. They do look cool but that is it. If you are a hardcore gamer and plan on 8hrs if gaming then i'd suggest saving your pennies for a decent head set in the 60$+ range. Not sure if this is a \"get what you pay for\" but if it is then GG and recommend keeping your options open for a different set in this price range.",

The LED lights are not working (thank god) but the right side of the headset does not work unless I tilt the cord a certain way, leaving a quiet sound only in the left side. Going to pick up a new headset for Christmas more than likely. For $25 this headset did well, but with no customer support and little customization, I'd recommend you go with a different brand and better quality headset.",

It's on the heavier side, but still pretty comfortable. It's quite well padded. The ear pieces fit completely over my ears. It doesn't slip too much. It seems to be pretty sturdy, and the cord itself is surprisingly tough. I like that it's USB. I am happy with this purchase. We will see how it goes long-term.",

I use razor sound pro ( which there is a free version that will help) with the program and these head phones it really sounds nice and the quality is of a 150 dollar head set. Unfortunately I cant say anything about the mic since I own a studio style set up so I have no reason to test this. Huge thumbs up, I will buy again!",

Note that the mute buttons for the mic and sound does not give off any indication when pressed, making it hard to tell if the user is muted or not, and the headset light (can be quite bright at night) cannot be turned of. Update: the controller malfunctioned after a couple months, the increase volume button now reduces the volume so I have 2 buttons that reduces the volume. Minor issue for me since I adjust my volume on my keyboard, but may be concerning for others.",
