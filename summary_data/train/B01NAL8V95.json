We just bought 2 of the toddler size and 2 of the adult (cot) size for house guests and they were very happy sleeping on them for the week. Absolutely the best. But that's not why I'm posting, I'm posting because I found the cutest carry case that fits the toddler size exactly. It's the \"Large Folding Fabric Storage Bags for Blanket Comforter Clothes,High Density Material,Dual Zipper Dual Handle,Waterproof and Breathable(Pink,24\"x20\"x11\")\". I measured the folded up mat and looked all over Amazon for a case that fit and this one is perfect.",

I think the zipper must have been defective, so I have written to the company to see if they will give me a replacement cover (I wasn't able to find a replacement available anywhere, even on the manufacturer website).",

It is soft, has no chemical odor, and is low to the ground so I don't have to worry about her falling and hurting herself like I did when she slept in my bed. It's larger than you would think and I can see her having this bed for a few more years (though hopefully we will have moved to a larger place by then).",

So far, however, I haven't found any which means this one is the best I've found that fits my needs.
