I ended up with an entire collection for my daughter's room for less than $700 - I purchased the South Shore crib, changing table and drawer chest and they are all great quality and had no issues putting together.

Assembly....... I have built a fair amount of furniture, I have NEVER had so much trouble assembling something so basic. The directions are not entirely correct either. The drawers.... for as much as this things weighs you would thing the drawer bottoms would be more than what appears to be extra thick cardboard. The drawer pulls...why is the screw like 3.5\u201d long and nearly impossible to completely tighten? I don\u2019t imagine this piece lasting 6 months. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone.",

I bought 3 baskets for mine. One is for socks, one is for lotions, powders, etc. and one is for diapers. The drawers a large enough to fit all my blankets and some clothes that I chose to not hang up. I highly recommend this product.",

I did, however, use more nails for the back panel than were provided with the hardware. It'll do the trick.",
