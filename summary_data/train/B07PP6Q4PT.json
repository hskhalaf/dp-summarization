I have snorkeled all over the Caribbean while on cruises, and they always give you just the goggles and a seperate snorkel. This thing is a game changer, so much easier to use! I like the fact that it breaks down for easy transport in the mesh bag thats included. The go pro mount made it possible to get some awesome pictures and video as well! You wont be disappointed with this mask!",

At first it felt weird to have the whole face covered compared to the regular snorkeling mask, but after swimming a bit I got used to it. It definitely has a nice wide view maybe even better (since this mask is brand new) than my old snorkeling mask. I think I will give this mask to mom or cousin who are not very good swimmers. I think it will make them more comfortable in the water because it is more user friendly for non-swimmers. Overall, I think the quality of the mask is good and worth the money.",

Generally, it is hugely better than the traditional set and the fogging is isolated to the breathing area, meaning you can always see. The fit was a bit uncomfortable and you may experience a little water seeping in, but again, better than the traditional (which did all these things much worse). Viewability is fantastic. I recommend this but try the sizes to get the comfort you need.",

The view and performance were excellent. While researching the mask I took note of a few complaints about inhibited air intake. I did not experience that at all.

Also, just as designed, the moment the snorkel goes under water it will not let in any water -- this is great in open water with waves on the surface that love to dump into a snorkel.

My husband panicked a little at first because it is slightly different than just breathing air. Take your time, stay calm and just breath and you'll be fine.",

And no more excursions where you have to share mouth pieces. You just put the mask on and breathe normally out of your nose or mouth. The mask gives you a much better view as it\u2019s doesn\u2019t block your peripheral vision. My advice would be to buy some anti fog spray with it. I had 0% fog the entire trip.",

Where the snorkel tube connects with the mask there is no seal between incoming and out going air channels allowing the two to mix. In fact, the path of least resistance for exhaled air appears to be through this gap between the supposed separate channels resulting in exhaled air being directed into the incoming air channel where only fresh air should be. This failure is not in the mask itself but between the connecting point of the snorkel tube and mask.",

At the end of 6 days, my lungs noticeably hurt from inhaling with resistance. Other than that negative there is nothing to dislke about the product.",

Mask sort of folds down (the snorkel part detaches) and they provide a mesh bag for carry & storage. It's not a glamorous bag, but it's really nice touch to include a such functional/usable bag.
