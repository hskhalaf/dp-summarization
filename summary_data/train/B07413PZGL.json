      "text": "This is a fantastic stem for the money. Unlike some other reviews, I had no issues with the Allen bolts stripping. The only thing to be aware of is that the part of the stem that mounts to the steer tube is fairly thin, so there is a good chance you are going to have to add a headset spacer or cut your steer tube down slightly. I mounted this on my trail bike, which I ride aggressively, including some fairly large drops and jumps. I\u2019ve had it on my bike for about four months, so I don\u2019t think durability is any issue at all.",

This greatly helped decrease the amount of leaning I have to do while riding. If you are tall and have a little discomfort and/or want the added ability of more control over steering please make this easy purchase. Dollar for dollar you will greatly appreciate the change this bike stem will make to your biking experience. Shipping was quick and well packed.",

Really blends in nicely with the rest of my bicycle. I'm reviving an old Gary Fisher mtb, and this has been a very important component to enhanced handling and is aesthetically pleasing.

I found this stem to be well made and certainly very strong although it is alittle heavy for those who are weight conscious. The reason that I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is: it has no knurling or grooves to prevent slick handlebars from slipping. You have to cinch down the cap screws tighter than what you would think is necessary. After arriving at that conclusion I have had no problem with slipping handlebars. Overall I think this is a good product.",

Second one went a lot faster for me to install after learning to keep the fork tight against head tube. I thought I got them right enough around the fork but took a pretty good fall and it twisted a little so my wheel was not inline with my handle bars. Just make sure to get them right enough and this should not happen. I'm happy so far! A cheap way to test out if I like the shorter stem and the quality seems good enough it'll last me a while.",

I\u2019ve found most stems to be 40-50mm for a stack height on the steer tube where this one is only 30mm. If you plan on purchasing this make sure you either want to cut your steer tube down or have a 10mm spacer handy. Other than that the product is great. Light-weight. Great color. Seems like decent construction so far. I\u2019ll update after a few trail rides if anything changes.",

Took it straight to Keystone Colorado and it performed flawlessly. 10 years ago stem this good could have being 6 times more expensive. May be I scored good batch, may be not.
