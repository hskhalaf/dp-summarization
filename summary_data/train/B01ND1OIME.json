My only complaint is that this came delivered in the box it comes in-so my husband knew ahead of time that I got it for him. If I would have known that, I would have put the gift option- I figured it would come in a normal amazon box and it did not.",

The mat rolls out smooth and lays flat without getting bunched up. As far as putting mats go, I highly recommend this for practice.",
