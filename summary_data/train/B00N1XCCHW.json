      "text": "This stuff is great, have ordered it several times. In the past I just rinsed fruit or vegetables, but I was at the grocery store recently and saw a very cute kid touching all the fruit. He also had a runny nose, and I just thought, 'better remember to really wash the fruit when I get home.' The great thing about Veggie Wash is you can feel the wax film wash off of certain fruit. It really does a great job of cleaning and doesn't leave any odd smell or taste. As I said, I've bought this before and make sure my kitchen always has a spray bottle nearby.",

It gets the white coating that they come with from the grocery store right off. Just spray this stuff on, gently rub the grapes in your hands, and rinse. Viola! It's gone.",

I use it on all my larger size fruits and vegetables (i.e. apples, oranges, lemons, mangos, melons, avocados, tomatoes, potatoes). Sometimes, I can't believe the dirt that comes off with the spray before I even rinse them off with water. Unless I get something from my own garden, I never cut or eat produce without cleaning it first. I especially like this spray because it not only removes the dirt but also takes the wax off apples and other produce.",

All you need to do is just spray all over those fruits in a bowl, then rinse with running water after about 30 seconds. You can notice the result right away. Also, it can easily remove those tiny \" white hairs\" on the outer layer of peaches in seconds. Because those tiny hairy stuff gives me allergic reaction. But, now, I can enjoy peaches again. I will commend to design a travel size to go with the package, so people can carry it with them when leaving their house.",

I enjoy that it gives the fruit a clean wash and you can see the grime rinse off. The fruit tastes delicious and it was pretty easy to use. Sprayed some into a bowl with water let it sit and then slowly rotated came out looking clean. I clean and cut the fruit all at once so it didn't add to my process at all.",
