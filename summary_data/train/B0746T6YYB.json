The tea requires 2 cups of water, therefore makes 30 cups. I feel as if this was a poor marketing tactic and unfair to customers. 15 tea bags for $12 is not worth it in my opinion.",

Like i can feel my uterus and ovaries doing some kind of workout. Im taking it as a good sign. Put a little faith and try this. Its organic and its better than putting the meds and chemicals that are cancer causing in your body. Baby dust and prayers to all of us trying!",
