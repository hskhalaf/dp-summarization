Not intended to underneath since it can get pretty itchy. Also, not comfortable if you will be sitting.",

Want to avoid stretch marks - use this. I wore this under my clothing and while exercising like the last trimester and I didnt have a single stretch mark.

I got an XL and should have got a L but it works okay just crosses over a bit more than I would like. I\u2019m 210lb at 38 weeks and 5\u20195\u201d carrying my second child. Only bad thing about it is that it\u2019s a three piece belt (tummy band, back support, over bump band) and it takes a minute to get it all off to go to the bathroom (happens a lot at 38wks!)",

But, she said when standing and walking it gives great support. The top strap itches her stomach. So I suggested that she puts it on over her tank top. Overall, great belly band for rhw price",

I received the medium at the end of July and like the last item, a few weeks later when I take a deep breath the Velcro pops off. Not what you would expect for the price.

It\u2019s fairly stiff and crinkles uncomfortably. If I need to sit down or bend it slides up and I have to pull it back in place almost every 10 min. 3. It\u2019s almost impossible to hide under summer clothes, you can see the stiff edges and you can definitely tell it is there unless you really layer your clothes.",

My only complaints are that it didn't come with instructions on placement, the velcro often sticks to mesh portions of the belt (snagging and fraying more delicate areas), and it's VERY ITCHY in areas on the back portion - this is especially troublesome because I need to wear at least two layers under it (a single shirt still allows the itchy/pokey fibers to stick through). Wearing dual layers under it and then another on top (clothes so that I can go out in public) makes it very uncomfortable and hot, so I really only use this while I'm at home.",
