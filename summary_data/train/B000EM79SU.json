I\u2019m upset about it too, because it truly is moisturizing. But for those of us with sensitive skin, it no longer works. Not sure why they had to fix something that wasn\u2019t broken.",

And I usually end-up tossing the other stuff and going right back to this conditioner. I have medium, straight hair and not too dry, not too oily and this product works extremely well for my hair. The big bonus, you don't need a heaping handful - a lil' dab will do ya just fine. And it smells nice; clean and simple, not like a tropical drink or cheap perfume. It's a really high-quality product.",
