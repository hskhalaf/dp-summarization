Using towels to stop the flow was a Big job and I worried about wet base boards. Then I discovered these \u201csocks\u201d. While the water accumulated in the socks must be removed after a long and hard rain, that is a lot better than watching towels become saturated, replace with dry towels, carry wet towels in a bucket to the dry dryer, then repeat. It rains in Texas.",

After continuing to mop daily I found these to put around the perimeter of the basement. They effectively held the water so it did not spread & continue to peel up the paint on the concrete floor. I was able to wring them out and lay on my deck for them to dry out and was able to re-use them. Would also be great for putting around a sump crock during a power outage. I highly recommend!!",
