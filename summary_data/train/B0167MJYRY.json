I have it in my favorites for quick purchase. Also leave them in fridge so they don\u2019t get bacteria on them especially if your dog doesn\u2019t eat the whole stick.

My last bag turned out to be over the acceptable stink-threshold, however, and I noted that in my seller review. I was pleased and surprised when the seller gave me an unsolicited refund. I would have continued purchasing them regardless (having tried others, this is a good value), but I really appreciated being treated as a valued customer.",

      "text": "After reading reviews for several dog chews and bully sticks, these are best value for money. But lately there have been concerns/questions regarding the product safety. I hope they improve their quality and inspect every bully stick a they claim they do so. Anyways I recently purchased a new batch and my little beagle seems to be enjoying it. The sticks are fully filled and right length. Thickness did vary but it made up as some very medium and some very thick. Also received one extra bully stick which made me happy. But again, this puts in thoughts of whether they really inspect their products.",

She loves the Bully Sticks and chews on them throughout the day.The sticks are solid stay intact while the puppy chews. It eventually breaks down but it takes a long time. If my puppy starts to chew on something else I just replace it with a Bully Stick. I give the product the highest recommendation because it solves the chewing problem.",
