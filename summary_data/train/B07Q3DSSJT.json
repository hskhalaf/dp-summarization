One suggestion, that would expand it for use with older children: a set of stickers for writing down additional suggestions of things to do? And if they could be removable, even better.

      "text": "It is a very good book for kids to learn what positive actions to take depending how they feel. Also it is very good that the action has visual image. That way it is even good for younger kids, who can't read. It will plant visual image in their brain, how to react when certain feelings come up. It would be useful for adults as well. :) For adults it would make great office gift :)",
