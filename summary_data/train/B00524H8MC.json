The light source is even worse than what I had previously that eventually died on me. This product did not live up to its hype at all.",

As a contingency, however, I thought it was only prudent to keep this Carson 5x magnifier in my kit, along with (hard copies) of my: Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, '17 FAR AIM and Ground School/Flight/Instruments Manual(s), et al., etc. I recommend this \"great\" Carson 5x, \"bigly.\"",

The case holds three triple-A batteries, but if the cover for the batteries is on the light does not work, so I need to have the batteries exposed and easy to fall out if I want to use the light. The magnifying glass is square but only has an effective circular lens that is smaller than the whole piece, so reading is limited. I will invest in a higher quality item next time - frustrations of use not worth the cheap price.",

The batteries are easy to change and last a long time. If this company comes out with larger versions I would buy those too! A fantastic price for this quality, I would pay twice that amount for it.

The drawback to the freebie is a conventional bulb that stopped working shortly after I first started using it. Last word - the Carson magnifier has twice the magnifying power, but that is what makes it so poor for more general use.",

The item is not big to begin with, so you're not getting the full magnification across the entire lens area that you might want or need. I generally reach for my non-lighted L-shaped 3 X 5 glass magnifier with an inset circle with stronger magnification for the really tiny close-up magnification rather than this one.",
