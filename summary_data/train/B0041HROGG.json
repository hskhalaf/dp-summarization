That small point set aside, the controller itself is very nice! The all silver finish really adds a nice change to the standard white and black that everyone else has. Overall, this was a good purchase but I wish Microsoft would put some more thought into making batteries that don't die so quickly.",

      "text": "I was really surprised at how much I liked this controller. Anyone who has played on the 360 knows the D-pad is severely lacking in responsiveness. The design of this controller is simple, yet effective. I'm surprised Microsoft has not adapted this design for all of its controllers. The only downside, is that it comes with a Play and Charge kit(which is why they tack on the additional cost). The charging kit is the only downside to this purchase. The battery pack does not seem to hold a charge very long. I recommend traditional batteries. All in all, a good purchase if you are a serious gamer, or are thinking of purchasing for one.",

The real reason I initially bought this was because my old rechargeable controller died and I was sick of having the cord get in the way in my gaming space. The D-pad pop out bit is cool but really more of a gimmick. I could see where it's useful to a point but not enough to really be worth buying as a number one feature. Overall, a good replacement if you want a rechargeable controller again. I wouldn't buy a stack of them, but as a main controller it's perfect.",

I ordered another one, and I hope it's in mint condition this time. However, don't buy from the seller called SpaceBound, Inc., just to be on the safe side.

I have a friend who had the exact same problem with this controller, so I don't think it is just a problem with mine. I also never had this problem with the old wireless controllers.

I returned my controller within the next couple of days and bought the traditional controller. If they could fix this d-pad issue I would give the controller 5 out of 5 but this is kind of a significant issue so its not a good buy.",

The only negative is the gap between the d pad and the controler skin. It will collect lots of stuff and almost needs to be taken apart to be cleaned. Had I. Known that I would have just bought a new skin and new joysticks. But aside from that one minor flaw, its a bad a** looking controler. Would still recomend",

Cheaper that other options. Cons: None. It's an xbox remote with an unnecessary add on. Do you like your current controller? This one is the same so if you need another one you should buy this one because it's the cheapest option.",

It basically works exactly like the original xbox 360 controller so if your expecting the new d-pad to be far superior to the original your out of luck. The d-pad is somewhat improved but not enough to buy a new control if you do not need one. Other than that the control looks better than any xbox control I have owned and it comes with a rechargeable battery so its convenient and a fair price for 45 bucks.",
