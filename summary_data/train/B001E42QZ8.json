The microphone is fine and doesn't require any setting up. The 5.1 surround sound is great They're only \u00a326.99 refurbished and in excellent condition!! I would definitely pick these over any other > \u00a3100 headset.",

My previous headset (not by this manufacturer) ended up with a snapped lead but this has excellent shielding so I don't think it will suffer the same fate. Choice of either USB or jack plug fittings and it works with Skype. I have also used this on a mac and PC and it works fine on both. Very good product.",

The product is excellent, although the mic is now faulty just 30 days after purchasing. It is lightweight and really comfortable with a velvety sort of material on the rings of the headphones. The sound produced is good, not amazing whilst listening to music but is amazing in game. i was a bit disappointed with the amount of bass produced but it wasn't a big deal. However the mic has become faulty making a buzzing sound constantly. However the plantronics customer support was excellent and a free delivery has been arranged for them to replace it.",

I've not really tested with many games but those I have, are all fine. They can get a little hot if you wear them for hours, so four stars not five.",

Trackir Proclip took some persuading to fit on side but with small modifications it is now a very stable platform for the head-tracker. I'd have no trouble recommending this producy if it was a little cheaper. \u00a340 would be a good price.
