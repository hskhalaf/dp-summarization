I knew my teeth weren't a perfect white but I knew they weren't some ugly shade of yellow. So as an impulse buy I bought some charcoal toothpaste... I took my before photos, eagerly waiting for that perfect white smile. I didn't see results after a few days, or a week as some reviews have claimed. It was almost 3 months before I noticed that nice dental commercial white. So I finally took my after photo today.",

I was very impressed with the immediate results of this toothpaste. Right after using it for the first time there was a big difference in the appearance of my teeth the same as that of just having had my teeth cleaned at the dentist and they just keep getting whiter! I recommend it.",

Not a blinding white, but that's OK since that's not natural! I'm happy with the results and will reorder when needed :-)",

I think the taste is very pleasant and the charcoal just takes getting used to. I do use a Phillip's sonicare and have since Christmas. Mostly twice daily brushing, but sometimes just AM. I have used whitening products in the past and dont anyone due to enamel wear. So I am very happy that this actually works without increased sensitivity",

Its less concentrated than other charcoal toothpastes on the market and doesnt foam very much, and you have to use quite a bit at one time for it to cover all your teeth. Its flavor is very mild, which is nice. I will likely be buying this again!",
