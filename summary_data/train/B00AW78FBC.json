My son did this same swap to his car, with the same results.",

Also the temp did drop on the gauge so it runs slightly cooler. All shifts are smoother. Not saying that just because its a little expensive and its wishful thinking. I am a pessimist so....It really does shift smoother. If you like to hang on to your truck/cars for a long time this will be worth it.",

All of their products are way beyond standard fluids. I had to replace my auto trans gasket due to it leaking and replaced all the fluid with the Max ATF. Prior to the fluid change, my transmission was a bit clunky going in and out of gear. With the trans fluid changed to RP it no longer clunks and it shifts smoother than ever. If you haven't made the switch to royal purple for anything fluid related, spend the extra money and buy the best!",

I have a 2004 infiniti i35 wich is a four speed automatic. so the car would kick each shift. also started getting some vibration at highway speeds. once I changed over to the royal purple atf the vibration at highway speeds went away and the shifts became a lot smoother. except from first to second that always had a slight kick to it but it was better then before. I've been running the car for 1000 miles so we'll see if it has the same results as the amsoil. hopefully not.",

They both seem to have great specs on paper with Amsoil has a slight edge on the viscosity around 100C degree, other than that, they are pretty much the same. Both are synthetic. The only difference is RP is actually purple in color and you can get it off of Amazon. Amsoil, you have to buy direct.",

    "description": "Size:1 Quart, Case of 6Royal Purple Max ATF High Performance Multi-Spec Synthetic Automatic Transmission Fluid is a synthetic, high performance, automatic transmission fluid. Its high film strength helps to dramatically reduce heat and wear. Automatic transmissions generate a great deal of heat and depend on the transmission fluid for cooling and protection. More than 90 percent of all automatic transmission failures are caused by overheating. A 20 degree Fahrenheit reduction in fluid temperature can double the life of the transmission. Max ATF significantly reduces heat to extend the life of your transmission. Max ATF is fully compatible and can be mixed with other automatic transmission fluids; however, for the best results drain or flush the current oil and then fill with Max ATF.",
