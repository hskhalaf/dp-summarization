      "text": "This is another amazing lens from Olympus. I have the 40-150 f2.8 and this is every bit as good, it's become my walkabout lens. Sharp even wide open at 12mm. I bought mine through Amazon from Camarthan Cameras, it was split from a kit so sold as second hand, having checked with the supplier they are unused, it just that you don't get the box(unless it's a brownie I don't take pictures with the box!). This made the lens over \u00a3200 cheaper. I registered the lens on the Olympus site and they confirmed the warranty plus their usual 6 month extension. Highly recommend Camarthan Cameras great to deal with and friendly on the phone.",

Looks like quality, works like quality, feels like quality... robust, solid, smooth action. Does perfect landscapes, does perfect macros, and portraits, and anything inbetween.... and is as good as any prime lens of any genre I've ever owned. I sold four lenses to buy this, and it was worth it...because this is so good I now don't need those 4 lenses...and that's all that matters!",

I'm using it on an OMD-M5 to good effect no doubt the EM1 would make even more of it's capabilities.",

It gives just that little extra wide angle from the kit lens on my EM-10 MkII with a satisfying weight, fast auto focus (manual focussing is just a slide of the focus ring away if you wished), firm but not over-tight action on the zoom and it has proved useful in lower light situations whilst taking church interior shots. As a novice it feels well balanced too and came supplied with lens hood and pouch. True, I could have purchased two lesser lenses for the price but I've ended up with a great all-rounder and feel confident in saving for the 40-150mm PRO lens.",

(The camera body stabilizes images) Fantastic lens, really sharp through all the stops (slight softening at zoom but that's being really picky) and as an incredibly virtually distortion free lens works great as a taking lens for a SLR magic Anamorphot (from about 18mm onwards- vignettes before then) The wide angle is great (24mm @ 35mm equivalent, 28mm when filming 4K on GH4) and sharp edge to edge. Peaking (guides) and auto focusing/aperture etc all still work with the GH4 (electronic zoom not applicable). Very happy with this being the ONLY lens I will need. Pro quality indeed.",
