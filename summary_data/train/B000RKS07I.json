There just no way to seal the gap between the nose and eyes. So I figured anti fog glasses would be perfect. Nope, not at all. The warm air from breathing hits the glasses and they fog right up so much that it actually drips off of the lens. I can still use them for anything else not involving masks but the whole point of getting them was for the anti fog while wearing a mask and it fails.",

My problem is that most make my face sweat so much that within minutes of working in the Florida heat, I cannot see what I'm doing. I took a chance on the Dewalt glasses because I have been favorably impressed with their other products. I was not disappointed. These are simply the best safety glasses I have ever owned. Guess hubby will have to find something else to fuss about.",

I have kids running around my shop, and the first thing on the list after tape measures for \"items that magically disappear\" are my safety glasses. So I have several pairs of these in hiding, so when one pair disappears I can pull out another and keep working. I expect one ALL of my glasses will make their way home and I will have a giant stack of glasses. Until then, these are very nice and inexpensive enough that I can just keep an extra pair or two on hand and prevent the down time and frustration of continually searching for my glasses.",
