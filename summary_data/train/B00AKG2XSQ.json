The only problem was a small crack in the frame on the side, but it didn't impede it's use, and for the price I really couldn't argue.",

Second, you cannot install apps on microSD card b/c the phone just doesn't like it, even through root and Android SDK program. Though it does get the job done. I have had no complaints with its performance so far. The occasional restart is required, but that is a standard that any computer electronic owner should do.",

Speaker volume is a little low when using speaker phone and GPS. Camera is OK for the price. Only about 2G of space for applications and no good way to put apps on the SD card. I don't use many large apps anyway, but with apps getting bigger, I'll probably need to upgrade in a few years.",

I would give it a single star, except that the price was good.

My only negative is the complete lack of a notification light which means you can't tell if you got a message, call, anything. You can't even tell if its charging. But only 1 star off for that.",

Even though the specs are much worse than my friend's Galaxy Nexus 3, the responsiveness is much better and prompted him to root his phone due to being showed up by this cheap phone. Also, LG updated the phone to Jelly Bean recently through an OTA update. Highly recommended!",
