My daughter is VERY wiggly and it was sliding all over the place and I was not comfortable with it at all. I liked the quality and height so my husband and I decided to add heavy duty Velcro to attach the two pieces. It is far more secure and functional now.",

Attaching the booster to the chair was not easy as well, as the shortest strap settings were too long for my chairs (solid oak chairs--nothing unusual). In addition, as others mentioned, the insert wobbles, which I think led to my daughter being uncomfortable as well. There are better choices out there.",

It's convenient, but somewhat annoying at how easy the pad comes out. There's very little to hold it in. Overall, the chair works well and does exactly what I need it to do. The boy hates it, but he'll get over it.",

      "text": "Pros: sleek & aesthetic design fits underneath table while on chair, so hides well buckle straps, that are machine washable easy to clean curved back hugs baby Cons: The foam pad that is engineered to pull out for easy cleaning, unfortunately comes off WAY too easy and thus falls on the floor repeatedly. Understandably if they made a lip then food would catch, so it's kind of a toss up... I rated three stars because I think $30 is a bit pricey for this considering it's not too much of a step up from the Babies R Us simple booster that is mega cheaper; we bought with LO # 1.",

Like many noted in here, the straps are a little loose going around the back of the chair but we just wrapped them around one more time and they fit perfect. So far my son loves the chair, irs easy to clean, duarable and goes right under the table. We love it! Thank you!",
