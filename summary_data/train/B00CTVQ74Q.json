My only complaint is the bubble levels provided don't fit well in their snap slots. They keep falling out. Clear drying hot glue applied with a hot glue gun or clear silicone will fix. If a small disposable tube of clear adhesive with instructions were included, this handy tool would be a 5 star purchase. I also lined the tube bending valley with a thin self adhesive layer of foam insulation to keep stainless and copper tube pristine and minimize rub marring.",

I recommend a 5 foot handle for good mechanical advantage over the conduit (make life easier for yourself). I'd recommend it for the price.",
