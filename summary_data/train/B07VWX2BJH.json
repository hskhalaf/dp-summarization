The outsole traction and breathable upper are highlighted as accommodating elements. For daily, speedy runs, the Ravenna 11 guarantees an efficient performance and a responsive ride.Still, fans of road running shoes that are meant for the correction of pronation are likely to gravitate towards the Brooks Ravenna 11.",

        "The collar of the Ravenna 11 is lauded for effectively securing the heel and keeping it from wobbling",

      "text": "My son has loved Brooks shoes but this years model is a fail for him. The first pair was purchased on June 21. The wear and tear by July 15th was so shocking that I just figured it was a defective shoe. Purchased two more and 4 weeks later both pairs are worn out. Last years model shoe averaged 300 miles, this years less than 200. He used alternating pairs and ran the exact same areas as last year. Will not be buying this shoe again.",

      "text": "I'm disappointed. I've run in Ravenna 9s and 10s. I've only been walking in my Ravenna 11s for a month or two and have experienced tear out in the heels on 2 pairs. I think the heel material is weaker and thinner than in previous versions of this shoe. I was excited when I first got these shoes because they were more stylish than they've been in the past and retained my heel better than the Ravenna 10s. This ability to trap a heel better might be part of the problem with the 11s. My recommendation is to save your money and not buy the Ravenna 11s.",

They are comfy and lightweight, and aren\u2019t too springy or dense. Arch support is just right for my low arches. My run times have already improved since they\u2019re so lightweight compared to the Adrenaline\u2019s. Fits the same as my Adrenaline\u2019s, too. Don\u2019t recommend buying online though unless you know your size in Brooks running shoes. Better off buying in a store first then re-ordering online for convenience.",

Now the Ravenna 11\u2019s I have had since Sept. 26 2020 not even 3 months and the left heel is gone. Seems to be a recurring problem. What\u2019s with brooks? Very disappointed.",

The eyelet itself is hard and rests on top of the joint of the big toe and overtime caused me some discomfort when running (hence my rating). I still wear the shoes for short everyday outings but not for running which was their intended purpose.",
