My recommendation would be to replace the Allulose with more erythritol and sucralose.

The chocolate coating is thick, the caramel isn't too sticky and the \"bar\" isn't gritty or crunchy, but still has a solid bite to it.

I indulge sparingly, but it's a treat that I allow myself on those occasions when a funky-tasting odd-textured protein bar just won't do. I recommend these to low carbers and normies doing keto!",

Still decent macros for the taste, and better than most other protein bars, but ehhh.",

I cut my bars in half and only eat half at a time. If they were a little cheaper I would by more than a box at a time but then I'd probably eat them a lot quicker, too!",
