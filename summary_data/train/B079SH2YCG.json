It comes with corner ties and buttons to get a duvet insert in. Does not come with insert. Just posting for reference because these were some questions that I personally had, is shiny and girly which I loved. True to size - I ordered in Rose Gold",

It arrived in a high-end box, and the duvet cover was in a tote made of the same fabric. I washed it right away, and like other reviewers mentioned, it did lose some sheen, and was quite wrinkled. I took the time to iron it and it looks great. Nice, breathable fabric, and the corner ties help keep the duvet in place. The buttons are not my favorite; they seem to have some trouble staying buttoned. But overall, I\u2019m very satisfied with my purchase and would gladly recommend it to anyone. Just have an iron ready.",
