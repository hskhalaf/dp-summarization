It has worked very reliably but clips at a little over half gain on 23 of 25 volume on a 1750 RMS SSA 12 inch sub. Looks real good though. Note: in the picture there is a black strip to the left of the logo, that's an LED light strip I installed for effect.",

Sure its probably no where close to 3k watts but for what it delivers it pushes my 2 12\" subs a lot better than my older name brand amp. Boss back in the 90's was really pretty bad but they have remained a low price alternative and I think this amp is really great for the money. Chances are you are not entering a bass competition, so to drive a couple subs with a smaller amp this is perfect. I have only had this installed for a day but if anything changes I will be sure to update this review.",

With the back seat up it would get very warm, so the subs were off when the seat was down. It overheated anyway. Sent it back, got new one installed, this time mounted to the seat back. Overheated again. Now I have the original amp (Boss R2000M) I bought with the subs back in with no problems. These subs are 1,000 watts each, the R2000M is a little underpowered to handle these 2, and the AR3000 should be somewhat overkill. Great bang for buck, just gotta keep it cool.",

      "text": "Have this hooked up to a 2 Rockford Fosgate R2 Ultra Shallow 10-Inch 4 Ohm DVC Subwoofers at 1 ohm. My guess is this amp is actually putting out about 300-400 watts RMS at 1 ohm. I had an old school Rockford 100x2 hooked up at 4 ohms and it felt like I had 2 more subs then I do now. Amp seems to work very well, and fits better under the seat of my F150 and I like having a remote bass control. But if you are buying this amp for 1000 watts RMS or better, then you will be disappointed. This amp would have gotten 5 stars if it could have been able to over drive these subs.",
