And, so far, it hasn't broken even with him playing with it several times a week, so it must be made pretty well.",

I was really ticked off, if I had this I would not ever need to waste time on dead batteries, problem solved, If you think this is an 800 lumen light your an idiot, its for emergency use and not super bright but will get you out of a jamb or fix a tire at night etc.",

This little sucker gets BRIGHT, and it runs for a pretty good stretch on a crank cycle. I like that it can attach to his backpack and it's small and lightweight. I gave it 4 stars because the little knob on the crank came off not too long after purchasing. It can be easily reattached with some gorilla glue but it got lost somewhere and so now it is more difficult to crank. If it weren't for that, this would have received a perfect review.",
