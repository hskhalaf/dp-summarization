I like being able to put something in the microwave, and turn to my next task speaking my instructions without having to wash and dry my hands to hit buttons. I like being able to use English sentences to reheat a cup of coffee or defrost 2 lbs of chicken. Most importantly, and what I believe is the VERY MOST undersold feature of this 1st generation mash-up product: NO BLINKING \"12:00\" AFTER A POWER FAILURE!!!!! WIN! WIN! WIN!",

In other words I thought that the microwave listened to your command, it's not, the echo had to listen to your command & send instruction to the microwave.

NOTE: It will only accommodate small plates, and round plates work best. Square plates tend to get bogged down while rotating and thus heating can be uneven.In short its a good microwave for the small dollars.
