It keeps me warm in a cold outdoor pool while I do water aerobics. I like the vest, as it allows free arm movement. Only complaint is that it rides up a bit-wish it were just a bit longer. Looking forward to trying it out in the ocean as soon as it warms up a bit!",

By using this simple vest under my down parka I can keep my body's core warm just by walking.
