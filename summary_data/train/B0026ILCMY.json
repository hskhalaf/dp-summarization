Everything deserves a 5 star, but because of the mess it makes with the bubbles leaking out of the holder and killing our tablecloth, I gave it 3. I solved it by putting a piece of whiteboard under it to elevate it but couldn't get it to stop leaking. Will still keep using and figure out a better system of absorbing!",

      "text": "Purchased for my daughters birthday party. The product is cheaply made. The four plastic stands that the motor sits on kept popping off and in turn, didn\u2019t provide the proper clearance for the bubbles to flow out of the Tiki\u2019s mouth clearly. When you would pull the Tiki head off the motor to re-adjust the motor stand, the legs would fall off again as you tried setting the Tiki opening at the bottom over the stand. Bad design.",

It creates a mountain of suds, and they pile up on the mouth of the Tiki. The $10 basic bubble blower from Target produces many more bubbles and was more fun for my kids than this one. This was way too expensive to work so poorly.",

One of the plastic legs on the bubble machine was broken off and there were no instructions on how to operate it. I tried glueing the leg on but that didn't work, so I used duct tape. When I poured the bubble liquid in it just leaked right out of the bottom. I looked at this same item at Party City and it was packaged exactly the same...no instructions and the leg was even broken!",

I got this for myself for camping get togethers & they wanted $38 plus tax!! It's an embarassment to use. They'd do well to just sell the Tiki Head separately & have the customer buy a workable bubble machine to go in it. Which I will now have to do. Awful!!! Do not buy unless you want to waste your money.",

There is no easy way to access the on/off switch because you need to take the tiki head off the mount to change the setting. The head doesn't even fit smoothly on the mount either. The bubbles shoot about 8\" and then start to foam out of the tiki's mouth like it has rabies. What a horrible purchase.",
