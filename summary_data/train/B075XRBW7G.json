Bubble are barely there either and when you try to use the attachments they fall off as you rub your feet on them. All in all I\u2019m returning product cause it\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for. If you just want to wash your feet it will work.",

With the attachments, you can give yourself a reasonable pedicure and at the same time, take a few minutes to enjoy time out. The downside is that you need to use it in a place without rugs or carpeting and that means filling it, carrying and finding comfortable seating. But is does feel luxurious and when you finish, your feet feel soooo good! I recommend this product.",
