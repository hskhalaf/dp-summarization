In fact, I came back to Amazon today to see if we could get some replacement cushions because they are so dingy and gross they are nearly unusable. I wish they sold the cushions or even the covers separately but it looks like we will have to have a custom set made. I give the chairs 4.5 stars because they are sturdy I just wish there was more thought into sustainability.",

First chair took longer but there was no debate about right or wrong methods. 2nd chair took less time but was more aggravating!",
