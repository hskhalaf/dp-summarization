I was going to try to use up what I have and then buy something else, but it's so bad that I'm going to just get rid of the remaining rolls and get something different. Really, really disappointed in this product and can't understand the positive reviews. Totally wasted my money on this one.",

Like others have pointed out, the rolls are big and the sheets are thicker than most others. And yes, they do the job very nicely, and one can use less paper, thus, saving even more bucks.

Presto's Ultra Soft is not Charmin but nothing really is anyway. In my opinion, Presto is comparable to Quilted Northern and less plush than Charmin.

I also think it ripped easily. Even my husband, who is totally oblivious to anything new, said \u201cHun, don\u2019t buy this toilet paper again. It sucks.\u201d So, there you have it.

I bought PRESTO because of the TP shortage. We were so surprised! It is a great product and really love how Amazon is rivaling Walmart deals and pricing but you can put on auto delivery and it comes to your door!! Doesn't get any easier than that. 5***** A little pricey for a \"generic\" but pricing will come down as more buy. Highly recommend, save your $ and buy on Amazon!",

      "text": "I bought the Amazon Brand - Presto! 308-Sheet Mega Roll Toilet Paper, Ultra-Soft, 24 Count. I actually like this Toilet Paper so much better than my regular brand. The Presto is very soft and sturdy. But, after a few days of using it, I found that it is not working out too well with out septic system. It is just a bit too thick and sturdy for out septic. Such a bummer because I liked it so much better. Now I'm back to what I used before and I'm missing that Amazon Presto luxury ;)",

I usually use Charmin or Cottonelle - whichever happens to be on sale - and wanted to compare. I like the thickness of the Presto - it seems close to the Charmin Ultra Strong - and is just slightly less soft than the Charmin Ultra Soft. So I would say this is a combination of those two. It is two-ply, which some may need to consider depending on your septic system. But it's a good value and comparable to the popular name brands.",

These won't fit in our standard TP holder that sits on top of the toilet, and they won't fit into the built-into-the-wall TP dispenser. You have to use about 20 turns off of the roll before the roll will fit into either. If we had a free-standing, vertical TP holder where you slide these over a single shaft to \"stack\" the rolls, there would be no issues. But, the rolls are really large.",
