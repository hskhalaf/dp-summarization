I tried tweeking with the settings in the Xbox but it is not loud enough to play and hear the footsteps of other players (PUBG). I would recommend a Turtle Beach as a back up as well.",

I came from wearing turtle beaches for years, one thing I will say is comfort however is the reason I could not give this headset a 5th star, after wearing for awhile the head band on top lacks cushion and with the ear pieces being heavy, the band will push down on your head and kinda hurt after awhile. Other than that this headset is extremely durable and mic is still working for me over a year later. Have recommended to many people as the go to buy.",

      "text": "Sup boys, where we dropping? I bought this because I raged too hard on Fortnite dying to a pleb and broke my other set. These are real high quality, I would totally recommend. Only thing that I would say they could improve on is adding a mute button, and maybe cutting down in the weight. They aren\u2019t super heavy, but when you\u2019re putting in some serious hours in the sticks, you start to feel them a little, but they have a nice foam pad on top so it\u2019s tolerable. 9/10 would recommend.",

IF YOU HAVE A PS4 DONT WORRY, THE GREEN ONE ALSO WORKS FOR IT. I'm more than happy with the sound and mic quality. And its comfortable. Extremely.
