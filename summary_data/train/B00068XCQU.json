It didnt seem to work well . 2 12v batteries got very hot and didn't work after using this maintainer on them. one was a year old and would no longer hold a charge. I selected this one because of the good reviews and hearing the brand name before. Perhaps a got a faulty unit. I am now trying a schumacher brand maintainer. review to come",

I leave them hooked up and in spring, when it's time to do some cruising, I turn the key and the cars light right off. Battery Tenders won't overcharge your battery-- unlike a typical battery charger. They charge using a \"float\" system, allowing the battery to discharge slightly before turning on and recharging. These are great for your seasonally driven cars, boats, bikes or RVs. Great product!",
