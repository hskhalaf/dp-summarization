I'm trying to keep my 2 year old safe from the stove top, without completely restructuring our open floor plan. We only use the back burners, and now with this cover, he has stopped noticing the stove top at all. It's view is obscured. Even if he was interested he can't reach anything behind the cover. So far it's really giving me piece of mind. It also happens to be nice looking and blends in easily with a 'modern' looking kitchen.",

Our cooktop is on a center island and I was constantly worrying about the kids reaching up to the stove from the other side where I can't see them. Worry no more! This was relatively easy to assemble though I think I was momentarily stuck on the installation portion. I haven't cleaned it yet but I can see it would come apart and go back together rather smoothly (now that I figured out the installation).",

For example the flat side of the top front panel lines in the middle to meet the flat side of the bottom front panel.",

The guard only covers the front and part of the sides of the stovetop, so with our kitchen layout the product does leave one back corner of the stovetop accessible from an adjacent walkway, but we avoid using that burner and keep a heavy pot there. Since we've added this, it seems to remove the stovetop from our toddler's itinerary: its out of sight and out of mind.",
