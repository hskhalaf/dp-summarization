I made the purchase, Amazon delivered, and the Stream failed miserably to integrate into my system even after following the directions exactly as written. Along with it not working properly, the Apple App store has a 2 1/2 star review which speaks volumes. TiVo, you need to get it together. This is subpar and unacceptable. Needless to say, the Stream was returned. Thank you Amazon!",

When it works, it's great, but be prepared to have your patience tested.

It definitely isn't a replacement for your SlingBox, as it won't allow remote connections. Secondly, the surprise, is that it's the loudest device in my A/V stack ... it's fan is surprisingly noisy.",
