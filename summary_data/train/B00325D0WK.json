      "text": "I have tried 2 other lash serums with no luck. I got this hoping that third time would be the charm and HOORAY!!! This one really works. Pics are before after 8 weeks and after 12 weeks with mascara. I didn't have enough lashes to wear mascara for years. This is a miracle. I actually have my lashes touching my glasses they are so long now. I am recommending this to everyone I know. I keep whipping out my phone to show friend the before pics. Without mascara my new lashes are coming on black and a coworker thought I just started wearing makeup when all I was wearing was my new grown in lashes. Worth every penny.",

My lashes are long and full. I\u2019ve also started putting it on my brows and see growth too. The results are with only 1 bottle, putting it on every night. Gonna by my second one in probably 2 weeks. Every once in awhile my eyes sting but doesn\u2019t last and not bothersome to me and still worth it.",

I tried the 'other' lash grow serum sold on Amazon because of its price...don't waste your time or money (it did NOTHING!) I will continue to use Grande Lash MD because it works. P.S. I save money on mascara now too, never more than one coat needed now!",

After using this product for 3 months, I couldn't believe how long my lashes have become and they have filled in too, even though I was cautioned that thickness was not guaranteed. My second purchase was made through Amazon. One tube of this lasts approximately 6 months and you really see results after 6 weeks - I did. After reaching your length goal, use every other day. I'm very happy. Now, I actually have eyelashes again (at age 57 and with thyroid disease).",
