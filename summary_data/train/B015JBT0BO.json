Here I am a year later, sitting here like a chump, not able to use my pressure washer. I did foresee this though and bought a supplemental warranty. Bottom line, if you buy this you should DEFINITELY buy the extended warranty, but honestly, I don't think they deserve anyone's business.",

This may have been due to the use of an x hose but I doubt it given the other issues with the components.

      "text": "It's a great for close range washing project, like deck, garage floor, car, truck and etc. Soap dispenser with different spray angle attachments make it even more effective for the close range washing projects. However, it's no as effective for long range washing projects like washing house sidings that are about 10/20 ft away (closer to or half way to the roof). That was my original intent with this washer. I guess 2200 psi not enough for that kind of stuff? Not sure. People tells me a gas washer might have been good for project like that.",

The unit was stored in my basement over the winter and then would not turn on the following year. I checked fuses and wiring and there were no obvious issues, so I'm guessing the motor died like a lot of reports have claimed. For what this costs, it should have lasted longer than it did for the amount that I used it. The one year warranty is essentially useless, as it seems these units stop working after about a year or two of use.",

I worked for about three minutes and then died after smelling like it was on fire. I have tried other sockets, and it will no longer run. This is money that is wasted because now I can't return it and I am out a pressure washer. DO NOT invest your money, time or energy into this product.",

It was easy to put the hose,wand and nozzle on and had very easy to understand directions. It only took about 5-10 minutes to put the pieces together and start power washing. It works extremely well. I've removed mold from the rain water off the brick of my house, power washed the driveway and my wooden gate. It all came out like new!! The hose is quite long which is convenient as is the the power cord. It has wheels and was easily movable. I would purchase again without hesitation. Love it!",

Sturdy & well-made -- I've only used it five times so far, but have no reason to think it won't last. The hose connector is metal (unlike the leaky plastic one complained about in the reviews of the Sun Joe washer) so that's another plus. My only criticism is that the instructions are poorly written, otherwise, very pleased.",

I like that you can pour soap into a little reservoir instead of having a hose that draws soap out of a container. My only complaint is if soap is left in the dispenser it can leak out of where the water hose attaches. spray everything out of the wand to avoid built up pressure. Overall a great buy!",
