The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the paint chipped off in several spots and I had to touch it up before I ever used it. I had trouble matching the color exactly so now I can see my touch up marks.",

I've given it 4 stars as there are a couple of places where paint has been chipped off on the cradle and the mattress is really poor quality. It is very light and flimsy and crumpled under the tension of a fitted sheet. The mattress in the picture is a Colgate cradle mattress that I had to purchase separately.",
