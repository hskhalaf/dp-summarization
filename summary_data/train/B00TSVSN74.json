      "text": "This is an AMAZING watch. There is an astounding amount of data that it provides, including pace, speed, cadence, etc. However, what I appreciate most is altitude and this is what sets the watch apart. If you run trails or roads, you will have inclines and some are steep. Of course, they impact your pace/speed. It's good to look back at your run and assess the impact of the incline on your performance, which can aid in training. My only concern is that I know there are far more features than I use daily (I just choose which exercise I'm about to embark upon and go).",

The added blue tooth functionality is the difference maker for me and the reason i upgraded from the Ambit2, otherwise this unit is almost the same as the Ambit2. The \"Moves count\" computer interface is a little clunky but it works just fine. Looks decent when in normal watch/ time of day mode too for use as a primary watch while on active vacations.

It grabs GPS signal within 30 seconds every time, and is the most accurate watch I've owned. Fits my wrist perfectly and doesn't slide around or rub.
