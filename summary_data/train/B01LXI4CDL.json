Although the comforter was very nice, I feel like there could have been more that came in the package. It would have been nice for the sheets or pillow cases to be included. I had to buy everything separately, which I was okay doing but it just wasn't fun receiving one product and having to wait for another product to come in, especially if you could not give both presents at the same time. Other than that great product",
