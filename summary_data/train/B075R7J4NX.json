Despite its rugged style, it has been commended for its light disposition. Consumers also adored that the upper offered protection from wetness and cold. However, some reviewers said that it was short and narrow compared to other New Balance walking shoes. There were also complaints about its style and bulkiness. But in the end, despite some minor criticisms, it came highly recommended for people looking for a durable and comfortable walking footgear.",

There are metal grommets on the top where the laces go through. The tongue is not wide enough to pad the metal grommet rivet on the inside of the shoe so it hurts the sides of my ankle. I have bought New Balance many times, but this is my first pair from China. They do not meet New Balance standards.",
