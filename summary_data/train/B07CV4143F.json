      "text": "Thanks to @Pragmatic, who wrote how to modify these for storage. In addition, my steps had 2 pilot holes/hinge side, though I got 3-hole hinges, requiring 12 screws, plus I bought 4 extra screws, 2 for the 7\u201d 2nd step support, & 2 spares. Since the 3-hole hinge doesn\u2019t align with the 2-hole pilots, I angled the outer screws inward. The extra screws in the middle should add extra support. In hindsight, I would rather have the low-profile countersink tapered screwheads, instead of panheads pictured, since the latter makes the top step not quite snug when closed.",
