Don't wear your good shirt after first use! Much irritation if you try to work at the areas it can't dip into (under shoulder blades), because of blade width. Not impressed with quality, although it's really all that's needed to hold the blade. The handle should be longer. Going to try something else, but feeling stuck with purchase, and if I get desperate, I might order extra blades. For the initial price, disappointed it doesn't come with a couple of extra blades.",

      "text": "It did the job ok, but don\u2019t expect miracles; the flat sections of my back it did just fine. The areas with contour, not so much. It took about 10-15 minutes to do my back but there were still missed spots where the blade passed over but didn\u2019t cut. What did get cut was the skin over both ends of the collar bone where it drew blood. The electric rechargeable mangroomer (also on Amazon) is safer, seems to get more nooks and crannies, and doesn\u2019t result in a cut, irritated back. It doesn\u2019t shave as closely as this one and leaves stubble, but that\u2019s a better sacrifice that drawing blood. Oh well, it was worth a try.",

Which is the same for shaving your face. If you take your time and don't forcefully push the razor blade into your skin, rather just let it glide over your back it works perfect. It isn't a back scratcher so don't use it like one. Disregard the bloody photos they are obviously being careless. I use it to dry shave and have never had a single cut or irritation.

However, the lifespan of the blade is too short as I had four \"good\" shaves where I didn't have to apply an excessive amount of pressure. After trying both dry and wet applications, and making sure the blade is clear of debris the tool does not perform without applying a lot of pressure- and even then the results are poor. I might consider a repeat purchase if the original sale included an extra blade, but for the initial cost of the tool (with only one blade) it is better to spend a little bit more initially and invest in an electric shaver.",

With the BaKblade (I don't get the weird capitalization but whatever) I can hit my back once a week and keep it nice and smooth. I shave dry before I get in the shower. It's a bit awkward in a few spots, mainly due to musculature, but with some stretching and bending I can hit all the peaks and valleys successfully.",
