      "text": "The 22 degree rating is definitely a survival temp and not a comfort threshold for outdoor use, but after multiple Fall and Spring camping trips with both a tent and hammock i am still pretty happy with this bag. For the average male i would say this will keep you toasty at 35-40 degrees with a sleeping matt or underquilt but starts getting chilly below that. It compresses reasonably well for the average backpacker.",

I chose this one because a) it came in a long size and I am 6'2\", and b) I planned on using it in early fall and the foot zipper is a nice feature. BUT, while it is long enough, there is absolutely no point to that length when it is this thin. I couldn't even get the zipper above my waist, let alone ever hoping of fitting my arms inside. Do yourself a favor and keep looking before buying, especially if you plan on getting the long size.",

Had to purchase a more costly bad with a warranty and long term quality standards.his bad is great if your going to use it a few days on a two day get away might last years but if you sleep in it often not gonna keep warm over a long period after about 3 to 4 months id say its not good in 40 to 50 degree temps anylonger",
