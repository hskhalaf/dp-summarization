Yes it does have rolling shutter but in my experience if you subject the camera to that kind of quick and jagged motion the footage is unusable regardless so this has no effect on my rating as it does not hinder my end product to clients.

If you have a 35mm lens like me, you now have a 35 and a 50. With the 120fps you also have a 80mm roughly. Three lenses in one. Cons -Battery -Can't use function buttons to switch shooting modes or crop mode. -Kinda expensive. If you have the money just get it.",
