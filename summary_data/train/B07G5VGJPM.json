It is not due to one design flaw. If you pull the handle a little too hard the whole thing falls off and dumps all the batter with no means to stop it. This is particularly hard for kids or other first time users. It takes a very light touch. The purple lid one from KPKitchen is cheaper, easier to use and lasts a long time.",

The wide mouth makes it easy to get the batter in without spilling, and it's very easy to see how much you're dispensing each time. The only gripe I have is with the silicon spout on the bottom. I don't have confidence in its long-term durability, it seems like it's only going to be a matter of time before it starts to crack and leak. The main problem is that if you make a thick batter, the silicon doesn't let it flow through easily.",
