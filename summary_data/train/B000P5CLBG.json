I realize it\u2019ll be short, but at least there wasn\u2019t a lot of extra fabric width wise. The belt is tie on and holds the extra fabric back. She could wear white stocking with this outfit. The \u201cboots\u201d come above her knee which is cute that way but it is loose. I\u2019ll figure something out if it bothers her too much.",

She just started wearing size 5, which is too big. So this really fits more like a size 4. There\u2019s no way she could wear it if she grew a couple inches without showing a bit too much. My daughter also found the cuffs and headband itchy after just a few minutes. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the seams or the foam.",

The package is conflicting, it says: \"Small, USA Size 4-6, For 3-4 Years\". So, I guess Small is actually for 3year olds. Stitching is definitely a bit shoddy, as other reviewers have said, but I'm giving it the 4 stars because it's a great deal for the price.

      "text": "We saw this costume in a high-end catalogue and were thrilled to find it for a better price online. It's clearly the same costume: same accessories, same packaging/ad photo, etc. The main costume is the best portion and fit well (these things always run a little small, but seem consistent). The boots, however, were too big for me (the child's mother). On the other hand, the headband had to be rigged to fit. I'm not sure it would go around a one-year-old's head. We added elastic to increase the diameter and allow for future use. For the price, it's all very reasonable. And, my daughter absolutely loves the costume (without the boot covers).",

The arm cuffs are 2 different sizes and an adult could wear them. The boot covers are ridiculously big and don't fit anything like this picture. Waste of money. My daughter is left with the headpiece and belt to wear around until I buy her a replacement. Not happy.",

(my child is 5-6.) Quality seems about as I would expect for today's store bought costumes. Size is my only complaint. (And I'm sorry, even if somehow I read the chart wrong the first time, there is a huge difference between size 2 and size 6. It can not be grouped all into one.)",
