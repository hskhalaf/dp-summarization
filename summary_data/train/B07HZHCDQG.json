I feel like that should be addressed as a safety concern, seeing as so many of these customers are clearly buying these for children.",

I do wish the charging port and headphone jack were at the bottom of the tablet, instead of the top (as the top of the tablet is crowded with buttons and ports). Video quality is decent, not great, but for $50 I can\u2019t complain. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a smaller, affordable tablet that they can use for video, reading, etc.",

Then I figured out that it meant I would get ads on my display very often, which I had to click to dismiss and there was no way to turn off. In the end, I ended up paying Amazon an extra $15 plus tax to \"unsubscribe\" from the \"special offers\".",

I could not find a reader that had the PDF bookmark feature. Maybe there are PDF reader apps out there, other than the one from Adobe, that has the bookmark feature but i got tired of looking. This is a less than optimal solution for me. Additionally, the available apps are somewhat limited and the tablet comes with a lot of trash apps installed. I would not recommend this unless you are really really into Amazon.",

You would think that with advances in technology, particularly in batteries, a new Kindle would at least be able to maintain prior version functionality.
