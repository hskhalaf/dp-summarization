      "text": "My daughter screamed when she received this for her birthday. She wanted a playset for years but has a terrible history of playing with her bigger toys and then rapidly losing interest. So far, she has played with this every day for the past two weeks. Easy to put together and combining both a kitchen and a bathroom into one, this is a simple but imaginative choice for the Baby Alive fans. I knocked a star off because there was a shipping failure (meaning due to the seller not shipping this out, for whatever reason, in a reasonable Prime 2 day window) and my girl not receiving this until after her birthday. That was not a good thing.",

She was so excited! She plays with it everyday. It can be used as a kitchen, bath, and has high chair for doll to sit! Was simple to put together. Just a lot of interlocking pieces. Overall, very satisfied!",

The item is great for her baby alive dolls and she loves babies! So it\u2019s a cute toy for sure. Don\u2019t pay over $37 for it though!",
