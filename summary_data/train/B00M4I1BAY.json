It was working fine for 3 months and allowed me to turn all all devices with a single button power press, but now, without any changes to the settings, it no longer turns on/off the soundbar. I'm sure I can re-program it again, but that is not the point. Overall, disappointing. Will be looking for a better replacement.",

It had a bunch of labels that wouldn't deal with DVRs or TVs, but still, a great remote. Some label suggestions would be \"Day\"; Up, Down, Left and Right \"Arrows\", etc. I use this remote to replace the Spectrum DVR remote because I couldn't control my sound bar and control my Apple TV. If you're looking for a multi-device remote, this is perfect.",

If all else fails, there is a JP1 connector in the battery area for advanced pc programming (way too advanced for me or most people, but always an option).",

      "text": "I ordered this remote for use with my X-Box One console and associated audio equipment (Onkyo receiver, Verizon cable box, LG TV) This remote performed 100 times better than the official X-Box remote with much greater range and accuracy. Some people expressed concern regarding the accuracy and effectiveness of the volume control which under the normal setting doesn't work well. What I found as a great work around is to simply use the learning function to teach the Inteset remote your media control volume button. This will then allow the remote to use the IR for your media receiver instead of X-Box One Kinect as a receiver which will give you greater accuracy and range when adjusting the volume.",

    "title": "Inteset 4-in-1 Universal Backlit IR Learning Remote for use with Apple TV, Xbox One, Roku, Media Center/Kodi, Nvidia Shield, most Streamers and other A/V Devices",
    "description": "The Inteset 4-in-1 universal IR remote is designed to work with popular streaming devices such as Apple TV, Xbox One, Windows Media Center, Roku (excluding Stick) and many more. From the solid feel to the velvet coating on the back, when you hold the INT-422 remote you know it\u2019s a high-quality product. It has most of the features found only in high-end remotes but at a fraction of the cost. Those features include volume and channel lock, macros, custom button labels, key punch-through, full backlighting and a huge built-in A/V device database. If a device is not found you can quickly program those functions with the remote\u2019s intuitive learning capability. \n\nThe 4 buttons at the top of the remote are pre-programmed for Apple TV (A), Xbox One (B), Media Center (C) and Roku (D) so that you can use the remote immediately with these streaming devices. You can easily assign any A/V device such as your TV or cable box to the unused device buttons or program over any of the pre-programming. Applying the included stickers above your programmed buttons helps users find the right keys effortlessly. The Red, Green, Yellow and Blue buttons function as the standard Xbox color control buttons (B, A, Y, X). For Media Center, they invoke the TV, Movies, Pictures and Video screens. For Roku, they invoke the Netflix, Amazon and other apps. You can control FireTv (excluding Stick) and the PS4 if you install a Flirc IR Receiver.\n\nFinding the your device codes is easy using Intesets\u2019 Device Code Lookup capability on our website. Click on the Device Type (i.e. Cable Box), select the manufacturer and then enter the device code into the remote. Then, the functionality for that device will be mapped instantly to the applicable remote buttons. Any questions are answered in our support forum, or you can contact us directly via our website.
