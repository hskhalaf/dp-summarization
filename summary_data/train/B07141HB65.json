I personally think this is a good thing. I hung up a harder scratcher previously, and it would bang against the door. She kind of just does a Tarzan swing on the one and dangles when she's attacking the feather. So far, the feather has remained intact, unlike some of her other toys. Would be nice if it was a tad bit longer, but overall, very nice.",

I'm including a picture of the culprit... I honestly wish this scratcher when smack our cat Jefferson on the top of the head every time he tried to scratch something. That would be useful.",
