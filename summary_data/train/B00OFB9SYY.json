Just try to keep the rice under 8 cups if you use steamer tray because rice rises into steamer tray while cooking. It's no issue really because it all goes in the same hole. Clean up was simple and saves on bills not needing to run dishwasher for pots and pans. Steamed meals can also easily wash off plates and bowels without scrubbing that further reduce need for running dishwasher.",
