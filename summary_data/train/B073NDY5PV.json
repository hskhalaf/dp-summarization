      "verdict": "One of Nike\u2019s most eye-catching and innovative shoes, the LunarEpic Flyknit becomes an all-weather shoe with the inclusion of a water-repellent upper and water resistant cleatie. The Shield version of the LunarEpic Flyknit continues to have a snug, socklike wrap up until around the ankle due to the revolutionary mid-rise design. It is very light, extremely comfortable, offers good arch support, and loads of traction. If the price is well within reach, the shoe is easily one of the best in the business.",
      "pros": [
        "A large number of reviewers swear by the comfort delivered by the Shield version of the LunarEpic Flyknit",
        "The inclusion of the water-repellent upper and inner sleeve gives it better protection when the conditions get a bit cold or wet",
        "Several noticed how breathable the shoe remains despite the water resistant upper",
        "Flywire cables hold the foot down in security and support",
        "A handful noticed just how flexible the shoe is",
        "The traction is surprisingly superb on wet conditions, based on the observations of some runners",
        "It comes with a set of 4mm sockliners",
        "A few used the shoe for long-distance running or for up-tempo runs",
        "A couple of expert reviewers found the cushioning to be very good in absorbing shock",
        "It is good for distance running or even racing when the weather forecast isn\u2019t too good",
        "A handful of runners said that the 10mm drop feels much lower, like a 6mm drop"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "An already expensive shoe becomes even more expensive in the LunarEpic Flyknit Shield",
        "A handful found the fit to be too narrow",
        "The mid-rise design was a bit weird and funny for some runners",
        "Some runners complained about irritation on their ankles or Achilles due to the mid-rise design",
        "Small stones are sucked into the outsole",
        "A handful were disappointed that it runs small"

My mom has these shoes and loves them - they offer great support. The shoe box, however, was damaged when i got it, like it was a recycled box. Overall the show is good, runs slighty small, I recommend going a half size up.",
