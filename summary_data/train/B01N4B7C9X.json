Plenty of space. For the larger bag, I was able to also fit my boots (they reach the knee), but did have to fold the top a bit. seemed quite sturdy- I carried my shoes in my purse for commuting between office locations, zippers worked fine, and the material seemed water resistant (there was a little bit of rain happening). Will come in handy when I travel overseas. overall very happy I purchased.",
