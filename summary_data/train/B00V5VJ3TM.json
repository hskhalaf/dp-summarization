I would recommend this to anyone who is not in need of a high end piece of equipment, but needs the features to take advantage of 4K and high def audio formats. For a serious home theater buyer, this would not be a good fit for a primary receiver.",

Has a really cool feature that allows you to balance speakers with each other to optimize the sound (it includes a little microphone you can place in your favorite listening location to tune the system up). That helped balance my big front speakers with smaller rear set. Overall the output is a bit lower than receivers I've used in the past but it still goes way beyond filling the room with sound. Sounds clear enough to make friends... loud enough to make enemies. :)",

I have my TV, FireTV, Blueray, PC and Playstation all routing through this and they all work wonderfully. I was additionally surprised when the connected device names where automatically displayed on the LED when I switched to them. I guess it's been a while since I last purchased a receiver.

But then it died and after some research I selected this Yamaha model and have not been disappointed. It also solved several problems: 1. My wife can now listen to Pandora and here bible studies on the nice speaker system via Bluetooth from her iPhone. 2. I can easily switch the listening mode so that I can distinguish what people are saying on TV which has been a frustration of mine in the past. So far so good.",
