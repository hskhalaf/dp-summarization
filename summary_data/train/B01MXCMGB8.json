My wife and I charge our phones, iPads, headphones, GPS receiver and friends phones over a four day period and still had 23% let. Plug it in at home and was fully charged to 100% over night, around 10hrs. I used this for 4 months now and have had no issues. Friends have tried two cheaper ones and a solar powered one. They just order this Imuto 30000mAh.",

      "title": "The 30,000 mAh is overrated",
      "text": "I like how this can charge devices like the Surface pro 7, Dell XPS 13, and iPad Pros at a considerably quick speed. Where it fails, and miserably, is the purported 30,000 mAh rating - I am more inclined to believe that it is a lie. Ideally, with that rating, it should be able to charge any of the devices listed at least on two cycles (with a little more left). However, with just a single charge, it goes down to 0 (and rather quickly once it gets to the 30% mark). Really, this is more like 20,000 mAh, it seems lighter than the other 30,000 mAh charger brand that I own.",

I would NEVER carry a battery this big and heavy in my bag on a daily basis. I may keep this in my car for emergencies, but I don't consider it practical to carry around daily, it's just too heavy and bulky.",

My current phone, One Plus 3T, has way too many things running at a time and the battery dies fast but I managed to do delivery on a bicycle for 12 hours (there was a good amount of downtime but still i was using my phone) and the battery still didn't get below 20%. It's a brick though so I keep it in my bag and have a long enough USB-C cable to feed my phone power while riding around the city.",
