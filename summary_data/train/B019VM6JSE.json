I fed her this in her food and within 3 days I started seeing a difference in how she walked and she started coming out into the living room and socializing with the family. She is a totally different cat. She seems to be more content and was even playful a few nights. I will keep her on this for the rest of her days because I love her and am happy to see a side of her that I haven't seen in a few years. Thanks for the great product!!",

I started this supplement on June 22nd. I decided to wait a month before writing my review and boy am I glad I did because this stuff is AMAZING. In just one short month the improvement I've seen in miraculous. Her knees have been fine, they haven't popped out once and she has so much more mobility, energy & ability. We have changed absolutely nothing in her lifestyle or diet besides this supplement so I'm 100% sure it is attributed to it. I highly recommend this, will be repurchasing.",

This is huge!! It has me considering comparable supplements for myself.

My 11-month-old Newf loves the bacon flavor of this product and tolerates it well. I recommend that dog owners start with a low dosage and increase it gradually until the recommended dosage has been reached. This will prevent any intestinal discomfort or diarrhea dogs can experience. The pump feature on the bottle makes using this supplement very convenient.

I've tried giving them Cosequin before but really didn't see the results, probably in part to them not liking the powder on their food.

      "text": "My dogs seem to really respond well to this and the salmon oil plus a CBD oils I give them. I have two American staffys and a GSD, BUT the dispensers are kind of gross, leaving drips and goop when I use the pump and droplets if I use the cap. I came up with the best idea EVER!!!! I bought \u201cAOZITA\u201d mouthwash dispensers here on Amazon to put the liquids in! They dispense like a liquor bottle at a bar. It\u2019s amazing!!! No more mess!",
