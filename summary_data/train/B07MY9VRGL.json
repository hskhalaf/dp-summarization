Indeed, wearing one paves the way for hikes where great agility and high amounts of comfort are almost always assured. In it, wearers can also expect to experience the trail with exemplary traction and water protection.That said, this high-quality hiking boot might put off some customers with its inefficient closure system. Nonetheless, the Ontario 85 Mid Waterproof is an outstanding Merrell piece, thanks to its collection of hike-focused pros.",

        "According to practically everyone who has rated the Merrell Ontario 85 Mid Waterproof highly, the footgear is incredibly comfortable",

        "This boot-type hiking piece from Merrell is fantastic in terms of waterproofing, say about a handful of those who have purchased it",

They are surprisingly light but feel were durable. I am also glad I got the bigger size because how low light these boots are, I am guessing I will need some thick socks for the cold winter hikes.",

I got them for about half retail, so a great price in my book.",
