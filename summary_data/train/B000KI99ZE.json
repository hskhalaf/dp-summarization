The Travel Case comes with a protective screen to hold it, it's got a thicker layer of protection, and you can put two discs in the case. The only disadvangage is that it's more cumbersome and somewhat heavier to handle than the Sony PSP PlayGear Pocket. I got both to see the difference, and I do use the Sony PSP PlayGear Pocket in my house, but for travel always the Travel Case. Get the travel case, if you will only get one protective case.",
