Plugging it into my audio interface with gain at 100% still does not pick up my voice. Trash. If it worked this would be 5 stars.

Sometimes you have to kind of talk a little loud with it and it is kind of difficult to adjust to the right position, but we use Skype and Rosetta Stone with it and it hasn't let us down yet! My 9 year old has messed with and my 2 year old so I am pretty confident that the product is durable :-) I would recommend this to a friend and i would definitely purchase it again in the future too.",

      "text": "The package came from Hong Kong so nobody can really complain that it takes forever for the package to arrive. The item was exactly as the picture displays. The only problem that I could find was the sheer fact that the microphone creates an echo on your computer and it does not pick up your voice with good quality. I would get a microphone that has a USB plug-in rather that a microphone with a 3.5 mm jack plug-in. The USB has better quality and easy input. That is my two cents.",
