Others may find the inability to specify just the states or regions visited in these two major countries a drawback... Otherwise the high quality material, fonts and overall design make this worth framing & hanging even for those who are detail oriented.",

I was kind of expecting Hong Kong will have its own little area to scratch but it was just bundled in China. Unlike Canada or United states where it is divided based on states. Given that i still give 4 stars as I do love this map. In fact I even order my friends the same for Christmas present. Hopefully they will like or love it.",

Another recommendation I have is to be careful when you are scratching off the map because it can sometimes scratch. Also make sure to wipe off the residue quickly after scratching because the black residue tends to stick to the map, leaving little spots.
