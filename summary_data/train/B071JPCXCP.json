The simple yet trendy look, zero break-in period, and lightness were some of the features which appealed to those who are looking for a new pair of footwear. The product\u2019s inexpensiveness, of course, is the chief advantage. However, the pair failed to please when it comes to the cross strap. Overall, the Hurricane XLT2 Cross Strap still delivered well on the trails.",

      "text": "I bought these sandals to use during a week long rafting trip on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. This trip included frequent hikes off-river through side canyons. I found these sandals to be extremely slippery - even treacherous - while hiking, and that's true of all surfaces, even dry rock. My second issue is with the straps, which I found exceptionally difficult to adjust right from the beginning. I fought with the problem at home during break-in but found the straps impossible to adjust once in the canyon.",

I have worn size 11 in all sneaker/boot/sandal brands my whole adult life and I ordered these in 11 and they were waaayyy too big and the strap was pulled so tight it actually hit the ground. The 10's are a snug but appropriate fit (see pic) That aside I think these are the best looking outdoor sandal out there (more attractive than Keen, which are the ultimate in middle aged dorkdom). Its hard to assess long term quality/comfort but so far so good.",

I liked the pulled strap model more but they were too expensive in my size. Docking 1 star because the inside is rubbing ... maybe I need to wear it in.",
