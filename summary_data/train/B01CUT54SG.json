I think perhaps it might have been better to buy it at Bed Bath and Beyond, where I could just have returned it in the store. I am really disappointed with Cuisinart's warranty.",

I read the reviews on this machine and decided to give it a try. OMG - first time I used the simple fresh strawberry recipe in the booklet and it turned out absolutely fantastic. Firm, creamy and fast. We had perfect ice cream within around 20 minutes. What a great find. I can't believe it has taken me all these years to realize there was an easy and inexpensive machine that would make a few simple ingredients turn into something so decadent.",

This one really scrapes the bowl, leaving only a very thin layer on the bowl. I made frozen no fat Greek yougurt. It was done in less than twenty minutes, with a creamy mouth feel like Haagen Daz for half the calories!! I did have to move the freezer bowl from the front of my freezer to the back to get it to freeze solidly, but after that\u2014piece of cake!!",

End up pouring mix into container and then freezing in my freezer. This leaves the ice cream with little ice crystals in it. Still tasty but not smooth. I followed directions accurately. So don't believe this is operator error. Will try to return to Cuisinart.",

Tip: Chill a container in the freezer an hour before starting the ice cream. Once the ice cream is done, transfer it to the chilled container. Since it's chilled, it won't melt the ice cream. Put the container in the freezer for as long as it takes to get the consistency you like.",

For anyone with the same doubts - it works just fine without sugar/whole milk/heavy cream or whatever else calorie booster you do not want in your ice cream. Splenda + 2% evaporated milk + banana/mango/vanilla powder works just fine. It might be a little too hard if left in the freezer overnight, never had it last that long though :)",
