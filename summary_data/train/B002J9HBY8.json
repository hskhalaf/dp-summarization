Biofreeze is the first product that not only relieves my pain but also stops the pain shortly after applying. Biofreeze works fast. I have used the roll on, the gel, the spray and they are all effective. This is one product I will alway have around the house. It works great for minor pain but also intense pain. If you're in intense pain it at least takes the edge off for awhile. Well worth the money.",

A great bonus is this is not addictive or dangerous compared to other brands such as BenGay etc... I find the BIG 32 oz is a better value for your money then the smaller 3 oz or 8 oz ones.

Works OK for me. Roughly the same as a couple ibuprofen or Aleve. I bought the quart bottle as one hand is loaded w arthritis and the other hand needs carpal tunnel surgery (in 3 weeks or so). Bottom line is that it works for pain but works better as sinus treatment.",

      "text": "I started using this about 15 years ago. It pretty much still works (really well) just as I had remembered it back then and the ingredients haven't changed much either. It provides great relief for sore muscles and joints, to the occasional light sprain. It comes out green, but is pretty much colorless applied, and provide a great cooling sensation. The mint is definitely spicy, but it's rather inoffensive and doesn't linger for very long.",

I have pinched muscles sometimes that make it difficult to stand up straight. After rubbing some of this on there and letting it sit for a bit I am up walking around like I never had any pain at all. The other thing that some reviewers state is that it just masks pain, but for me after it wears off the muscle actually seems relaxed and the pain is gone.",
