They stand up nicely to getting wet in mud, moving rock around with your hands, and creates a nice barrier for the thorns on the lemon tree. They are comfortable, well made, and protective. Definitely recommend, just keep them away from chewing dogs, for that, they are no match!",

Cons: I with the thumb and index fingers had the same box-type construction as the other fingers, but that is my only complaint regarding the fit.

      "text": "I bought a pair of these a year ago and I use them for work. I dig and handle a lot of fragmented sharp metal and these have held up pretty good. I like the velcro strap because it keeps dirt from getting into the glove. I still get a little bit, but it is significantly reduced compared to the gloves that have no adjustable wrist strap at all. My older set of these have a few holes in the thumb and pointer finger where the stitching is, but the palm/fingers with the thicker materiel hold up pretty well. Overall, if you are looking for a lightweight glove that will also help keep your hands cool then I recommend.",
