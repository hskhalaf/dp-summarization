Then I took a bunch of t-shirts that I don't wear, but can't throw out (they have sentimental value) and did the same thing. I find myself looking round the house for MORE to pack away...it's addictive, so be warned! It is also very easy to use, and the bags are re-useable and yes, great as an aid to packing too!!",

The package went from 28 inches down to about 11. It's been 5 days and the bag is still as it was when i first packed it. I have yet to see how these do for repeat inflation-deflation cycles, but have no reason to believe they won't hold up. Overall great product, excellent value!",

Vacuum works great, and so does the hand pump (although takes a bit of time hand pumping air out of the huge bags). I like having the cap you have to screw on after taking air out, that way I know nothing will knock the seal while the bag is stored causing air to seep back in. Good to know the rubber seal is protected.",

It's just that the material that is use for the bag itself does not seem to be as pliable as with what you get with ziplock. As far as the vendor is concerned, I am happy with their delivery.

We contacted the seller after we started running into leaks and they absolutely swapped them without any fuss. Even paid for the shipping on the replacements, so there was no cost to us.

What makes them truly distinct and amazing is that they come with a pump that screws into the bags to suck out the air so you can actually use them for travel (unlike spacebags) because you don't need a vacuum. Also a great alternative for people who don't own a vacuum or who have sensory issues and cannot tolerate the noise vacuums make. I used to have to constantly pester my housemate to vacuum the air out of my space bags. I no longer have that problem because I have switched all of my bags over to these. Also, THEY LAST LONGER. I could not be more impressed.",

You need a bit of planning to arrange stuff inside the bag before vaccuming out the air to make optimal use of the bag-space and to make sure it can be folded easily. If done incorrectly, you have one stiff board to deal with. I had to make sure post-vaccuming I can still fold it. Took a couple of iterations to get it right.",

      "text": "These items are great but there are much products from other brands. These bags burst open in my move (only a van ride a couple blocks away) and thus haven\u2019t worked for long term storage. Other brands fit much more. They are also nearly impossible to deflate with the hand pump. In fact I had to buy a different vacuum to use these. If you are planning on using the hand pump try a different brand.",

Also, the zipper-like plastic clips that come with each bag, are not connected to the bags. That was a little tedious to deal with being they didn\u2019t want to stay on. The reason I give this three stars is due to the bags not staying air tight.. I filled five bags and two of the five slowly filled back with air. Also, don\u2019t lose the little caps that screw over the part that you suck the air from because they have to go back on to complete the airtight seal.",
