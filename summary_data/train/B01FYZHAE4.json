There are two straps on the back perfect for pitting the seatbelt through.

      "text": "I bought this for a cross-country roadtrip with my dog. He\u2019s a pretty nervous dude and has never been comfortable in the car, but this is great. He\u2019s a mutt and kind of an awkward size, so I\u2019m not sure I could use this with the top closed, but I put his blanket and some toys in this and he just naps. He\u2019s so content, it\u2019s honestly shocking. The strap to hook onto the dog doesn\u2019t adjust to a comfortable length for my dog, and after a few days the hook popped off the strap. Otherwise, I\u2019m so grateful I got this carrier for our trip",

I wasn't looking for a carrier so don't know about how it would hold up, but great for the car.",

My only complaints are that the security strap and hook are not very strong and the seat sits a little lopsided on my car seat and I drive a Lincoln MKT which is a big car, so I am not sure how it would fit in a small car seat.",
