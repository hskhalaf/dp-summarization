They had packs of 10 for $54.. Very light weight.. So I was scared of what I was getting here. These are almost 5 ounces each!! Very heavy quality, all individually wrapped with the screws for each. Definitely best quality and best price!!",

Out of 25 pack I had 2 pulls that were cosmetically unacceptable. The above said, I'd like to reiterate that for the price, these are nice pulls. They are heavy and have a very nice feel to them.

I'd suggest you measure very carefully before buying - if your drawers / cabinets already have holes at 5\", you're going to have a problem mounting these. If you are drilling new holes, as I was, it should work out OK as long as you match your template to the actual pulls carefuly.",

      "text": "First off, the weight of the handle is very good. Kudo's for including 2 different lengths of screws ! I had bought 20 handles, had 2 of them that wouldn't accept enough of the screw, one of which when mounting, the screw got stuck, had to get vice grips to get if off the cabinet. After that, I pretested inserting the screws before mounting & found a 2nd one with the same issue. Seller was very quick to respond & resolve the issue to my satisfaction, so they get 5 stars for service/prompt reply. Overall for the price would buy again. BTW, as with a lot of Chinese screws, be careful how you tighten, the head can strip very easily.",
