It is very flimsy so great care must be taken to get it all put together and mounted without breaking the cheap plastic, but once it is installed, it lights up and the emergency lights come on when the power fails. Perfect for getting through a Fire Dept. inspection, but I wouldn't trust my life with it under any circumstances. All told, worth the $29 paid, but not a penny more.",
