I have not spilt anything on it since purchasing several months ago so I cannot speak to the water resistance.",

When the wash cycle was complete, I opened the top and the mattress pad was completely torn and there were 2 spots of brown discoloration. The wash instructions also say dry clean but who is going to take their mattress pad to the dry cleaner? I was mine frequently.",

I put this pad on top of the foam topper with a regular mattress liner around it and the Bamboo on top of it. So, I separated myself from the foam and augmented it with this pad. The combination of the two has reduced my night sweats by probably 90% over the past few weeks. The Bamboo topper is very, very comfortable and I've slept much better. Worth every penny.",

Between my gel-topped mattress, this bamboo pad plus the bamboo sheets, my heated, sweat-filled nights are no longer. (Drop the dirty thoughts, I'm talking menopause here.) I am very happy with this pad and highly recommend it. Thank you!",

Washing and tumble drying the topper at a commercial laundry did return it to new condition but the body impressions soon returned.
