First I will preface this review by saying everyone has different views about fragrances, so don't hate me if you don't like it. I absolutely LOVE this scent!!! The bottle is very classy and it has heft, not your run of the mill diffuser. The scent itself, is not overpowering but fills your house with a deliciously elegant fragrance. I will be ordering again, and I hope this review will help if you're on the fence. Sure it's pricey, but definitely worth it.",

In an enclosed room, no less, the performance on this one is not up to par with their other scents. I have since replaced it with their lavender which I love; it fills the room with a beautiful fragrance and is still going strong after months. I keep the Morocan Amber in my bedroom and the performance on that one is also very strong. Wish I could\u2019ve gotten a refund on the Ocean Mist.",

I finally found Moroccan Amber by Nest at Nordstroms and have been using ever since. it's expensive but i get lots of comments on it. use it in three places- great room and two bathrooms.",
