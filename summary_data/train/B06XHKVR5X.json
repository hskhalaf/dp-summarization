These are nice quality, thick, kneeling pads which work well to save aging knees. Being tall, I am always kneeling down to do something outside. I have had no problems with the pads, they seem to hold up well. The thickness is nice (2 inches?) when using on cement or gravel.",

For the time being, though, I'm sure this will work well for light duties like weeding in my yard or planting flowers.",
