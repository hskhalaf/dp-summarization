They\u2019re also lightweight enough to be worn all day, supportive and stable, and durable. Best of all, they come in terrific color schemes.The laces can be frustrating as they keep getting untied unless you do double loops. The fabric of the shoes also has a tendency to snag on the socks. However, if you do an advantage vs. disadvantage list,\u00a0 you\u2019ll find that the pros greatly outweigh the cons.",

        "The Merrell Range AC+ colors are \u201camazing,\u201d users say, and they also stay bright even after tons of wear",
        "The modern casual styling of these low-top sneakers by Merrell is commended by some reviewers",

However, I learned that the more people don't like the fit of a Merrell shoe/boot (high arch, narrow heel, too week in toe box,, etc), the better the chances that it will fit me just fine. Such is the case with these. I only give these four stars because useless I lace them just so the top of my right foot (medial marginal vein) will complain that the laces are cutting off the circulation. Other than that bit of tying finesse, I do like these shoes and they will stay in rotation among its Merrell stablemates.",
