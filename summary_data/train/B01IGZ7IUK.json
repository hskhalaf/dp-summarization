      "text": "Keen recently changed their shoes dramatically. I used to be able to walk out of REI with a size 9.5 men's Keen of any style and feel confident they would fit. Typically there wasn't even a break-in period even for their hiking boots. But now even with styles I've been buying for years, I had to go up to a size 11M to keep my toe from contacting the tip of the boot. Of course, at that size, the boot didn't fit the rest of my foot. These Montfords fit the closest to the old Keens. I used Amazon Wardrobe to get 5 different styles of Keens and kept these.",

After wearing all day my small outside toe will begin to ache but for 6 hours or less they are fine. They breath much better than the all leather Rialto, which is why I bought them. I have had them since October 2018 and they are holding up great to daily use around town. I'm happy, I would buy them again.",

      "text": "Bought these after trying on many different shoes. I wanted low-tops that would be all-purpose shoes for a 11 day trip to Ireland. These did the trick. The tread is not as rugged as most hiking shoes, and was worried i might slip around. In Dublin they did seem to slip around a bit in the rain, but after some wear they did just fine. By the time we reached Giant's Causeway they were plenty grippy. Wasn't doing any major treks, longest day was just a little over 8 miles. I was comfortable the entire journey.",

But they had dog hair all over them like the previous person had a dog that seriously sheds a lot. So that was kinda of a turnoff.",
