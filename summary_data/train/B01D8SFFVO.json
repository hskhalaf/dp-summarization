Even for personal use you can't beat the practical constant good result and the cost advantages of Parker / Shark blades over other options, that are frequently shown on TV commercials for membership. Shaving is a skill and art that can easily be mastered in short practice. Once you use a straight razor you will likely fall in love with it.",
