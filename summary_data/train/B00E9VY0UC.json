While it is hard to tell in photos, the leather is extremely soft and supple. They are light and really flexible. I usually wear new shoes around the house to decide if I want to keep them or not. After awhile, I forgot that I had these on. I dont know how they will hold up in the long run, since I have not had them very long and have not started to wear them outside much, but so far I am very satisfied.",

So, we have sandals that don't fit and basically have to pay postage for the chance to have tried them on. (net of 3 stars) Buyer beware!",

We were pleased to see that this one did not. It has velcro on the back to adjust. I can't get them off of him. Bed is very soft, hardly needs to be broken in at all. The look makes it casual tho. You wouldn't go out to the clubs with these. Also, Clark's are very well made so I expect these will last him as long as the doomed puppy doesn't find them!",

A lot of brown dye came off on the rag. I'm not sure if the mold or whatever will grow back. The footbed is flat, with no arch support, and were made in India. I would not recommend this shoe.",
