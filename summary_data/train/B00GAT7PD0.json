However, after a couple of months I experienced problems with the charger, so I had to purchase a new one. Now, only 7 months on, it's starting to freeze if I try to load more than a simple page.. ie something with a video or lots of adverts. I appreciate it's not that expensive, but if you need to replace it after less than a year, I can no longer recommend it.",

The Chromebook is great for that because I only need it to create documents on and to browse the internet. It does both of these things brilliantly. It is very fast and very quiet because there's no fan. It only works on wi-fi, but that's fine because I would only ever use it in places with wi-fi (although there are a number of functions that still work offline).",

The 2gb of RAM and processor will probably slow you down. Superb as a second machine and miles better than all those tablets if you actually need to get something done",

What a great price - cheaper than replacing the ipod touch that has been very disappointing. We are not computer geeks so this product is ideal - nothing for us to upgrade or worry about.

But i like it because its quick and i mean quick no waiting around. First turn on it downloads an update then you can start using it with your google account or make an account. I think to be honest this is better than a tablet pc.",

The Acer C720 is blisteringly quick on start up and the battery lasts longer. So in summary, the Acer C720 is faster, has better battery life but the HP just shades it as it has a better screen, is lighter, and looks so damned nice. I was tempted to swap with the person I gifted the C720 to but on balance I will keep the HP11. I am very much sold on the Chromebook concept as well.",
