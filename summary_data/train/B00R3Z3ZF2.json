They are difficult to put together/take a part and just feel low quality. 2. The knives need sharpened frequently. Overall these knives or just ok if you are used to quality knives. If you are used to using super cheap knives these will be an upgrade.",

Nice sharp edge and the knife sharpener is basic, but if you know how to use it correctly it'll get the job done. The only thing I don't like is that the steak knives aren't smooth edges.

      "text": "Bought this set to replace an old cheap set that we\u2019ve had for several years and couldn\u2019t be happier. Quality is way beyond what we expected, arguably better than another set we considered that was 3x as expensive. These knives are very solid, have a nice feel in your hand and are well balanced. Blades are as sharp as you\u2019d want and the set arrived in less than 24 hrs in flawless condition. At this price, you can\u2019t go wrong with this set. I would be proud to give these as a gift too. Would be a great starter set for a new couple or anyone moving out on their own for the first time.",
