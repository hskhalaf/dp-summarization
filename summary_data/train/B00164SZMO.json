There isn't much room for slack to hang on a leash when your dog is about 10 inches tall. Also, the adjustable buckles didn't stay in position for me. They ended up loosening up and my dog slipped out of his harness. Luckily I caught him before he could get to a busy Chicago street.

My dog likes to pull but is only 40 pounds. The design of the attachment ring is such that it cuts through the webbing holding it. It is a horrible design. Additionally the adjustable straps won't stay put so you have to keep re-adjusting them. This is a more minor nuisance although maybe with some dogs they could get loose.

We were in the woods for miles, she didn't pull, was much more obedient, what a pleasure. The only negative is she has to relearn the command \"come back now\". That's for when she runs off around trees, over branches. With the command she could retrace every step back to me. She will relearn it fast enough. GREAT product recommended.",

I am also pleased that my dog is not being strangled if she suddenly decided to run at a wild animal or some other distraction. Sometimes she decides to go on strike and lie down in amost inconvenient place. I am able to lift her easily onto all fours and she is ready to go. I recommend this to everyone that has a dog - small or large. I keep it on my dog all the time (and attach lead when needed).",

When I made him come out he would come over and put his nose on the floor or his head against the chair to keep it from going over his head. With the Kurgo he comes running. Suggestion: Stitch the strap that goes from the neck to the back to the short strip that fastens around the body. It can turn upside down and get tangled and then the plastic buckles don't match up. That's it. Diego likes his harness.",

I think this should be advertised for medium and large dogs only.

So much for safety!. But the harness is nice in its own right and the idea is pretty ingenious.",
