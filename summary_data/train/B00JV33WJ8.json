This product can be used as a forced air dryer and with a quick change be converted into a stand dryer for hands-free drying and brushing. With a house full of standard poodles - that is an enormous help - I don't have to deal with two different tools - one will do the job of both! Highly, highly recommend this product.",

It may not be as strong as a full sized force dryer, but it's strong enough to do a blow out on a husky and get all the loose fur out. It's very strong for it's little size. It's also super light so it's really easy to carry it around the salon. The hose is really durable too and it fits well into the dryer. Great product! I highly recommend it!",
