I figured I would give it a try for a few days just to be sure, but wasnt expecting much. Turns out, the results justified the slight downsides! My fine smile lines are significantly reduced - I'm 35 and have just started to really notice them, but this has made a big difference; they're practically gone. It's not as effective on deeper lines, but I expected that. The light stinging never caused redness or itching and subsided after a week or two of regular use. Will definitely buy this again.",

I've found the darkness has diminished, but not disappears; which is acceptable. The big surprise was the firming of the skin. It took regular application and some patience; but, all of a sudden, I noticed that the skin was firmer when I worked in the eye cream. Ladies, your quest is over. This is the freal deal - at last!",

It was the only thing that somewhat abated the bags and puffiness. This eye gel works wonders in reducing puffiness! It's astounding tosee the results, even just a few mins after applying the gel.
