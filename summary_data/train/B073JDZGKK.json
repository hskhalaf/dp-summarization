The dock doesn't work when plugged in. I have to unplug both monitors from the dock, and plug them back in (thunderbolt first) to get the monitors to work. It's harder than it used to be before I dropped $300 on a dock. I spent about 3 hours with tech support, confirming that everything was up to date and functional, before giving up. Huge waste of time and money.",

      "text": "2018 MacBook Pro two weeks old. I've used the dock for 2 days at work. Ethernet, power, 2 monitors VGA with dongles for the Display Port and the USB Thunderbolt connection, a backup external hard drive. Set up was easy, hooked everything up and it worked perfectly the first time. Day one at lunch I had to reboot the computer for some reason, I don't know if it was the dock or something else. Day 2 no reboots, no issues. one nice feature is I charged my mouse overnight using the front USB port. I just need to remember to unmount the external drive if I unhook the computer. Great so far. I don't expect any issue.",

A 3 foot cable would have been ideal, and I see there are now 6 feet T3 cords now (at 100w, 40gb). Maybe even a discount for purchasers to upgrade cables, as T3 cables with these specs are expensive.
