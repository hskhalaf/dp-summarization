The only negative that I've seen in the 5 years of owning them is that the plastic liner can dry out and crack with time. It typically happens on the corners of the mattress but it doesn't always happen to on every corner. Even so, I would still buy another one if needed. They are worth the money.",

It doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that this mattress is unsafe. I realized after placing my son down in his crib for a few naps that his head and torso sunk in quite a bit. If he were to roll on his stomach, as all babies do, this would be a huge suffocation hazard. He is not rolling yet but I am tossing this and ordering a new one ASAP. Back to the bassinet for naps, he goes!",

My son, who is now 12 1/2 pounds at 4 months, leaves indentations in this mattress and we just started putting him in it (was in a bassinette until now). I am now already looking for a replacement as I am afraid to leave him in it at night. I would not recommend this mattress as it is too soft.",
