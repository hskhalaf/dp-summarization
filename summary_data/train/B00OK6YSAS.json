I used this polarizer on a recent trip to Peru and was satisfied with its ability to \"pop\" blue skies and reduce reflections on various backgrounds. Given its relatively small light loss, I left it on all day and also used it in low light situations which would would have been unthinkable before. One adjustment I made was to increase the ISO by one f-stop to compensate for indoor shooting.",

I suspect the B+W has better light transmission because it looks a lot brighter through the viewfinder and shoots a stop faster. It's also less picky when shooting wide. The Hoya has a bad habit of polarizing one side of the frame (dark sky) while the other side of the frame is isn't (bright sky). This is somewhat expected when shooting wide, because your picture covers 180 degrees of sky - the polarization angle in respect to the sun is different on one side vs. the other. However, the B+W seems to cope better in this situation, allowing more polarization before the disparity becomes unacceptable.",

      "A MUST-HAVE \u2013 Whether you\u2019re indoors or outdoors, the right polarizing filter is a must for every photography equipment. No other filter provides such a simple and fast method for breathtaking pictures through reduced reflections on water and smooth non-metallic surfaces. Enjoy richer colors in landscape photography, outlining clouds, skies, and skylines in perfect clarity.",
      "EASY TO USE CAMERA FILTER - The K\u00e4semann polarization filter can easily be screwed onto the filter thread of most lenses. Thanks to its special design, the adjustment ring can then be rotated on the filter without resistance in order to improve your images in the simplest possible way. You see an immediate result through the camera viewfinder, or on the display. Adjust the effect strength as desired.",
      "BEST WORKMANSHIP - The High Transmission (HTC) polarization film is set between two precise ground and polished cover glasses. It is particularly neutral in color and of high quality, providing for much sharper and richer images than conventional polarizing filters. The MRC glass has been refined with several wafer-thin layers of coating to ensure high scratch resistance and a dirt- and water-repellent effect due to nanotechnology (lotus effect).",
      "TOUGH & SOLID MOUNTS - B+W sockets are absolutely accurate, easy to apply, and easy to adjust as polarizing filters thanks to their precision manufacturing. With an extra narrow XS-PRO mount, vignettes can be ruled out in most cases, even at high wide-angle angles. Due to the internal thread, a conventional lens hood can also be fitted so you can take better pictures.",
      "MADE IN GERMANY - Schneider Kreuznach (B + W) \u2013 We\u2019re proudly your precision mechanics specialists for filters, photography, optics and precision, with more than 100 years of German experience. Schneider products have already been used in NASA's Apollo missions. Thanks to our multi-resistant nano coating lens filter, we\u2019re helping photographers everywhere take clearer, crisper images."
