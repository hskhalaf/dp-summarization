      "text": "This salad spinner is pretty simple to use and lasts surprisingly long time. My first exact spinner lasted more than 5 years and eventually the plastic inner basket started to break and the bowl stained to an ugly brown color. I like how its construction doesn't contain too many parts, meaning it will have less parts to break. Just put the veges in, close the lid and give it a whirl and most of the water will be drained.",

It's not that large, which is great because it fits in a drawer, but is large enough to handle a salad for 4 people. It weighs nothing, cleans easily and does what it is designed to do.",

It's more direct, you spin the top knob and the basket spins,it's sturdy, solid, and I believe I won't be able to break it even if I tried to.
