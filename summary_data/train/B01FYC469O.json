We have a 1,000 square foot place and collected almost 1/2 cup of water in just 24 hours. It's sleek, quiet, and modern looking and I highly recommend one for each floor of the house!",

Within a day, I didn\u2019t need my AC. Even when the temps climb up over 90, I rarely need my AC now. I usually dump out the water myself before it\u2019s full, so that way I can keep it running continuously. One night, the machine turned off while I was asleep and I woke up the next morning feeling totally scummy and damp. It\u2019s really powerful and very effective!",
