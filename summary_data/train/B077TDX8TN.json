I am angry and very disappointed. Not to mention, I now have a broken-hearted six year old who doesn't understand why he cant play his new game. It is difficult navigating this whole Nintendo world as somones who l\\knows nothing about games, let alone navigate misleading and corrupt business practices of the sellers. I wish I could sue for fraud, but I will take my $30 knocks and walk away with empty handed. Hard lesson learned..",
