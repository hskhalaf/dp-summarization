The handle is not solid as the rubber grip actually shifts around whatever is used as its core. The exterior metal is quite soft and gouges easily. A Harbor Freight hammer damaged it. May be worth the $10 to some but if you are wanting a dead blow or even a decent hammer, I'd look elsewhere.",

This hammer has a light head and so the 32 oz is distributed in a manner that does not maximize the impact. The Armstrong hammer, made by Trusty-Cook, is perfectly balanced with a bigger more substantial head. The Chinese hammer has less dead blow action ( shape of shot chamber, weight of shot, size of shot, etc,) and is inferior to the Armstrong in delivering maximum shock to the striking surface. This hammers are for automotive/ industrial applications not for driving nails.",

    "description": "Size:1lb\n\nDead Blow Ball Peen Hammer is an optimal machinist hammer. It combines the effortless positive strike from a dead blow hammer with hardened steel domes for shaping and forging metal. The steel faces are used for striking, shaping, flattening and expanding metal. Show-filled dead blow action reduces rebound while providing maximum striking force, saving your arm and wrist from strain and capable of giving the force you need in tight spot. The premium polyurethane construction is not only durable but also resistant to a wide variety of oils and solvents. Textured handle provides a non-slip grip\n\nFeatures:\n\n * Polished Steel Hammer Face and Peen - Provide for a smooth striking surface ideal for striking hammering and straigtening metals and striking punches and chisels\n * Shot Filled Bead Blow - Enhances rebound reduction and providing unequaled striking force. The feature reduces fatigue allowing you to use this hammer all day\n * Industrial Construction - Welded steel shanked handle is fixed to canister head and throughout the handle providing unmatched strength. The flared end and textured polymer overmold grip ensures the hammer stays in your hand\n * Non-marring, Non-sparking - Unicast poly molded body prevents hammer from wearing away between the head and handle and material prevents sparks upon impact\n * Resistant Material - Hammer may look soft, but it can take a lot.
