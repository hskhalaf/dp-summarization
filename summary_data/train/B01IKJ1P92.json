This is the best relief cream we have found, including prescription cream. We love the fact that it is a cream and not an ointment. It not only works better than anything we have found, it is a cream and not an ointment so it is not greasy at all and does not leave any type of stain and soaks right into the skin. The only thing we use now.",

Maybe this is a very liquid type of cream but liquid all the same. One container totally wasted.

It\u2019s cold and the smell is eucalyptus , I like but I do not know if it\u2019s really effective yet. Just wrote this to warn the other to be careful in opening the jar.",

I love the smell and do use it for my sinuses as well. Nothing cures arthritis in your knees but this is such a relief. I recommend you try it. Just order one and see it works as well for you.
