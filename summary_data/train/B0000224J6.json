Or maybe not, It's only a 10\" wrench and not all that heavy. But that's the only other option I would have considered, because the fact is you can't really find a better pipe wrench than these wrenches from Rigid. They're made in the USA and they're no more expensive than any other quality pipe wrench. Pretty much a no brainer, BUY this wrench if you need one, you won't be disappointed.",
