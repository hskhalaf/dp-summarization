I may have to purchase one for myself. I would highly recommend.",

My only gripe concerning comfort is I use this chair for gaming. Hence the two pillows which I always keep on the chair. Also, and this is minor, the black caps (not sure what they're called) continuously fall off somehow every now and then. They can be placed back on easily with a little bit of manual pressure by hand. Other than that, the chair's very comfortable. Furthermore, it's durable and sturdy. I've had this chair for 3 years and going, and I remain happy with it.",
