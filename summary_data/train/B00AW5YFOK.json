Big mistake!! These ear muffs are EXACTLY, repeat EXACTLY same as the nearly twice as much clear armor!! They clearly came out of same press, absolutely perfectly identical!! They are adjustable, not sure why others say that. My head is large and fit fine, superb protection!! Don't buy more expensive pair, only difference is name on side of them.",

The padding feels comfortable to me: not as soft as a $200 pair of stereo earphones, but rather with some ruggedness for the range.
