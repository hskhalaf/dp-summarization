It has a nice output, substantially better than the 250 watt personal heater I have. The casing and cord stay cool, and it automatically shuts off when moving it (and then goes back on when stable). This is a PERSONAL heater that has limited output, but again it is super helpful for me, because I can't run stronger heaters without risk of blowing fuses.",

However, it does the job it is supposed to do.",

Lucky for me, I\u2019m the only thing I wanted heated (not the entire room).",
