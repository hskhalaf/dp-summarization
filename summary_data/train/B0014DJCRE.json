      "text": "Very compact portable speakers for any MP3 player not just the iphone. The sound quality isn't bad for such small, not very hi-tech speakers. It runs on Ac adapter or batteries but haven't tried battery power yet to comment on how quickly or slowly it eats up batteries. I agree with the 2 prior reviews- a place to store the cords would be great as the speakers fit into a small ball already and a charging dock for your MP3 would be helpful. But, a great set of portable speakers for the price point.",

      "text": "I use this in the bathroom so I can listen to my iphone while showering and watch news podcasts while at the sink. Most speakers like this don't let the iphone sit horizontally for watching video. It would be better if it could go louder, but it's acceptable for a small room. It's also bigger than I thought, probably too bulky for a messenger bag. Would also be nice if next generation used the dock connector so it can charge the iphone.",
