It's now August and I just ordered another pair of TOMS from THEIR online store, at least I know they're real TOMS. I'll be a fool to re-order from these people.",

These seem to run a bit smaller or they're cut on a very different last (shoe mold.) I ordered a size 9 initially and I could barely get them on. Hence, I exchanged them for a 10...the 10's were HUGE! So I figured I must be a 9.5. However, the 9.5's are still loose in the back and I need to wear a blister strip on my heel to prevent rubbing. They're very comfortable aside from that, but the sizing is very strange.",
