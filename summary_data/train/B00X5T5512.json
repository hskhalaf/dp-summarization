They were exactly what I was looking for - a more modern looking, affordable option to glass champagne flutes. They are made from very sturdy plastic compared to the cheap disposable kind. One review indicated that they could be tippy, but I think that would only happen if you're outside & it's windy, or you place on an uneven surface. My guests used a wine glass marker to write their names on the flutes which washed off easily when done using. Love that these are reusable, they stack & have lids for compact storage. Priced right - very affordable. Would definitely recommend!",
