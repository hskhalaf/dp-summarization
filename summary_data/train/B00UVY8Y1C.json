After using the saw for three months (very light use), the dust blower stopped working. I opened the cover and found that the bellows is a cheap rubber type thing that now has a big crack in it. I just sent an email to Porter Cable and will update here what I find out for them. If they want me to take it to a service center, forget it. The part is enough to change myself and the saw is too bulky to be moving around like that.",
