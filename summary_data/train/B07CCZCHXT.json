Both the silver and the darker grey metal ring holders look high-quality, and I love that the phone stays in place in the car vent - my phone didn't wobble at all. I had a question about the ring holder and the seller was lightning fast in their response. The only thing to be mindful of is that the adhesive will stick best to a completely flat surface like plastic or polycarbonate, not fabric or an uneven surface (like pebbled leather).",
