We only used this a limited amount as it was in our bonus room. Bought a new bulb and it didn\u2019t fix the issue. Our only option now is to pay for shipping back to them and wait and see what they do. Very disappointed in this product, especially because the picture quality was very good.",

Beware though, if your not using a projector screen, and plan on using this in a LIT ROOM, you'll quickly realize it's not bright enough. It's QUIET, and... it blows out some hot air, as you'd expect. We use it for events, shows, flea markets, to promote our products, and with a simple power-point presentation, it drew people better than any signage we've ever had.

We play Rocket League on it and I don't notice any lag compared to playing on a PC gaming monitor. Another pro is that it was easy to adjust.

The 4K input does improve video quality however, and the HDR is awesome to boot. Great lumens, throw distance, and picture quality make this an excellent projector. There are one caveat but at present shouldn't really matter all that much to most people: HDR will not work in 120hz Game mode. For me this is okay, as 60Hz is good enough for me in HDR, as most console titles max out at 60fps anyway.",

Even though it is true 120hz, it did not take my long to notice the very nauseating \"rainbow effect\" that I was completely unaware of with these projectors. I would shy away from cheaper DLPs and only opt for 3LCDs - which I know for a fact don't have this issue. It may not affect you like it affects me, and if you have a different use case it may work fine for you, just beware of this potential drawback. It was a dealbreaker for me as I found it difficult to use for more than 15 minutes at a time.",

It basically covers the whole wall just being like 3 or 4 feet away and honestly looks better than i imagined it would. I can even have the lights on while watching it. Though my inside lights aren't super bright. I use it for watching tv and playing video games and would highly recommend it.",

The Darbee enhancement is great as you can definitely see the difference in texture and it makes the screen more defined when being projected over 150\" ....would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great projector for watching movies, gaming, etc.... Great for outdoor movie watching too ....",
