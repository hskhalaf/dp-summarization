May be a hazard as the unit turned on and started beeping suddenly today even though unit was left in the off position. Sounds like something is shorted in the display or board to me.

The only thing that I the other pot had that was better was the pressure cooker value. My old pot was always in a locked position so you just had to push the button to release pressure. With the Cosori, you have to remember to turn the knob back if you have released pressure. It doesn't happen often, but it's just another step. For future upgrades to the pot, this is the only thing I would change. Not a deal breaker. This is a great cooker!!",

Maybe not seated correctly at assembly or a piece of debris or flash stuck in valve? The company help line suggested I check this valve for the proper number of ridges, which is why I pulled it off in the first place. The valves were not the defective ones they suspected. Also, one pot had a one inch spot that was extremely hard to slide the seal under. The help line wasn\u2019t too concerned about that. I wonder if bending that wire slightly out to ease the pressure would inhibit sealing? Otherwise, the pots work beautifully.",

I researched this brand and compared it with the more expensive Instant Pot (since it's all the rage) and found they basically had the same ratings but this brand was less expensive. It also came with a glass lid attachment and an extra sealing ring which the Instant Pot did not have. I've cooked 6 meals in it and they all turned out VERY good! There are a lot of recipes on Pinterest to try out \ud83d\ude0a",

Cleaning is a bit of a nuisance since you're supposed to remove the silicone ring and metal cap over the safety valve every time.",

We just put everything we want for the meal (the meat, vegetables, potatoes, seasonings, and very little broth) into the pot, put the lid on, press a couple of buttons and within an hour, we have a complete meal.",

All this is great except the steam valve will not longer hold any steam. I emailed customer service and they have not gotten back to me. This is upsetting. I paid 90$ and now its a 90$ paper weight or maybe I can use it for fondo!",
