      "text": "I could gush about this camera for hours but really I think the highest praise I can give it is that it's the only modern camera I've ever owned that I didn't hate for some reason or other(s). It's an incredibly versatile camera that takes good pictures and is a pleasure to shoot with. Nothing about it feels compromised or poorly thought out. The standout feature is the \"hybrid viewfinder\", and the design of the rest of the camera follows it. The viewfinder is very good at everything it sets out to do. If the idea of it appeals to you, you should absolutely buy this camera, you won't be disappointed.",

The camera and 23mm F2 Graphite lens have become my favorite go to outfit in my Fuji collection.",

This camera is fast, responsive and the added features of dual card slots, focus point joystick and center weighted metering are the features that were needed for Fuji to compete with other professional cameras. They dynamic range is so much better than my Canon and finally the fast autofocus I can capture action as a bonus. So looking forward to using this camera at my next wedding! Fuji, come out with a wireless TTL flash system - only thing that is missing. For now I'll use my RadioPoppers with my Canon flashes.",
