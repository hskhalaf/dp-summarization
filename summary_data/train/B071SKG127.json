This one is adjustable and I love that the entire thing can be washed! The tray is also great with a spot for a cup and additional items! Update: after washing the cover just ONE time, part of the back tore open. I\u2019m so upset because obviously that part is going to need to be washed a lot. Very disappointed.",

The back of the seat easily pulls of constantly and the tray hardly stays in place. Supposedly your supposed to be able to raise the seat, the seat doesnt raise. My mother in law has the same seat, hers also doesnt raise. I would never recommend this seat and if I still had the box I would return it.",

The tray is extremely difficult to align and getting it to stay requires a lot of jiggling in order for it to click. It does. It seem to be made very well either. Super disappointed in this!! On a positive note I will say it is very easy to clean and assemble.",
