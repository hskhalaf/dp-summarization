I really like the belt and still use it daily, but I will be more conscious as to what pants/shorts I wear it with, and try not to get it wet. In the pictures, the reason it did not get sweaty on the right rear is because that is where my IWB holster was located, separating the shorts from my sweat.",

      "text": "Very thick and sturdy, feels secure. I purchased this because I carry ccw both in the waist and outside the waist and was tired of flimsy belts. The heaviest gun I carry is a Sig P229 legion. Only thing I hate is that because this is real leather, my owb holster makes a sound with this belt, which is the kydex rubbing against the belt where the belt loops of the holster rest on the belt. Besides that I use this belt to open carry when I\u2019m on duty (plain clothes detective) and I never have any issues. Very happy with this purchase.",

The magazine's for the XDM are 19+1, The speed loader would not fit over the shoulder of the magazine even though it said XD on it . The whole order was wrong, so I got irritated and returned the entire order for a refund.",

      "text": "Ordered two belts, black & brown, very high quality and durable belts. Ordered size 42 (size 38 pants), and belts ran a little big for sizing. Instead of buckling the middle (4th) hole, it was comfortable at the last (7th) hole. Relentless ownership honored their word, free returns and free replacement belts arrived within 3 days of creating replacement order. Now have both in size 40 belt, and comfortably buckle using the 3rd and 4th holes. Highly recommend, and would order again. Belts look professional (office job not allowing me to carry), yet durable when carrying my concealed holster/weapon. Thanks again Relentless Tactical!",

I normally wear a size 40 pants/cargo shorts and per the sizing chart, ordered a 44 which ended up being too large and my gun and holster were being pulled down and cargo shorts were almost falling off. I reordered a size 42 which fits much better and allows to be tight but not too constrictive. Might want to update the sizing chart. The belt is very well made though, so besides that, i'm very happy with the product.",

If that's you, work with their chart. If not, grab a belt you currently use, MEASURE from where the prong hits the frame to the CURRENT hole, and that;s your waist size. If you are using this for IWB concealed carry, add two inches. Any bigger and you'll look like a dork. Trust me. The retail store did not have the correct size so I came to Amazon and ordered the correct size, but I DID purchase. You'll like it. EXCELLENT QUALITY!!!",
