However, when I received the case, one of the fans wasn't working (bottom one), and when I removed the safety film off the front panel, there was a large crack in the middle of it. The material the case is made out of is very flimsy. Would not recommend. Amazon support did a great job in providing compensation for the damage though.",

It's easy to work on and quiet. The only reason I have given it 4 stars under 'easy to remove' is because of the power supplies location. I'm probably being a bit harsh but its a tight fit and I wouldn't want to remove it without stripping the rest of the hardware out first. It has some nice features like foam over intake fan points - just little touches. If I could think of anything remotely negative to say, it's a bit larger than I'd imagined.",

Both side, top, bottom, AND front panels can be removed for assembly/maintenance.

Works great with Mystic Light. The lighting effects for the fans are gorgeous. If you want you can connect them directly to your board and use RGB, Mystic Light, etc. to control them, but you lose some of the effects from the case controller board by doing that.",
