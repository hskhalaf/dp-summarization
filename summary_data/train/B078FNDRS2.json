      "text": "Arc'teryx makes incredible gear and this coat was really well engineered with thoughtful touches (like the zipper garage around the neck so you don't get scratched by the zipper teeth). But the large is made for women who have HUGE chests (who are they measuring?) - this is true in general now with outdoor gear companies. Size large is assumed to also be Size BIG, which I am not. At 5' 10\" 135 pounds I'm not wide, but I am tall. So for my body, this was a no go. The fabric is also really stiff and very noisy.",

I probably should have looked up what a morganite stone looks like - but it doesn't look like the photo. It was a pink hue but looked more like an opal. Definitely not the neutral in the photo. I'm returning for a small and different color. It did seem really warm and I didn't have any issues with the zipper. It's perfect for the city. I bought it to zip myself into something to keep warm when I am walking the dog.",
