However, after receiving it and spending the past few hours getting it setup, it is still an awesome phone. I'll be testing out the cameras this weekend. I am also glad that it uses two SIMs. For those curious, it does force you to choose between using the secondary SIM or an SD card. Luckily, it comes with a 64GB ROM. That is plenty for me. The included case is really slick. I hope some hard shell options become available.",

It's fast, snappy, great screen, amazing battery life and awesome camera front and back. I can't belive it lol I know it's a ported phone but I'm glad they did this one cause it works. I git it for $199 but even if I had paid $299 it's still worth it. I'll update more later on as use it more.",

Running graphics intensive games on this, can get 10 hours easy without a charge and without any breaks. Just normal usage should last two or three days without any problem. Everything else is great as well: speed, memory, display, sound, etc... The only negative is the screen shattered on me from a two foot drop. That was the original reason for three stars, but a good protective case should solve that issue. Just be very careful with this if you aren't using a case.",

Also the lack of software updates will continue to be th Achilles heel for Blu phones in general. We should at least have Oreo and with the push that Google is making to get more Android phones with up to date software there really isn't an excuse to still be running such old software. Other then that I think this a great phone for the price and I've yet to see a phone that beats this phone with equivalent specs at this price.",

I do agree with others that the case is a bit ugly but it was free so I can't complain too much. Well worth 249.99 or even the 300 when it goes up in price.",

About 3 months ago, I find that text messages aren't getting updated for extended periods of time, then arriving in clumps. It's not a question of bars either. This makes conversations virtually impossible. After a factory reset, everything seemed to work reasonably for about a week. Then they went back to being delayed. I am incredibly disappointed with this product.",

If your looking for a phone that has a great camera, Loud Speakers, and outstanding battery life to which even Apple can't even compete offers 4010MAH were the latest Iphone is 2716 lol, it's clear which phone offers more value and better quality then most overpriced flagship devices, overall very solid phone THANKS BLU!",

It's come to the point where I'm embarrassed because for important calls I wish I was home so I can use the home phone. Before I forget this phone won't read the memory card after a few weeks no matter how many times you change it or brands you buy for it. All this when it's not even a year since I got it",

Be aware the screen is super delicate so get a screen protector! I only had it for a short while before I cracked the screen, definitely not gorilla glass. But amazing phone.",

And I've dropped it a hundred times with no damage! I've had Blu before and I have no idea why I would even try anything else. Maybe because you sometimes feel that if it costs more, it's better quality? Not true!!",
