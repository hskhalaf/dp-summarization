I asked her how she likes it and she says, \"it works well, it's fast, not heavy and doesn't slip on her desk.\" This is the 3rd TI calculator I've purchased and overall I've been satisfied with their products. We use rechargeable batteries so I'm not concerned that it takes AAA batteries versus a rechargeable battery that comes with the TI-84 Plus CE.",

There are so many functions of use for the 84-plus, and I am still discovering more every day. The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I find at times the display is difficult to read while graphing. I knew there was a color edition which has a much nicer display, but the $60 price difference convinced me this one would be sufficent and it is. I recommend the 84-Plus for everyday graphing calculator needs.",

The RAM is non-volatile, which means the applications you install into RAM will be saved until cleared. The command combination of \"SHIFT + 7 1 2\" erases the RAM, and all installed programs on it. Erasing the RAM is necessary at times to revert everything to default. I don't like the idea that both the settings and programs are installed in non-volatile RAM. But hey, who am I to complain? Its drawbacks aren't too problematic for me. I like this calculator, overall.",

      "text": "I think this is one of the best calculators (both graphing and non-graphing) out there. I haven't had any problems with mine, and once you get the hang of how to use it, I think it is pretty simple and very useful, especially in high school and college level math classes. It even makes writing out simple math equations much easier than a non-graphing calculator. I would definitely recommend this.",

      "text": "I had originally purchased the TI-83 for an advanced algebra class, but was disappointed in the operation of some of the features. (I have detailed those in my review of the TI-83.) The TI-84 is exactly what I needed--the display is clearer to follow due to the usage of modified symbols and text sizes, and the scrollback feature to grab prior results or formulas is a must-have. For the little extra it costs to get the TI-84, do it! The TI-83 was fine in its day, but the added functionality of the TI-84 will make using the calculator much easier.",

There were some scrapes to the side of the calculator though and numbers carved on the back. Overall though, it is a useful calculator that you will surely need sometime in your educational career, and the wear was not a big issue.",

    "description": "The all-purpose TI-84 Plus graphing calculator, ideal for math and science, features more than a dozen preloaded apps including functionality that encourages exploration of interactive geometry, inequality graphing, and real-world data collection and analysis. Ideal for middle school through college.\n\nWhat's in the Box: \nTI-84 Plus calculator, impact-resistant protective slide case, TI connectivity/USB cable, silver oxide battery, four AAA batteries, Guidebook and free software Apps, warranty information. \nTI-Rechargeable battery\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAmazon.com Product Description Building on the hugely popular TI-83 Plus, which is perhaps the best-selling calculator of all time, the TI-84 Plus is completely compatible with its predecessor. From that well-established platform, this new model adds more speed (a processor that's 2.5 times faster), more memory (24 KB RAM and 480 KB of Flash ROM), an enhanced high-contrast display (eight lines by 16 characters), and more beloved Apps. \n\n \n\nIncludes a USB Port and cable. It also adds USB on-the-go technology (cable included) that can be used to share files with other calculators or to connect to PCs or optional presentation tools.\n\n \n\nComes with 12 pre-loaded Apps and supports all TI-83 Apps. Twelve Apps are pre-loaded, including Cabri Jr., CBL/CBR, Conic Graphing, Inequality Graphing, Probability Simulations, Science Tools, StudyCards, TimeSpan, Topics in Algebra 1 Chapter 5, Topics in Algebra 1 Chapters 1-4, Transformation Graphing, and more. For students in math and sciences, the TI-84 Plus is a powerful, problem-solving tool with features for storing, graphing, and analyzing up to 10 functions. Plus, it displays graphs and evaluates tables on a split screen, allowing you to trace the graph and scroll through table values simultaneously.\n\n \n\nSplit screen lets you view a graph and its equation at the same time. With the TI-84 Plus, you can view an equation, its graph, and the coordinates all at one time. Jump from point to point by entering a number. Several useful plot types are available, including scatter, box-and-whisker, XY-line, histogram, and normal probability plots. Advanced statistics and regression analysis, graphical analysis, and data analysis are readily accessed, along with features for calculus, engineering, financial, logarithm, trigonometry, and hyperbolic functions--all crucial tools for advanced analysis. With its clear display and fast processing, the calculator incorporates graphing tools for mathematics and science course work, including statistics and finance.\n\n \n\nThe included normal slide case is great for desktop work. The TI-84 Plus is powered by four AAA alkaline batteries (not included) and one silver oxide battery (included) for backup, with an automatic shutoff to save energy. It also comes with a hard normal slide case and is supported by a one-year limited warranty.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nTI-84 Plus, normal slide case, TI connectivity cable/USB cable, silver oxide battery, TI Product CD-ROM with full reference Guidebook and free software Apps, warranty information; four AAA batteries not included, alkaline recommended",
