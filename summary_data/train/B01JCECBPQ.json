      "text": "The second burner on this cooktop failed within about 3 months of receiving it. The warranty required me to pay for shipping to get it replaced by Cuisinart, which was over $60. The replacement cooktop has started giving the same error as the original when using both burners at the same time (the second burner turns off and displays an error code). Right now I'm using only one burner at a time and it seems to be OK, but I'm very disappointed that I can't use them both together. Otherwise I'm a huge fan of induction ranges--they're fast to heat up and don't create a lot of waste heat.",

Overall I can\u2019t recommend something that just stops working for no reason, then costs you to replace. In the end, this burner would cost us closer to $200+ to get a second \u201cfixed\u201d one, so just nite the bullet and get a nicer one instead.",

Also, because the current is shared by both burners, you can't use just one burner at full wattage which is much slower when boiling water for pasta or soups, etc. I would not buy this again. I used it about 3 times a week during the year this I had it. I've had other one-burner induction cookers and they will boil water quickly. I'll be buying another one-burner (Secura) which I had before and replaced because it died at one year. At least that burner isn't that costly and uses all its wattage on the burner.",
