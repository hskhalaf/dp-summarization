    "description": "Save-a-Garden is the New Generation of Insect Traps with a decorative design.\n\nThey contain no pesticides and are safe to use indoors and outdoors. Now you can protect your plants from flying insects that feed on their leaves and roots, trap them and stop the infestation without harmful chemicals.\n\nHow do they work?\n\nSmall insects are attracted by the bright yellow color. Once they land, the glue on both sides will trap them and they won't be able to escape!\n\nVery easy to use\n\nSeparate the traps by lifting the end of triangular plastic base. If some adhesive gets on your hand, remove with vegetable oil (or any type of oil) and wash with soap and water, or simply use disposable gloves to avoid contact.\n\nPlace them directly into the pot, or hang them from trees or larger plants by inserting twist ties in the punched holes. Each trap comes with its own wire tie.\n\nUse them for Whiteflies, aphids, gnats, fruit flies, fungus gnats, mosquitoes, thrips, leaf miners, leafhoppers, moths, sciarid flies, lepidoptera, diptera, nematodes, olive tree flies.\n\nTraps are ideal for flowers and vegetables, balconies, gardens, orchards, greenhouses etc...\n\nBacked by 21 Century Solutions 100% satisfaction guarantee or your money back!
