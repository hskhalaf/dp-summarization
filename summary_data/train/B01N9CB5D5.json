It is a little large around for her so if your child is 50 or 60% of normal it would still be good. Anyway, the product is well made and lovely fabric. We love it!",

My 9 year old wears an 8 in most things and the 8 fit her perfectly here...maybe because it's a tankini and so the length is forgiving. She is not tiny by any means but generally too small for a 10 in other clothes. Love it! And great price too.",

Tank top rides higher and bottoms sit so low, leaves a lot of skin between the two. She is used to rankings that nearly meet in the middle and leave only 1-2 inches of skin showing. Very disappointing because it is beautiful. Would return for a 14, which I know would fit, but would probably still leave too much skin and may ride up in her hips. So back it goes. We also got her a size 12 Keanu one-piece and it fits perfectly. So will order another one of those.",
