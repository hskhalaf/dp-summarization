Both of them leaked from the tip when inverted, so the sealing wasn't the greatest. It's getting ridiculously hard to find decent water guns anymore. It isn't like the bar is too high, all we want is for them to hold water, shoot a stream of water, and not break the first time you drop the damn thing.",
