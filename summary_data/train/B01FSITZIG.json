I have always worn a size 9 in all NB Minimus shoes and find no other shoe compares. However, these are too small, length wise. The gray/orange pair have been my faves and they are most like this new model. Some reviewers say the band across the top was too tight. I don't think it is-just the length. Hope this helps. I'm exchanging for a 9.5. Only gave 4 stars because of this - otherwise I love Minimus shoes!",

If you want a more natural feel when you run or walk, that's what you will receive in this shoe. They will take a while to get used to so take it easy at first and do short runs. well that's all I got.",
