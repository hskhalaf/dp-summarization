I thought, I'll just stash this in my tackle box and it'll always be there just in case the need arose. Turns out this knife is no joke. It's sharp and holds an edge well, it's got good flex and yet has a solid rigidity. The lock is sturdy and the knife feels safe and comfortable. This is the best filet knife I've ever owned.",

From trout on the clear lakes here in Alaska, to salmon on the silty glacier rivers, and rockfish and lingcod in the saltwater. This thing doesnt have a spec of rust. It is easily my favorite filet knife. Well my fixed blade buck filet is up there but this one gets alot more use in the field.",

I have tried so many different fillet knives, and this one by far is the most reliable one. It stays pretty sharp for at least 3-4 months without sharpening it even though I cut through tuna skin with it at least 4-5 days a week. I have owned this knife for about a year and so far it has not broken or gotten loose. It is very well constructed and reliable. I actually bought one for my co-worker and another one for myself so I now own 2 of this knife.",

Doesn't do a True fold -has a goofy blade tip extender that doubles as a blade lock when open.. feels pretty light and cheap. But CRKT usually holds an edge.. This is a Buck.
