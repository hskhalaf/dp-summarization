I bought this makers hammock because it was in a light color, for summer heat with the convertible top down. Turns out that the cover here is superior, and feel and look substantially thicker. The cinch straps for the head rests are a much more broad and thick and the clips larger and more substantial. The width seems less than the black hammock so I would say this light color might make for a slightly smaller coverage. This is a very good product value.",

It has large disconnect snaps, so passenger can easily get in the back seat if needed. CONS: None so far. BOTTOMLINE: This is a nice looking, inexpensive, SEMI-durable Dog Taco. NOTE: I bought a similar product that did not have quick release snaps. That seat cover also had its straps disintegrate in less than 6 months. These products are not all the same.",

The straps that go around the head rests help keep it up and the front keeps our dog off the console where she would be normally. It also keeps her from getting into the foot area (and getting stuck lol). It washes well and holds up to dirt, sand, etc. Great choice to keep your car relatively hair-free.

I wish it had clarified 'cars, mid-sized and smaller trucks, and some SUVs'. Fortunately, I also needed one for my car.

      "text": "So glad I bought this product! We have a 50 pound puppy that likes to ride but wants to climb in my lap while I'm driving. he has also had issues with getting car sick. Now he can ride in the back seat and this seat cover prevents him from crossing over to the front. It also is a good quality fabric that protects my seats from his nails and if he gets sick, I'm not having to scrub the vehicle like I did before.",

I have two dogs and one is always trying to jump onto the console and I am fighting her off. With this sling setup, not only does it prevent her from getting up front,it also protects them from falling to the floor if ai brake too quickly. I totally recommend this ,wish I had found it years ago. I will always have one and I';m ordering another for my wife\"s SUV. thanks guys,great idea and design! Roger Lawson -Dallas,Texas",
