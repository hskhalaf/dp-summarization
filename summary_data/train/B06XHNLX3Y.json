Boys being boys, they put them on right after opening the package and proceeded to bop each other up and down a field. Product surviving them = product well made. It was hard to imagine what size they would be prior to ordering. I would say these are perfect for kids under 10 who aren't too tall. They would probably be too short for everyone else. However, there is plenty of room inside for girth, so if you have a little butterball, fear not, these will fit.",

Will use again in future for youth group games and VBS. Bust a gut laughing at the kids playing with these! The teens said they looked like the \"blueberry girl\" from Willie Wonka with them on.",
