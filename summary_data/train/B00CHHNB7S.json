I went ahead and purchased another piece of glide strip from Dewalt to take care of the issue but I haven't installed it yet. I expect the saw to be solid after the \"fix\"... but this should not be a required step. If they fixed this issue, it would be a very nice saw. I also agree with the others who said the spring is too stiff. When making very long cuts (where you have to stretch out) it's hard to keep the saw down (plunged). I saw where another user replaced the spring, but I am not sure if I will go there or not yet.",
