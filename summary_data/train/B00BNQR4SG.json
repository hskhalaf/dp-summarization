I then rubbed Neatsfoot oil on it over the course of about three days. I probably put on about 20-30 coats, so it takes some patience. The results where totally worth it though. I'll add some before and after pictures but the real difference is in how it feels. The handle isn't nearly as slick and feels much more comfortable in my hand.",

Even the case is a joke, after unbuttoning you have to pull the handle awkwardly through the little opening. I guess you cant rely soley on good reviews.

It has a hefty weight for being a small hatchet but it allows it to give some extra swinging power. The sheath on ther other hand is cheapy made and its not made in the us. Its poorly desgined and it is very easy to cut your self when trying to put it on the axe, especially when you try to buckle it shut. If you plan on keeping the axe home and dont need the sheath then get this axe but if you backpack and camp like me, Id wait until they update the sheath. Hope this reveiew helps",

Its well made and lightweight enough to take backpacking, which is why I bought it. I like that the sheath is made from leather. My one complaint would be that it is unevenly made. The edges are a bit sloppy all around. I will probably treat the grip with some oil or other waterproofing agent, just to make sure the leather doesn't get wet and start to separate or shrink. Even if it does, it could be wrapped with paracord and that would be just as comfortable and useful as well. I'm glad I got this hatchet.",
