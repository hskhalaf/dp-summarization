After talking to Crucial's tech support, I found out that I would have to pay for shipping if I want to replace the drive under warranty, so keep that in mind. I also found out that Crucial wants you to connect the drive to power for 20 minutes, then disconnect it, and then try it again. According to their support person that \"very often\" fixes the drive. You can decide for yourself whether you want to trust a drive with your data if it just randomly shuts itself down and needs to be revived like this.",

      "text": "I bought this SSD because the MX500 is the cheapest SSD that includes power fail protection. Ordinarily you have to use datacenter rated drives to get this feature. I'm using these as a cache drive for my file server, so they get written to a fair amount. They don't publish endurance ratings but a few reviews indicated that they should be good enough for a low-use server. My experience has been different - in this use my drives show ~8% wear after just 300 hours of use. Your mileage may vary but based on this I'd expect to replace these drives every year in most desktop applications. I expected better from a drive that has a good reputation.",
