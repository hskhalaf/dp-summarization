HOWEVER, as others have noted, the UAE edition is the same region (region U) as the NA console, meaning they are basically identical aside from their serial number prefix and the fact that you can't have Nintendo NA repair the system. I never send my consoles to the manufacturer for repairs (I handle my own), so that's not a concern of mine. During the system setup, just select U.S. for your region just as you normally would, and you're good to go. You can interface this device with the original NA consoles for download play, etc. There is no difference.",

From what I saw, if you need it fixed then you will have to send it to Singapore or something, but I haven't had to do that with my old 3ds so I'm not too worried about this one breaking for no reason. Just be careful if you take it on the go. Old 3ds stylus is better imo, this one doesn't extend and feels lower quality",

      "text": "Bought this as a gift and it's absolutely awesome. It only comes with the 3DS (you need to buy a charging cable if you don't already own one). This New 3DS also comes with built-in support for amiibos which I think is crazy. The glossy black outer shell is gorgeous and the inner black has a nice matte black look. The device is a good size for playing more action packed games. Overall an awesome design for the 3DS XL if you don't already own one. **Note: this does not come with Sun or Moon. The games must be purchased separately.",

I am very satisfied with this purchase. Beautiful art on the shell as well! Shipping was incredibly fast! I really could not be any happier!",
