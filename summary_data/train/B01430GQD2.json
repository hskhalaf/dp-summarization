We were pretty happy with them for a few weeks then noticed the paint was coming off the bottoms of the blades. Didn't think much of it at first, just ware and tear. But within a few months the paint was coming off the full blade and onto our food. Even just slicing a meatloaf, or even warm bread we noticed paint through each slice of food. It eas enough for us to throw them out and look for something else.",
