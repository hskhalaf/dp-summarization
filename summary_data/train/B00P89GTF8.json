Either that or combine this with your favorite lotion. And definitely give it 10-15 minutes to dry before putting on clothes. It has very little scent (and a good one!) and I've had no irritation to my skin with this brand. I love Norvell!",

I\u2019m as white as a paper and Norvell gets me as tan as a beach-living suntanning-every day girl in a few uses! It is long lasting, I use it for 2 days in a row and then don\u2019t need to apply again for 6 days. Be sure to moisturize with a tan friendly moisturizer in between though!!! This and Skinny tan are the only products worth your money for home tanning. I\u2019ve tried them all, trust me. ;)",

Its slimy consistency makes it all too easy to spatter around and collect on odd surfaces during application so that you may later find a rueful stain on a cabinet front or passing blouse. Not one of my better finds, to say the least. Norvell can do far better than this.",

It\u2019s perfect for any skin tone because of the purple undertones so it will not leave you orange, as long as you apply evenly and make sure you rub it in, it\u2019s streak free. I applied after a shower and let it air dry for about 20 minutes before getting dressed and it did not rub off or stain my clothes or bedding. I woke up with great, even color. Will definitely order again and I highly recommend especially if your skin has red tones to it like mine.",
