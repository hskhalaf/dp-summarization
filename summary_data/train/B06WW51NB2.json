I'm giving it only 3 stars due to the fact that the remote hardly works. I have to mash the buttons multiple times just to change the light colors. I've switched out the battery. That did not fix the issue. I also have to hold the remote very close to the receiver to change the color.",

The lights stick perfectly and tightly on, and dont damage your interior when you take it off. HOWEVER, make sure you put them where you want the FIRST time because you'll lose the stickiness after taking it off once.",
