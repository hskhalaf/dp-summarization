After the phone company came out and ran the phone line we plugged the phone in, the answering machine portion seemed to work but after letting the hand set charge for over 24 hours we still could not use it. Guess the battery that was supplied was a dud. Since we couldn\u2019t get the phone line installed in a timely manner the time limit for making a return on the phone has passed. Boo.",

Great buy if you want a good low price phone with good sound, signal and many good features.",

It would be nice if the backlight on the screen was a tad brighter, but I'll not nitpick. There are a half-dozen or so Vtech phones in my family, and no complaints.
