So if you\u2019re buying last minute or for a birthday, I recommend to purchase it a few weeks in advance. And on top of that, it doesn\u2019t have a tracker, so I was unaware of where my package was. As for the product itself, it\u2019s very good quality, and very soft. Looks good, feels good, about the right size and it\u2019s just about what you would want in an angry bird plush.",

      "text": "My 4yr old son loves angry birds, and has amassed quite the collection of toys. I got this for his birthday and he loves it. He also got a larger 12\" version thats the exact same. Both make noise, but you have to hit them (throw them against something) really hard. It can be difficult sometimes to make it sound - but it's not like he minds throwing it around trying :-). Have had the toy for about 6 months. Stands up to light dog abuse, and heavy playing w/ a child (ie not of cheap construction). All in all a great angry birds toy, for a great price.",

That being said, they weren't terribly expensive for what they are and they are fun to toss around. Ended up making little forts with him and throwing the bird plushies across the room trying to knock them down.",

      "text": "Bought this for my son, he's crazy about Angry Birds. The toy is very soft, and great for kids. The sound feature is a small button located in the forehead of the bird. My only concern is that it can be a little tricky for young children to get the sound to work at first. A plus for parents is that the noise it makes is relatively quiet, so it's not as irritating as some of the really loud toys out there these days. Overall, lots of fun and very cute!",
