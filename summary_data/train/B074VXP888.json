Metal is thick and solid, does not flex when digging or prying. The narrow shovel is great for weeding and also has measuring marks engraved into the metal.",

The trowel helped dig to break up soil and make planting easier. We were able to dig holes as deep as we needed. We were also able to easily shovel the dirt in order to plant our seeds. It was a longer and we are finally able to start our garden. These tools are sturdy and will last a long time. They are also safe enough to be used by my children.",
