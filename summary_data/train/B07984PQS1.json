I'm writing now to say this is a good product made by a very awesome seller. The seller immediately responded and sent us a replacement. The binding on the edges and the velcro seemed to be redesigned resulting in no more popped fasteners in the night. And, the new model is much more comfortable to wear. Thoughtful touches include a sweat band if one is prone to that. This seller makes a great product. They are gracious and quick to respond to problems. Highly recommend!",

It arrived and it's really just a piece of stretchy fabric with some holes and Velcro. The idea behind it makes sense as if it's placed correctly, it will force your jaw up and hopefully alleviate the snoring. Unfortunately this ended up being more of the same, but I didn't want to give it a bad rating as I'm sure this will work for some people. Thanks for trying.",

I couldn't wait to use it the first night I received it, and I felt comfortable wearing it without feeling too compressed. And the way to put it on is very simple. The next morning, my boyfriend told me that my snoring last night was much less than usual, and I'm glad this is working. I'll continue to wear it to sleep from now on.",

He didn't find it too uncomfortable, though it did get scratchy the one day he forgot to shave. The biggest problem is, the material it is made out of looses the stretch after a week or so. Now where the holes for airflow meet the outside seam, it is starting to tear in between. Since it is also not stretching like it was, my husband has to tighten it every couple of nights just to help it keep his mouth closed, which just increases the amount it starts to tear.",

The rough velcro faces the head, and catches hair in it. It can take a lot of tugging to remove your hair from the velcro. The soft velcro should be in that location. I also had to use scissors to trim the material away from my ears so it didn't cover them.",
