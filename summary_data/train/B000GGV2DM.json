At less than 50 bucks, I thought it was too good to be true. Man, I couldn't have been more wrong. This thing is made out of good quality materials with an excellent fit and finish. I replaced the original head with another I had laying around. And I could not be more pleased. Now I'm considering an 8\" to go with it.",

I cranked it up super high and can just pop it anytime. Its my favorite part of my new.drumset. LOVE IT",

For $50 I wasn't expecting a whole lot but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a great addition to any drum kit. The head might be a little on the cheap side and can be dented more easily than most, but even so I am happy with this purchase.",
