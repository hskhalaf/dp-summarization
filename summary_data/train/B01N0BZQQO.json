Good price for 6 tubes...adds up to about 6 bucks per tube verses most are 10.00 to 12.00 now...up to 20.00 for Revolution per tube. I have used this med for many yrs....with no issues at all.

I applied the product and within the first 25 hours noticed pretty much no fleas in him anywhere. I gave it an extra day before allowing him to run around the house and my other 2 cats. Didn\u2019t see any on him. It\u2019s now been about 2 weeks and everything is still looking good. No bad reactions or sickness. Highly recommend this product!!",

If you have a heavy infestation, you still need to wash everything, vacuum every day, etc, or the problem won't go away. Capstar (or generic nitenpyram) will help.",

PETARMOR PLUS Flea and Tick Prevention for Cats conveniently provides vet-quality protection without the expense of a vet visit. It kills fleas, flea eggs, flea larvae, and ticks for up to 30 days. This flea & tick topical treatment for cats controls mites that may cause sarcoptic mange and kills deer ticks that may transmit Lyme disease, while preventing flea infestation for up to 4 weeks. Fast-acting, waterproof, and containing the same active ingredients as Frontline Plus for Cats, this flea & tick treatment for cats starts to work quickly and effectively. To apply, remove 1 product tube, cut off the top, and use the open end to part your cat's hair. Squeeze the tube firmly so that all of the solution is applied to your cat's skin between the shoulder blades. If the fur around the area still looks greasy 48 hours after application, use a wet washcloth to remove any excess product. Keep treated pets apart from each other, other pets, and children for 24 hours, until the product has time to dry completely.",
