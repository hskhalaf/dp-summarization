      "text": "Was super impressed by phone until I figured out it will not run Bluetooth 4.1 accessories which my five year old iPad can. Also the charger is nice but the cable is garbage order a well rated braided. Over all amazing features for the price but hugely dissapointed on the Bluetooth. Update- Had to lower my score a recent email I received from Blu indicates that the promised update, when it comes is \"...to make Lollipop more stable for this device\" as apposed to Marshmallow as previously promised. For years I used to sing Blu's praises I really would like to again.",
