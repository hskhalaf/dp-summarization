I wish I could back up a bit more sometimes. 14 feet would be ideal.",

Without this problem we\u2019d give it 5 stars without question and would have been very pleased with the purchase. It sure feels sturdy and well made as stated in many reviews. A concern is that since 5 screws failed, other screws may have been defective or over-tightened. It was just luck noticing the small screw heads in the large box after setting it up. Amazon was great in working with us for a refund.",

      "text": "This table is amazing! My husband and I love playing ping pong but we just do not have the space for a regular sized table for inside. After thoroughly researching options I purchased this as a surprise for Christmas. We could not be more thrilled. It has the feel of a full size, the bounce is true, the net is taut, the legs adjust. Assembly was a breeze as the legs just unfold . It stores easily as it breaks into two tables. I am amazed by the quality. Now I just need to work on my finesse shots.",

Due to this I was looking for table that I can fit in the garage, and can be folded and stored when not in use. This exactly matches that. Though the table size is smaller than the original table, we don't feel it. Use this every weekend. One advantage is once we get used to this table, we can play on the original sized one very easily. The quality of the table is very good and the product was received without any defect.",

The height of the legs are adjustable to allow for quick leveling. The table seems to be built very well. I'm used to playing on a full size table ; this table is a little narrower and shorter than a full size table. Once you get your \"game\" adjusted to playing on a smaller table, it is a lot of fun. Our family will be able to enjoy this table for many years. Thanks!",
