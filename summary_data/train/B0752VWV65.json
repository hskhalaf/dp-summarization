After the rice was done, I would wipe off the inside top of the rice cooker with a paper towel or sponge to remove the residue left behind. Today, I got it out to make some quinoa, and it was coated inside with fuzzy mold. Upon greater inspection, I found black mold behind the rubber seal and in the rolled aluminum that is part of the lid. This is so disgusting and impossible to clean off unless you take the entire product apart, screws and all. And, the rolled aluminum creases remain moldy. DO NOT buy this product. I don't think it's safe. Unless you like mold...",

You have to leave the lid open, because the moisture inside will remain inside, unless you clean it out every time.. I ended up buying another one that has the detachable bowl and lid, so you can take that piece out and put the actual cooker away.",

    "description": "Style:Rice CookerMaking a complete and balanced meal in the Hamilton Beach Electric Rice Cooker and Steamer is as easy as placing the ingredients in the bowl and turning it on. Not only does it cook rice and whole grains perfectly, but an integrated basket can be used to steam seafood, poultry and vegetables even while the rice cooks below. That means with just a few presses of a button, it\u2019s quick and easy to serve salmon with kale and quinoa one night and chicken and broccoli over white rice the next. The 2-in-1 steamer basket can also be used to rinse grains before cooking, which prevents clumping and results in a fresher taste. Clean up is a snap with the dishwasher safe nonstick cooking pot. Its compact size makes for easy storage. Cooking healthy, delicious meals doesn\u2019t get any simpler than that.",
