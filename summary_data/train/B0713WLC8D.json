The straps are very forgiving for the weight I put on it, and to top it all off, JanSport backs their product with a LIFETIME warranty (save your receipt)! The only caution I would give is that the light pink color does show dirt a little easier than other colors, but I can spot clean it super easy and quick with the durable fabric and mild cleaning solution, so for me, still not a drawback!!!",
