      "text": "So... I'm pretty irritated. This is the 4th container we have purchased and my husband is up MAYBE 3lbs. He lifts and eats. We strictly track everything so I know it isn't from something else. This product just doesn't work. 3 scoops is only 500 cals that is A LOT of powder, the scoops are huge. So it makes him too full to eat, in turn making this nothing but a meal replacement. Which won't make anyone gain. I wish I had went with my gut. Would return but was told I can't cuz it is opened........ Um.ok.",
