I definitely do not recommend this monitor for this price, the lack of quality control and shady marketing are instant turn-offs.",

Cant notice it on games go often because of constant moving. But my black background shows it quite easy. 9.5/10 would buy again.

When I got this monitor, and played a few games, I could definitely tell the difference and didn't feel as though I was being shot way before I saw the person. Feels much more even when popping around the corner and being surprised by the enemy. Would definitely recommend for xbox gaming. FPS specifically.",

Goes perfect with my PlayStation 4 Pro. I also love watching movies on this way better then my regular flat screen. I leave hdr on and the eye assist off. If you're going to use it with the PlayStation 4 pro, just know you have to change the output settings in your PlayStation 4 settings to 1940. A display cord is not necessary. I went through so much trying to ensure I had 4K quality. Wanted to pass along what I've learned.",

I. + modes to balance maximum contrast and vibrancy and fully enjoy the splendid image performance of HDR while maintaining your viewing comfort. The image has a faulty coloration - Go to Picture and Reset Color, and then choose YES to reset the color settings to the factory defaults. If the image is still not correct and the OSD also has faulty coloration, this means one of the three primary colors is missing in the signal input. Now check the signal cable connectors. If any pin is bent or broken off, please contact your dealer to get necessary support. The image is distorted, flashes or flickers- Read the instructions on the link \"Adjusting the Screen Resolution\" on the CD, and then select the correct resolution, refresh rate and make adjustments based on these instructions. The image is blurred- read the instructions on the link \"Adjusting the Screen Resolution \u201con the CD, and then select the correct resolution, refresh rate and make adjustments based on these instructions. If a VGA extension cable is used, remove the extension cable for the test. Is the image now in focus? If not, optimize the image by working through the instructions in the \"Adjusting the refresh rate\" section on the link \"Adjusting the Screen Resolution\". It is normal for blurring to occur due to conduction losses in extension cables. You can minimize these losses by using an extension cable with better conduction quality or with a built-in booster.",
