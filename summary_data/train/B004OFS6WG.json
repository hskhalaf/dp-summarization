      "text": "This is my second pair of AIAIAI Tracks. My previous pair lasted for nearly six years before they died. I continue to love them. I have moderate hearing loss which means I have to have the volume up loud to hear things through headphones and these cope beautifully. There is minimal sound overspill so I don't disturb my household too much. They're comfortable and lightweight so I can wear them for hours without getting sore ears. The microphone is an excellent added bonus when I'm using them with my mobile.",

Cons: The earpieces keep falling off the headband and are exceedingly difficult or impossible to reattach. They're poorly attached with tiny plastic beads. Jostling them frequently knocks them off. It's too hard to reattach them. I've given up on these and am discarding them.",

It was replaced for free under the warrenty. This part could be better designed. I now wrap that part in a thin layer of electrical tape to decrease wear and tear on the cable. I think this help, and I recommend everyone do the same. That being said, I would recommend this product to everybody.",

For the price-point, size and weight, I don't know of many other headphones that compare in range or clarity, and the retro styling is fantastic. I have read reviews saying the clips that hold the speakers to the headband eventually wear down, but I have not had to replace anything on them yet. I love these headphones and will be buying another pair of AIAIAIs when the time comes.",

I wear glasses so it puts a little extra pressure on my ears which I don't like but I know I can improve on that in time. My only gripe is when the cord is packaged, it is curled up and taped, therefore I have a straight cord that is curly like a pig tail. I'm gonna hang upside down to see if I can get that out. Other than those two slight issues, I am super happy with the sound and quality of these headphones.",

I'm not a general fan of in-ear buds, but these Sony's have a fourth size (extra small) earbud cover, which makes the fit very comfortable. Also the buds are offset to fit the ear canal more naturally. Save your money on the Aiaiais.",

I find the clips that attach the ear pieces to the headset really annoying. They detach really easily in your bag, being knocked or light pressure, and are fiddly to reattach and very easy to lose. I'm not sure it is strictly a design flaw, as it probably protects the headset attachment from breaking -- it doesn't stop it from being annoying very time you have to reattachment them as they need specific alignment and pressure.",

It's always the same issue: the cable wears with natural movements at the device connection and inevitably one speaker stops working, followed soon by the other. To my view, this is clearly a design flaw. It doesn't matter to me anymore that they're inexpensive. Also, you really need to crank the volume on public transit, then the sound bleeds moderately. There's no noise cancellation whatsoever. They get 2 stars because the design looks sweet and the sound is as advertised. I should maybe give them 3 stars but I won't because now I'm bitter.",
