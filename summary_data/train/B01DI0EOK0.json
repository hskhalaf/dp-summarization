These lights also arrived in perfect condition, with each individual bulb cushioned by bubble wrap and in its own mini box within a larger box (see photos).",

Some people seem to be quite, ahem, hard of hearing but they do buzz. We switched brands and the buzzing was instantly gone. If you can't hear or it doesn't bother you, go for it; otherwise, they are not compatible with dimmer switches. They WILL dim but for me the buzzing was intolerable, a deal breaker.",
