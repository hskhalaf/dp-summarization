I\u2019ve used it for years and nothing smells as good as this stuff... I\u2019ve ordered from this site before and things seemed ok the last time..conditioner may have been a bit off but it wasn\u2019t bad enough to where i wouldn\u2019t use it.. but this time? Oh hell no! It smells toxic! Literally! The shampoo smells close enough but the conditioner is DEFINITELY NOT THE REAL TIGI PRODUCT! The smell is way off, chemically, and it\u2019s super greasy! It\u2019s like conditioning my hair with oil! I will be seeking a refund or return! Really disappointed with this seller:(",

The overpowering chemical and perfume smells were enough to gag even someone without a sense of smell before I even opened the box by the time I opened the bottles it was making my eyes water. I definetly regret ignoring the bad reviews thankfully Amazon let me return it no issues.",

My stylist told me about Bed Head Resurrection, so I bought the set in the salon when it was on sale. It was amazing and the next time I went to have my hair cut, she said it was healthier than it had ever been. Sadly, they didn't have a sale so I looked for the product on Amazon and found it here and have been purchasing ever since. This product is the same product as in the salon, looks the same, smells the same and works great!!",

I leaned closer to the conditioner and realized that was what was causing it... smelled like actual chemicals, putting a burning sensation in my nose. Immediately, washed off and scrubbed my hands/anywhere the conditioner touched. So far hasn\u2019t caused my skin any irritation but my god, the smell was so unpleasant.

I get a lot of compliments on my hair and this product is part of why (I also use styling products). I would not recommend this shampoo and conditioner for those with thin hair, though, as it would weigh down their hair. My hair is fine and straight but I have a lot of hair and this shampoo/conditioner is the way to go.",
