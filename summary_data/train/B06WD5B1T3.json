I fully charged the fan about a week before the trip. On the 3rd day of the trip is when I first used it when we went to Universal Studios. It was definitely a lifesaver. Without it I would have been totally miserable. It has different speeds and a water option of which I didn\u2019t use. It\u2019s slightly bulky but for what it was worth to me I didn\u2019t mind.",

      "text": "This is a really great little misting fan. The quality seems excellent and the Mist that comes out is very atomized. Has multiple speeds, two different misting settings, rechargeable via USB, and the battery lasts a long long time. The only minor criticism I can think of is I wish the water reservoir held a little more. If you're using constant misting it only lasts under an hour. Oh yeah I forgot the other minor criticism is the size of the opening to refill the water. It would be nice if it were a bit larger. These are both minor annoyances and not enough to take it down in rating.",

      "text": "I didn't end up using this fan because it comes with a tiny squirt bottle you have to use to fill the water reservoir. Really? I'm supposed to carry that around as well? There is a strongly worded warning to only use the bottle because the fan is not waterproof and the reservoir is on the top above the motor so if you try to fill it from the tap...goodbye fan. Donated to charity.",
