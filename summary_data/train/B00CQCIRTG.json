      "text": "I've owned many pairs of speakers and most \"bookshelf\" speakers aren't meant to be place on bookshelves. As a general rule, most 2-way bookshelf speakers work best on 24\" stands. Stable speaker stands tend to be very expensive. I've owned very high end stands and some not-so high end stands. These stands are much closer to high end stands at not-so high end stand prices. They are very stable and look quite nice under almost any speakers. If I could buy Sound Anchor stands at this price, I would. However, given all of the options, these offer the best value that I can find.",

      "text": "Stop looking for speaker stands! This is a solid product and coming from someone who is very critical and has read reviews on basically every stand out there. I almost went with the 24\" sanus (wood) stand. I was hesitant to pull the trigger on these due to do few reviews......don't hesitate!! I have a pair of Polk Audio RTiA3 book shelf speakers sitting on them (also highly recommended). These speakers are large and these stands compliment them perfectly. I was looking for stands that would keep speakers at ear level. These stands met my needs in every way. only thing I would say is if the hole to feed the wires was on the bottomof the stand. Kudos TransDeco!!!",

I was afraid they'd slide off or that the whole stand would easily tip over or move. I'm a little conservative so I put some double sided 3M poster tape on the bottom of the speakers to secure them to the stands. The stands themselves are quite hardcore and heavy. If you really wanted to you could kick them over, but just walking around the house if someone accidentally bumps into them, they're heavy enough that they wouldn't tip over or move much. I'm very satisfied with these.",

I am happy with the purchase, and would recommend! I also purchased some .75 inch isolation pads to attach to the top plate. The one that come with the stand are quite thin and dont grip very well.",
