Be careful of youtube reviews and opinions on small flux core welders because 90% of its BS.. I watched 4-5 vids from self proclaimed professionals that said these little welders would pop the breakers in my house and silly stuff like that. Guess what? Didn\u2019t pop a single breaker. Little more practice and I might even zap together some yard-art! Lol",

A MIG welder has a gas bottle and it allows you to GAS weld. MIG stands for Metal Inert Gas. Except with this welder there is no inert gas. And it does NOT join two metals. It is a flux core solderer which attempts to \"super glue\" two metals together. No bonding is done with this welder. JUNK! DO NOT BUY!!!! Well unless gluing two metals to together is what you are attempting to do. Good Luck.",
