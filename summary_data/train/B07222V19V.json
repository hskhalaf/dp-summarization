It answers lots of questions at pottsy1907. Basically this product does everything the others claim to do but DON\u2019T! It\u2019s rapid charge. It comes with cables. It won\u2019t scratch a surface. It will charge multiple devices brilliantly. It has an ON /OFF switch, many don\u2019t have this basic want. The deviders are sturdy, solid, won\u2019t move when u pull out ur device and actually hold ur device. This is it. I would def recommend.",

      "text": "I bought this to \"bring to order to the galaxy\" of my household's ever growing collection of rechargeable electronic devices - each with its own wall wart competing for outlet space and cheap cable littering the place. This does the job and looks pretty good doing it. My only further comments on this product are that: a.) the \"kids edition\" Amazon Kindle does not fit in the provided slots (though phones, ipads and a nintendo switch lite fit no problem); b.) the provided cable set is mostly for iOS devices. If you're an Android or otherwise mini/micro USB family, you may have to buy some additional cables. Otherwise, this is a good product, and cheaper than many of the alternatives.",

I am now looking for same item in a smart device, so it doesn't waste energy, just plugged in all day, as most charging cords draw energy when plugged into wall socket, regardless if you're actually charging something. Apple/Google, and all 3rd parties, need to demand smart chargers/devices for everything, and stop wasting electricity 24/7",

      "text": "I wanted to love this product, but had troubles with it early on. The first issue was that 2 of the wires stopped charging devices. I contacted the company, and they said they would send me replacements for the two that didn\u2019t work, but the replacements never arrived. I used my own wires, and that worked for a while. Within 4 months, all of the original wires had stopped working. At 6 months, the main charging piece stopped working. It was a real disappointment from start to finish.",

Only criticism is it is a bit flimsy fitting my I Pad and the blue light is unnecessary as only one light works and has nothing to do with charging.",

They're dead. and I'm grieving and now am grieving my loss and have the 1% blues. Please learn from me. focus on your kids and spare yourself from this disappointing charger.",
