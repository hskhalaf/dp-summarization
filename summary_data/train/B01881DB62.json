The leather was folded in on itself to fit in the tiniest packaging and I was worried, but within hours molded around my dog's neck. I have a 72lb Rhodesian Ridgeback mix and I am 2 holes in from the last. I chose this for the bright but not obnoxious color on a tan background. Color stitching is imbedded and safe within the leather border. Just got it last week, do not know how it holds up to getting wet or dirty. So far I like it.",
