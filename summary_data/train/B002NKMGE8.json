In the middle of printing, the color suddenly stopped coming out at all. The cartridge was near full, and hadn't been in the printer for long. Printing things in color would cause the meters on the screen to decline, but nothing actually came out. Tried another new cartridge to make sure it wasn't something that went wrong with the cartridge, the brand new one worked the same way.",

It's a fast printer, and if you print a lot of black-only - it hard to beat on the cost of ink per page. I've been happy with the color printing, but the cost is competitive, not amazing. The quality is very good. Parts break, though, and Lexmark is speedy about sending replacement parts at no cost to the user. This happened 2ce on my 3 year old Pro905, we'll see about this new one.....",

I have not printed any pictures so far, but the resolution is clear on work pages that I have printed. I also like the two tray design, where I can potentially have legal paper in one tray, and regular size in the other. The menu on the printer seems to be very easy to follow. I will write more, when I have had it longer. Also the inexpensive ink cartridges are a plus, too. (Four black cartridges on Amazon for $28 bucks, incl. shipping!)",

Super easy to set up, works reliably, and it looks good. Best home/work printer I've had in years.",

After 1.5 hours on the phone with tech support from a foreign land, they conceded the machine was defective. The new machine did arrive promptly as promised, but none of the functions worked, it is a multi-malfunction machine. AFter another 2 hours on the phone with tech support, they promised to send another new machine. this time after waiting a week, instead of a new machine i recieved a print cartridge. i just carried the machine out to the dumpster. i will never buy another lexmark.",
