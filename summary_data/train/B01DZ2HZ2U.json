      "text": "I was really excited for this product. After using it several times, I have one major issue and one minor issue. The main issue is that it leaks ALOT of gas out of the bottom of the dispensing nozzle. You can feel it blowing the cold gas out at a very large rate. This alone makes it unusable for me, as that gas is very expensive. The only other minor issue I have is the threads where the cartridge container connects to the main body are pretty rough. It is definitely not a smooth experience, and I feel that over time, could be pretty susceptible to stripping. Based on the gas leak alone, I cannot recommend this product. Very disappointed.",

I had a small issue with mine after about 6 months and I emailed them to see if I could get a replacement part and they INSTANTLY offered a replacement dispenser free of charge.

I made up my normal cold brew, diluted to strength I like and filled canister. It tasted delicious! I found I could get more per cartridge by filling my drink cup 1/2 full, then submerge the dispensing end into the cup. This froths the coffee in the cup as well as the coffee coming out the tip. The extra escaping NO2 worked on that portion of coffee and makes it produce a lot more coffee per cannister.",
