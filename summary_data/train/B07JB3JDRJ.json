It is fun to ride but the thin small tires make it a bit unstable. The last time I charged the bike again it got 3.7 miles the only possible way to get 15.miles on a charge would be to do it at 5mph wile peddling total disappointment and i will be returning the unit...",

The handbook recommends extending full leg length from seat to pedal, which is reliable advice, but this is unattainable because the seat post is too short to permit a rise that can accommodate legs longer than 29 or 30 inches from crotch to foot sole. I'm confident that solutions to extending the seat riser can be found, and I'll be looking for them. Otherwise the bike performs as advertised, with speeds slightly in excess for 18 mph possible, and a generally good fit and finish.",
