WiFi would drop almost every 10 minutes. This went on for more than 2 months - I eventually switched to LTE only on the phone. Second, recently the WiFi range seems to be decreased - I get random drop offs on an iPad in the main bedroom, which is on the same floor and less than 50 feet away. This only started happening recently. I want to like the product, but I recommend waiting through a few more firmware updates.",

I haven't disconnected from the WiFi once with this router and it provides a strong signal throughout my entire house. It is pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for.",

The set up was a breeze as well. I did not have to call my internet provider for help. As soon as I put in all the router information required, I had everything running smoothly. Even my son mentioned that our internet connection is much smoother now and much faster!",

      "text": "Bought this unit for coverage in a 1050 SQ ft condo in a concrete mid-rise building. Placed it in the center room and have excellent coverage everywhere - no dead spots. Using with 2 laptops, a tv, and two cell phone with no speed issues at all. Setup was by far the easiest I have ever experienced. Was up and running in less than 10 minutes and most of that time was spent with my wife on negotiating passwords. Wife especially appreciates its appearance - no objections to it being out in plain view, unlike our previous multi-external attenna unit. A bit pricy, but its not like I have to buy a new router every year.",
