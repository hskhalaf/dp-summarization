It only boots GUID for Intel Mac's. So the true premise of backup/and boot up disk is unrealized. In-fact I have found that to be true now for over half of Western Digital drives. I would not recommend this drive to anyone that has both PowerPC and Intel Mac's. Not just because of the boot issue, but also the slowness of the drive.",

Had to purchase separate esata cable. Used instructions that came with it (unplug device you are hooking to and then turn on hard drive let start a little and then turn on device and let it reboot)and it worked like a charm.",
