      "text": "These are fairly good measuring cups with only a few flaws. First, the weld joints between the cup and handle seems like a likely spot for rust to start forming. The rubber grip handles fit comfortably in the hand, but if the cup is full of flour (1 cup), it's almost too much weight and the metal begins to bend slightly. The edges around the teaspoons is rough and unfinished on some of the spoons. The set is alright for the price, but I would not purchase them again.",

My only criticism is that the holes are too small for anything other than the ring that comes with the cups and spoons, It would be nice to have a larger hole so that alternate options for hanging could be utilized. I like to use a caribiner for my cups - it releases more easily - but the holes are too small. Also you cant then hang the cups separately if that;s what you want to do as standard hooks won't fit.",

Seems like a silly thing, but its nice having the entire set. Lastly, I agree with some off the other viewers, the \"rings\" that are attached to the two sets (cups and spoons) are a little tight. A slightly larger hole on each item would allow them to move a little more freely. SMALL issue. I'll either fix it, or live with it. NOT a drop dead issue. Would definitely recommend this as a stocking stuffer gift for a newlywed or a friend that bakes a lot.",

      "text": "Between my boyfriend and me, we had a sad collection of measuring cups and spoons. All were plastic, a few were missing, and many had battle wounds from garbage disposals and stove tops. So, a nice \"grown-up\" set has been in the back of my mind for a while. I knew I wanted metal, but what I like about these is the little added bonus of squishy silicone. Not only does this add a little cushion, I like that they have some color, which wasn't an attribute I was looking for originally. I've been using them long enough to be able to say they are cute, sturdy and amazing!",

The holes on the handles are very narrow slots, so they don't fit on the hooks in my kitchen. I had to jury-rig a couple zip-ties into the narrow slots so I could hang them up. Now I have to use the whole cluster whenever I'm cooking with or washing these utensils. Not very well engineered.",

Didn\u2019t even warrant me returning the item. Some reviews state that these are not sturdy enough. Well, unless you are going to use them to dig a hole in your backyard for your new swimming pool, they are really quite functional and fun to use.",
