You may also have low levels of selenium if you smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, have had weight loss surgery, or have Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. I live in The Pacific Northwest and have hypothyroidism and an autoimmune disease which low levels of selenium could contribute to. I have learned that it is important that I supplement and I think BRI has a good product at a good price.",
