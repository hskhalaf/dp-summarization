      "text": "This could not have been easier to set up and operate. It works great with Apple\u2019s HomeKit. Now I have a bedroom lamp I can turn on and off without getting out of bed but also I can automate it to come on when I arrive home or at sunset. I\u2019ll never have to walk into a dark house again. I\u2019m so excited! Update: I added a second one to the living room lamp that\u2019s always hard to reach. Adding it in was a breeze. It\u2019s set up for the same automation - turn on when I arrive home between 4 and 11 pm. I can\u2019t say enough good things about these!",

      "text": "Dream come true. My wife loves getting into a warm bed. But she needed a way to remotely turn on her electric blanket 1 hour before she got home. With a variable schedule, a simple timer would not suffice. Of course, the PureSwitch also has a simple timer to turn a light on/off the same time everyday. Now with the PureSwitch, my wife can remotely turn on her electric blanket on her way home and have a toasty warm bed waiting for her when she arrives. Happy wife, happy life!",

If I switch my iPad to the 5 GHz network, Pureswitch stops working. Overpriced and useless. UPDATE: Bought an Amazon Smart Plug which works flawlessly, integrates with Alexa, and is half the price.
