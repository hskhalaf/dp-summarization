      "text": "Excellent intro into gold nib pens as an Every Day Carry. Elegant yet not flashy with great design and mechanics.material and build holds up to everyday use and doesn't need to be babied like other expensive resin pens. The nibs are buttery smooth as most describe however the fineness is not as fine as japanese counterparts (such as the pilot/Platinum/Sailor) . I'd say the Fine writes like a japanese Med/broad, and the extra-fine like a fine/medium leaning more towards Medium. If you have tiny handwriting I would stay away as your not going to get those sharp lines.",

It took me a while to get past the price tag, but I finally rolled the dice and got it recently with no regrets whatsoever. -The writes very buttery smooth in fine, consistent lines. -The pen is lightweight, ergonomic, and well balanced in your hand. -It delivers ink onto paper at its finest. Using Noodlers Heart of darkness ink on this pen and the lamy safari, one can tell the writing from the lamy 2000 is significantly finer and darker. -I would recommend this pen to anyone truly enthusiastic about fine writing and fountain pens.",

Well, I couldn't stop missing it, so I ordered another one, this time with the storage pouch as well. This pen is amazing! It holds a large amount of ink, and writes wonderfully. Not to mention that it looks great. I use it all the time, and the pouch that came with it is very well done too. It fits the pen snugly, closes securely, and not only protects from scratches and dirt, but seems thick enough to provide pretty decent fall protection too. Its a combo made in heaven.",

They are not, however, good pocket pens. The caps have a tendency to loosen and can come away from the pen body as one is removing it from the pocket, leaving the nib exposed and getting ink everywhere. For your desk or for carry in a case, excellent. For your shirt pocket...well, wear an old shirt...",

    "description": "Size:Extra Fine (EF)| Color:2000 BlackLAMY 2000 Fountain pen with piston operated filling system for use with LAMY bottled ink T 52. It does not take ink cartridges or a converter.\n\nThe nib is a 14 karat buttery soft gold nib, platinum coated and hand polished.\n\n\u2605 IMPORTANT NOTE: The Lamy 2000 nib is less rounded at the tip than most other fountain pens. \"Scratchiness\" of the Lamy 2000 Fountain Pen is in general related to the increase of pressure some writers tend to use in an attempt to compensate for over-rotation. It is not a Quality Control issue rather a matter of finding the \"Sweet Spot\" on the angle of rotation. If you rotate it a little too much to the right the nib will skip or \"hard start\". Another very important factor is the paper that is being used when writing with a Lamy 2000 Fountain Pen. We highly recommend using only acid-free, pH-neutral paper. This will make a huge difference on the performance of your Lamy 2000 Fountain Pen. \n\nAvailable nib grades: Extra Fine (EF) / Fine (F) / Medium (M) / Broad (B). \n\nDesigned in Germany by Gerd A.
