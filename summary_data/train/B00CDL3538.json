They are perfect and they are adorable and they look so darn cute in the little hands of a little person. Also, seriously, you could freeze plain water and the kids would love them! They don't make a a lot but they are just enough. I'd definitely purchase again and probably will. Oh, and they are easy to use and they freeze fast.",

To fill up all 9 molds takes about 1 cup liquid total. We've had good luck with simple apple juice. Dimensions of the whole thing are approx 10 in x 7 in, and around 3.5-4 in high. The pops are in there securely enough that you need dexterity and some hand strength to pull them out (i.e., easy for an adult, but challenging for really small kids).",

You can't see it in the picture, but the little sticks are slightly tapered & have a notch in them to help reduce the likelihood it will slip off as it melts.
