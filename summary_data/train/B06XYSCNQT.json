      "text": "This would be great for groceries or small loads only. It does not work at all if the stairs are spaced too far apart. It is also unstable and tips easily when trying to put more than one box or item on it. It works great if you can fit items in the bag, does not work well without the bag. To use for boxes, I had to tape a platform on it so the box would not hit the wheels and stop them from turning.",

Wheels definitely on for the long term, and this bag came with nice padded carry shoulder strap, in addition to the secure to dolly strap, which was double stitched on both sides an inch from seam!",
