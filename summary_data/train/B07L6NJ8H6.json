It sits atop a supportive, yet flexible VKLN cupsole (a vulc-cupsole hybrid). More so, an EVA drop-in midsole accommodates an impact-resistant heel insert.As simple and subtle as it looks, the Protocol has some double-stitch details and micro-perforations throughout. It adds durability and breathability. Moreover, a dual-density PU RX insole cushions the feet. Underneath that is the grippy herringbone-tread outsole. This skate shoe sits at only $56.",

The soles are already coming unglued after what has been very light wear. What is especially disappointing is that I've had other Osiris shoes in the past and they have been durable and bulletproof. I'll pay extra for a good shoe, but these shoes have not lived up to my expectations. However, my return window closed just a few days ago, so I'm stuck with gluing these things back together.",

Ex the hole for the lace is poorly matched with the cloth on the back so you have to rummage a bit to get the lace through. I only wear them to walk around town in style but if i wanted these for some aggressive activity i might think twice. For $50 I hope they survive at least 6mos but they look cool enough that i took a chance and also bought a red/black pair. Wish me luck!",
