The chocolates one by one were old, had a dry and whitish film to them and they were mostly all hollow! The few that were solid which I expected all of them to be, leaked a weird oil that came through the wrappers. By the time I reached the tenth day, I couldn\u2019t bare them any longer and threw the calendar out. So I wasted money on an expense mine field full of repulsive chocolates! Sad",

It was like the 6th or something. Why not come on Christmas Eve? Strange. I'll still buy it again next year even though it's a little expensive.",
