My one hint to new purchasers is to immediately pull another 2-3 inches of the new bag after tearing off the bag you're going to use.

The bags are thinner than what the bag dispenser at our local park uses, but I've never had an issue with one tearing during use. The included dispenser is nothing fancy, but it's holding up fine, even after dropping onto the pavement a couple times.",

      "text": "I have been using pet waste bags for 13 years. These bags are the best I have ever used. My favorite part is that hole that helps to get the bag off of the roll. I run in the dark with my dog and it is super helpful that they tear away quickly and easily. I have NEVER put a hole in the bag either. I love the amount that comes in the pack. I feel like it has been forever since I last ordered. The only thing I would change is the size. They could be just a bit larger. I have a greyhound. Use your imagination :)",

We still have SO MANY left and they're fantastic. Very silky and easily tear at the seams. Also quite thick as to do the job intended.",
