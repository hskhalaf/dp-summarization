      "verdict": "Onitsuka Tiger Serrano Slip-Ons are true vintage models with just a hint of modern elements thrown in to make them more adaptable to the times. The slip-on characteristic makes the shoes easy to put on and off, yet keeps them snug and secure on the feet when they need to be, even without the use of laces.\u00a0Because the shoes are so lightweight, they can be easily packed and taken with you when you travel. And belying that thin and light frame is a supportive profile that provides great footing during hikes and walks.",
      "pros": [
        "Onitsuka Tiger Serrano Slip-Ons are super comfy and feel like socks on the feet, plenty of purchasers say",

        "According to some reviews, Onitsuka Tiger Serrano Slip-On shoes support the feet better than their thin silhouette lets on",
        "The sneakers are easy to slip on and off, a few consumers claim",
        "A handful of testers have commented that the shoes are well made and are even more so than the Mexico 66 Slip-Ons",
        "These are value-for-money shoes, a small number of individuals have reported",

I've hiked many miles in these shoes over fairly steep rocky terrain. I prefer minimal shoes like this when doing so when snakes and cactus aren't an issue as I get better footing. These are great for everyday running around, slip on/off easily.",

A bit snug due to the garter as expected with a slip on similar to a slip on sperry.

Aside from breaking in a spot or two, they look and feel great! And my favorite feature is of course...no laces!!",
