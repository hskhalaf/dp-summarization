      "text": "This is absolutely worthless. I inserted one of these at the end of a new mole tunnel after fully charging it. The next day the mole dug right around the unit and continued on as if nothing was amiss. I put all four units in a row about 20' apart in hopes of deterring the moles from any further digging in my yard. It now looks like a battlefield with mole tunnels all around the four units. This is a total waste of money and I am very disappointed in the honesty of the people that were giving this a five star rating. Makes me wonder if those ratings are all fabricated.",
