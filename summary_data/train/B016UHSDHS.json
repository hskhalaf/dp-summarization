But, at one third of the price, the Koolertron outperforms it. It has a sharper display, more features, feels solid without being heavy and is simple and convenient to use. So, no. 3 has been demoted to backup and the Koolertron is definitely my no. 1 and would have no reservations in recommending it to anyone. It is the best buy I know of.",
