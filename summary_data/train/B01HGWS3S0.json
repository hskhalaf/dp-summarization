I live on a large property, my front door is several hundred feet away from the gate and we needed something that would allow delivery drivers and guests to notify us when they're out there. I purchased this unit, because it was waterproof and didn't require a battery. It works perfectly, the signal is strong and rings twice for every push of the button. The interior receiver has several ring tones to choose from and two volume settings.",

      "text": "The idea of a waterproofed all weather button is solidified with a battery-less design. This is the best wireless doorbell I've purchased. The last two did not last but a few days before they malfunctioned. The button itself is larger than most, so plan ahead for placement. I used the back mounting bracket instead of adhesive, which works great. The receiver has three volume levels, and the highest is loud enough for us to hear upstairs. The center light on the bell does stay lit, so we plugged it in and left it in a corner, it's out of the way and stays out of sight. I would recommend this doorbell.",

      "text": "Pros: 1. Wireless. 2. Transmitter (button) requires no batteries. 3. Receiver (bell) plugs to your electric socket. 4. Twenty five different ringtones. 5. You can have up to three buttons with one bell. 6. You can adjust bell volume to low, medium or high. (high is too loud for me) Cons: 1. Sometimes you need to press button two to three times to ring the bell. 2. I have thick walls and a metal door therefore wireless range is significantly less for me (around 110 feet or approximately 35m) Final thoughts: Good quality, good price and loud. It requires no batteries so it\u2019s virtually maintenance free. Does not always ring the first time you press its button.",
