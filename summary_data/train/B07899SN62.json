The bottom of the Matt got dissolved by oil, and turned into some king of black goo. Parts of it are all over the garage floor now and look terrible. Update 10/27/19. The coating on the back of the mats has completely disintegrated, the rubber goo was all over the garage floor. I spent 10 minutes scraping it off, and then threw away both mats. Avoid at all costs. Horrible product.",
