Super easy to get in and out of the bed of my truck, which is a huge plus. Nicely built and fairly comfortable (we were out for about 3 hours). May end up buying a second one so that I can have a spare if family or friends ever want to go kayaking with me.",

So its not the same as our other kayaks but I knew that going in. Some of edges were a bit rough but I sanded those and now its fine. Considering the cost I believe i have a very good value. Is it perfect and strong as a $700 kayak? No but your not spending $700.",
