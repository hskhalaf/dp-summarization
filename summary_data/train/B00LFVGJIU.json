      "text": "This reciever is a great performer. I am using it to power JBL 400watt 4 ways. Great audio clarity and control. Tight bass and ridiculous highs. At 80% output it performs almost as well as my old Conrad Johnson set up. The video features are awesome. Switching between 4 HDMI sources is handy. The bluetooth streaming is cool. The wifi features are ok but could be better. Needs HD FM. I have not used the surround sound yet. Overall I highly recommend this reciever to anyone who desires both high end audio and video performance in one unit.",

This has happened three times to me. Other than that though, lots of cool features and works well most of the time. Hopefully a firmware update will fix this down the road.",

Everything is crisp and clear, and the dialog levels are good. I don't have to fight between listening to the movie soundtrack or trying to understand the dialog. For a 5.1 setup, I'd recommend this above all else. It is worth the premium. To boot it comes with HDMI 2.0 ports, but since I don't have any 4k content I have not tested that feature.",

For music - marantz is probably one of the very best amps you can buy for the money. The M-DAX feature for sound regeneration of lossy audio works great as well. I would definitely recommend this receiver - even though its actually quite expensive.",
