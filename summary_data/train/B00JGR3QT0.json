The unit gets used up to 10 minutes each night. This flashlight worked great for the first 6-8 months. Then, it suddenly stopped working. I sent it back to Goal Zero, and the sent me a new unit. That process took a couple of weeks. The second unit that they sent me lasted about the same about of time. For a flashlight that costs >$75, it should last much longer. Disappointing.",

I am surprised at how useful this flashlight is. Its super versatile. The shape allows you to position it a any number of ways to give you a stable light source. The 2 hooks in the back... make sit even better. Been using outside and have bumped it around and dropped it a bunch. I use the floodlight the most. So far, awesome.",
