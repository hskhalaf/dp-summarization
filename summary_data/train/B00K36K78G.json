Don't know why some say it's hard as a rock because it isn't. It's just firm and really, really comfortable.Definitely love the extra width and length as opposed to most folding beds.

No, I'm not saying cot because unless someone told you it was one they would never know the difference. It's perfect!!",

I asked my husband to fold it up and hook it at the top after our guest left and he came back and said, \"It's not going to fold. I thought you got a bed that folds so we could store it?\" He was a bit irate. I went into the guest room and folded one end up. He looked at me incredulously. When the bed is set-up you cannot see a crease. It looks like a piece of upholstered furniture. It was used for 3 months straight and still looks new.",

Very attractive as such things go, with a gray geometric print cover on mattress and bed - does not look too unsightly in the corner of the room. Highly recommend as a spare bed for guests.",

It's light enough for two people to lift and maneuver in the box, and when put together with the wheels it's a breeze for one person to move around a room. The steel frame appears much sturdier than the more commonly seen spring suspension. This is a great alternative to an air mattress. Very happy with this purchase.",

      "text": "I got this bed a while ago for any guests that we might have spend the night. It does the job, but I have an issue with MY order. My order only came with 3 wheels. This throws the bed off balance and it kind of closes when leaning on that wheel-less side. I have messaged the seller on Amazon and Zinus from their website and I haven't heard from them. Don't expect any customer service if you buy this product and if it's missing a piece, be prepared to return it as you're not going to be helped.",
