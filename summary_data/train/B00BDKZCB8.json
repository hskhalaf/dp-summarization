We were all laughing and wondering why she would randomly do that from time to time until I held it myself. This thing- must have a spell cast on it that just makes you want to swing it around. It's balanced forward, so that when you hold it, it just feels good to start chopping at stuff. Oh, it's nice. Plus the extra goodies in the handle- the flint or whatever in there sparks super bright. She'll be hacking down trees and lighting them on fire in no time!",

Axe being that thick and light simply bounces off of everything I throw it at. On the other hand this blade-body combination makes it fantastic for chopping wood by wedging itself into wood. The axe is very durable and can take a beating. It also comes with a fire starting device if you loose your lighter or just want some fireworks. Overall great product just not for throwing.",

My only minor complaint, and it isn't significant enough to duduct a star, is that the \"rubber\" or \"rubberized\" hand grip feels little different than the rest of the handle. They should have used thicker rubber or gave it some texture. Actually, I have another complaint, but this was foreseen. The case that comes with SCAXE2 seems like a piece of junk. Thankfully I read enough reviews and watched enough YouTube videos to know this before choosing to pirchase. I ordered a $10 leather case along with it. It was $10 well spent.",

The reason for four stars is that although the fire starter in the end of the handle is handy I would rather have had a good lanyard instead. I like the added safety of having the axe attached to my wrist in case it slips out of my hand. The way it is there is no place to attach a lanyard. The lanyard that is shown is attached to the fire starter rod not the axe and it is designed to slip out with a gentle pull.",

I loved the length of the ferror rod however i lost it while i had the hatchet on my belt (must of got caught on something while walking). Although there is ALOT of shock when using it but that along with the rod slipping are my only complaints!",
