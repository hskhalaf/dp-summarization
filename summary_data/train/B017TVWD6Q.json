Seriously though, the brush is super soft and has a nice, heavy handle. Razor also feels substantial and is easy to grip. The shaving soap feels and smells good as does the after-shave balm. I have very sensitive skin and so far it seems to agree with me. The one thing that I found somewhat tacky is the plastic brush stand. Would be nice if there were a stainless steel or similar stand to hold the brush and razor when not in use. All in all, it seems to be a worthy product.",

The all-natural soap smells amazing and doesn't remind you of cheap deodorant that's in those store brand shaving creams.

There was only one issue but I think they will resolve it, as they have great customer service. Will be back to purchase from them again!",

Solid construction razor with retractable blade holder... like. I liked everything about this set. Also, if you're looking to save money in the long run, nothing beats shaving with safety razors. You'll spend 10-15 bucks on about 100 blades. Having a fresh and clean blade is very nice.",
