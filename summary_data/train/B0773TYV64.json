My other pot by another manufacturer has been a pain since day one. This was easy to assemble and use. Did not have to worry about scratching teflon. Easy to clean. Nice safety features so if someone tangles in the cord it detaches. I would buy another one and probably will since fondue is a favorite in our family.",

The only con ernie is that it is nearly impossible not to accidentally scrape the ceramic bottom. Am hoping that won't create issues later with scratches and sticking. So far we are more than happy with this purchase. The recipe booklet is great too!!!",

I'm not sure why they chose to say 400 on the dial. 2) Don't use the metal fondue forks that come with the unit. They will scratch the very good non-stick surface very easily. The instruction book even says, \"Do no use metal forks\". Pay heed to their advice.",
