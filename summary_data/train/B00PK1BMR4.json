This stapler failed completely before completing one room stapling insulation. The piston began leaking and would not drive any staples even though I followed the lubrication instructions and air pressure setting completely. $38 for the staples is expensive since the tool is virtually worthless.",

The selection of staples provided assured that I had the correct type from the start (there are many types and sizes of staples to choose from, I could see that selection going wrong easily). I will be using this tool again on a household upholstery project; I was pleasantly surprised at the solid performance of this inexpensive tool.",

It was even driving 5/16 staples in the rafters with no problem. It\u2019s also very efficient and doesn\u2019t need a lot of air pressure to fire. Just a little light oil once in a while to keep things moving and you\u2019re all set. What an awesome gun for a great price!",

The air stapler has so much more power. Be sure to get the right staples (style, size) and you will be all set.

I have been using it to staple cordura fabric to a thick plastic backing using 5/16\" staples. It has plenty of power. The depth of the staple can easily be adjusted by simply turning the regulator setting on your compressor. I also like the fact that it uses a common T50 type staple which you can buy at any hardware store. I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it to others.",
