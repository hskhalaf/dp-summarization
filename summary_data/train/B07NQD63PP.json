The problem is that some of the pieces are so small that they're always getting lost and so playtime ends up in tears. Baby and pets are just too small for a four-year-old to handle. My granddaughter loves to play with them, but drops them and then we spend hours looking for them, sometimes to no avail. At the price of the kits, that's pretty disappointing. I don't recommend this for young children. Even if they weren't in scale with Polly and friends, I'd rather have larger pieces! So far we've bought three sets, but it's too expensive to replace missing pieces.",

The only thing in the design is the pieces are so very small they could simply fall out of the windows when traveling so we found a little drawstring bag to put all of the pieces into and it fits nicely inside of the house when folded up...surprised someone at the company didn't think of this. As far as value for the money, I think all of these Polly Pockets items are over priced.....but they can get it and the kids love it. My granddaughters play with it over and over again.",

My 4-year-old granddaughter absolutely loves playing with it. She likes having the container to put up the little pieces and she's kept up with everything including the miniscule dog and has played with it a lot.
