The 120hz is referring to the build in MEMC technology. It works by adding extra frames in between regular video frames for a smoother picture. Like you would get with a true 120hz TV. Sort of like the upscaleing vcr that changes regular DVD quality to BluRay quality. It works very well to give you a 120hz quality picture with just a 60hz TV. As for the sound. It works well, not super surround sound quality but it good. For the price of this 55\" TV, you can't complain.",

So I decided to purchase an inexpensive TV without the smart option because I use Apple TV anyways. This Sceptre TV fit the bill for under $400. The picture quality is great, but the sound is not good at all. Even after testing every single option, the sound did not improve. I purchased a Visio sound bar for $90 which works perfect with the TV. I can use only my Apple TV remote to control the entire setup including turning it on and off. I would definitely recommend this TV even with the bad sound.",
