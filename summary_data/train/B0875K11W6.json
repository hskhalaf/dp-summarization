The 2020 iPhone SE product red is fantastic, especially for people with small hands! It\u2019s a similar width to the iPhone 5 but slightly longer and much slimmer. Easy to use and much less bulky than the iPhone XR (work phone). Love the fact that it was easy to transfer data from iPhone 5 and set up. Am also going to use apple pay as can then leave my purse at home! Colour is a nice bright red and I bought it together with an easy fit glass screen and transparent case. All in all excellent value for money and highly recommended.",
