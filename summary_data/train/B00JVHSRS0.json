Amazon employees passed the ticket around about 10 times and all refused to refund even the original item, not to mention the other items this cross contaminated. The worms OBVIOUSLY came from the dog food, pictures attached.",

I thought they just weren\u2019t hungry. I gave them the sample you sent me and wow they devoted it. I ordered a bag and low and behold first thing in the morning as soon as their bowls were on the floor the food was gone!!! They love it and we are so happy we have a healthy food for them our babies. I\u2019m so glad we received a sample.",
