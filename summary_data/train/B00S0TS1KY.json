To refill the machine, you have to loosen the screw on top to remove the hat. After refilling the globe and replacing the hat, you have tighten the screw....DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN! Or you will put too much pressure on glass causing it to break. I can almost guarantee this is what happened to the other unfortunate folks out there. Just snug the screw down and it should last for years to come....",

The tray the goodies lands in is adjustable such that it can handle larger balls, like the .80\" balls we use, but to accommodate this I had to do some adjustments most people can't do as well, such as filing the interior and trimming springs, so I recommend you use their 5/8\" ball size as a maximum. I also removed the interior spring that required a coin to turn the crank...easy for me, but perhaps not for everyone. It's possible that they may be willing to do this, but I don't know.",

We've had another one before this and the glass shattered within days, so definitely get this one if little ones will be using it!",

I don't understand these reviews claiming that the glass globe is so fragile. It is a good medium thick glass. I accidentally knocked the globe against a wooden table and it didn't break. I knocked it pretty hard, too. So I wouldn't be concerned about the glass being too fragile unless you or your kids plan on drop kicking it just for fun. Overall I would say it is worth the price.",

Unfortunately the coin mechanism jambs regularly. More serious is the thin glass. The writing was on the wall when neighborhood children grab at the machine. The first tip on the counter and the glass broke leaving one cut finger and a crying child. If the style remained the same, the base remained the same, the mechanism get tweaked and the globe be made of a strong plastic or better glass, this would be a so nice. Unfortunately I can not even find the manufacturer to help get this fixed",

My only observation which I will point out is that it doesn't take dimes, so when your little one tries to twist a dime, the machine will spit it out where it spits out the gumballs. My problem with that is that the money is not clean and then your little one eats a gumball from that but it's not a horrible thing because it's easily preventable.",
