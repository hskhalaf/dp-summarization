AND I wanted to be able to move it around easily (meaning it had to have wheels). This served all of my needs.",

Drawbacks would be weight and width (with tires on) As far as power output, under a heavy load, it will lug down briefly but pick right back up. Also should be noted that at 7K in elevation where I hunt, it had zero issues running.",

It is easy to start: has electric starter plus a start/stop remote. Don't have to go out in the cold to control it. Minimal assembly required. First one arrived with broken plastic air filter cover. Called their customer service and they shipped me a new one immediately! Highly recommend it .",

      "text": "Currently using this model generator to power 2 1500w space heaters, house lamp, and charging cell phones during blizzard Jonas. Made this purchase after Sandy when we lost power for a day and a half and were stranded. Wife thought I was crazy. Now she's thanking me for my preparedness. Runs well in 17 degree weather! Contemplating buying a second to run a few more space heaters and/or appliances depending on time of year.",

It runs my little travel trailer and some tools at the same time, good enough for me.",

Champion tech support sent us a replacement switch and control box, which failed to fix the problem. We were told by Champion at that point to take it to Camping World for repairs. Our local Camping World does not have a technician that can work on these things. Now the generator is leaking oil into the air intake, fouling the filter whenever it is used. It will not even pull-start now. Champion is no longer responding to our emails and requests for support. We will begin investigating Small Claims Court next. Short version: Champion sold us a bad product and refuses to correct it.",

Found the best price here on Amazon which included free shipping to my home. The package arrived undamaged. Required a little amount of work to put the wheels on, pull handle, adding the oil the came with the gen and finally hooking up the battery cables. So after filling the gas take the generator started right up. Both the wireless and side mounted start button worked good. The pull handle is mounted to close to the muffler though. Overall it was a good buy.",
