      "text": "I LOVE these bottles. I've tried every other brand out there. I mean that very literally. If your bottle leaks or nipple collapses it's super easy to fix. Because of the way these bottles are made you have to check the vent at the bottom of the insert peice. Pinch it to make sure it's not stuck together . This will keep the nipple from collapsing. Dishwashers especially cause the vent to stick together and not let air out. If your bottle is leaking. You CAN NOT heat up your bottle with the cap over the nipple. Just keep the cap off and all leaking should be cured :) good luck!",

I supplement so I bottle feed several times a day and everytime I use one of these bottles my baby ends up choking on the formula and it spills out everywhere. I am using the correct stage 1 nipples as well. I have tried the Phillips brand and Dr. Brown brand and my baby does not have any trouble with these bottles, no choking and no spillage with these two. My suggestion is to buy single bottles from a couple different brands to see what works best for your baby.",

So when our lactation specialist told my wife that she needed to take a two-week breastfeeding break to let her nipples heal, we went to bottle feeding. We heard horror stories of babies developing \u201cbottle preferences\u201d so we originally went with the Dr. B\u2019s bottles. But we soon discovered that if our little man has a latch problem, a non breast shape nipple aggravates the problem which causes 45 minute AM feeding sessions. Let\u2019s just say that I ordered these bottles at 2AM with a crying baby in my arms and it was the best desision I\u2019ve made :)",

Yes it was collapsing a lot in the beginning but first u just pull it out before it collapses so u do it four to five times during feeding and later i think when baby gets stronger it is not collapsing at all. Anyway it worked for us!",

It takes so long to turn blue (safe for feeding) that if solely relied upon, your milk becomes cold. It's good for letting you know if it's too hot and that's it. Not worth it ! Try Phillips Avent anti-colic bottles with the natural nipple.",
