I've owned 6 FujiFilm digital cameras over many years. I get used to one and the new camera throws me. Some of the features of past Fuji cameras that this one lacks are auto-bracketing and fast multi-image shooting. Still... great images for my dolla... now if I could just connect the wrist strap to either side of the body I'd be very content with my purchase.",

What I like most about this camera is the fact that the lens never extends past the cover, so it can be opened and closed quickly and easily. And it's so fast! Great for people who love taking snapshots on the fly. I will say that I got my finger in the frame a few times at first. You just have to learn how to hold it. Overall, this is a great compact camera. The look, the size, the speed, the features, and the picture quality make this one cool little camera.",

It doesn't take quality pictures at night if your a certain distance away and sometimes it takes blurry pictures in darker places as well. The sound doesn't work on my camera but its probably becuase I have dropped it a couple times and thats never good for any camera. The battery life is okay but my friends have other cameras and their batteries usually last twice as long as mine does. I recommend getting a back up.",

It is not overpriced and the quality is not the best but I'd say very good. It does not come with a leather case because you don't need one. The lcd display has a thick protective glass like a scratchproof material (just don't drop it for a test or something). It is so small that's why it's called portable. If you have big hands naturally this is not for you. All digital cameras have different features of their own, you just have to read the manual to be able to appreciate fully what you got.",

I downloaded them to my PC (which was very easy) and the pictures were grainy and many were out of focus. The picture quality was worse than most compressed .jpg's that receive via email. I have an older Olympus C-3000 which takes terrific pictures (indoors, night time, etc.). I am used to much higher quality shots. The Olympus has a much larger lens, which I think has something to do with it. I took the Fujifilm back and am sticking with my older Olympus for now. I am extremely disappointed, especially since Best Buy charged me a 15% restocking fee ($60)!",

    "title": "Fujifilm Finepix Z1 5.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nAn exquisite product design to excite your sense of aesthetics. From this concept is born the elegantly simple and slim form of the FinePix Z1. Every aspect from the lens to each screw has been specially developed to enhance the beauty of the Z1.\n\n \n\nThe FinePix Z1 is a sleek .7 inches thick--\njust one aspect of its elegant design. From the front, side, bottom, or any angle, the appearance is not only stunning, but also hints at the incredible power sheathed within its clean geometry. The distinctive U-shaped rear cover wraps around the body with organic symmetry that seems to mold to the curve of your palm. Meet \"Z\"--the symbol for innovation in digital camera design and performance. 5.1 Megapixels + ISO 800\nExploiting the high sensitivity of the new RP Processor's powerful noise reduction and the fifth-generation Super CCD HR, FinePix Z1 delivers the maximum 5.0 million recorded pixels image even at the maximum ISO 800 setting. Even photos at twilight and under other low-light conditions retain the subtle tones that you see when you press the shutter. Also with the newly added Natural Light mode, you can capture every nuance of the scene naturally and without flash even in dim light.\n\n Fast Start-up\nFinePix Z1 is ready when you are. Just slide open the protective front panel, and in approx. 0.6 seconds, it is waiting for you to press the shutter. In addition, Z1 has a shortened shooting interval of 1.1 seconds and fast shutter release with a time lag of minimum 0.01 seconds.\n\n \n\nThe Fujifilm FinePix Z1's large 2.5-inch display is larger than the display on most cameras in its class. 2.5-Inch LCD Monitor\nSpecial reinforced glass used for the extra-large 2.5-inch LCD enhances shock resistance, allowing you to take the Z1 everywhere with confidence. The LCD's Auto Gain function automatically adjusts brightness for optimum viewing anytime, whether inside or outdoors. Plus a host of new shooting functions including the Post Shot Assist Window that lets you take the next photo while seeing the playback of previous shots, are supported by a totally new Shooting/Playback interface for more intuitive operation. \n\nThe FinePix Z1 has an innovative refractive 3x optical lens uses a prism to admit light and bend it 90 degrees. 3x Optical Zoom\nSpecially designed to preserve the flat body concept, the innovative refractive 3x optical lens uses a prism to admit light and bend it 90 degrees into an internal configuration of 10 lens elements in 8 groups. Unlike a conventional zoom lens which extends from the body, all zoom element movement occurs internally. FinePix Real Photo Technology\nReal Photo Technology is the synergy of three key devices: the Fujinon lens, the fifth-generation Super CCD HR, and the newly developed RP (Real Photo) Processor. Playing a major role in realizing the Z1's huge leap in quality and performance, the RP Processor performs double noise-reduction processing to achieve high sensitivity with minimized noise. In addition, a new built-in Anti-blur program takes advantage of high sensitivity and faster shutter speed to automatically suppress blurring from camera shake or movement by the subject under dim light conditions.\n\n Shooting Modes for Creative Control\n\n\n * High Speed Shooting mode assisted by accelerated Auto Focus in approximately half the time of normal AF mode. \n * Macro mode for photos as close as approximately 8 centimeters \n * Red-Eye Reduction + Slow Synchro mode \n * Scene Position (Portrait, Landscape, Sports, Night Scene, plus the new Natural Light mode)\n\n Other features:\n\n\n * Z1 PictureCradle included \n * DPOF (Digital Print Order Format) compatibility for instant ordering of prints \n * PictBridge compatible",
