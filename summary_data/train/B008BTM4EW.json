They took him out to the skating rink and he absolutely loved it. Bauer has the best beginner skates for children. I'm an old time skater and know my skates. If you buy these for your children make sure you have them walk around the house with them. This will help them get used to the weight, help them with their balance and this will also strengthen their legs for when they do get on the ice.",
