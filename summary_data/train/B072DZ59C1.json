I'm normally a size 9.5 but got a 9 and they fit perfectly. Also because of the thick strap, these shoes are super comfortable; not to mention very classy & chic.",

Which is perfectly fine. Needless to say, they are adorable. They look just like the pic (lavender). They were comfortable, sexy and stylish. They match perfectly with my ensemble. I have a wide foot (medium width), so I was concerned about the band, but the fit was PERFECTO! I recommend this shoe!",
