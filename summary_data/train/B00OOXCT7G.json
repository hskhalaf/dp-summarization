      "title": "Amazing sound, but needs 2017 update",
      "text": "I was blown away by the sound the W Studio put out but ended up getting rid of it because of its lack of hdmi arc and 4K pass through. Dialogue is ultra clear and adjustable, and the bass is unreal. I don't think I'll ever be able to own a system with a tiny sub again. If you're okay with using two remotes and aren't concerned with 4K, I'd highly recommend this. But if you're like me, let me know if you find something that has those things and matches this sound quality! One final note: this soundbar is gorgeous, and looks great in a living room.",

I had an issue with my main bar after a couple weeks, and they sent me a replacement after they couldn't solve the issue over the phone. My dog ate my remote last week, I called them and they are in the process of sending me a replacement- NO CHARGE... not even Dish or anyone else does that!!!

Great for music (ADHD by Kendrick Lamarr played on this system will change your life) as well as movies. Surround effect is just OK but not a deal breaker by any means. Two main problems with the system is lack of 4K pass through, and no bluetooth. Otherwise I'd give it a perfect score. Set up while far from being rocket science, is a bit tricky.; Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase.",

It's pricey... and probably too pricey for what it is... but if you can get a refurbished model or a good sale, I would more than recommend it. If you don't care about money, it's probably the nicest sounding sound bar I've ever owned. I was also surprised by how good the subwoofer sounds, given that it is wireless.",

I called the manufacturer and was informed the warranty was good only for 1 year on this product. Their stated 5 year warranty only covers their tower speakers. Since I'll be replacing this product, I'll upgrade to latest technology with better warranty coverage. I was always pleased with the sound quality, and it sounds awesome for a bar/sub combo.
