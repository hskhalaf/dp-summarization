Well made. Highly recommend if you need a dish drainer that's actually going to handle more than a glass or two at a time. Buy this one.",

If you have bigger items to dry, the space that isn't the shelf is too small... Also the knife holder is inconvenient, and the sides holders for cups or something... Isn't ideal to hold much...",

It holds the dishes securely in place and it holds a ton of assorted dinner ware and cooking utensils. It was a snap to assemble. The he only tiny, insignificant problem that I have encountered is that the microfiber mat is not wide enough to catch the drips from the glasses if you use the handy glass holder add-ones. I just put a small tea towel down. Kudos to the manufacturers of this dandy dish drying rack!",
