Overload protection feature works well. Dislikes: -There is a burnt plastic odor that come from the motor no matter if it's loaded down or not. It may decay over time. -The way the pitcher is molded it has indentions that look like diffusers or something on all four corners. Because of this, at times solids will get trapped on the sides and you have to shut it down and scrape them off. Over all I would buy it again.",

It's a frequent stop and chunk effort. If you're trying to make an on-the-run smoothie, forget about it. The suction feet makes it difficult to slide in and out from underneath the cabinet.",

The pour spout is very wide for reasons I can't figure out and every time I pour something from the blender to different container, some of the liquified content drips onto the counter. Every time!
