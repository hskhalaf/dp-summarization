After THREE replacements I can now say with absolute certainty that this product has serious and profound manufacturing defects which are not avoidable. These issues result in frozen connections to peripherals, brutal system crashes resulting in lost data, and random disconnects of external storage. Avoid this product.",

I'd not recommend this unit to anyone. ORIGINAL (4 stars, one month after purchase): My only complaint is that cables coming out the rear make it tip backwards if unsupported. This is simply because it's lightweight and can't hold itself firm on the desk with heavy cables in the back. This is quickly remedied with some cable ties. Very clean look, and works perfect.",
