Units like this one support industry standards, so there aren't special drivers, utilities, and the like require to see and use them. It's simply a plug it in, turn it on and get connected affair. Be careful of others that require special software, drivers, and configuration. They are nothing but trouble, likely lack support for anything but Windows and will wind up not being used. It's an industry standard supporting NAS, it works, it's 1TB, what else can you expect it to do?",

Pros: -Super easy setup (Plug in and it is discoverable on all computers on network). -Reasonably priced for 1GB storage. -You can add a USB External Hard Drive for additional storage directly into the unit. -Backup software runs in the background and does its job well. Cons: -The transfer speed is not great, but certainly adequate. Recommendation: -I would recommend this solution for those who are looking for an inexpensive way to backup data on a small network.",

Setting up was easy even on linux for which you don't get instructions (you basically just access it as a samba share). One drawback is the remote access on linux through the internet: The client that installs on your computer doesn't support linux, which is weird because it's a java app so it should be platform independent. The download/upload speed depends on your connection, if you need to copy GigaBytes of data than you better connect through an ethernet port not the wireless. Overall it's a great home storage device for reasonable price.",

After installing this update the product works well, but I am giving it 1-star because out of the box it works terrible. The software that comes with the product is glitchy, error prone and highly unreliable. If you are inclined to purchase, figure in an extra $29.95 in the cost -- You will NEED to purchase this to make it work well. Western Digital should provide FREE software updates when they are critical to hardware functionality.",
