We have a small apartment in the City and two of these fit perfect in front of our sleeper sofa. They aren't to heavy to move and tuck away when we need to pull out the sleeper sofa. Nice contemporary clean look. The finishes look and feel good. My husband had no problem putting them together. They were not damaged and they don't wobble. So happy with them!",
