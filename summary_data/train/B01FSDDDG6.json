Unfortunately, the strap over the forefoot ruined the shoe for me so I sent them back without ever running in them. I could feel it rubbing on the outside of my little toes, and also slightly on the top of my foot. I'll stick with my Trail Gloves, which are my favorite shoes for running. I had bought these because of the 4mm drop to give my achilles a break once in a while, but the strap is a deal breaker for me. Good lucking shoes, and seemed well-made.",

Then the back of the left shoe rubbed my Achilles area so badly the bled. Needless to say, I sent them back as defective. Being a Prime Member, that part at least went smooth.",
