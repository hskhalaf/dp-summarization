Whereas the 4050 is beautiful and apparently well-made, the 4052 floor lamp is a piece of junk. For whatever reason the Amazon system will not allow me to review the 4052 individually but lumps it in with reviews on the 4050, possibly to skew the negative comments on the more expensive 4052. The lamp arrived with both switches broken and the gooseneck rusted. What I received was obviously someone else\u2019s return because the interior packaging was broken into pieces.",

(And don't blame 'Made in China'--we went to Home Depot, bought a near identical lamp for $40, also Made in China, and are happy with it.)",

I couldn't send it back because the packing was all over my floor. I wanted matching lamps on either side of my bed. Seriously rethinking buying another one.",

    "title": "Adesso 4052-15 Lexington 71\" Combo 2-Light Floor Lamp, Walnut, Smart Outlet Compatible",
    "description": "Size:FloorA traditional silhouette meets modern design in the Lexington Combo floor lamp. The dark walnut rubber wood body holds an alabaster frosted glass dome shade for up lighting as well as a metal-domed adjustable reading light. An Adesso patented 300 Watt Double Socket construction on the uplight allows for two criss-crossed sockets, each holding on/off 150 Watt incandescent bulbs or equivalent CFL's, which provides approximately 3 times more light than a typical torchiere using a 150 Watt 3-way bulb and illuminates an entire room.Two brushed steel rotary switches are located on the pole, one controlling the uplight, the other controlling the reading light. The lamp is accented with a brushed steel base and neck as well. This lamp has a black cord and is smart outlet compatible. Bulbs are not included. All Adesso lighting products are either UL listed or ETL listed, meaning it has been tested and approved to meet the government-regulated safety standards for the USA. When shopping for lighting products, we recommend to always look for the UL or ETL marks to ensure you are purchasing lighting that has been tested for safety standards by a 3rd party testing lab. Unfortunately, not all lighting products in the marketplace have been through 3rd party safety testing.",
