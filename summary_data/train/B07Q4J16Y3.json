The instructions are easy to read and not confusing like most products out of Asia. The only thing I dislike about these that caused me to drop a star is the glasses stick out too far on the left and right eye creating a gap for light to creep in and it stands out for others to check you out, who then notice the sunglasses aren't normal. I got them for hiking in Germany and for what I wanted them for, they work great! Highly recommend.",

Certainly easy enough to use, just push the button on the frame to start recording, push again to stop. Can either remove the SD card and plug it into an adaptor, or plug the glasses directly into the computer to transfer the video recordings. Frames are a bit thick but they're cramming a lot of electronics into a very small place. A good alternative to strapping one of those ridiculous 'go-pro' style cameras to your head.",

Nice Product! I hope they last. Update: still work fine after a month or so. If you want to use on your motorcycle or with anything that requires a helmet, be aware they will not fit where they rest on your ears. Just too wide. But still a fine product that I would recommend.",

They are too straight rather than form fitting to my face. It needs more curve to it. I prefer the shape and fit of these glasses  but the video recording quality from the linked glasses is a joke. Overall, these are pretty good video recording glasses.",

I tinkered around but the problem persisted. it seems it was a faulty battery?!?!?! This was very disappointing. it was a great experiment and I will definitely film again, but not using this product. I should have went all out and purchased a high end pair...but at least....I know for next time",

But that is also a positive. For filming short segments when you are moving a lot, they really stay in place because they are so tight. For the price, I would recommend these, especially for females or anyone with a smaller head. Maybe my bean is just a little too wide.",

There is no notification when the battery discharges completely, so you will unknowingly lose any further recording.",

It would be better if you could see if they were recording by looking at a light closer to the eyes instead of having to remove the glasses and look to see if they are on or off. Very annoying and makes it hard to know if you are still recording. I consider this a major design flaw that should be easy to fix.",
