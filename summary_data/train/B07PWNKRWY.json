These shoes have mostly gray soles which will disguise most of the grime from use, but there is a portion that is left as white. If the gray were darker or black and covered the entire sole, I'd give these a 5 star rating.",

These shoes have a nice modern look, with the classic white-sole aesthetic (but smartly with a black bottom, so they don't immediately look filthy). Only time will tell how well they hold up and how soon before the white parts are discolored. But for now, I'm very pleased. Recommended.",

This shoe fit my foot so well (I purchased during Black Friday) that I honestly bought another pair on Cyber Monday! They feel great!! I workout in these nearly everyday. These make for a good cross-trainer or even light to moderate running shoe. Again, if you have wid-feet, not to mention need arch support, buy these shoes dude!!!",

The stitching came undone. I gorilla glued it back together and so far so good. The soles are very springy and they have good support. I'm not using them for the gym or any strenous activity, just standing,walking and some stair climbing. They do fit as expected, I have 2 other pair of Under Armour shoes, all the same size. I recommend these but do watch the stitching on the eyelets.",

I DO NOT recommend these if you intend to use them regularly and when working out as they will not hold up and you will have to order a new pair.",

However, I needed a new pair of running shoes and the reviews said these were great. I agree. These are very confortable, they fit as expected and they are worlds above the Nikes I was using to run. I recommend as a inexpensive replacement to your current shoe.",

Too bad, I don't think I can return them since I already ran outside with them. NOT FOR RUNNING!",

After 3 miles, you can feel the shock really well, which isn't a good situation to be in, and you might want to spend a lil more money on a real running shoe with somewhat more cushioning.",
