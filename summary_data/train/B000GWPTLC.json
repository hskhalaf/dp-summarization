This was actually confirmed: Confirmed by a HP Representative, the HP 6180 Uses Yellow Ink to Print in \"Black Only\", regardless how you set up you printer. This means that even if you print in gray scale, it still uses all the colors to \"enhance\" the black.",

      "text": "Bought this printer to replace an older HP all in one that I was also very happy with. This one is really great. The two trays handle both regular paper and 4X6 photo paper. The speed and quality of printing are terrific. The document feeder for copying faxing or scanning is a great bonus. Six ink cartriges give top photo prints, plus savings by replacing individual ink colors. I've learned the hard way that using HP papers and inks give you the maximum quality of printing, and are the way to go. Setup went very smoothly. I am very happy with this purchase, and would recommend it.",

Possibly the software driver slows down my PC like many say, but I can;t be sure its not other reasons (need to format drive and start a fresh). Scans are good too. Seems more reliable than my HP laserjet that I have hooked up to a Hawking print server. I recommend this product.",

We were used to our old HP All-in-one which gave us almost unlimited enlarging and shrinking capabilities. The cartridges are overwhelming, but we've adapted to that. The worst part is the paper tray. It is unbelievably small, holds very few sheets of paper, is difficult to access, and difficult to load.",

Does not print as fast as advertised & makes alot of weird noises. Overall, it does the job I need it to do very well; and I like the HP programs that let one use scan & other functions very well. I am happy with my purchase. I haven't tried the photo function yet. Hope this helps:)",
