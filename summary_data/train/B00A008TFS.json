She is highly treat motivated so when that was not apart of the equation you could forget her doing anything. She also pulled very hard on walks. I bought this shocker and use it only when she is ignoring a command. She is smart in that her attitude changes to more submissive when the shocker is on. Definitely recommend for the more stubborn breads.",

      "text": "This review is long over due. I'm very disappointed in this product. I ordered this brand due to its reputation and the fact I could add a total of 3 dollars to the one remote. Within a week one of the buttons on the remote stopped working and one of the chargers wont charge the device. This is frustrating because these arnt cheap and I work on a ranch so I need them to assist in controlling the dogs while herding animals. Otherwise when it works it works well just not very well made",
