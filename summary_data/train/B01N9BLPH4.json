I didn't want one mounted about the stove because that reminds me of an apartment. Make sure you mount it correctly and just under the ledge of the counter top. It's very convenient to put stuff down into it rather than pull things out of the microwave especially with liquids.",

My sisters kids absolutely love it though because its at a height they can operate the controls to make corndogs. If it were easier to clean I would give it 10/10 but because of the difficulty I\u2019ve had cleaning it I\u2019m gonna give it a 7.",

The company should offer some videos that should usage of the control panel. The control panel is impossible to read even with an overhead light turned on. The options should be light enough to find them without searching for a flash light. I would not recommend this product for anyone just wanting something that functions for simply kitchen usages.",
