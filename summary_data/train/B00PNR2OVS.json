Also, as a huge plus for me this has some brownish undertones to it. I bought a couch from Kasala which although deemed \"gray\" has some very distinct brown undertones. Gray tends to either go a little towards blue or a little towards brown. If you need something that definitely looks gray, but won't clash with browns, this is it.",

Much thinker and more luxurious than the other one. The color is also perfect. The \"grey\" isn't a solid color, so it blends in well with different shades.",

I was hesitant at first to make such a big purchase without seeing it in person or feeling it, but I don\u2019t regret this purchase one bit! It is so soft and matches our decor perfectly. I know some people complained about there being an odor when they first opened it, but it\u2019s not bad or overpowering. It just has that new smell. We\u2019ve had it for a couple of weeks and the smell is practically gone without having sprayed anything. I\u2019m sure if we sprayed something like Febreze it would have gone away sooner. Would purchase again!",

Another thing - my dog Snickers loves rolling around on it since it is a very soft almost shag-like rug (BTW it feels amazing on your feet too). Shipping said two weeks and it was on my door step in about 3 days - excellent.",

The colors are subtle and dont look cheap as some of the other rugs I've purchased on here. If there was one complaint, it would be that the underside is cheap material in that it doesn't want to stay set. The rug slides around more so than your average rug of this thickness. Not a new phenomenon but just a FYI - you will need a mattress pad or tape underneath to keep this in place.",
