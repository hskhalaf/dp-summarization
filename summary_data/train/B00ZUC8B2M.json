The whole thing doesn't weigh enough to stay in place when my cat (a small cat) is playing. More importantly, it has VERY poor quality and construction. The fabric pieces are stapled in place, and not well. As soon as I opened the package, many of the staples were already falling off, causing the fabric pieces to come unattached. (See pictures)",

We put it right next to the desk so that the big guy has somewhere to lay that is not on or right in front of the keyboard. The top hammock is right on desk level so he seems to be ok with the change. He also loves the balls hanging from the side. neither of the cats usually go for the little toys hanging but he is in love with this tree. I will say that one of the balls fell off on the first day, but that hasn't stopped the cats from playing with it. It fits our style",

Obviously not a structural issue but there\u2019s a cheap plastic ball hanging from the tower. Now as of February 19, that ball and string has been completely ripped off the tower. You\u2019d think a company making something for a cat to play with would ensure that it wasn\u2019t easily destroyed by a cat. We only have one cat and she\u2019s only 3 months so technically still a kitten. Not impressed. The tower is sturdy, and my cat obviously likes it, but could be much better built.",

They LOVE this what we call their \"sling chair\" they like to lounge in the sling chair part and watch tv. And they USE the cat scratching part which saves our sofas in the living room! The only thing is that the balls come off a lot so we keep tying them back on. Gotta figure out a knot that really works. LOL",

They play and climb all over it, sleep in the hammock on top, and snuggle in the little cubby on the bottom. It can also be folded up and put away when I don't have any baby cats. It's mostly survived, having two litters (7 babies total) so far. The front did get a little tore up, but really, 7 wild kittens might be above \"normal\" use. I actually ended up just cutting off the part that became frayed and it's fine. I would definitely purchase again, and I definitely wouldn't want to be without it.",
