I wasn't sure the magnets would really hold tight while we opened our beer, but this ABSOLUTELY holds to our refrigerator AND the hidden magnet at the bottom of the wood has no problem at all grabbing the caps before they fall on the ground. So, now we always have a handy bottle opener, were not on our hands and knees looking for lost caps, AND the wood is really nice looking and slim, so it's not some big gaudy looking block stuck to your fridge. This is TOTALLY worth the money!",

It took a while to get it to stay solidly in place because the opener and the hole are roughly the same size but after adding some Gorilla Glue it has remained in place for almost a year. We also tried using the included magnets to stick it to the side of our refrigerator and it worked great there too, although it did move around just a bit. Highly recommended.",
