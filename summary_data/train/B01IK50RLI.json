The instructions for install leave A LOT to be desired. We installed, and used sturdier screws as my carpal-tunnel riddled hands were definitely able to bend the supplied screws. It is unfortunate because the space-friendly pet furniture department is sorely lacking in supply and variety. I was excited, and I am tremendously underwhelmed.",

What's more, you should definitely replace the provided screws with sturdier ones, as I also had some break in the wall studs. Some complained about the sturdiness of the hammock, so I opted to mount a perch leg almost at the same level as the hammock, so my cat wouldn't over-leverage one side of the hammock over the other. Basically, he can walk onto the hammock arms, rather than jump onto it. No issues so far with my ~9lb cat, and he still uses it every day! Love the design as well.",

Since my home was built before code the studs were not 16\" spaced like the pre-drilled holes in the large \"dome\" piece so I drilled some of my own holes to run vertically instead of horizontally. It works just the same. The kitties love both the soft and \"rough\" carpet areas of the cat unit. Highly recommend for someone wanting to add new and exciting heights to their cat's play area. I have found that she has become a bit more relaxed and loves more often now, but maybe that's the catnip.",
