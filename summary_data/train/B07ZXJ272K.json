The spikes do a great job of digging in, especially going up and down hills. Great for late winter when everything is melting and refreezing.",

It also made the rest of my ridge hike considerably more dangerous. To add to my dissatisfaction, the zipper on the little case broke off as well. This is not the kind of equipment you want to have failing on you as it could literally end up being the difference between life and death depending on where you are.",

We were able to do a difficult hike that others without micro-spikes were sliding down and having to turn back on. They were easy to put on and figure out, and held up well during a hike that had some rocks etc. Highly recommend these!",

They aren\u2019t very comfortable unless you are on a surface that they can sink into; otherwise you end up sort of hobbling and clanking down the road.",
