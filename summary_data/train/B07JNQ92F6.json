      "text": "The monitor feels high quality, the colour reproduction is excellent. The FreeSync option works great with nVidia GSync compatibility settings, gaming is smooth at 144Hz. HDR is great, be aware it auto enables extra sharpness which I'd turn off.. but HDR needs to be disabled anyway if you want to enable FreeSync so I only switch it on as needed, then go back to FreeSync when gaming. The 'bleed' another reviewer seems to talk about is merely IPS glow, which is expected with an IPS panel. It's not as bad as they show in the picture, in fact I don't notice it at as I play games.",

Thanks to the Gsync-compatible Freesync there's no tearing or anything, and thanks to my fibre-optic video cable ( I can run it at a distance from my PC. There is some backlight bleed, but that on mine is nowhere near as bad as the other reviewer has experienced. I did turn the brightness right down - at 50% it was very glaring. Recommended.",

Amazon sorted this out no problem \ud83d\udc4d It does rotate (see pic), swivel, tilt and height adjust. Bit of tweaking setting the screen, but looks really rather good. Tried to uploaded a video of it playing a YouTube hdr video, error processing. So on YouTube if you search for XV272UP playing HDR Channel Dubai video you should see what it looks like. It was a present so can't comment gaming wise, but gets a thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d in that department from the user.",
