The zipper on the small front compartment was opened in the middle, I was able to rethread it, but wonder if it will hold. My mistake not to examine the bag until I was ready to leave for my trip.

When I first pulled it out of the pouch, it looked quite small. After putting in 6 tops (including a fleece one) there was still a lot of room yet to fill up without it looking huge and bulky (and possibly not being accepted as a \"personal item\" comparable to a purse or laptop bag on airlines).

For an up-coming adventure I have now bought a larger green one for myself. These packs feel and carry like a full-structured day pack, but there is no bulk at all. We don't fold ours, but just pack it flat in our suitcases and it takes up no space. We always take them when we travel as well as use them for short adventures around home. Great size, great colors, no bulk.",

Can\u2019t say enough about how much use we\u2019ve gotten out of this pack and it doesn\u2019t show a stitch of wear. Will actually be purchasing one more this week so that we all have a pack.

It also doesn't take up much space since it folds up into a small pack. One minor issue is that one of the mesh compartments for holding bottles tore a little and will need to be sewn up, so the construction isn't the best there.",

      "text": "Very light weight and compact for traveling. Was excited to use while day traveling around the streets of Paris but ended up having to carry the bag. Everytime I put over my shoulders the bag would slip off after walking for awhile. Very frustrating. If I cinched the shoulder strap very tight (uncomfortable) they wouldn't fall off. However, this made it very cumbersome to remove quickly for jumping on and off the metro. Some type of connector across the chest would be great for me. Otherwise a good backpack. Maybe I just don't know how to adjust straps properly ????",

Nice size, packs reasonably small, has a surprising number of handy pockets. Straps are quite comfortable under a fairly light load (haven't tried it schlepping heavy stuff).",
