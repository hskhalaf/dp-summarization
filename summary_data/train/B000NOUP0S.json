And that's only the beginning of how great this camera has held up. For its age, this Fuji S700 takes phenomenal photos. Although it is only 7.1 megapixels, the image quality that this camera produces is better than that of any cheap 16 megapixel camera. 10 times optical zoom still comes in handy as well. I am so pleased that I purchased this camera so many years and thousands of pictures ago.",

The photos are clear and crisp with billiant colors. At maximum zoom across a football field the detail is clear and perfect. I now have to wrestle my camera away from my daughter (somehow the camera now lives with her) who uses it to take photos of my grandson's sports and school activities. She posted some of the football photos on Facebook and got rave reviews on the great quality of the picutures. The s700 Turned out to be a great camera for a miminmal investiment with no performance problems.",

Although this camera does not have optical image stabalization it will minimize camera shake by pushing up the \"film speed\" and hence the shutter speed. The electronic viewfinder is great when shooting in bright condtions and the LCD becomes hard to see. Lots of modes and manual control over most everything. Picture quality is super for my intents and puposes. The owners manual can take a while to digest as some of the translation is a bit poor. These and even many point and shoot digital cameras these days are so feature laden that you almost need to have the manual along all the time.",

She was as happy as I was with it. It takes pretty good quality pictures, though I wasn't always impressed by the low-light responsiveness, even with the flash. Overall, though, it did a good job. I recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive camera that feels a little better in the hands than one of the small, square, point-and-shoot models.",

The only fault i would list is the battery door is a little fragile. Overall I would say its a great point and shoot camera, with some added features. Oh its also one of the cheapest in the inbetween category of not quite slr, but better than the small point and shooters.",

Video setting on the camera is ok too, very clear but again takes up a great amount of memory on your card.",

      "text": "After looking for a new digital camera for months and reading all the reviews I finally decided on the Finepix S700 and I couldn't be happier! The camera is very easy to use and the pics are coming out great! I have yet to take a bad picture with this camera! The only downside to the camera is where the flash pop up is placed, it took me a while to correctly place my fingers so I didn't get hit when it comes up but other than that I have no complaints!!",

The S1000 has a lag with the shutter speed and it does not have an extended viewfinder. Having a choice of a viewfinder or a screen was important to me and since I would rather use the viewfinder, the batteries last longer. For years I have used a 35mm film camera and had no problem switching to this great digital camera.",

Outdoor pix are fabulous with the s700, but I have found that the majority of photos I shoot are indoors, and this 7mp camera can't hold a candle to the quality of the older 5mp Kodak that I have. Now, if I can just get the finishing quality of the Kodak with the flash capabilities of the s700 . . .",

I know its a used camera but come on! Second, looks like some pixels are missing from the LCD screen, I think the screen was hit, that could have caused the dead pixels. Third, There was pictures in the camera. Fourth, the flash does not close all the way. But what else can you expect from a used item right? But all in all, I love the camera takes good pictures a lot of features.",

    "title": "Fujifilm Finepix S700 7.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom",
    "description": "Fujifilm Finepix S700 7.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nManufacturer Description The Fujifilm FinePix S700 is for anyone seeking an affordable long-zoom digital camera. The powerful 10x optical zoom lens and 1/2.5-inch, 7-megapixel standard CCD imager helps you capture perfect images. Dual media slots (SD/MMC and xD-Picture Card) give you more storage options, while the 2.5-inch LCD display helps you capture each image perfectly. Other features include multiple exposure modes, auto & manual focus, 8 white balance modes (including a custom hold mode) and a six-mode popup flash. There's plenty in the Fuji FinePix S700 to cater to the needs of advanced amateurs looking to gain maximum control over their photos. \n\n Fuji FinePix S700 Highlights \n\n \n\nFujinon lens technology The S700 features a 10x optical zoom with a 35mm focal range equivalent of 38-380mm. Bring your subject closer and clearer with high-quality Fujinon lens technology.  Picture stabilization Fast moving subject? No problem. Fujifilm's Picture Stabilization technology utilizes the heightened sensitivity of the FinePix S700 at ISO 1600 and high-speed shutter settings to prevent camera shake or freeze subject movement, keeping blur to a minimum. This easy to access feature (selectable on the mode dial) let's the FinePix S700 choose the correct light sensitivity and best-matching shutter speed automatically, for the highest quality digital pictures. \n\n i-Flash Intelligent Flash i-Flash fine-tunes flash output for shooting with high-sensitivity settings. It recognizes scene conditions and determines the optimum flash output to ensure superb results. Subjects in the foreground appear natural, and background detail is bright and clear. The difference is especially noticeable in the natural facial tones of people in your pictures, in close-ups and group photos alike. \n\n \n\n2.5-inch LCD display and Electronic Viewfinder The FinePix S700 features two different ways to frame and view your shot. Choose from either the large, 2.5-inch 230k pixel LCD Display, or the .24-inch 230k pixel Electronic Viewfinder. Both offer a 60/fps refresh rate, and a brilliantly bright and detailed view of your image in either shooting or playback mode.  Dual media slot convenience The Finepix S700 features a xD/SD compatible slot, allowing the use of either xD Picture Card or SD media to store and transfer your photos. This new capability assures compatibility with a wider variety of applications than ever before, and allows users to choose the media technology that is right for them.",
