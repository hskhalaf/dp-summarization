It says 240 on the box, and I ordered in bulk to give sets out to families at my church and I was short almost an entire set except for green. The picture is of the remaining markers once I removed 20 full sets of markers, which should have had 4 of each color left. I really don't know what to do because this is literally false advertising and pricing. Amazon, please fix this.",
