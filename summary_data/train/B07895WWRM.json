Buyers were also left astonished with the shoe\u2019s waterproofness, surface grip, and cushioning. On the other hand, its lack of arch support didn\u2019t leave a good impression on consumers. Taking everything into account, the Teva Arrowood 2 Waterproof still has what it takes to provide a trail-worthy performance, especially in wet environments.",

      "text": "I tried using a shoe stretcher device (purchased separately here at Amazon) to widen the right shoe to accommodate the spot on my right foot where I have a bunion. I left the stretcher in the shoe for 48 hours, but it didn't help. Presumably the problem here is that the waterproof material doesn't stretch. Took these shoes on a vacation trip and wearing the shoe on that foot became painful after a few hours. The shoes look good and they seem well made, so it might be great if you don't have a bunion.",

This change was needed and is appreciated. The lacing system is also better. The fit and finish is excellent as is usual for the Arrowoods. Above all, in my experience, Tevas are the only shoes that I have (and I have alot) that are truly Water-Proof! An excellent upgrade and a great shoe! I can't wait to try another pair. Thanks Teva!

I like the way they look, too. I don\u2019t have many shoe choices and these are #1. I love Amazon Wardrobe for shoes. I can actually wear them around the house until I\u2019m sure they are right.

Also I like that I can easily slip them on and off so I don't track dirt in my home or the homes of other. As an extra bonus, I can wear these shoes day in day out without problem. Not something I can do with other shoes. Overall great shoes.",
