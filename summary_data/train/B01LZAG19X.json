Please don't get me wrong, your shoulder is still aware you are firing a gun. However, the level of pain or shock is drastically reduced. A round of skeet with the old 870 was enjoyable again. Plinking with the the lever action was good times revisited for these old bones. I will most likely get another one from TinyPrice. Why not?

The price is great, and while snug, and taking some effort, it fit perfectly on my rifle. I ordered another for my fathers .308 on the way back from the range.

      "text": "It was a little hard to get it over my stock at first but after stretching it out for a bit it slipped right on. The rifle (just under 30 caliber ) I put it on and saw a noticeable reduction of recoil. Personally, when I shot 20 rounds my shoulder was getting sore, yet when the recoil pad was attached after shooting 30 round I had zero soreness. I recommend it, especially if you have it'll to place in-between your shoulder and the butt of the gun.",
