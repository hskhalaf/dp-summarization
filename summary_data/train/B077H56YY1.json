First archery hunt and first time deer hunting. 7/5/20 I'm currently wondering why when I first bought this crossbow the description said it was 410fps and 110lb draw.

      "title": "Great introductory crossbow.",
      "text": "As far as quality, it's almost identical to a Centerpoint 370. Assembly, materials used, power. Its almost a clone. That being said, for the price, it's a great deal. The scope isnt the best, but what would you expect for an entire package that costs less than $300? I was able to zero it in though, and was shooting nickel sized groups from 20 yards out. Definitely powerful enough for hunting. Only time will tell how it holds up. If it ends up breaking on me, I'll update my review. For now, I absolutely recommend it, especially for someone just looking to get started.",
