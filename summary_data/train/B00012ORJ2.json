Straight forward mounting bracket, plenty of cord length, pretty good power, and decent button options. Sensor reheat works well on multiple things, and defrost options are good too. I felt the unit was the most reasonably priced for the few 24\" units out there. Fast free shipping was great too!",

If you get one that isn't flawed, then I suspect it'll look very smart when installed.
