The unit is well-made and attractive. The UI is user-friendly. The only drawback is the software. You can\u2019t create a code that only works for a limited time, like you would want to provide to a babysitter or a housekeeper. I\u2019m hopeful that Yale will add this feature. If they do that, I\u2019ll give them five stars.",

We have family, friends and service companies who now have controlled access when we are not here. Really like remote view of status of lock. When you are away from the house you can still check to see if door is locked/unlocked; and remotely do either if necessary. My only miff which keeps me from five stars... on the app, you cannot assign a name to specific access code . So I have to keep a special spreadsheet so I know who is assigned what code. Also, there is no e-mail/text notification when an access code is used. Hopefully Yale will fix these flaws soon.",

This lock has worked well with my HomeKit and I have used the remote unlocking/locking a couple times now with success. My minor gripe is that it take a few tries to get the screen to light up sometimes when I'm returning. I'm not sure if it's when my finger is too dry or wet or cold or what, but sometimes it takes 3-4 touches. It hasn't failed to light up yet and that's really my only gripe. If they had a similar button one with HomeKit integration and without painted only numbers, I would probably choose that over this one next time.",

If you're not a software or digital device company don't pretend like you are. I'd stick with something a little less temperamental, with more support and from a company that makes digital products.

      "text": "So I just installed my Yale this weekend. It literally took me less than an hour. Somethings I didn't change was the door hardware. I used my same one and it fit the same. I messed up the master code twice and had to reset it but I love it. It was super simple to install and I'm glad I made the purchase.",
