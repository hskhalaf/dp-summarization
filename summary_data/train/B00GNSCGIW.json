I\u2019ve been using gas engine splitters for 40 years and all are noisy, heavy, polluting, expensive...etc. I now use about one cord of wood per year. I like it split extra small but always have to re-split about a fourth of the load, which is a pain. I\u2019m 70 and my shoulders and back can\u2019t take hand splitting any more...so this splitter is just the ticket. I built a rugged little table on casters to place it at 36\u201d working height and it\u2019s perfect. I leave in on the breezeway next to the stacked wood and re-split as needed. It has plenty of power, is quiet and non-polluting. I highly recommend this splitter.",

It met our expectations in every way -- Although the instructions specifically say that for safety sake, only one person should be operating the splitting process, we found it much more efficient to have one person run the lever that puts the splitting maul into motion and have another person lifting the logs into place.

That said, it arrived fully assembled except for the operating handle, and that took maybe 30 seconds to install. The unit's wheels are large enough that it will roll on rough terrain, and the unit works fine. Yes, I'd do it again.",

Using all the information out there, we decided to buy the Boss Industrial ES7T20 log splitter, and we have not regretted our decision. It is easy to use, and will split most any diameter of log, if careful in how you proceed. It is a bit heavy to move, but it needs this weight also to do it job. We like our replacement!!",

If you feel that the Overview and Specifications listed should meet your needs don't be afraid to purchase this machine. If you want to split wood any distance from your power supply go ahead and purchase some 30 amp extension cords, you will need them. The splitter will not function using smaller cords at a distance greater than 30 feet or so. Follow the easy to read directions and you will be splitting wood in a matter of minutes.",

We have been extremely pleased with ease of use as well as efficiency of use. It's small, but it's mighty. Love that it just plugs in, no need to store and pour gas.",
