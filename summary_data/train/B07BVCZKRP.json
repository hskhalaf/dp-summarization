It would be an unexpected distraction for the threat. If it causes him to run, great! If he reaches for it to shut it off, he gets hosed with law-enforcement grade pepper spray or shot as a last resort.",

I like that the alarm turns off only if the cord is reattached to the device. I can pull the cord and throw the alarm away from me, allowing for the sound to continue until the stranger leaves. Having five alarms allows us to have an alarm in different locations in our car, on our person or around our house (such as in the garage).",

The flashlight is surprisingly bright for such a small item. The alarms are incredibly loud and ear piercing. We've attached them to purses, belt loops, or just carried them while walking alone (or in small groups). They are simple to activate - and simple to silence. Hopefully they will never be needed, but I do have a better sense of security (for myself and my loved ones!)

You'll next begin immediately fumbling as you strive to put the pin back in to shut off the deafening noise this little thing lets out. It's comical how loud it is! What does this all mean? It gives me some satisfaction when I give to my daughter as she heads off to college this summer! Buy with confidence.",

The carabiner that comes with each of them is not very well made but is easily and cheaply replaceable. Not sure why this as marked as sensitive.",
