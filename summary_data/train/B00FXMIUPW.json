The chain was so crooked that he had to take it apart. In addition, the handle bar is rusty. He told me to go to Home Depot and buy a wax for metal to prevent more rust. In addition, there's so many scratches!!! I could have just return this but because of the \"folding tricycle\" I didn't want to bother taking it apart and shipping it back.",

      "text": "Some parts were missing, issues with stripped nuts and bolts - namely the left pedal and handle bar (my husband replaced the nut and bolt) and the instructions were a total nightmare. We literally had to look a the photo on Amazon to figure out how certain things were connected. I'm not a fan of the pivotal seat, but I can live with that. Basically, you get what you pay for. What this bike needs is more quality control, much better instructions, and the nuts and bolts literally need to be of better quality. Would I recommend it? No. Spend a little more and get a quality product.",
