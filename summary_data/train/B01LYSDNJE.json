I would not recommend these guns if your kids are remotely rough with their toys. Both guns have broken simply from being dropped by a 3 year old. Obviously I realize they're not intended to be dropped, but a little sturdiness in toys for kids is expected. We have a different brand of laser tag guns that have held up for years. I went with this brand to get more guns. Should have stuck with the tried and true. Lesson learned.",

Unfortunately the hit sensor was not placed in this perfect location - instead it is on the front of the gun, below the emitter opening. This means the gun is only oriented to detect shots from the front. Too bad - good tag strategy is to attack from the side or back. The two buttons to change team modes and shooting modes are unlabeled. Not cool to have to carry the instructions with you to know the buttons and the options.",

I also don't like how the gun doesn't default to the color of the gun when you are selecting teams. This isn't a deal breaker by any means but something that could make it a smidge easier for younger kids to use. Otherwise they are really fun and seem to be made very well.",

I paid over $100 for 2 sets and 5 guns were only used once, 3 guns never used. Only six guns of the eight guns work as they should. Seriously disappointed.

      "text": "I bought the Lukat brand laser guns and they were very hard to work with. When your 9 lives were up they wouldn\u2019t respawn or reset. I sent it back and asked for a replacement and the same thing happened with the second set so I opted to try these and I absolutely love them so far. We haven\u2019t played outside yet, but that is our next adventure as we just received these. My son and all players involved extremely enjoyed it. Highly recommend for now. If anything changes I will give an updated review.",

Whishing there was an option to only return and replace one.....the other 3 work just fine. I wish there was a way to turn off or down the shooting volume.

Hopefully by summer time he\u2019s still a fan so that the kids can run around at night outside and play laser tag. Just make sure you purchase a hundred batteries to go with. Battery life is pretty decent but when they go they go and then you have a bunch of sad kids.",
