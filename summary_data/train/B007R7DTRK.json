      "text": "One of my best purchases ever. I bought this used primarily for video, because of Panasonic's reputation for video. Took me a while before I started to do videos seriously at the gigs where I do still photography - but I now have got into the swing of things, and am shooting a lot of video - some of which are stunningly good in quality. The sound using only the camera's internal mics is good enough that a regular taper asked if it really was from the internal mics. Please see comments where I have included several YouTube links to videos from this camera",

I was a bit skeptical going from a series of Canon cameras to a Panasonic, but I've been very happy with my purchase. (And the Amazon Marketplace Deal was awesome!)",

For example, the popular effect where the photo is black and white except for a red balloon or a red dress- the Lumix will do that in real time. The Lumix has a bunch of preconfigured FX and settings that make it really easy to use. It's really tiny too. It's smaller than some point and shoot cameras I've seen.",

    "description": "Color:Black| Style:14-42 Zoom LensFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\nLUMIX GF5\n\u2022 Class Leading Fast Auto Focus [ * For Micro Four Thirds System Cameras as of April 5, 2012 ]\n\u2022 Automatically Recommends Creative Effects with Guides\n\u2022 Widest Range of Interchangeable Lens Available [ * For Micro Four Thirds System Cameras as of April 5, 2012 ]\n\u2022 Smartphone-like Touch Enabled Display\n\u2022 Professional Looking Stills and HD Videos\n\n\n\nLOVE PHOTOGRAPHY?\nHidden within the sophisticated profile of this next generation [Mirrorless] ultra-compact interchangeable lens camera is the heart of today\u2019s powerful DSLR cameras. The LUMIX DMC-GF5 features higher image quality even in under low light shooting with high ISO settings. The reason is the large newly developed 12.1 Megapixel Live MOS Sensor and advanced Image processing from the LUMIX Venus Engine. In addition to the basic features desired in DSLR cameras including quick accurate auto focus, DMC-GF5 features a host of options that make photography even more artistic yet easy \u2013 enjoyable enough for users seeking to step up from a compact digital camera. Complying with the established Micro Four Thirds \u201cmirrorless\u201d standard, the widest range of interchangeable lenses is offered to expand the photographic experience and your love of photography.\n\n\nNEW 12.1-MEGAPIXEL LIVE MOS SENSOR AND VENUS ENGINE TRUE PICTURE QUALITY\n\n\nThe DMC-GF5 is a stylish camera in compact size thanks to the elimination of mirrors found in DSLR that were designed in the days of film. Yes it retains the fundamental excellent performance of an interchangeable lens system camera, only it was designed for the modern digital age. DMC-GF5 incorporates a newly developed 12.1-megapixel Live MOS (image sensor) which features high sensitivity signal processing. Optimization of on-chip filters realizes image recording with even higher sensitivity at max. ISO12800. Both photodiode circuit and readout circuit are also optimized to minimize noise generation through processing to readout. Furthermore, newly added NR (Noise Reduction) circuit completes Panasonic\u2019s excellent noise reduction system that thoroughly removes noise left at final processing stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image processor Venus Engine uses a combination of 3DNR(3D Noise Reduction) and MNR (Multi-process Noise Reduction), both bright area and dark area are faithfully reproduced with minimum noise in high sensitivity picture recording.\n\n\nCLASS LEADING FAST AUTO FOCUS\nAll cameras of LUMIX G Micro System adopt Contrast AF for its focus system. Compared with the Phase difference system AF used in legacy DLSR cameras, the Contrast AF boasts higher accuracy.\n\nThe DMC-GF5 features the class leading**** ultra-high-speed (approx. 0.09 second) of Light Speed AF and high precision touch enabled pin-point AF that makes it possible to capture even the fast-moving subject clearly. Not only thanks to contrast based focus accuracy, but its speed also excels like that of traditional DSLRs with Phase difference.\n\n\nCombined with the Touch AF control, setting and focusing at the subject is incredibly easy and quick, never missing the spur-of-the-moment. Taking further advantage of Contrast AF, the DMC-GF5 incorporates Full-area focusing which makes it possible to set focus on any point in the field of view. Frame composition is free and intuitive combining the touch-control operation.\n\nThe touch-control system of DMC-GF5 immediately lets users to set focus to the subject by just touching it on the LCD and you can even release the shutter. Once you lock on the subject by a touch, the camera tracks the subject with the AF tracking function even if it moves. Pinpoint AF function is incorporated in DMC-GF5 allowing more precise focus setting by further enlarging the focusing area. It assists, for example, setting focus right on the pupil in an eye.\n\n* The time for focusing on the subject is measured with LUMIX G X VARIO PZ 14-42mm / F3.5-5.6 ASPH. / POWER O.I.S (H-PS14042) (bundled lens in DMC-GF5X) to move the lens position to \"2m\" from \"infinity\" position. The zoom position is in wide end. Panasonic measurement method\n\nNEW SCENE GUIDE TO LEAN VARIOUS EXPRESSIONS IN PHOTOGRAPHY AND NEW CREATIVE CONTROL\nFor beginners of interchangeable lens system cameras, the new Scene Guide in DMC-GF5 offers 23 sample pictures shot by professional photographers. Users can choose the one closer to the situation they are going to shoot and optimum parameters for shooting the scene will be automatically set*. Furthermore, shooting procedure, technical advice and recommended interchangeable lens for the scene can be shown for users to learn photography.\n\nThe popular Creative Control mode is upgraded by increasing its filter option from 6 (for DMC-GF3) to 14 (for DMC-GF5) adding new Soft Focus**, Dynamic Monochrome, Impressive Art, One Point Color, Cross Process and Star Filter**, in addition to the conventional Expressive, Retro, High Key, Sepia, High Dynamic, Miniature Effect*** and newly added Low Key and Toy Effect mode. Effect parameter of each mode is also adjustable. With the new GUI and menu tab, switching filter effect is extremely easy and is possible to preview via the Live View. Also, recommended filters are suggested depending on the scene that camera detects in iA or iA Plus mode.\n\n*Video recording using Scene Guise is not possible in some scenes.\n**For photo only\n*** Sound will not be recorded with [MINIATURE EFFECT] in Creative Control Mode and approximately 1/10 of the time period is recorded. (If you record for 10 minutes, the resulting motion picture recording will be approximately 1 minute long)\n\n\nINTUITIVE CONTROL AND HIGH VISIBILITY ENABLED BY THE NEW 920,000-DOT TOUCH DISPLAY\nWith the new 3.0-inch large 920,000-dot high-precision touch display and GUI(Graphic User Interface), the DMC-GF5 offers both ease and comfort in operation.\n\nThe touch-control system immediately lets users to set focus to the subject by just touching it on the screen and you can even release the shutter. Once you lock on the subject by a touch, the camera tracks the subject with the AF tracking function even if it moves. Touch zoom is also available when the LUMIX Power Zoom Lens H-PS14042 lens or H-PS45175 is mounted. Taking further advantage of Contrast AF, the DMC-GF5 incorporates Full-area focusing which makes it possible to set focus on any point in the field of view. Frame composition is free and is intuitively determined. Also, menu of shooting option is available with Touch Q-menu. Operation is always quick and easy with DMC-GF5.\n\nThanks to the newly integrated graphic engine, GUI is now sophisticated in every detail and features animation for higher visibility. Users can choose an image and set it as a wallpaper on the back of menu screen like mobile phones.\n\nULTRA SMALL, LIGHT-WEIGHT BODY WITH BUILT-IN FLASH FEATURING SOPHISTICATED DESIGN AND ENJOYABLE OPERABILITY\nThe DMC-GF5 features ultimate compactness despite its incorporation of built-in flash. The design dispels impression for conventional big, heavy and colorless DSLRs. Although the round-form profile gives comfortable impression, its design is sophisticated and stylish. Aluminum ring surrounding metal mount surrounded refines the look even sharper. Finest tuning is applied in every part of the camera not just its look but also touch and even sense of feel.\n\n\nHIGH QUALITY 1920 X 1080 FULL-HD VIDEO WITH STEREO SOUND\nThe DMC-GF5 can record 1920 x 1080 at 60i(NTSC) / 50i(PAL)* full-High Definition videos in the AVCHD format which excels in both compression efficiency and compatibility with AV equipment for playback. In addition to the practical full-time AF, the Touch AF in video recording also lets users enjoy professional-like rack focusing. With a dedicated video record button on the top, users can instantly start recording videos while shooting photos without any having to make any extra setting adjustments. Along with the full-HD video capabilities, the DMC-GF5 also features high-quality sound, recorded with Dolby\u00ae Digital Stereo Creator. Videos can also be recorded in MP4 format for playback on a PC or other portable electronic devices without having to convert the files. Also, the Extra Tele Conversion function virtually extends the zoom range Max. 4.2x without deterioration of image quality in smaller resolution.\n\n-Maximum time to record motion pictures continuously with [AVCHD] is 29 minutes 59 seconds in European PAL areas.\n-Maximum time to record motion pictures continuously with [MP4] is 29 minutes 59 seconds or up to 4 GB.\n-You can check the recordable time on the screen. (For [FHD] in [MP4] format, the file size is large and so the recordable time will drop below 29 minutes 59 seconds.)\n\nOTHER FEATURES COMPLETES DMC-GF5\nAlthough the DMC-GF5 is a compact, stylish, interchangeable lens system camera, the DMC-GF5 is capable of high-speed burst shooting at 4 fps (in full resolution) to capture subject with motion.\n\nFor beginners of digital interchangeable lens system cameras, iA (Intelligent Auto) mode supports taking beautiful pictures with a variety of shooting-assist functions including AF Tracking, Intelligent D-range Control, Intelligent Scene Selector, Face Recognition and Intelligent ISO Control. The iA Plus mode lets users adjust defocusing area in the background, exposure compensation and white balance for more flexible control.\n\nA dedicated sensor for shooting angle detection is newly added which makes it possible to tell whether the photo was taken horizontally or vertically whatever lens is used.\n\nThe DMC-GF5 is compatible with UHS-I standard for the SDXC/SDHC Memory Card taking its advantage of high-speed data transmission.\n\nA Variety of optional accessories including Wide / Tele / Macro / Fisheye Conversion Lenses, fashionable straps and carrying cases makes it more fun to be with DMC-GF5.\n\n[ **** For Micro Four Thirds System Cameras as of April 5, 2012 ]",
