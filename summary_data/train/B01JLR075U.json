It feels like one of those cheap dollar store Halloween capes. The strings tying the tube to the ball pit broke the same day it was given to the kids (Christmas Day) and 3 days later the metal coil that gives the tube shape broke through the fabric and almost hit my eldest in the face. I'm not sure if it was a fluke or what but it scared the crap out of me. The ball pit and play tent still appear in good condition. I honestly can not recommend this though.",

The 3 peices tie together easily and stay together duringplay time. When assembled the set takes up alot of space so if you do not have a big open area you may want to consider a smaller tent. The tents are all very light weight so outside play is limited on windy days. the peices all fold up with little effort and fit into one bag that is small enough to store under a bed or in a closet when not in use.",
