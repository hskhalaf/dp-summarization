Overall, these sneakers are made to come in style and keep the feet comfortable all day.",

After months, they've minimally broken in and now are bearable in terms of comfort. Not the level of comfort I remember from my Samba's as a kid. Might want to order a half-size up",

Also, I have narrow feet and the size 9 fits me perfectly. People with normal-to-wide feet may end up with a shoe which is the right length but too tight.",
