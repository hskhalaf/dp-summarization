The only dislike was that when I upgraded it by adding a hard drive, it was quite challenging to disassemble the entire thing, but it has been rock solid in its operation like a Mac should be, so I am very happy with it. Just FYI order the minimum spec HD and memory and upgrade those yourself. It can save a lot of money! I put 16 GB in this machine and a 500 GB SSD in the second drive bay, and use the 1 TB drive for extra space.",

Pros: - Easy sync with iPhone, iPad, iPod - Easy setup - I don't have to shut down all the time for updates to take place Cons: - No DVD slot. I know this is old school, but I like to put my pictures on a CD (in addition to saving them in the cloud), but I can't do that with the Mini. I guess I need to get more comfortable with the Cloud - So many updates!",
