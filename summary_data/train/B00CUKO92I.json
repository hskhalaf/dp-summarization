We leave near the coast, salty air I guess because it didn't get rained on. Thought we would have at least 2 years useage. We live in warm climate so fit pit season is short. Metal is too weak. Definitely put coat heat rated paint before use. A little expensive for just one season. We used it anyway and it works where there are not big holes. Will try a different brand/vendor for replacement.",

My fire pit is 4ft. from side to side and this fits very good on the top with about an inch to spare around. The only negative is when you open it, it creeps forward a little and I always have to push it back when we are using it. I am going to look to attach it to my fire pit somehow so it doesn't move forward. Not a game breaker but a tiny bit annoying. This is very easy to put together and blocks 98% of the ash floating around. We are very happy with this purchase.",
