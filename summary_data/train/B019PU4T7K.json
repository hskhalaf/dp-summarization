The helmet fit perfectly and the Music playback and phone call features worked great. I was very happy. That is, until I left the store to go home. I lowered the faceplate and heard a snap. The left side of the plate is hanging off the helmet. When I get home I try to see what it was, maybe just a clip. No, it was the bolt holing the left side of the plate to the helmet. The head of the bolt simply snapped off from normal use of less than 4 hours.",

It makes loud/obnoxious beeps whenever you turn it on/off. Wind cuts thru the helmet really bad, wind noise is deafening at highway speeds",

The controls are terrible and useless for anything but turning volume up and down. The sound quality is about what I would expect for tiny speakers.

I will say that for over $200 including shipping, I certainly expected a much higher level of packaging as opposed to what I received.

      "text": "I have a $700 Shoei helmet I recently purchased. The ILM has about the same amount of wind noise. I can barely (mostly not) hear the Bluetooth speakers at speed. It\u2019s about as comfortable as the Shoei. The Bluetooth is a bonus that I like for navigation. I believe this to be a reasonable purchase for someone who doesn\u2019t want to spend the money for high end brainbox protection. If I didn\u2019t already have the Shoei I\u2019d probably call it good. If I could hear the Bluetooth speakers above 50mph I\u2019d give it five stars.",

      "text": "Great helmet, Seems like a great design and I like a LOT of the features of this helmet. Bluetooth worked well, speakers were plenty loud. Phone calls inside the helmet were a little muffled but NOT bad. I did NOT wear this riding however. The problem? I wear an XL Helmet and this one (XL) was too small. It fits really tight around the forehead and was not comfortable. Company DID offer to return with apologies and I will be sending this back, but the company does not make an XXL which was disappointing. If you are an XL I would avoid this helmet until they make them in XXL.",

Only wish they would\u2019ve been more understanding when the part broke within seven days of receiving the helmet. Only charged the battery two times. So far that\u2019s my only complaint.",
