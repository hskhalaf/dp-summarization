The pump that comes with it is great, but a workout, so if you can, get the electric. It can easily be handled with one person: set up, carry, and pack up. My kids and nephews loved it and this board was a hit at the beach. This is going to give summer that extra fun!",

      "text": "The stand up paddle board is warped. It's slightly twisted along its length. This makes it very unstable, since the board is not sitting flatly on the water. Also, the telescopic paddle can not be solidly arrested. The telescopic part keeps sliding around. Inflating and deflating is easy enough with the supplied pump and some elbow grease. On a breezy day you must wear the supplied leash because the board will get away from you faster than you can swim. It has a much higher profile than a solid board, therefore the wind drives it away quickly. What's left to say is that because of the warping, it's not usable. It's not tracking straight and it's very tippy.",

One piece of advise.....buy an automatic electric pump. You'll thank me, I promise. It's no fun pumping up and down 500 times in 98 degree weather while the kids wait patiently for a paddleboard.

      "text": "My wife and i received two of these free flow crafts as a wedding gifts and we absolutely love them. Very compact and portable. We are always able to roll these tightly and store them in the original bags which fit nicely in back of the SUV. Tips: - Always fill your craft up to 15 PSI - Always keep track of your detachable fin - It is worth investing in an electric air pump. There are many out there but of course serenelife sells many that are guaranteed to fit and work like a charm! - Just have fun and go with the flow!",

      "text": "This paddleboard has been amazing. We bought 2 of them and have used them the past two summers and they are absolutely great. Once you inflate it, it remains at a good PSI for the whole summer. They are lightweight enough to easily strap to the roof of the car. It is durable and you feel completely stable on them. Would DEFINITELY recommend this paddleboard to anyone. I accidently lost the fin to attach to the bottom of the board and Pyle sent me a replacement one for FREE. They were awesome to deal with and super helpful.",

I lost a piece and they stayed with me, sending me parts two different times, free of charge, to help me get things squared away. Very impressive, and that is important for something like a paddle board. it isn't quite as stable as the boards that cost two and three times as much. That's what you get at this price point. But for the casual rider who will only use the thing several times a year, it's a perfect board.",

It\u2019s tough to inflate past 10 psi but you need at least 14 to not fall over. The board was pretty steady going through the wakes of boats and jet skis. However, once all done I could not get it back in the bag. So four stars because it\u2019s hard to inflate and tough to put everything away. Other than that I loved it. It\u2019s worth what you pay.

The pump attachment does not lock into the paddle board, so someone needs to hold it the entire time you\u2019re pumping the board, and they have to hold it very tightly or air will slip out. My friends with other branded inflatable SUPs do not have this issue with their pumps. Additionally, the paddle is of poor quality and I am already unable to lock the paddle into its extended position due to the poor quality lock coming loose.

Agree it's tough for the last lbs of air into the board without an elec pump. Don't know about the maneuverability (not in water yet) but had to select stars for the review. Am looking forward to using the board in the spring at the Delaware beaches.",

I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to get up as easily as I have on hard boards and more expensive inflatable SUPs. Hopefully I can adjust but definitely not as stable as the higher end boards which isn't a surprise.",
