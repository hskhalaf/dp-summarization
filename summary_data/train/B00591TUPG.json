Unfortunately, the Birko insole is shorter than the indicated US M (11) on the Nike and Asics. Fortunately, it's wide enough not to slide but short enough notice very occasionally. I'm not sure going a size up is a good thing either. You can't cut it or reshape it because of the toe supports. It has to fit or not.",

For these inserts, I had to pick a size in-between my Birkenstock size and my shoe size. Then they fit well enough in my shoe without being too much arch support.
