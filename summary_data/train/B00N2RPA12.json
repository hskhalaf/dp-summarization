Cons: connection by magnets-not attached, angle not adjustable when using keyboard. Would give it 5 stars if the connection was more solid and the viewing angle was adjustable. But overall, for the price, I can't complain.",

But I use mouse when I use keyboard, and I don't read/write files are large. I don't care at all. Surface3? It's too expensive :-)",

Had it out the box within 2 hours of getting it. Setup is very easy, especially if you have other computers running Windows, however the attached key board is terrible. Hard to get it to connect and once you do the keys are temperamental.",
