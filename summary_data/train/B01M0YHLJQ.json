It's still in great shape and my boyfriend likes it, too. Easy to add colored details (extra pillow or a bright throw at the foot of the bed).",

I believe had other less than a year, and am now looking to buy a different one. With kids and dogs, I need bedding that can be washed frequently. Although the material remains intact and looking good after washing, it's become impossible to fix the stuffing, and it's all bunched up in the middle. Would not recommend.",
