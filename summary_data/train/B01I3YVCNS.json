The lack of a small cutting board is sort of puzzling at this price point. Finally, after touting their all-stainless (\"SOLID\") utensils as being so much better than the flimsy plastic handles used by competitors, they included a corkscrew with a flimsy plastic handle. Ha! I really like this set, but if you have to buy a cutting board you might take a closer look at comparable sets that cost a bit less.",

I bought a 4 person with the intention of mostly using it for 2 people in the interest of having extra utensils with which to serve food. This one is nicer than others I saw. It's tasteful. The cooler compartment is big enough for at least 2 people and probably for four people with an appetite for quality over quantity. There is no smell to it when it's first opened, thankfully.",

I will say the only disappointment is the wine pocket holds only traditional bottles. Some wine bottles today are larger diameter and won't fit. I with they would have provided more tolerance in the wine pocket size for larger bottles. I also wish they used a velcro flap to secure the bottle, instead of a zipper. These two nits are the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.",

If this is, in fact a generous size compared to similar products by other sellers (and it IS for sure bc I researched measurements), I am so glad I went with this set instead of the others. A smaller blanket size would be useless! Also, love the waterproof bottom on the blanket that came with this. Great design but another midsize pocket on the from would be helpful. Color scheme is better in person. Overall, I am happy with my purchase.",

The flatware is nice for being a picnic backpack, and the blanket is waterproof on one side, so no worries about a damp ground. The rest of the items are relatively low quality, but functional, aside from the salt and pepper shakers which are worthless. Those things can be replaced though. I'm adding my own cutting board and knife as well. I haven't tried other picnic backpack sets, but I am satisfied with this one.",

It's a bit difficult to slide everything in and out. I may regard this as a plus in the future because if they loosen a bit they are still tight. Lastly the wine sleeve could use a wider or more elastic opening. Or if it zipped down slightly more. It did do a fantastic job of keeping the wine cold.",

The detachable blanket also appeared to be useful. There was a small zipper at the opening of the side pocket 'bottle holder' which unfortunately did not really stay fully zipped (since it was so short) so I'm not sure it was needed. But overall I felt it was a practical attractive item for which the outdoorsy type couple I gave it to will get alot of use out of it.",

For those concerned about carrying wine and/or other beverages about in public, the compartment in the back has plenty of room to fit 2 bottles discretely. I have yet to wash the blanket but thus far it works nicely. The blanket keeps you and your belongings dry, even on moist to wet grass.
