It is not necessarily the most stable setup, but we have successfully steamed many a small black cod and other fish to a tasty conclusion. Use chopsticks inserted through the holes on the insert plate to remove with fish when done. Good product that allows us to steam our fish without breaking the bank. I estimate that the product has a long life span and will never need to be replaced.",

I first shopped locally for a fish poacher, and found this exact item in one of the stores specializing in kitchen items, but at a much higher price than Amazon. The poacher appears to be well constructed, and I would definitely recommend this item to anyone interested in obtaining one.",

The product is poorly made. Since I was beyond the return policy timeframe I am not eligible for a refund or even an exchange. It has been a very disappointing experience.",

Before buying this product, I looked around the Internet to try to find the weight of stainless steel. At parkers-pantry.com, I found the following in addition to the product description posted at Amazon: Brand: Norpro Name: Fish Poacher Manufacturer SKU: 280 Material: 18/10 Stainless Steel. Dimensions/Capacity/Size: 4.5\"H x 18.0\". Special Features: Perforated rack insert Warranty: Yes. This is very lightweight metal. 4. After using the poacher once, I found the bottom surface became pitted. I would not recommend this product.",

But to move up to a much better made fish steamer will cost 5X the money. I steam fish twice a year, so I don't need a $300 copper French made hand hammered pot. You probably don't either.",
