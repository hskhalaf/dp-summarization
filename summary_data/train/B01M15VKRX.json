This makeup provides good coverage, is comfortable on the skin, and has a somewhat dewy finish while having all the benefits of a matte finish. The dewy finish is natural looking and not overly dewy; it just add a bit of a glow that I like. It is a bit pricey, but not overly so -- worth the money.",
