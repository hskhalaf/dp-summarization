I then purchased the Redwing sole inserts and they are much more comfortable for all day wear. The break-in time was about four days of wearing the boots. They are comfortable and look great. Redwing has an excellent leather treatment that keeps them looking good and water resistant. My first pair of Redwing boots lasted 22 years. This pair will most likely outlast me.",

I initially bought them for casual wear and replaced the laces with gold/brown round laces, but will also wear them in the shop/garage when working on my motorcycle or vehicle. The leather is very stiff and I immediately applied mink oil to the boots and wore them around the house or when running short errands to get them broke in. I also followed the recommendations to order a half size up and add a foot insert. These are sturdy, high quality boots that I now wear daily. Good boot and they will last a long time.",

So the design is great i love them and the quality of the leather is amazing it will last a very long time. personally once the souls wear down ill have them shipped to a cobbler to replace them for as long as the leather holds up. The price is expensive but you get what you pay for.",
