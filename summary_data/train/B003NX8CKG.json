When they eventually wear a little thin, I keep one near the bed to slip on when nights get a little too cold for comfort but not enough to turn on the heating. I find them the perfect take along for flights and convenient for gardening and housework.",

I had originally ordered a small, but it was tight when I zipped it up, so I repurchased a medium. It fits perfectly, although the sleeves are a little long. Only complaint I have is that the material inside the pockets is a bit harsh on hands (almost like a microfiber material), but I won't be using the pockets much so it's not a deal breaker.",

The jacket has no liner (it says liner in the product description). It's a nice early Fall or Spring jacket. I bought a 3X and it fits more like a 1X. The fabric is super soft and I'll update my review as time passes and I wear it more. My last Columbia jacket lasted 10 years before the zipper broke. Wondering how long this will.",

The regular extra small fits much better, although it still has a kind of strange shapelessness to it. Certainly not the most figure-flattering item of clothing but I suppose that's not what I got it for. I'm also not a huge fan of sleeves that end in elastic, but it's not a deal breaker. Overall, it's a comfortable light weight jacket and for the price I'm perfectly happy with it.",

It doesn't pill, doesn't shrink. I loaned mine to my daughter one day because she forgot her jacket and she loved it so much I bought her one of her own. And I love that the pockets zip up.

      "text": "I ordered to wear at work with my scrubs that are navy since we can only wear things with minimum logos. I have other Colombia jackets/ sweaters that I love, but was unable to find a navy one in store. Based off the picture it looked like a true dark navy, but I was disappointed when it came in that it definitely not true navy. It looks faded and cheap! It is more like a slate navy, or is where it almost looks sun faded. It does not match any of my navy scrubs. It\u2019s comfortable and warm, but I can\u2019t look faded and unmatched at work. Disappointed to spend $40 on a sweater that looks like trash.",

It's on sale for 30$ which is okay but I would be upset if I played the full 60. I will say the color is nice so there's that.",
