The headgear protected the back of her head and cushioned the blow resulting in only temporary discomfort. She wears it every time she is on the field and is very comfortable. It looks like a headband so she is not self conscious about it. Very satisfied.",

After 1 training session he said it was falling in his eyes the whole time. I then purchased a size 4 which was initially really tough for him to get on, but he says it's perfect once he starts sweating. The sizing is way off.

WARNING AND DISCLAIMER: The Head Guard is designed to reduce the risks of cuts and impact to head during participation in soccer, but cannot and does not prevent all risk of head injuries. Participation in soccer and other sports exposes the participant to the risk of injuries, and participation in such sports implies acceptance of such risk. No helmet, head gear or head protection device can prevent all head, neck or facial injuries. A user may sustain head injuries (which may include concussions or other brain-related injuries) notwithstanding his or her use of the Head Guard, and there are areas of the head and face that are not covered or protected by the Head Guard. In addition, for maximum performance, the Head Guard must be sized and fitted properly, and replaced promptly if fit loosens over time or falls off during participation in soccer or other sports.",
