The guard no longer functions properly making the saw totally useless. I will be getting a different brand going forward. If you get one of these saws, make sure to check everything is securely fastened! I tried to return to Amazon, but it appears I am too late.",

If you are having this problem let it run a good 5 to 10 seconds before attempting the cut. You can hear it. It sounds like it starts out slow and then it comes up to full speed. If you do this you can get good clean cuts.",

And lets be honest, you're using this to chop lumber not to do absolute precision work. This is a case where more than powerful enough and \"close enough\" on the angles is good enough.",

I would not recommend if this tool is what helps you make a living but for small projects around the house it is great. We did all of our baseboards after laying laminate flooring. I looked up a youtube video to better understand how to use it and I have to say I made a new friend. Didn't even let the husband use it. It was super easy and nice clean cuts. Would recommend to anyone who wants to do their own home improvements or even hobbies.",

Should have spent the extra money for a better saw, but not sad to have this thing around for rough cuts. For what it cost it could still make you a lot of money, hoping if i remove the fence and build my own that the problem will be solved",
