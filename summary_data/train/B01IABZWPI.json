After a few times job, you can feel the pestle starts breaking pieces of sand and it WILL go straight to your food. Your stomach can not digest these kinds of materials, so it will try to increase the gastric acid in your stomach to digest it. Your stomach will feel floating after a meal maybe just for me but be careful when cooking. That's all I want to say, it depends on your trust to buy this product.",

It's also beautiful: the outside is studded with sparkles, and its roughness keeps it from slipping in your hands. Do Google the seasoning instructions. You need to pound rice into powder -- which takes some time and effort, at least if you're a noodle-armed person like me -- to get all the manufacturing dust out of the inside surface.",

A simple rinse with water is all it takes to clean and it does not appear to take on any odor or color. The pestle could be a little larger compared to the mortar to prevent what you're crushing from pushing up the sides.",

The bottom is made of a material like felt. The inside of the receptacle is somewhat rough, but not as rough as the exterior. It works well for grinding and powderizing. The pestle is polished on the sides, as is the top of the receptacle. It is quite useful for preparing herbs in the kitchen.",

Then proceeded to make garam masala. It's great. Needs a bit more pounding than I expected, but all-in-all, it really works well and looks great. Thanks!",

    "rating": 4.8,
    "feature_bullets": [
      "REQUIRED MODERN COOKING EQUIPMENT - A kitchen's ambience is defined by the aroma of herbs and spices battling against each other before they are added to a recipe. These strong flavors are unleashed when using the HiCoup Kitchenware mortar and pestle. Our giant size black and grey granite stone mortar and pestle crusher is handy for everything from cracking peppercorns and crushing tender herbs to making pesto, salsa and guacamole.",
      "CHEF PREFERRED \u2013 Chefs prefer traditional granite mortars and pestles over clay, ceramic, glass, marble, wooden or other stones one since granite mortar and pestle sets never fails to product the best and most delicious paste. You will discover that the fine flavors produced from food ground in the HiCoup granite mortar and pestle are far superior to the flavors of foods ground in a mortar and pestle made from other materials.",
      "EXCELS AT THE FULL RANGE OF TASKS \u2013 From mashing delicate herbs to grinding stubborn peppercorns, our solid, hand-carved mortar and pestle out-rivals the competition. The huge, heavy duty, and broad-based pestle needs to do little more than fall on ingredients to crush them \u2013 very little elbow grease required. And the bowl\u2019s big, extra deep sloped shape and rough matte texture keep ingredients in the centre, so there\u2019s no need to chase them around with the pestle.",
      "HEALTHY AND EASY TO CLEAN \u2013 Our gray granite mortar and pestle is literally rock hard, is non-porous, will not absorb flavors and odours, and its matte surface creates friction for grinding but is smooth enough to wipe clean easily. Additionally, studies have shown that granite dust, which gets into the ingredients pounded in a granite mortar and pestle, contains 5% potassium and has associated with it 16 minerals. Potassium aids the functions of the cells and different organs in our bodies.",
      "A HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCT BACKED BY OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE \u2013 We\u2019ll let our reviews and seller feedback speak for themselves."
