I finally found one that combines the things I love and eliminates the things I hate. I love the battery life and the fact that tracking is effortless. You don't have to put it in a special mode to record exercise or sleep. It connects to the app quickly every time. It is water resistant so shower, sweat, or swimming is no problem. It is simple, efficient and looks good. I'm glad I tried one more tracker before giving up on them.",

I expected a bit of a difference, but it's basically cut my phone battery life in half. This would be something I could get past, but not the time keeping. You definitely get what you pay for.",

      "text": "I really wanted to like this watch more. I love the way it looks and feels -- I have basically worn it 24/7 for 2 months. But it has two major flaws. First, you have to keep manually syncing it (particularly when traveling across time zones to update the time). But worst of all is that it doesn't keep time well: about once a week, the hands get out of calibration. This means your watch loses time -- often several minutes -- and the only way to fix is to recalibrate in the app. A watch that can't keep time isn't much of a watch at all. But when synced, the step tracking and especially the sleep tracking work well.",

It also automatically syncs with my phone, unlike the Garmin products that required several tries to manually sync.It has a long battery life. Best of all, it looks like a watch. The only other features I would like to see would be (date and measurement of stairs). It does exactly what it is built to do, smoothly and seamlessly. Overall, a great product.",

I do have a Samsung gear that tracks sleep as well as many other functions but is not waterproof, that's ok, I will enter it manually into myfitnesspal and take my refund. Ps.

This was a huge selling point for me and I have showered and swam with this on hundreds of times and it still works perfect - Looks great - Vibrating wake-up alarm is great - It does not track while moving in cars, buses, monorails, etc. Cons - It does track when I am riding on the riding mower - The face scratches easily",

I'm curious to see if it breaks after 6months-year like every tracker I've had in the past does. I will update if that is the case. It's a little big for my tiny lady arm but I like it that way.",

My wife and I bought two of these watches new and not much later, she cracked the crystal. I then dropped it and it shattered completely. Upon asking for a repair, I was offered a 25% discount towards a new watch. No thanks. My next purchase is going to be the Timex Metro, hopefully they will stand behind there product, unlike the Withings company. I bought my watch in October of 2015 so I am well within the 2 year warranty.",
