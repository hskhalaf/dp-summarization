My 95 year old mother, with her totally arthritic hands, can not do this. Second and largest problem: No where on the order page does it state the item CAN NOT BE RETURNED. I feel the order page should have made this abundantly clear. Once you buy the item and attempt to return it, then you find out that \"no returns are allowed\". Now we are stuck with an $85.00 item, which will be used as an expensive paper weight.",

I kept resetting it for my father, kept resetting the alarms and dosage schedule hoping it would resolve the matter, but it never did. By the time I was ready to throw in the towel and return it, it was 1 day past the return window. My father is now out $80 for this mis-functioning unit.",

I keep the unit locked so she does not have to worry about accidently opening it and all the pills falling out when she turns it over.

My advice is keep an eye on the lock. A small screw is what holds the lock together and it can back out. This caused it to jam a couple of times and the pill box can no longer be locked.",

My mom, who lives alone and has Alzheimer's, has had this machine for about 18 months now and it has proved to be quite reliable. If the patient takes medication twice a day like my mom, they will be able to store two weeks worth of medication in the device. If once a day, it will hold up to four weeks of medication.",

And why have someone with memory problems have to remember to push a button?? This one works just great. The alarm goes off, and as soon as she lifts it and takes the pills out, the alarm stops. It does not move to the next set ofnpills and open until the ext alarm goes off. Nothing for her to remember. It's great!",

She takes a phenomenal low number of scripts so I am able to use a single alarm/day. I fill it for a 28 day period and now am able to plan and enjoy my visits with her. This has changed both my life and our relationship!",

Amazon should definitely remove this from it's amazon's choice because the product is awful and now I'm out $160. In addition, the no returns policy should be clearly stated on the front page, just like brick and mortar stores have to.",
