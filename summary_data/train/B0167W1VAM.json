Wave had it just over one year, and the plastic case is breaking apart in several places. within a few months of owning it the frame around the display started to separate from the the display, and now the hinge is broken and the whole thing is coming apart (see photo) so it will have to be replaced. It is not used heavily, and it never leaves the house, so this is not from undue wear and tear; it is because the plastic construction of the case is cheap. One year is too short of a lifetime for a laptop.",

Plus the space bar sticks about a third of the time so I often have to go back and retype things. While these are issues I can work around for now, if it died tomorrow, I would not be replacing it with another Lenovo IdeaPad.",

      "text": "I did my research and this came recommended from several sources as one of the top budget laptops. While it worked, it was great - met all my expectations. No, you can't have tons of programs or internet tabs open at once, and at this price you shouldn't expect to. However, after less than 6 months it no longer turns on. This is outside of the 1 month return timeframe, so my next step will be to contact Lenovo to see if they can help. Will update my review when I hear back.",
