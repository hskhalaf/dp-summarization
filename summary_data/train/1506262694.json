This book is well organized with a great amount of information and practice for the SAT. Although she has not yet taken the exam, the book is helping her feel more comfortable as we get closer to that test date. The general test-taking hints are also useful for the ACT (which she has already taken). Considering the cost and importance of college-entrance exams, this book is well worth it. Recommended.

While videos are great for reinforcing concepts, this book tackles the style of questions the SAT presents to students. Half the book covers math, the remaining sections cover reading, writing & language, essay, and practice tests. i took photos of some pages, and the online website. the explanations were clear and concise.",

The book is HUGE but it is put together well and it's easy to go through it bit by bit. My son has started and does some every day. The online portion is fine. From what I understand, the more practice tests you can take, the better, so every little bit helps. His scores on practice tests are pretty good so far, so maybe it's helping. If you your school doesn't offer help, or you want more and can't afford private tutors or classes, this is a good option. It's also a good supplement.",

Obviously, the more practice you can do using the strategies learned is even better. This book is my son's additional practice.",
