They are the equivalent of brand name gloves costing twice a much. They stretch and conform to the hand well. They are not tacky, but allow for a tight and unyielding grip. They do not get tight and shrink up from moisture. There is an extra layer of leather in the heal of the palm, which helps prevent the gloves from wearing out too quickly. As long as this product is available, I wouldn't even consider buying another manufacturer's glove.",

I was worried when I first got the gloves the way the leather was stitched around the thumb and palm of the gloves, but they seem to hold just fine. I wear a large glove and most are tight on my hand this one was a little lose so they do tend to run a little big. The main thing was my racquet always felt firm in my hand and I didn't notice any slipping in my grip. I will probably buy 10 more at this price.",
