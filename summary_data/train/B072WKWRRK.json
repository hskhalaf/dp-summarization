Instead of being the best of both worlds it kind of sucks as both a neck strap and a case. So, I bought a harness and this case to go with my new Leica binoculars and it works perfectly. I love that the strap disconnects because I just use the harness straps on the binoculars and the case strap just gets in the way.",
