      "text": "The boots are really really nice looking in person. They are a lux, rich, deep black, the slouch is perfect especially around the ankle given that it\u2019s not baggy or sloppy/awkward looking at all. They feel true to size in terms of width and around the calf. But I will return them since they are pretty uncomfortable to walk in. I am comfortable walking in typically heel/pumps and heel boots but the angle the boot forces your foot into is too steep. Also, the heel is on the thinner spectrum (towards the base) and does not feel sturdy while walking. Shame!",

Like , ok, they don't fit this customer, let's rewrap and pass on to another who is her size and hope for the best. Even the insoles were used, like some one else tried them on. They were flapping like someone else struggled to get them off as well as trying to get them on! Sorry!!",
