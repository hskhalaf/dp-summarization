Every time. Battery life is a concern for some, but I've had zero trouble -- I think the trick is just making sure the deadbolt isn't touching the hole in the doorframe.",

The versatility is perfect for our household: use a key, use a code, use your phone to open the door. We've had this for about 8 months and it still works flawlessly. Apple TV or the similar Schlage component will make it operate best with Apple Home Kit.",

      "text": "Like many other reviews here, I can't get remote access to work at all using the Apple TV, and remote access is the main reason I purchased this. Additionally, the troubleshooting steps that Schlage support walked me through has caused ALL OF MY OTHER HOMEKIT DEVICES to also loose remote access (they were working fine before). Wish I just stuck with my zwave deadbolt... That had plenty of problems itself, but this is surprisingly worse, since it doesn't work at all remotely. Left 2 stars because the lock itself is nice. If they can manage to provide a more reliable remote access solution I will revisit this rating.",

This is very convenient as you can provide codes for individuals and allow them only certain days/times to have access to the house. Having your own unique code is great, this way you know who is going into and out of your house. Easy to set up! You can change access whenever you want on the app and you can even remotely into the lock to unlock it if there is a guest you don't want to have access. Great product!",

I landed on the Schlage Sense because of my positive experience with my other lock and having the keypad is built-in is some much more convenient.

Enter an access code on the touchscreen to unlock the door instead of searching your pockets for keys. Pair the lock with your smartphone over Bluetooth . Share access with trusted friends and family with just a few taps in the Schlage Sense app \u2013 no more keeping track of spare keys. The Schlage Sense lock is easy to install yourself in minutes. It\u2019s battery operated so there\u2019s no hardwiring required, and the lock will still accept access codes if the power goes out at home. Typical battery life with average use is about one year, and the low battery indicator reminds you weeks in advance to replace it. You can update the lock wirelessly through the app as new features are released, which means you never have to buy a new lock to take advantage of the latest capabilities. Add the Schlage Sense Wi-Fi Adapter (sold separately) to your home Wi-Fi network to lock/unlock from anywhere on Android smartphones, iPhone , iPad or iPod touch . Or, if you have an iPad /Apple TV connected to your home Wi-Fi network, you can control the lock from your iPhone as part of your HomeKit-enabled smart home.",
