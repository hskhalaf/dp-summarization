      "text": "Bought this for my kid for Christmas about 3 years ago and she still uses it whenever we go camping, vacation, visits, etc. Compact, convenient, hooks up easily to the computer and it is very attractive. As an adult, I would not mind carrying this around in my purse. The video quality and photos are not bad at all. We have compared identical shots taken with her camera and my more expensive (older too) camera and the colors seem more vibrant with her camera. Very pleased with this little camera and we paid a lot less back than what is advertised at now.",

      "text": "I admit this camera is cheap, small, portable, and relatively easy to use, but the quality of the photos are terrible. So terrible, that I bought a new camera and this one just sits in my room. That's how bad it is. It's such a waste of a $~70 camera. I didn't want to miss out on once-in-a-lifetime photos while I was in Europe, so I didn't even take this camera. It's not a 50/50 chance as one reviewer said. For me, it's a 95% chance that the photo will turn out terrible. I'm not willing to ruin great photo ops with a cheap, poor-performing camera. I wish I hadn't bought it.",

It takes the most grainy pictures I have ever seen on a digital camera and I have owned about 5 over the years. I thought technology was supposed to get better not worse? Don't pay attention to the megapixel claim it is just a marketing gimmick, my old 3.2 megapixel digital camera took better photos than this. I am returning to Amazon for a refund and I am going to buy her a better camera. I guess you get what you pay for.",

My daughters camera seems to be once in a while not want to go on so she has to close the lens for awhile again or push the battery in. I don't know if it's her or the camera yet. But it has been a great gift compared to junk that will get thrown out anyway. And now I get to be in the pictures!",

The actual product is more high quality in look and feel than the pictures give it justice (looks like a toy in the pictures) and the flip open lens cover to turn the unit on is a nice feature. The battery is also solid in terms of length of use and quickness to charge. Works seemlessly with Picasa too, which is nice. So far we are very happy with our purchase.",

On the battery, I've found that if you actually charge the battery like you're supposed to(charge it before your initial use, and only charge it when it needs to be charged), it lasts! I purchased an additional battery so I wouldn't be without one should the situation present itself, it was only $7 on Amazon.com !. Overall, great camera for a great price!",

But the pictures are clear, beautiful, crisp, and full of color.. A lot of people complain about the flash on this camera but the flash ALWAYS delivers whether in bright or low light settings. One of my favorite things about this fuji camera is that it gives the subject of the picture a GREAT skin tone.. I have had too many cameras make family pictures look too pink or yellow, this is just right. This is the second of the same camera I have owned.",

THE ONLY DOWNFALL IS THAT IT IS VERY SMALL, BUT IS SO SMALL THAT ITS CUTE AND MAKES IT DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE FROM THE OTHERS. I BUY ALOT OF AMAZON PRODUCTS AND THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I BOUGHT YET. GOOD LUCK I HOPE MY REVIEW HAS HELPED YOU. I FORGOT TO ALSO ADD THE SOFTWARE IS EASY TO INSTALL AND ITS EASY TO UNDERSTAND. GOOD LUCK GUYS I HOPE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT. :-)",

    "title": "Fujifilm FinePix Z30 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Pink)",
    "description": "Color:PinkFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nBoasting a high-resolution 2.7-inch LCD screen, the 10-megapixel FinePix Z30 has a Fujinon 3x optical zoom lens and is designed for ultra-portability, making this the ideal camera for the fashionista on-the-go. Like its predecessor, the Fujifilm Z20, the Fujifilm Z30 can Face it, Blog it and Roll it. Users can Face It with Fujifilm's innovative Face Detection Technology with Automatic Red Eye Removal for capturing the ultimate group shots; Blog it with the innovative Blog Mode, making it effortless for social-media-savvy users to post pictures and videos to personal profile pages, blogs and video sharing websites or simply to e-mail to friends; and Roll it with the Successive Movie mode that allows users to create 60 second movie clips. \n\nAutomatic Scene Recognition\nSR Auto (Automatic Scene Recognition) enables the FinePix Z30 to intelligently recognize six types of scenes automatically. For each picture taken in this mode, the Z30 will optimize the ideal exposure, focus, white balance and ISO for the scene to ensure the best quality picture is captured with ease. \n\nThe FinePix Z30 is also packed with the following features:\n\n * Natural Light & with Flash Mode: In this mode, the FinePix Z30 quickly shoots two images in succession -- one with and one without the flash -- saving both. This convenient function lets the user perform an on-the-spot picture comparison and decide whether the FinePix Z30fd produced the most pleasing photo with flash, or without. \n * Successive Movie Mode: In-camera editing allows for the creation of a 60-second movie clip, even when shooting in two or more scenes is desired. Start and restart multiple times to build a 60-second compilation, and edit the start and end points. \n * Dual Shutter Releases: One button for still capture, one for movie record, for ease of use. \n * Special Scene Modes: The FinePix Z30fd has 13 scene positions including Fireworks, Beach and Snow, offering a one-touch setting for almost any situation. \n * SD/SD-HC Compatible slot: A single media slot that accepts SD/SD-HC media cards. \n * Battery Life: Long-life rechargeable Li-ion battery.",
