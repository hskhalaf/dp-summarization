The other doggo snarfs this down like it's proverbial crack. Nice portion sizes for two dogs to share as a food topper.",

The first time I opened one of these pour overs he started going nuts!!! I've never seen him so motivated for mealtime! He now eats the whole meal in one go!! Amazing difference. He is only 7 lbs so I've been mixing about a tsp of topper into his kibble and that has been plenty, so one carton can last many meals. Also the packaging is quite clever and makes it easy to store for multiple days without mess. Needless to say we'll be buying more!",
