It\u2019s perfect for storing delicates and houseware. The package arrived with no damage and all the pieces were wrapped really well. I\u2019m happy to say there were no scratches or broken pieces. It took me a couple of hours to put this together on my own. I\u2019m not the best at assembling. If you live with someone, ask for help. The wood is heavy and the materials are sturdy so I took my time to screw ever piece together. But I\u2019m very happy with the end result.",

I built it myself at 9 months pregnant (was nesting hardcore and couldn't wait for husband to come home and help) and it took about an hour and a half. I like the height for using it as a changing table and the drawer size provides good storage. Would give it 5 stars but two of the drawers don't track perfectly because some of the holes for the tracks were slightly off. The drawers still close and it doesn't really bother me but it drives my husband crazy.",

I will say, though, it was a total hassle to put together with so many pieces and despite that fact that it looks nice it is pretty low quality furniture for the price. The matching changing table had a drawer front fall off and we had to fix it. I am giving this four stars because it does look nice and we will probably get another 2-3 years out of this piece of furniture. If this was a $99 piece of furniture it would have met all my expectations, but at twice it is a little lacking.",

Was a little hesitant to order unassembled furniture through Amazon, but I'll tell you they exceeded my expectations. Not only was the furniture well packed for shipping...... I was really impressed by the real wood quality and ease of assembly! I ordered the crib, dresser and changing table to make the set. This is defiantly higher quality furniture and with my help, very well put together;)",

I bought a DaVinci for the quality and instead I received something I could have bought at Walmart. Since, I procrastinated and the little one will be here in a week, we are just going to grin and bear it, just wanted to get our story out there.",
