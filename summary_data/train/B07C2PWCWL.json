      "text": "Haven't used in saltwater yet, but worked great for bass fishing. I don't have high expectations of corrosion resistance for the black oxide jaws. I purchased for hook removal and cutting braid. The braid cutters worked exceptionally well for the first trip out on the 65lb braid. The hinge is smooth and tight. The jaws line up with no odd gaps or any indications of poor quality. These will be great to keep in my tackle bag, will probably buy a nicer pair of Dancos later on down the road with a more solid clip on style holder.",

The 90 degree configuration of an Allen wrench would make it much easier. If I ever lost these pliers I would certainly not buy them again.",

They provide a good grip and don\u2019t let go. The line cutter easily slices through braid, mono, or flouro line. The clip and wound line are convenient to attach to a bungee on my kayak to remain within reach, and the cord has enough length to work with fish. I recommend this product.",

These are slim enough to grab the hooks on small fish when we are in the pond. And still useful for the bigger fish in the lake. I like the carbineer hook you can use it on belt loop so no dropping it in the water.",

I'm always looking for fishing gear that will simplify and expedite my time on the boat when I'm removing fish from a hook or working on getting baits back into the water. The Booms Fishing X1 Aluminum Fishing Pliers do just that. They're well built and are a good size. They're spring loaded to be open when you remove them from the included sheath which is nice. The attached lanyard is plenty long when fully extended and the crimper/wire cutter are an added bonus. I would highly recommend the pliers for fresh or salt water anglers.",

      "text": "These would be 5 star pliers if they had a lock to keep them closed OR they didn't have a spring that kept them wide open at rest. They are so wide open at rest that it takes two hands or some fumbling to get them closed. I was, with effort, able to remove the center screw and remove the keep-open spring. However the center screw is held on with lock-tight or some other glue and it is difficult to remove. So far so good with this modification, but I realize I may need to reapply lock-tight to keep it adjusted properly. Too bad Booms hasn't added the keep-closed lock that they had promised to their customers.",
