There have been zero splinters from any of them as read in some of the other reviews and the quality is beautiful. It arrives wrapped in heavy-duty plastic with nice packaging that clearly shows the manufacturer put thought into. We are very happy with these cutting boards and will continue to purchase them for our guests.",

This Ex-Large cutting board is perfect for chopping up Pork Shoulders or fine slicing steaks. He uses it at least once a week, usually more. He really likes the drain channel around the edges of the board. Sturdy enough to take weekly use, and cleans up easily. I am thinking about getting him another as he uses it as an appetizer sampler tray too.",

Easy to clean and maintain, it looks much better than the cheap plastic one it replaced and that's the idea; to have a cutting board that looks good so it can be left out on the counter at all times. My friend bought one of these for me over a year ago and I decided to get another for an opposite end of the counter. The two almost match precisely even though they are handcrafted! Absolutely perfect! Stop reading and pick this one up as you won't regret it!",

      "text": "This cutting board was bought before the holidays and it has done double duty through Thanksgiving and Christmas meals and parties. Its extra large size is perfect for prepping and serving. Easy clean up with hot soap and water. I don\u2019t put it in the dishwasher. Be sure an treat it with food grade mineral oil when you receive it and once a month after that. This cutting board will be a work horse in your kitchen for years to come.",
