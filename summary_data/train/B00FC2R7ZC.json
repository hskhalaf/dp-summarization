I was worried they would be too frail since I'm not very delicate with my headphones, but they've been holding extremely well! The ear padding doesn't give any problem and is comfortable enough. Quality wise the bass is a little shallow for my taste, but not that much to be a problem. I can't find a single defect to them.",

These squeeze my head to the point I have to take them off after 15 minutes! I bought these, hoping for basically, the CAL1 with an inline mic... Unfortunately, the mic is terrible (people can't hear me unless I lift it up to my mouth) and comfort level is atrocious. If you have/love the CAL1 and are looking for an \"upgrade\", I'd look elsewhere...or better yet, just buy another set of the originals :)",

    "description": "OVER-THE-EAR HEADSET WITH DETACHABLE CABLE AND INLINE MICROPHONE\nModeled after its award-winning predecessor, the Creative Aurvana Live!2 is designed to deliver true-to-life acoustic performance with tighter bass. The headset is powered by 40mm Bio-Cellulose drivers for impeccable audio while the earcups' premium protein faux leather cushions with memory-foam provide excellent seal against external noise. They also provide unmatched comfort for extended wear.\n\nExperience a true-to-life \naudio performance with tigher bass.\nView larger\nThe flat-fold earcups is ideal for audio monitoring and convenient storage. Bio-cellulose technology \nideal for headphone drivers.\nDesigned for comfort. PRECISE AUDIO PERFORMANCE\nConstructed with accurate 40mm Neodymium drivers with Bio-Cellulose diaphragm and meticulously tuned, Aurvana Live!2 delivers audio so authentic, it's as if you're in a live performance!\n\nLeveraging on cutting-edge biotechnology processes, a natural fiber (bio-cellulose) created by acetobacter (a type of acetic acid bacteria) is dehydrated and then compressed to a thickness of about 20 microns in a diaphragm die. In contrast to plant fiber cellulose, bacteria cellulose has extremely fine fiber and of higher purity.\n\nThe ultra-thin bio-cellulose diaphragm is ideal in the production of headphone drivers, as it is able to deliver the same sound velocity as an aluminum or titanium diaphragm along with the warm and delicate sound of paper diaphragms. The result is faithful, crystal clear and detailed highs, coupled with remarkable deep and rich bass tones \n\nCONVENIENT PLAYBACK AND CALLS\nThe headset uses a high-purity, tangle-free, flat audio cable with an inline microphone and a one-button remote with volume adjustment for hassle-free communication on your smartphone. The cable can be detached for storage or retrofitted with another cable of your choice.\n\nUNMATCHED COMFORT\nPadded with premium protein faux leather and memory-foam, the earcups provide you with unmatched comfort over extended periods of usage.\n\nSOPHISTICATED DESIGN\nAesthetic and lightweight, the Aurvana Live!2 is styled in two alluring color options and enforced with a metal alloy headband for added durability.\n\nTRAVEL READY\nThe flat-fold earcups is ideal for audio monitoring and convenient storage. A soft microfiber travel pouch is also included for portable convenience.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n * 1 pair of Creative Aurvana Live!2 headset\n * 1 detachable flat audio cable with inline microphone and a 1-button remote with volume adjustment, 2.5mm-to-3.5mm gold-plated 4-pole plug (1.2m)\n * Soft microfiber travel pouch",
