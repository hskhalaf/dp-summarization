      "text": "Seemed durable enough when we first started it. But after about 30 minutes of riding it on soft, dry grass, the chain kept falling off. Followed instructions to tighten, but it kept falling off. Tried to loosen the engine mount bolt to slide the motor back (per manual) but one of the bolts was so tight that it stripped. Every other bolt is placed in such a way that it\u2019s almost impossible to loosen cuz there\u2019s always metal in the way. I doubt any German engineers designed this bike. Gonna return it. Bike became un-rideable within 30 minutes with just a small 6 yr old riding it. Unacceptable. I\u2019ll pay a bit more and buy a Honda next time",

The Governor screw is welded on. After cutting that off, it's so fast. I can't even describe how much fun I'm having on it. The BEST thing about this little bike is that it starts on the first pull every single time! It's also very quiet when it's just sitting there and running, not moving. Very fast, very powerful little engine. Best money I've ever spent. Can't recommend it enough.",

Kids and grand kids rode it all afternoon with no problems what so ever. It says it is recommended for up to 150 lbs and I would agree with that. Anyone heavier would be a strain on it. Overall it is exactly what I expected and would recommend it!!",
