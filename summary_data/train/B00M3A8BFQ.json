I prefer a smooth, chocolatey flavor profile for my coffee and espresso so this blend definitely hits the mark. It's smooth, sweet, and full bodied. It does lose a little bit of the body once you add milk, but most people won't notice. Really good \"starter\" espresso for those who are trying to get into it. Easy to drink and not super complex in terms of identifying all the different notes/aromas. Crema is also really good for these beans! I haven't tried any Lavazza roasts, but we tried Stumptown, Kean Coffee, Intelligencia, and death wish before settling on Wild Jo.",

The grounds cold brew, french press, and aeropress very well but I loved it in the form of cold brew and will keep buying it for that purpose.

I had bought a bag and loved it, then had bought a different coffee (not Jo) and just wanted to use it up fast so I could then re-order this Jo coffee again which I did. There's something different about it, and whatever they do definitely creates a distinctive taste. I prefer to buy organic whenever I can, and between the taste and that this is organic, it has everything I'm looking for in a coffee.",

I am not a coffee connoisseur, so my tastes fall into categories of \"would buy again\" and \"would not buy again.\" This is the latter. It's not a bad coffee, but if you're looking for something with a fuller body, you might want to look elsewhere.",
