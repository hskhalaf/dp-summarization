I do love the concept however.",

This camera does take decent pictures in daylight but, it's very slow capturing images. It doesn't catch up to the subject, lags. I wanted this attachment to be better than my cell phone's camera but, since it's too slow, didn't work out for me. Also it cropped my pics when I tried to share it on media, very strange and disappointed.",

And although the pictures are high quality, I cannot take pictures of things in motion. Stand stills/landscape/portraits are great but any motion and it's a blur. I can take 10 pictures and it zaps 1/2 of my battery. I would not recommend this because it's so expensive for a not so great product. I would hold out for something better.",
