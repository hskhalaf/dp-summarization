They said that I could fix it myself or take it NC to be fixed. I live in Norfolk Virginia. Other than that they would not do anything for me. I took it apart and found that the pin pointed to in the picture had fallen out. I put the pin back in the slot and put the auger back together three times before I got the Auger to work. I don't know how long it will work before the pin falls out again. DON'T BUY THIS AUGER!!",

We live on an 80 acre place and post holes come up often, as we are always repairing, or adding to. It has handled every hole with ease. One small drawback is that it will only drill to about 26-28 inches. It would be nice if it went a little deeper.",
