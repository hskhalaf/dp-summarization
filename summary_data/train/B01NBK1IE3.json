Beautifully made, I really like how the wind proofing has been done, there is a mesh to hold the crown flaps in place, one of the problems with the flaps is that when the wind lifts the flaps rain pours in, with the mesh it prevents that from happening! Great design from Procella. I look forward to many years of service from my new umbrella!",

If you had a slight figure I could see you getting literally carried away when deployed in a storm with strong winds. It's not going to turn inside-out like a lot of cheaper options, but that doesn't mean it's not going to try and take off if offered the chance to do so!",

I had a small umbrella that only cost me $5, but apparently it was made with poor material. The wind wreaked havoc on it and only lasted a couple of months. Procella's design aides in mitigating the negative effect of wind and is of solid construction. Great price for a great product. Also, it fits perfect in my golf bag and on my push cart.",
