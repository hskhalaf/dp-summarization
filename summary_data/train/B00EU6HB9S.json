Also it needed cleaning after every shower or two because the holes are pretty small, which they have to be for it to work. But if you skipped cleaning it for a couple showers the water stopped draining. Even clean it slowed the drainage a lot. I think my drains will just keep getting hairy, not sure what the answer is.",

The narrow rubber edge keeps it in place and makes it take up less visual space than the usual shower drain covers with tabs to hold them in. My American Standard bathroom sink has an irritating fancy mechanism to operate the stopper which frequently fails and also requires so much work to remove that grunge builds up. Removing the stopper and replacing it with this Oxo cover gives us more protection from losing things dropped in the sink and it\u2019s far easier to clean the usual yuck quickly before it reaches nasty slime stage.

You can also turn it over so the curve faces down to get it to not shift, but then some of the holes may be covered. Either way - if your tub is like mine, you should get this one.",

      "text": "How much can one say about a bathtub drain protector? Well, I'll just say that I used to use the round plastic type that goes partially down into the drain which worked pretty well, but I was always replacing them because they'd get so discolored that I'd use a little vinegar or bleach to clean them and then they'd begin to break down. This one eliminates all of that. It's perfect. Catches all the hair and easy to clean -- just wipe the hair away with a tissue or your fingers. Just the right size. Stays put. Looks good.",

I do have to make sure that it is covering my drain after I have the spigot on before pulling the shower on. The pressure of the water from the spigot sometimes move the cover out of position, but this is a really minor and infrequent occurrence. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.",
