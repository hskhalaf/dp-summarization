      "text": "I had this vacuum from 1/2017 - 9/2019. While it worked it had great suction and worked great on wood floors. When it came to rugs it had too much suction and would suck the rugs up. The wand hose was kind of difficult to maneuver. Overall I really liked this vacuum because it had great suction to get dog hair and dirt off the wood floors. I previously had a shark that wouldn\u2019t even suck hair off the floor. But the downside is it lasted 2 years and randomly broke and a vacuum this expensive should definitely have more life in it than that!",

The hardwood floor sweeper attachment pulls dirt from under the edges of trim very well, and is more maneuverable than the vacuum. It has replaced our broom for sweeping.",
