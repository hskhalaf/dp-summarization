I like both, price unmatchable, you get two pieces for the price of one, durable material. Very satisfied with purchase :)",

They smaller one is nice for a lunch. If you plan on carrying more than a drink and a bento box, the big one is a great size. If you're looking for a nice, useful lunch bag, you can't go wrong with this set. It came quickly and is very sturdy.",

The large pink bag is just a little bigger than the small black bag. I don't want to say that this was intended to be sexist, but it was a disappointment.

      "text": "Great price for 2 bags, and I love the neutral design and quality of the bags. The smaller bag has enough room to pack 1 meal and some snack items like fruits and veggies. Fiance uses the larger bag and can even fit his 24 oz water bottle in it. You will need to use ice packs if you want food to stay cold, but that's not a problem for me because I just put it in the fridge right away. I would definitely buy another.",

The small bag fits my apple, oranges, banana, vitamins, protein bar, and room for extra perfectly. From the fridge to the bag, my apple stayed cool about 6 hours on my desk.
