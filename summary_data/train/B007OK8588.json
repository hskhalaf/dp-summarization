      "text": "This is the third carrier I've had now and my favorite by far. My last purchase ended up being very bulky, and in spite of its ample storage, was really hard to move around. The CaddyDaddy is really well formed so that the clubs are in there tight, but the bag moves well on the wheels. I really like this bag, it's been great for my ample travels and no issues with clubs bending or breaking. I did take the extra step of buying the stiff-arm protector, also offered on Amazon, to give that top, umbrella-like protection.",

I researched a few different bags on Amazon before I made my purchase and I am very pleased that I chose this particular bag. Highly recommend!",

Its been awesome not having to take a carry on, versus having a group D or E boarding group then only to find no room for my damn carry on cause no one wants to pay luggage fees! Often the \"oversize\" bags are also the first bags out!",
