Sure the product could come laminated, but that may raise the cost, and then people would complain about that or complain that the lamination makes the edges to sharp. The complaint about having more than one card to show is just extremely picky and easily solvable. Just use a paper clip to hold sunny over dentist appt with the dentist appt title showing over the top edge of sunny. I appreciate this well-done excellent home school product because I have bought my fair share of junk home school products.",

In addition to the date and month cards, there a lots of cards for specific holidays, plus extra cards for birthdays and field trips. Many holidays are included such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Day, Kwanzaa, and Diwali. The pocket chart is sturdy and just as pictured. Since the cards are made of card stock, I might laminate them for added durability.",

This chart does not include yesterday, today or tomorrow cards but the price difference for charts that include them is a lot more. You can simply type up the words, print them out on card stock and cut them to size. It takes about 5 minutes and saves money. I would definitely recommend this product.",
