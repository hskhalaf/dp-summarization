Overall Id buy it again and recommend to a friend!",

Should have just driven down the road and pulled a fully assembled bike of the rack. The chain rusted after just a couple months too.",

Unfortunately it was a birthday and returning the item after it was mostly assembled and telling your eight year old that you can't use your favorite present wasn't something I was going to do. Took petals off a old micro bike... Birthday saved.. Item half delivered...",
