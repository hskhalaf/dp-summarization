      "text": "These are the best gloves I've ever used and I've been through my fair share. I liked my first order so much I again ordered five pair. I've been an electrical contractor, carpenter, and landscaper for over 38 years. I've used these gloves while working in crawl spaces, attics, and while handling course, sharp rock for a day. These gloves are robust! Just so you know, a fantastic additional feature is that the fingertips are intentionally slightly slit so when you wash them the water drains from the tips, thus the gloves quickly dry. The price per pair is excellent. I give these gloves my highest recommendation. Keep up the great work, Vgo!",

That being said, I've been using these gloves for about a year now, and must say they are great. I'm an electrician and usually work on live circuits, they may not be approved for this kind of service but they've never failed me. One pair usually give me 4 to 6 weeks of protection, depending on the work being done. These gloves literally saved my life in an accident involving two lids and 480V AC. I recommend these gloves to anyone in the trades.",

Can't go wrong with these. They are a little tight brand new. After a few hours of riding that works itself out. The protection offered withn these are just as good as anything I saw trying to compare with name brand riding gloves advertised as Motorcycle gloves. 5 pair for the price of one, don't let that stop you.",
