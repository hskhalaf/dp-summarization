I opened one up and \u201clined\u201d the brew part of the Oxo with it ... Then I added my course ground decaf coffee and cold water. Problem solved. A day later I opened the small Oxo filter so it could drain and the brewbag kept all the grounds from clogging up the filter. It drained quickly and completely. I emptied the cotton bag into my compost and sprayed it clean in my kitchen sink. Yey!",

You can customize the coffee by adding more or less grounds/water as well as vanilla, cinnamon, Coacoa, etc.. for a personal, original flavor. One of my favorite aspects of this maker is it makes concentrate, unlike many cold brew makers that just make ready to drink coffee. This means you get more coffee for your time, and you can use concentrate in a wider variety of personalized coffee drinks. The only thing I could say that is a drawback is it DOES use a 16oz bag of coffee to make about 24-30oz of cold brew. It\u2019s a high disproportion compared to the normal hot drip coffee user.",

Just make sure the coffee was roasted/grounded for at least a week, otherwise the coffee will taste sour. We use the whole food brand dark roast decaff which uses the swiss water process and grind it on coarse grain at the store. ~10-12oz coffee grounds and ~40oz of water. We slowly pour a little over 8oz first, then let it sit for a few minutes, and then pour the rest (32oz) slowly. If the water is poured too fast, all the coffee grounds will float to the top, if poured slowly, it will still float, but it doesn't look as dense as when poured fast.",

When I wake up Monday I drain it into the carafe/beaker thingy, and bam I have coffee for the whole work week! It's great for those hot Louisiana Summers, Springs, Falls AND WINTERS! Why is it always hot and humid here...WHY!?! Note: It is pretty tall, and I brew it in the fridge. I had to lower one of the shelves and shuffle things around, but the fam was happy to adjust, as the coffee keeps me a calm and cool Bruce Banner. You won't like me without coffee!",

I would still recommend they change the design or material for the carafe, as it is clearly an issue.",

Plus the concentrate created from the cold-brew process stays fresh longer than regular coffee.\n\nThe OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker brings the cold-brew process to your kitchen, offering smooth, low-acid coffee without a trip to the cafe. Just add coffee grounds to the Brewing Container and fill the Rainmaker top with water. The Rainmaker ensures that water is distributed evenly over the coffee grounds. Let the mixture steep for 12 - 24 hours. When you\u2019re ready to enjoy, the Brew-Release Switch allows for easy control of the draining process. The stainless steel ultra-fine mesh filter can be removed for quick cleanup.\n\nOnce the concentrate is prepared, mix with ice and water for iced coffee or hot water for hot coffee. Milk can also be added. Tea-lover? The OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker will steep and strain your favorite tea into sealable, glass carafe.\n\nFor best results, use coarse ground coffee.
