That\u2019s right, I can actually sleep in them comfortably! These are the only rollers I have been able to use over night. In the morning, I simply take them out, finger through the curls (I do this while my head is upside down) and use hair spray. The result is amazing- just like using a 2 inch barrel with even more added volume. Would recommend!!",
