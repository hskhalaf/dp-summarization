My biggest complaint is that even in locked mode, the chair creeps down. I tighten it as much as it goes but it never stays put. In addition, other chairs recline easily as soon as you push back. This one does not. You have to keep one foot on the ground and push off. So if you\u2019re short, good luck. My feet also hang off the bar. Totally uncomfortable. So if you\u2019re 5\u20199\u201d and above, good luck.",

The material and eyelids started coming apart, and the crods holding it all together broke on one chair. So if you're looking for a cheap chair that gets one Summer's use this is the chair for you.

It can only be used as a recliner with the footrest raised. Even then it has an unnatural feel. Very disappointing. I have sat in other brands and didn't realize there could be this MUCH difference. The fabric and metal is good quality but it is poorly designed. Do not recommend. Spend a few pennies more for a quality chair/recliner.",
