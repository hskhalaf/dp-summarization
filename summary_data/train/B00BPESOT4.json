      "text": "What can I say... Gerber rice cereal, you are a life saver! My pediatrician recommended adding 1/2 tablespoon of this cereal to my baby's bottle when she was 3 months because she wouldn't sleep. Back then she was already drinking 4-6oz of formula and was still always hungry and fussy. And, pediatrician did not want me to give her more milk since she was so small, so recommended this cereal. Well, she is now 9 months and has been sleeping through the night ever since! Now, I add 1 tablespoon of this cereal to her 6oz of formula and she loves it! Since many of you are asking about expiration dates. I purchased on 2/2015 and they expire 4/2016.",

A month later I purchased a box of 6 from amazon.com and I got a product with expiration date of May 2017. It is not expired but it is not as fresh as the one from my local store.",
