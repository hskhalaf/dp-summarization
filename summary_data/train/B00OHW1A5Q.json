So far she's gotten quite a few compliments and I also got some kudos for giving such a fantastic gift. I was a little worried that these were knockoffs but read a lot of reviews and was confident that I was purchasing legit product. It comes with an authenticity card, which can also be plagiarized, but the craftsmanship and the material used was all I needed to see to be comfortable. And of course, purchasing these glasses on Amazon saved me a bunch of money as opposed to buying it at a retail store. Highly recommended!",

These are authentic & brand new! I would recommend these sunglasses and this seller to anyone looking for designer merchandise at very reasonable prices.

Or, I might install a more permanent set like the other reviewer mentioned doing. Heck these guys were half the cost of retail, so it ain't no big thang.",

      "text": "Absolutely BEAUTIFUL sunglasses--such a classy cut. Just wish they fit my Asian nose bridge better--they stay on when I'm upright, but fall off easily when I bend my head, neck or body towards the ground. The frames are a little wider than most other frames, which is great for me because I do have a wider face, and the outside tips do point upward, covering a bit of my eyebrows but nonetheless achieving a very classy look. The side handles are thicker than most other sunglasses. Unfortunately, these glasses also do not stay put when I put them on my head--they slide off easily.",
