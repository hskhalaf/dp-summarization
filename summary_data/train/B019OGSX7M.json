One was very full and great, the 2nd was a little less full but still great, but the 3rd is only 1/2 the size of the others with the filling inside. I'm surprised. I'm just having a hard time figuring out how to get hold of the seller to say \"I don't want to send it back, I'd just like to purchase more stuffing for the 3rd chair.

I have no idea how I'm going to return this thing now that it's all puffed up, but I will have to figure something out.

After finally getting it broken up I realized that there is a at most 2/3 of the amount of foam actually needed for this to act as a functional beanbag. The shell material is comfortable but it needs way more foam inside the bag, and you can feel all the little individual pieces when you Do sit in it. If your goal is to find a confortable beanbag to relax in I highly suggest you find an actual beanbag and not this product. It's just not worth the money.",

I really like the chair but cannot use if it makes my whole room smell that way. It also seems to be causing my allergies to flare up.",
