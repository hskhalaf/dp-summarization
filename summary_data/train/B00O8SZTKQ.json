Unfortunately, the next morning after getting fish, I found one dead from being \u2018sucked in\u2019 by the filter. I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting this, I mean, it\u2019s a fish tank with a filter, shouldn\u2019t it be able to filter the water at a reasonable level without killing fish? After seeing the dead fish, I looked at other reviews/questions and found I wasn\u2019t alone. Now I\u2019m trying to figure out what to do, has anyone found a fix for the filter to tame the suction?",

This might be a simple fix, but now my setup time and chemicals are wasted. I'll have to go buy some sealant, wait for it to cure, refill it, hope it doesn't still leak, and wait another 24 hours before I can add some fish.

It is a small tank, even though tall, so you can't put a lot of fish in it. It would be a great Betta tank, but not for anything bigger, maybe a gold fish.

Just run a razor down the sealant on both sides and the bottom, then tear it out. Then take a flat scraper and clean the rest off. I highly suggest this right from the get-go. It is on the inside so doing so it doesn\u2019t risk damaging the structural integrity.",
