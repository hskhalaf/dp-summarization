But I thought I would post this to help someone looking to buy. My daughter is 5\u20193\u201d and weighs 240 and she got XL! It fits perfectly! We are so exited to see if this enhances our workouts!!! Oh and and another benefit for me is it makes my body appear shapely. So I feel okay wearing it out in public. I\u2019m very self conscious. Once I find out from the seller if my fit is okay I\u2019ll post pics for everyone that needs them.",

I do sweat a lot more than I used to and I really feel like I am getting a good work out. The suit is snug and adds a little bit of resistance which I like too. I wear some compression shorts and shirt underneath so I don't have to wash it as often. The instructions say to hand wash, which means I basically just rinse it down and use a little soap on the armpits, etc. I really am glad I bought this suit. Hope this review helps.",

This suit beats the pants off of your normal trash bag get-up. I agree on ordering a size or possibly 2 above what your normally wear. Just by doing a brisk walk (3.5-4.0 mph) at a steep incline (10-12%) on the treadmill you will sweat and sweat! Its absolutely awesome, and I feel great afterwords.

I was afraid a small wouldn't fit, but the mediums a bit big. The swish sound when you walk isn't bad and I wear my suit to the gym all the time. I love the way I feel after a workout. I also have serious back/leg injury issues (from long, long ago and recurrent) and this suit really seems to help my back. I highly recommend and someday want to get the small for a tighter fit. Great buy. No regrets.",

I like this effect because I'm taking fresh water in, while eliminating toxins and old water weight that has been stored in my core. I highly recommend this suit to anyone who wants to have a significant impact on their workout routine, without a significant change or extension of time and effort. I'll be ordering one for my wife.

I feel it should have been cut a little lower but I just fold it in and can work out normally. I am doing weight training and spinning and the suit does not bother me at all. It is surprising that it does not smell bad after all that sweat. Overall, an amazing buy.",
