      "text": "I needed a 1/2\" shank router motor to dedicate for a particular panel bit for long term repeatable cuts. This was a perfect find, in fact this cost me 30% of what the router bit cost. It has a strong smooth running motor which seems to be working well for my stationary panel cutting unit. Much cheaper alternative than buying a pre-made shaper unit.",

I also like the way it ramps up to speed. The chuck lock is a great feature too and it keeps you from having to juggle two wrenches when changing the bit. I've not had any issues with the depth adjustment moving--it's as solid as can be--but I don't ever use it with a table.",

This router will handle 1/2\" cutters but has a maximum speed of 25,000 rpm. Many 1/2\" shank cutters are limited to much lower speeds. Because, like many larger routers, it has \"soft start\" technology, it will NOT work with most variable speed router control boxes. This potentially limits its usefulness for larger 1/2\" shank cutters.",
