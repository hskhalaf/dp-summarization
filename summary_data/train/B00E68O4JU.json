My friend told me about the tangling issues so i made sure to fine tooth comb through hair to get all knots out before doing a new section, and not too much hair per section so that might have helped, also my hair is a shoulder lengh i think that helps too.

I mainly use it after my hair is dry and it holds the curl for several days, it does loosen over that time but it's still curly.

I would return this product but do not want to pay the high shipping charges. Warning to all out there, DO NOT EXPECT RESULTS with any of the settings.",

I curled my hair during the day, wore it all day, went to bed, and woke up with the curls still holding. I didn't use any hairspray or products before of after curling.

      "text": "I can not say enough wonderful things about this curling tool!!!!! This will make your hair 10X nicer than what they can do in a salon. It's worth every penny! A lot of people say it damaged their hair..it never damaged mine. You really have to be patient and take the time to learn how to use it. It's time consuming to do your hair, you must curl small, thin pieces of hair at a time but its worth it b/c it will last daysssss! I don't go to the salon anymore b/c they can't achieve what this tool can! It won't last forever, this is my second one. The first one lasted about a year. Highly recommend!",

Second, IT WORKS! :) I have long thick hair down near my mid-back. If you follow the directions you'll have no problem! I did 1/2inch thick strips of my hair and it worked great! I tried a little more and it did tangle, but it has a de-tangle feature where it BEEP BEEP BEEPs at you and essentially tells you \"try again stupid\". Would recommend to anyone who wants to curl their hair super-easy. It's gonna be a little time consuming but worth it for the beautiful curls you'll get!",
