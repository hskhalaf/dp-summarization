      "text": "What an awesome pair of boots. I was really impressed with them, good for the Winter in The North Country. I have heard of Skechers before long time ago, now that I have them they look stunning. And even the laces are all alignment up too. I like the industrial grey to that as well. They have a nice feeling when I walk in them around the house to try out, because there's just no snow and ice just yet. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d",

These would be good for recreational use but seeing as they upped the price by $35 since I purchased them, Ill try another boot this time around.",

It did rub against my right big toe pretty bad, causing it to blister, but it calised up and now it's unnoticeable. I do dumb things at work like drag empty pallets around with my feet and it destroyed my last pair of shoes, but these don't show any damage so far besides some paint from the pallets getting onto the front of the shoes.

I\u2019m a landscaper and they are my go to boots. The one thing I don\u2019t like is how close the hooks are for the shoe laces. Sometimes I have trouble tying them. The laces broke after a few months of use.",
