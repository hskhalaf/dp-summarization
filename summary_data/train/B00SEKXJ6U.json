If you are on a capped plan or pay more at a certain bandwidth point, this camera is wasting a large amount of bandwidth for no reason.

      "text": "Followed instructions exactly. My phone never could establish a stable wifi connection; it repeatedly cycled though stages of connecting/connected/noIP/etc. I even tried to connect to the device from my Mac and, again, it could never establish a stable signal. Tried calling their tech support number but, even though I called during the support hours on their website and waited 40 minutes, no one ever picked up after being deposited in the \"wait for an agent\" queue. The FAQs on their website cover nothing related to this symptom so, presumably, it was defective. (Yes, I even reset the unit four times using the instructions in the FAQs.) RMA'd back to Amazon.",
