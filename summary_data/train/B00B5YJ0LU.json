I often buy fish and chips made from pollack, so I expected Grizzly's pollack oil to have a mild odor of fresh fish and to have acceptable taste. To give the company the benefit of the doubt, the container I received was rancid. The odor was awful, completely unlike the salmon oil I had purchased in the past from the same company. My dog would not eat if I put this pollack oil on his kibble. I can't blame him, this oil stank. I had to discard the container. I can't recommend this product at all.",

I will definitely keep using Grizzly Pollock oil as it is easy to dispense, readily accepted by all of my pets, does not have a strong odor and is very economical.

I stopped product immediately but my older dog was so sick that after a couple days had to bring her to Vet. $500 of blood tests & medications later the Vet confirmed that it was from this product and no other cause. I called company and just got a \"sorry return the product to Amazon\" which is really disappointing considering how much $$ I had to shell out to get my dog's gut back into order. Also, neither of my dogs are allergic to fish - they've been allergy tested and both consume fish on a regular basis. So beware!!",

We stopped that and just added the oil directly onto their kibble, stir it up, and they are eager to eat.

The eight year old one has problems with allergies and a sensitive stomach. This fish oil supplement really helps her with her allergy related dry skin. We just add this supplement to their food and they just eat it. The bottle has a very easy to use dispenser. Which makes it easy for us to dosage how much we want to give them. The price is very fair and it lasts us a long time.",

She can't believe the change in him. They don't mind the flavor either. They get it with breakfast (mix dry and a little wet). No issues only positive reaction to the oil.

I gave it four stars because I am not sure if it's \"working,\" but knew that the pug needed some omega oils to supplement his raw food diet. I also add a powdered plant enzyme and probiotic. I believe this helps with skin and joints. I feed my dog raw meats that are formulated for dogs (Vital Essentials Turkey).",
