Totally bummed out since the construction of it is actually pretty smart with a magnifying glass that flips over to let bugs in and out and let you get an up close view of the bug inside.",

For being a kids toy, it is successful about 70% of the time for capturing the beetles off my plants. It hasn't worked well for flies. I imagine that it would work for a spider. As for kids toy entertainment, my son thinks it is fun to use. If you are concerned about the well being of a bug or insect, injury could happen to the bug or insect. A few beetles lost legs.",

Otherwise no complaints here! Even comes with a magnify glass so you can see just how horrific these creatures are that live in your house. Lesson learned - dont stand UNDERNEATH whatever you're trying to vacuum because if you miss, guess where they're landing.",

I took the batteries out it came with and replaced them with new ones and still nothing. My son is devastated on Christmas. Do not buy this mess. I give this zero stars. They made me give it one in orders to post! But I don\u2019t mean it!!!!",
