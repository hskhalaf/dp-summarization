      "text": "Although the resident evil series has started to go away from these action-oriented episodes, we have really enjoyed RE5 and RE6 as fun cooperative games to play on the couch together or online. The characters have a little nuance in their primary weapons and melee attacks, but generally play similarly enough to keep the learning curve very minimal. Levels can be a little long, but are very fun to re-play with lots of enemies and collectible items. LOTS of content as there are 3 full story modes (maybe 8h apiece, I believe), 2 of which are re-playable with a different character. I really can't recommend the game enough.",

Of course it's different from the original, but that doesn't mean it's not a fun game!",
