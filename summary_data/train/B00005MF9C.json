And Two: to put water in the reservoir, you need to be left-handed, as you cannot see what you're pouring if right-handed. Back to Bella.",

      "text": "I really like this coffee maker. It makes the coffee quickly and the cup is a nice size. The one drawback is that it does not keep the coffee hot like you would expect from a stainless steel cup. That is because it is only stainless steel on the outside. The inside is that hard black plastic you see around the lip and the handle of the cup. I like that the coffee is made directly into the cup instead of into a small pot. Also, the filter is reusable. If you want the cup for on the go, not the best choice.",

I find my leftover K cups hold just the right amount of coffee, so am using them up. Just dump the contents into the basket. When I have used them all, it will be nice to get away from that expense and go back to a big can of Folgers again. All in all, I am very pleased with the change.",

      "text": "I've been waiting a while to write this review because I'm honestly torn on whether or not I think this was a good purchase. on one hand, it was $15 and came with a mug, so what can I really expect? On the other hand, it just barely works well enough for me to keep using it and not buy something else. It won't utilize all the water i put in the reservoir, making me have to run the cycle twice, more often than not, to fill up my cup. Overall, I would only recommend buying this if you are on an extreme budget. I'm sure there are better coffee makers out there, if you do your research.",

Wet the filters before using, otherwise you notice significantly less coffee than water you put in. It keeps the brewer clean, no messiness at all. and no washing needed - pick up the filters and dump them. Although I do try to wash it every week.",

Your coffee brews directly into a 15-oz. stainless steel thermal mug that fits most car cup holders. The permanent grounds filter is compatible with coffee grounds and pre-packaged soft pods, and it's easy to rinse clean in the sink. One-touch operation quickly delivers the morning coffee you need, with a compact design that's perfect for small kitchens, apartments, and dorm rooms.\n\nBlack+Decker and the Black+Decker logo are trademarks of The Black & Decker Corporation and are used under license. \n*Cup equals approximately 5 oz. (varies by brewing technique)\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\nGreat for commuters, office professionals, and one-coffee-drinker households, this personal coffeemaker brews 15 ounces of coffee directly into a stainless-steel travel mug. The mug has a rubber handle for a safe grip and a lid to keep coffee hot. It's tapered to a 2-1/2-inch-diameter bottom, so it fits most vehicle cup holders. The coffeemaker itself is designed for an on-the-go coffee drinker. It has a permanent filter--no messy disposable paper filters required--and shuts off automatically after brewing. The mug, filter, filter basket, and mug lid are dishwasher-safe, and the coffeemaker can also be used to heat water for tea, hot chocolate, and instant foods like oatmeal and soup. Made of gleaming black plastic, it measures 9-3/4 inches high, 7 inches wide, and 6 inches deep, and carries a one-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack Troubleshooting Steps: Brewing Coffee \u2013 1.) Lift the one-piece cover. Pour one full mug of cold water into the water reservoir. 2.) Place the permanent filter into the filter basket. Add ground coffee, (we recommend approximately 2 \u00bd tablespoons). Close the cover. 3.) Remove the lid from the travel mug and add sweetener, cream or milk to the mug before brewing; replace the lid. Place the mug on the mug rest directly under the filter basket opening. 4.) Press the power switch and the power indicator light will illuminate. The coffeemaker and power indicator light turn off automatically when brewing is done. Allow the coffee to finish dripping from the unit before removing your travel mug. Note: There will be slightly less coffee in your travel mug than the amount of water added, as the grounds absorb some of the liquid.",
