I tossed them in a load of older towels, a bit scratchy and rough and the towels came out of the dryer so much softer and nice to the touch. I like the option to add essential oils but appreciate the fact that they are chemical free and safe to use on the new grandson's clothes and bedding. Thanks for a great natural product!",
