Then they wake up and eat this and watch Netflix with me. So fierce. Highly recommend for your fierce little home predator.",

My only complaint - and maybe this is odd - is that my cat seems to have a dirty, gross butt while she's on this food. I'm assuming her waste is a little more loose, as it gets caught in the fur, and when she sits on something after using the litter box it leaves a gross little splooch, like the most horrible lipstick mark in the world.

When i switched to this food a few years ago, I got samples of all the different types of natural food for my cat, laid out small amounts in bowls and monitored which ones she liked best. I then kept whittling down which samples I set out (halving each time, main sure to keep ones she was actually trying) until this one was the clear winner. Ordering online is great because it's a heavy bag and shows up at my door--and it's a good price.",

I was looking for a food that contained l-lysine for my one cat that has had chronic herpes since birth. I found one that contained a high quantity of it, so I switched brands. But as far as TOTW, it had great taste appeal, they all loved it, and was easily digested. No more regurgitations than usual. I have 5 cats. The one with the chronic skin condition showed no improvement, FYI. Wouldn't have changed, but the doctor recommended the l-lysine. In in addition, will get a lysine supplement as well for the herpes.",

When our vet said our cats were over-weight, and the oldest cat needed lower protein for its kidney health, we tried their cat food. (We selected this one because it had the lowest protein of all their flavors.) We have three cats, varying ages, and they have been on this ever since (2+ years now). Without the junk-food grain fillers, their weights have dropped. Best of all, our oldest cat no longer had any old-age/kidney-related issues for over two years.",
