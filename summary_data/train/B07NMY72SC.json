Honestly, I am highly disappointed, it is in black and white, children are stimulated by the gaiety of color. The navigation is a joke. Amazon/Kindle, you could have done better than this! The concept of JUST an e-reader is great but you all need to go back to the drawing board on this one. By the way, this is my 4th Kindle so my expectations were very high. Come on, Amazon you know better!",

For chapter books, its great, but for illustrated books, they display both pages on a small portion of the already tiny screen, and we can't even read the words. It's quite ridiculous. You can't rotate them horizontally either. Other than that, its wonderful. Every kid should have one.",

The Fire tablet is even worse - full of garbage apps, sluggish and difficult to navigate, poor battery life. Kids need the full color and size of a real book.
