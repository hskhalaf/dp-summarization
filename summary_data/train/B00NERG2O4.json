For me the result is constantly raising my head to reshape the pillow. Over months this led to serious neck pain. Adjusting my review to three stars because to be fair the pillow is one year old. Also it is probably the best CPAP pillow out there. But it's the best of a bunch of pillow that don't work well - so that's not saying much.",

I still need to experiment with the filling level, but after taking about half of it out, it is definitely easier to side sleep with the CPAP and tolerable to sleep on my stomach. This pillow allows you to distribute the filling to make it highly customizable, and this feature makes it much easier to use non-back positions with the CPAP. Although initially it feels stiffer than normal pillows, this did not bother me and it feels like my neck is maintained in great alignment.",

It's really easy to adjust to the exact right position and supports your head and neck really well. I just push down a little bit where my mask is and there is no pressure on the mask at all.

With this pillow, I never did fall asleep. After 20 minutes, my CPAP ramped up, and I've never been able to fall asleep when the pressure is up ... only early on, when the pressure is low. I'm giving 2 stars for the service and quality of build - no stars for performance.",

With this pillow, I 'm down to .6 apneas per hour for the past 12 days....I just had my first 0 apneas for the entire night. Nothing else has changed in my life. For some reason when I lay on my side, I stay put with this pillow. Please be advised that I am not saying that it will work for everyone.....but it has worked for me.",

You can make it support your head at a higher or lower level just my moving the stuff inside around. You can adjust your head level a small amount easily. This pillow cured a chronic sore neck. You can adjust the thickness of the pillow a large amount by unzipping and removing or adding the material inside. The pillow comes with plenty of materiaI. I would recommend this pillow to anyone even if they do not do CPAP. I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

This pillow allows you to configure the profile of your pillow precisely by moving the material inside around. The material stays in place once you move it. This provides the benefits of a firm pillow but the comfort of a soft pillow because you create the exact profile that best fits your head. Delivery was quick. Instructions were very helpful. All in all, great buy.",
