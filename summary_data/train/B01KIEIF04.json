They require the customer (me) to pay for returning shipping charges of bad battery before they\u2019d send a new one. Since it\u2019s defective, I believe the company should make it right and take care of the issue, but they would not. Very disappointed in Hoover.",

The power and roller buttons can be a bit finicky and the hose can clog (its a tiny machine, thats to be expected) but for the price and convenience, the pros far outweigh the cons.",

The components are plastic and break easily but the price is worth it. It has great suction. Probably the worst component on this vacuum are the wheels. Other parts can be replaced when broken but the wheels are held in with plastic and the eventually break and there is no way to replace the piece that breaks. If you don\u2019t have a lot of money this vacuum works well. If you have more money to spend buy the nicer ones for over $300 because this probably won\u2019t last 2 years if used heavily.",

I had a Hoover cordless previously and it worked great for about 5 years and was very easy to get to the filter. I have only had this vacuum for a few months and I now have to replace it.",

My three previous purchases included two batteries to operate that system. The big DISAPPOINTMENT in this purchase was that Hoover only included ONE battery this time, so when one battery runs out, you have to wait to charge the other...nothing interchangeable about that.

So I just went back to using the older first one and used the second one for replacement parts on the first. After 3 years my first one finally died and I loved it, but not going to keep paying more for another that doesn\u2019t work as well as my original that cost less.",

Husband and I finally was able to twist back into place with both of us. I threw out all boxes so didnt want to repack and return. Works great as previous one. Dreading changing filter when time comes. Hope its easier to twist canister together.",

Also, it stands by itself and doesn't have to hang on the wall like the newer models. I had a second battery before and now I have three! It's perfect for my tile floors and the latest model seems to be a bit quieter.",
