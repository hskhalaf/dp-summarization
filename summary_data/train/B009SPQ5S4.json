This bed is 4-5\" thick and provides sturdy support for her old bones plus the cover is waterproof and washable!! We purchased the inside liners too because we use doggy chucks on top the bed to keep from washing so much. We also use chucks on the inside liner while the cover is being laundered. Works GREAT for our needs!! I recommend spending the money for this AWESOME PRODUCT - it's everything we've been looking for.",

So I guessed he must be like me : I like firm beds. I came on Amazon, found this one and ordered the small size. He liked it and slept on it the very first day. Even though he is a very small dog, I found the small size bed was way too small for him so I switched to the medium size. He sleeps on it every day and I am happy knowing he is sleeping comfortably.",

So if the top is soaked and you pick the bed up to unzip it, the fluid runs down the sides and to the bottom then soaks into the bed foam through the bottom of the cover. So since it's very difficult to find a waterproof bed/washable cover, I recommend this but if it does get soaked, leave it on floor and carefully unzip the cover and slide it off and fold the fluid in while lifting and carrying it away to the washing machine or sink.",

While no dog bed cover on the market is truly waterproof, these covers are water resistant and will prevent strike through if the wetness is immediately noticed. I have a paralyzed dog with bladder control issues. I simply wrapped the memory foam portion in plastic garbage bags, and then placed the removable cover over that. It is highly functional and has been working perfectly. I bought a large number of replacement covers so that I can simply swap out the dirty covers as often as is necessary.",

I bought the medium for her and she seems to really like it. She fits fine on it. Also it's easy to vacuum and pretty light compared to her other beds. I may buy her a large one for the house. Also she doesn't bottom out on it. It's real foam not the shredded stuff they put in other beds. I definitely would buy again. Because of the light weight it's easy to move around.",
