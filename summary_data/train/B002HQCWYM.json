Still, this tasted like drinking flavored water (I tried a few variations with the Keurig machine to see if I could make it stronger but to no avail). The search goes on for an acceptable Keurig chai tea latte....",

I generally make this AND put a tea bag in a large cup and between the two I get a decent cup of chai. It's not a Twinnings problem, it's a brewing issue.

Also, this is already lightly sweetened, so be sure to taste it before adding anything to it! I like to add a little half and half to make it creamier, but it doesn't need any sweetener at all.",
