Maybe it had a short somewhere, or maybe it's just junk. Either way, I can't recommend this at all.",

If you want a headset to play games that you want to hear, I don't really recommend this because it's a quiet headset, and it isn't good quality. I use it when I'm playing multiplayer games, which as long as I can hear my guns firing, that's all I really need. Other than that, I want to hear my players. However, on the Playstation 4, there are different settings that you need to adjust for the best mix. So in general, it's a good product for your money.",

I've started the refund process for this headset. Do yourself a favor and don't waste the money. I don't know if it'll work better on other systems, but on the PS4 it's seemingly impossible to calibrate this thing properly.",
