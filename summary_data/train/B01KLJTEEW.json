For the $200 I paid I could live with some minor defects like other people have described but the playing surface being sub par really sucks. Way too loose.",

As previously stated by other consumers, the felt is loose as can be, almost unplayable. And the padded surrounding is dented. I know I didn't buy a $1000 table but come on. Flase advertising and poor quality. I would return it if it wasn't such a pain in the ass to return this large table. I want my money back or send me a damn table as pictured on the site. Metal cup holders, decal on the felt and felt that is actually installed correctly. Boooo",

The cup holders will fit a normal sized can and they're a little over an inch deep. This thing is pretty heavy though, you might need two people to move it around. The plastic buckle and strap will not actually hold the table closed for storage. And if you try to use the strap as a handle, it WILL break. I'm speaking from experience. Other than that, it's an excellent product. I'm very satisfied. Now if only the felt design wasn't so lame.",

The bottom of it is scratched in places and appears to have been colored in with a sharpie. If you love paying extra to wait longer and get broken products then definitely buy this. If you did accidentally buy this, good luck paying for the 70 lbs trash heap in postage to send it back.",

That being said, it's such a nice table and at good price each location has bought one--so no more lugging for us. It's very study. The fabric could be tauter--mine is fine, but my friends is a tiny bit lose (quality control). One other point, the cup holders could be deeper and should removable for easy cleaning.

      "text": "Overall, the table is pretty nice and sturdy. The playing surface is nice and cards slide on it without much resistance. The padded edges are a nice touch and make extended games easy. However, the \"stainless\" steel cup holders rusted as soon as a few sweaty drinks were placed in them. For as much as this table costs, I'm really disappointed that they cheaped out on the stainless steel they used. Nice table and all, just beware the cup holders will rust the second you pull it out of the box.",
