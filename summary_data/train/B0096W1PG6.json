The US lens warranty is a 1 year warranty for manufacturer defects. Alternatively, you can get this same lens and add the 2 year any way it breaks protection (you drop it, dunk it, whatever) for under $20. This warranty, sold by Amazon (guaranteed by Square, I believe). Oh darn, now they offer a 3 or 4 year protection... all still for far less than the 1 year Sony warranty. Sounds like a no brainer, to me (oh, it is the same lens, works like a champ!).",

I used different modes from close up at wide angle as well as on 50 mm focal length to landscapes and a few snap shots of people. Color and details were satisfactory, definitely not Leica quality mechanically and optically but this lens purpose is to provide the convenience of quick shots later displayed on computers. As for the 1 year Sony warranty, who cares at half-price? i am confident that this lens will out last a year, besides most lenses ar damaged by dropping them or other accidental events which are never covered by warranty anyway.",

Not so great in low light situations. I suppose the Power Zoom is good for video capabilities, but I don't find it any more convenient than Manual Zoom for photos. The other concern is reduction in battery life with the PZ. I'd rather use the SEL 18-55mm for it flexibility and in my opinion better optics.",

Anyway, it arrived on time, well packaged and looks and performs just fine. It included both front and rear lens caps, plus a little bag and a cleaning cloth. While this isn't a high-end lens, it is a good kit lens, is small, and yields fine photos....all for a very low price. At such, it is a good kit lens, I think.",

    "description": "Compact and lightweight design for excellent portability thanks to retract-ability down to a mere 29.9 mm\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nE PZ 16-50MM F3.5-5.6 OSS POWER ZOOM LENS\nThis 16-50mm retractable zoom lens is super compact and easy to carry and the ideal lens for traveling and other scenarios that require a lightweight, compact camera and lens combo.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nCIRCULAR APERTURE\nWhen changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. \u03b1 lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.\n\nED (EXTRA-LOW DISPERSION) GLASS\nAs focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.\n\nASPHERICAL LENS ELEMENTS\nAspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.\n\nDISTANCE ENCODER\nThe distance encoder plays an integral part in ADI flash metering, which delivers high precision flash metering that is unaffected by the reflectance of subjects or backgrounds. The distance encoder is a lens component that directly detects the position of the focusing mechanism, and sends a signal to the CPU in order to measure distance to the subject. During flash photography, this data is very useful in calculating how much flash output is appropriate to the scene.\n\nLENS-BASED OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION\nGyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nINTERNAL FOCUSING\nOnly the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if you\u2019re using a polarizing filter.\n\nSELP1650 not recommended for use with NEX-3, NEX-5, NEX-C3 \n2012 Sony Electronics Inc.
