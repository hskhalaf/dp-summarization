Since the battery door has the mount behind it anyway we just don\u2019t even bother putting the screws in, makes for easy battery changes, which happen FAR TOO OFTEN. He loves it and we love it, so we just purchased one for our newest baby. Something must have happened with production in the last two years. The songs are all different. They are loud (even on the lowest volume) and sound too harsh to even be considered soothing. I\u2019m contemplating returning and finding something else that is quieter.",

The first one, the belt broke that controlled the animals from moving. I was able to replace it with a band from a whiteout roller. The kids both loved this, 9 months to 3 years. Helps calm them.

BUT, it definitely did not \"lull\" my baby to sleep. It's SO bright, especially if you're using it in a dark room, which I assume you would be because you're trying to get a baby to bed, and the first 10 minutes are quite loud as well. So if you're looking for a fun crib toy, I recommend. But if you're searching for something to help your baby fall asleep on their own, you should pass on this.",

Two years later: Updating to say that although my son hated it as a baby, he loves it as a 2.5 year old. It's a little loud, but throw a piece of packing tape across the speaker and it's a good volume for going to sleep. This works well for pretty much anything with an out-of-sight speaker. Otherwise, my kid rips the tape off. It's got a good semi-hypnotic rhythm so it doesn't keep kids awake like some other ones we've tried.",

He immediately calms down as soon as he hears the classical music and he gets hypnotized by the sea animals. The only down side is the battery life. Four C batteries would only last a week but it is worth it! So overall I'm really happy with my purchase!",
