It's easy to access the stop watch also and or quickly convert to military time. I love this watch and where it everyday as it blends in with most of my outfits.

However, the strap rubs the bones of my wrist, and I'm constantly pushing it up above that little bone on left left side of my wrist. I love the look and accuracy, and thus I put cushioned tape around my wrist before work, and that keeps the watch in place from sliding and protects the bony prominence of my wrist. Yes, I'd buy it again, but if you are bony or at the very least have bony wrists -- consider padded tape or a toe pad for that bony prominence.",
