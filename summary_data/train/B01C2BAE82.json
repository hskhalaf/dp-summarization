They're super comfortable barely feel like I'm wearing it but be mindful to start off w/ where you're comfortable. The straps itself doesn't hang , it comes w/ a loop to stick the hanging of the band like a belt basically. I don't have any dislikes, . I definitely recommend this for anyone trying to see better results in the gym. Blood flow resistance is new to me but I'm glad I get to experience it w/ brf bands \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe.

They are far too elastic, and as a result cannot achieve the proper amount of restriction. Again, do not waste your money.",

I contacted the seller and he sent another set immediately, no charge, and directed me to the video on the product page that explained how to use. Outstanding customer service. Don't over-tighten. The pump expands your arms into the band. And don't worry, if the lever does come off and you can find it, it pops right back in again.",

BFR is the way to go, the pump is real and I am confident I am heading toward my goals!",
