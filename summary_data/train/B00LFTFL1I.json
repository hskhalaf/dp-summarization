This ProGear 190 manual treadmill is surprisingly smooth -- enough that I can mindlessly walk without jerky stop-and-go belt movement constantly calling my attention back to it. Like other people mentioned, I put a 2x4 board under the back feet so it doesn't feel like it's running away with me. This makes for a nice little calm workout. -------------------------------- Different shoes make the belt run smoother or rougher.

It\u2019s not large so it\u2019s easy to find a place to put it. I\u2019m a 78 year old woman. So if I can put it together and use it, well you can too.",
