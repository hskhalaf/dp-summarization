      "text": "I upgraded to this camera from my older Powershot A510 (stolen). It's better in every way. MUCH faster, good battery life, awesome pictures, unbelievable zoom, and image stabilization (I got soooo many fuzzy pictures with the A510 -- not anymore!). It's definitely not compact (fills up my entire jeans pocket), but it takes infinitely better pictures than compact cameras. The software has also gotten much better, and you can finally play videos in ZoomBrowser. It's still not very good at extreme macro shots or low light conditions; but I'm not a pro photographer either, so I rarely mess with the settings. BTW, GREAT bang for the buck. Hope this helps you gather information!",

      "text": "The only problem is that this thing REALLY eats batteries. On vacation we went through two Duracell Ultras per day. Worse, I had to listen to the missus whine about it. We tried some fancier batteries that are supposed to last longer, if they actually did last longer it wasn't noticeable. I'm going to try the canon rechargeable batteries, people seem to like them. It just seems nuts that this camera consumes so much power, but didn't come with a rechargeable, professional grade, battery pack. (remember that we bought this thing for snapshots AND artful composed shots, and it performs those duties very well.)",

The camera feels sturdy and I havent had any problems with the scroll wheel, which i have read about in some other reviews of the product. But night time photography reduces the shot-to-shot time horrendously. Its highly frustrating when u want to take a few quick shots and you end up waiting for ages. I found the flash range to be a bit less. I havent used any other megazoom, so I cannot compare. If a high optical zoom isnt your top priority, you might wanna consider other models, otherwise, its a good camera overall.",

      "text": "This camera presents a lot of very interesting features. I especially like the IS, the use of AA batteries and 10X zoom. However, the face detection still needs to be improved. It finds a face easily, but a second one is very often omitted making it a little tougher to take couple shots. Time between pictures is also a little long.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SX100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nPowerShot SX100IS will inspire you with its with phenomenal 10x optical zoom... and so much more. There's the 8.0-megapixel CCD and Optical Image Stabilizer for shake-free shooting. Plus, the DIGIC III Image Processor with advanced Face Detection, Face Selector Button, and red-eye correction assure superb results every time. Auto ISO Shift and ISO 1600 make low-light shooting easy. The large Mode Dial lets you select Scene Modes or full manual control effortlessly.\n\nPacked with Brilliant Features in a Compact Body\nExceptional value in a compact ultra-zoom 8.0-megapixel digital camera with unique Canon DIGIC III Image Processor for superior image quality and vibrant colors. A new concept, the PowerShot SX100IS is compact and portable with streamlined controls. Take it everywhere, because inside is a level of photographic power that's truly impressive; 8.0 megapixels ensure deeply detailed images, giving you complete freedom to enlarge an image or any section of an image and crop it to your exact specifications.\n\n With DIGIC III, your images boast superior quality, the camera operates at top efficiency, and battery life is enhanced. What's more, DIGIC III enables Canon's Face Detection Technology and red-eye correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the Shutter Button halfway down, and the camera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face looking bright and natural. Red eyes can be corrected during playback.\n\n iSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance.\n\n Powerful Zoom, True-to-Life Imaging\nZoom in for sharp, steady close-ups with Canon's 10x optical zoom lens with Optical Image Stabilizer.\n\n The PowerShot SX100IS has a 10x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a bird high atop a tree, a child's winning goal from across the stadium, or a school play from the last row. Plus, thanks to Canon's highly sophisticated Optical Image Stabilizer technology, even at maximum zoom every image is rock steady.\n\n The PowerShot SX100IS is equipped with Canon's acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you'll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash.\n\n See the Image Beautifully with Wide Viewing Angle \nHigh-quality 2.5-inch LCD screen for easy viewing, AA batteries for the family on the go. \n\n The camera's 2.5-inch LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing, or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture and wide viewing angle to make shooting, playback, and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient. Clear and bright, it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. And the convenience of using AA-size batteries means that no special power adapters or chargers are needed wherever you go.\n\n 2.5-Inch LCD Screen\nCanon technology maximizes quality and performance.\n\n Genuine Canon Face Detection Technology sets the focus, exposure, and flash automatically, leaving you free to compose a group, capture an unguarded moment, or coax the perfect smile. Plus the new Face Selector Button lets you select the primary face.\n\n DIGIC III features Face Detection technologies, giving the you best possible results in any shooting situation. Face Detection AF/AE sets the focus point and exposure for the faces of your subjects. Face Detection FE adjusts the flash to correctly illuminate your subject to provide the best balance between your subject and the overall scene, eliminating the common problems of over- and underexposed faces.\n\n Red-eye correction detects and corrects red-eye during playback. In unusual cases where red-eye is not automatically detected, it can easily be corrected manually during playback mode.\n\n And new Face Selector AF enables you to lock on and follow a specific face. The selected subject is tracked wherever the face moves in the frame. Simply press the Face Selector Button; then the selected face is double-framed and tracked when the face moves in the frame.\n\n Life doesn't give you second chances to capture special times. That's why the PowerShot SX100IS features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility.\n\n Instant Creative Control\nEasy-to-use Mode Dial with a wide range of shooting modes from fully manual to fully automatic, including Kids and Pets mode to capture fast moving objects.\n\n Now you're free to concentrate on what really counts--your subject. With the large simple-to-operate Mode Dial, all you have to do is turn to the setting that best matches the scene you're viewing through the lens. The PowerShot SX100IS does the rest. It chooses the perfect exposure, aperture, and flash. Or if you want to flex your creative muscles, choose Manual Control and do it all yourself. You've got special Scenes Modes to handle a wide range of common shooting situations--effortlessly.\n\n 18 Shooting Modes, Including 7 Special Scene Modes\n\n Shooting Modes\nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions.\n\n Auto\nThe camera chooses all the settings so you can concentrate on your subject.\n\n P Program\nAccess advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically.\n\n Av Aperture-priority\nYou define the aperture to either isolate your subject or have clarity throughout the entire picture, and the camera will choose the corresponding shutter speed.\n\n Tv Shutter-priority\nYou select the shutter speed to stop or blur action, and the camera finds the appropriate aperture. With slow exposure times, Canon's noise reduction system activates to ensure low image noise.\n\n Manual\nThe ultimate in creative control, you set selecting both aperture and shutter speed manually.\n\n Portrait\nThe camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject \"pop.\"\n\n Landscape\nFor front to back sharpness, the camera sets a small aperture.\n\n Night Snapshot\nGet natural-looking pictures with brighter backgrounds and subjects lit by flash.\n\n Kids and Pets\nReduced focusing time freezes fast-moving subjects, so you won't miss those special shots.\n\n Stitch Assist\nBuild awe-inspiring panoramas by neatly aligning sequential images.\n\n Movie\nShoot in VGA (640 x 480 at 30 frames per second [fps]/30 fps LP) and QVGA (320 x 240 at 30 fps) for up to 1 hour or 4GB, or QQVGA (160 x 120 at 15 fps) for up to 3 minutes.\n\n Special Scene Mode\n\n Night Scene\nFor impressive sunset or nightlife shots, the camera properly exposes the background and uses slow-sync flash for the subject.\n\n Foliage\nCapture brilliant shots of autumn foliage, greenery and blossoms.\n\n Snow\nShoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint.\n\n Beach\nGet clear shots of people at a sunny beach without darkened faces.\n\n Fireworks\nGrab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.\n\n Aquarium\nAchieve proper flash-free exposure and natural hues at indoor aquariums.\n\n Indoor\nReduce blur and improve color accuracy when shooting handheld indoors.\n\n The Complete Print Solution\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading, plus ID Photo Print and Movie Print with select PIXMA Photo Printers, CP, and SELPHY Compact Photo Printers.\n\n The PowerShot SX100IS's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever.
