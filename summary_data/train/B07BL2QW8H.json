Some found issues regarding fit and construction. In addition, there were not enough comments to conclude that functionality is beyond the basic level. Overall, for a simple, no-frills running shoe, the Fresh Foam Zante Solas met the expectations of runners.",

        "The New Balance Fresh Foam Zante Solas is a very comfortable shoe, according to several customers",

        "One user mentioned that the Zante Solas had a stylish appearance",
        "The shoe is perfect for indoor workouts and training, aside from running, said a customer",

      "cons": [
        "The fit of the Zante Solas is quite narrow around the forefoot, a couple of reviewers stated",

I didn't really notice until after my first run in them that I hadn't even tied the laces. The sock-like fit makes them fit snugly enough to run in without the laces having to be tightened at all. Durability has yet to be proven.",

      "text": "This is an odd sneaker. It is extremely lightweight (about 7-8 oz. per shoe-maybe less), which is good for sprinters, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that these are just cheaply made. The sole is a solid piece of foam, with decent cushioning, but not much like a conventional running shoe that has layers of thick rubber. The whole sneaker is designed more like a stiff sock attached to a foam sole. There is little padding at the ankle opening. In fact, there isnone. That could (will) result in skin irritation. As others have said, they are difficult to get on. I would not purchase these unless shoe weight is your highest priority.",

They take a little bit of work to get on, but I'm not bothered by that. Easier than climbing shoes, haha! The sole is fairly thick foam and is comfortable. However it has very little traction, these are gym shoes, pavement pounders, etc. Not for trails with rocks or roots. They do fit as expected. I normally wear 10.5 in athletic shoes and they're spot on.",
