Cons Moving it is a bit cumbersome but, I'm willing to make that trade off for the stability when shooting. Hint: If you're going to use a socket wrench, you'll need the long sockets.

Assembly was pretty easy, and took about as much time as advertised.

Only needed 2 people for 3 steps, spring, backboard, and rim attachments. Taking all products out of the box, keeping the labeled wrapping on them, and spreading them out helps make the assembly easier and faster. All holes were lined up correctly except for one. Just a slight modification fixed that. It\u2019s extremely sturdy. The base bar underneath the plastic base helps tremendously. It will take 2 people to move it around safely.",

The instructions were really clear and detailed. The negative on the assembly was it required multiple sizes of wrenches and sockets. It would have been better if they had provided the wrenches in the kit. The goal is very hard to move around when it is full. It should not blow over easily.",

It took me 5 hours, but we stopped for snacks and lunch. I was also wrangling a 4 year old at the same time. I put one or 2 things on wrong and had to undo them - so lost maybe half an hour with that. I think it could have been done in 3 hours without distractions. :).",

Make sure you have it close to where you want it placed before filling.",

    "title": "Silverback NXT Portable Height-Adjustable Basketball Hoop Assembles in 90 Minutes",
    "description": "The Silverback NXT is pushing the envelope for portable basketball hoops. The advanced technology and strategic engineering of this goal makes for faster assembly, improved rebound, superior strength, unmatched stability, and effortless transportability. Compare the features of the Silverback NXT to other portable goals on the market, and you will see why this hoop is the next big thing in portable basketball hoops. - Stabili-Frame \u2013 The Silverback NXT features Stabili-Frame technology, creating unmatched stability for increased playability and added safety. The slanted pole design was engineered to offer even weight distribution across the entire base. Unlike competitor goals, the pole directly connects to the steel frame below the base, increasing the integrity of the structure. Compare to most portable hoops that utilize the blow molded base as a support structure \u2013 which is typically the first piece that fails. The shape of the base and the weighted ballast wheels create an optimal center of gravity, ensuring your goal will stay upright. Infinity Edge Backboard - Unlike traditional backboards that are framed by a plastic or metal edge, the Silverback NXT features an Infinity Edge Backboard with edges that wrap around to the back of the backboard as one continuous material. This design not only creates the modern, clean look of the hoop, but, more importantly, gives the backboard unmatched strength \u2013 greatly reducing \u201cdead\" spots in the backboard that are common among portable hoops. This technique, folds the edges of the material backward, creating a stronger face for superior rebound. Ergo-Move - The sloped base design on the Silverback NXT creates a completely unique weight distribution that allows the goal to be moved by two people with much greater ease than traditional portable basketball goals. This design enables the goal to be tilted backward onto its large weighted wheels, relieving much of the weight that a person must support, similar to the engineering of a wheelbarrow. The hoop is then easily rolled to its new location while the rear kickstand prevents the goal from tipping over. Quick-Play - No one likes long assembly projects, so the Silverback NXT was designed to make assembly as simple as possible. The NXT comes partially assembled with attached hardware, so you simply attach the major pieces using only a few required tools. The NXT allows you to assemble your goal in approximately 90 minutes, so you can start playing.",
