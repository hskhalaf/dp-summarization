In between the dampness of the microfiber cloth really removes the dust and dirt so that the heavy clean is really quick and the floors look great.

It has 1 reusable, washable pad that picks up well and a container for your preferred cleaner and water mixture. Easy to assemble (click head to handle- done) ive used it for 3 months now and tripped over it twice and it hasnt busted. If you find the liquid bottle leaking, tighten the lid and reinsert. Fixes everytime (user error)",

The mist sprayer is a good concept to help clean the floor (can use our cleaning solution). The plastic frame used under the cushion is delicate so a lot of force cannot be applied. I wanted to use it for the hard floor in our kitchen as it becomes really dirty. It was only able to clean superficially. I think this detaching design is the issue of being delicate. I hope this review helps buyers to make a better choice.",

The only thing it needs is a stronger swivel neck and they definitely got a winner",
