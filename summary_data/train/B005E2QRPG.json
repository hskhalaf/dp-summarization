I love that they're not waterproof because I like to store small veggies, like snap peas and mushrooms, within the bags in the fridge; it keeps them fresh and avoids condensation. The drawstring doesn't have anytype of locking mechanism, but they stay closed just fine from cart to checkout to home. I chose these specifically because they're super easy to see through, and the cashier doesn't have to open the bags to read the barcodes or see what's inside. Overall would purchase again, and hopefully convince my family members to make the switch too. Saves plastic, keeps food fresher, way stronger. You won't regret this purchase",

This took some extra time at the store and string so long wasn't easy to do quick knots. My fruit seemed to last in the bags but my veggies did not. Broccoli got soft fast and zucchini rotted. Update: When I was folding these to send them back one bag had large amount of the stitching coming out at the top. I only used the bags once.",

Had switched over to reusable shopping bags, but still had guilt about those produce bags, and these are the answer. Large enough for any produce I would get, durable, and breathable. Great price. Enough bags to split between my and my husband's car so we always have them for shopping.",

These were great though, you can easily see the fruit in the bag, and their stickers. Light weight and flexible material too. A good buy, happy with purchase though were a bit expensive, which was the only downside.",
