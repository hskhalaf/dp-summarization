Eyeless, lost in a sea of darkness and dank detritus, this otherwise well-made trash can will forever haunt your kitchen with the blind actuation of its sightless maw. Take it from me and my faithful friend: Do not thusly seal its fate. This fellow is dutiful and loving, eating all the trash you toss down its brushed aluminum gullet\u2014so long as it is properly anthropomorphized. Until then, its soulless hunger knows no bounds.",
