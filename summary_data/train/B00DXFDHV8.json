A lot of Apps are no longer compatible. XDA-Dev website never created custom ROM for this tablet. Probably because it's an Intel processor instead of ARM. Pros: Clear, crisp display. Really good sound. Long battery life. HDMI port was really useful being able to connect to a flat screen TV. I'll never buy another ASUS product. (Had an ASUS EeePC netbook and that also died!)",

It also has a microSD card slot so you can add additional storage to your tablet ... something most alternative Android tablets don't have. I would recommend this.",

It has almost all the benefits of the 700, but also includes 2GB of memory, and at a much better price. Have found it to be very easy to set up, battery life is great, and the display is fantastic.

They continue to sell the MeMO Pad ME302C with Android 4.2 in 2017 and refuse to update. Many apps will no longer run on 4.2.",

Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 teaches you that is not necessary to have an (overrated) iPad or Galaxy tablet to have real fun and quality. However, this one has a minor bug when it comes to the blocking screen. Sometimes when you want to unlock the tablet the touchscreen doesn\u2018t respond properly, but after a couple of attempts the touchscreen gets responsive again.",

I bought the original ASUS keyboard case for it and it feels just right. Just get a matte screen protector to reduce glare and fingerprints on the screen thats the only thing that bothered me.

After tampering with the Android software though I think I did something and it began to have regular crashes. Resetting it to factory condition fixed the issue and I sold it for a Nexus 9.",
