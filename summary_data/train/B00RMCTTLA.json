Fender bags ( I own two ) are not as well made, have thinner padding, are constructed of thinner material and were more expensive.",

Zipper came apart on first use, on both the main, and the compartments. Disappointing seeing how, all I had in it was my Bass, Strap, small tool case, and a pack of strings. In a nut shell, if you love you Bass, NOT your choice. Sad though, looked promising, until it was used.",

Nice pouch on the neck portion for a footrest, which is tight but it fits.

Seems like the velcro on the neck support is not in the right place to make sure it stays in position, but it hasn't been an issue. My kid really loves the backpack straps.

The backpack straps adjust low enough that the top of your instrument won't be so high that you have to worry about doorways. (I'm 5'10\" so that's important to me.)

Not as 'smug' as I thought it would be; being a gig-bag rather than a hard case, there's not going to be as much support for the neck--but the included 'neck rest' certainly does help. Would have been nice to have velcro loops (or similar) to secure lead cables in the large pouch. Still, as mentioned, a very good case for it's price!",

My gut instinct wast to return it but I needed something immediately so I (regrettably) kept it. Now, 3 months later, one of the shoulder straps has ripped off, completely shredded, irreparable. I wish I would have spent the extra $ and got something better.",
