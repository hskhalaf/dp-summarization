Not enough to give him a blister, but enough that he noticed. He\u2019s an active kid and said the shoes have plenty of cushion and flexibility. Great fit for his growing foot!",

They currently have about 1/3 the material left, after 70 days of use, but the top of the toe cover has worn through as well. Not worth the money.",

You could tell by the toe creases on both shoes, the way the laces were tied, no tags or paper in or on the shoes and white lint inside the shoes. Advertised and sold as new at new price. Obviously not new and previously worn. Pretty gross to get sent footwear worn by another person. I also read through other reviews and found several that had also been sent used product. So, this is an obvious practice by this vendor.",

      "text": "There wasn\u2019t much to like about these shoes. I used them for about two months before I finally broke down and replaced them. The laces hold the tightness, but are a huge pain if you need to loosen and tighten them on a recurring basis. The padding moved funny under both feet, and over the course of a half an hour run led to a fair bit of foot discomfort. Every time I tried to walk in them (I walk on my running off days) they caused blisters on the back of my heel, no matter how tightly I tied them. Glad to finally be rid of them. I typically get good use out of ASICS, but these were awful.",

A lightweight midsole foam also works strategically with all the joints in your feet for a more flexible and tactile ride. A molded sockliner is contoured to better match the natural shap of your foot, while the full underfoot rubber better resists wear while delivering stronger propulsion. The support panel in the midfoot also increases stability and helps prevent your feet from twisting, keeping them centered on top of the midsole platform. With a trendy design thrown in the mix, GEL-KUMOLYTE running shoe has all grounds covered when it comes to comfort, style and stability.",
