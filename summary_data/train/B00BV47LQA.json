We were told that for children whose teeth are prone to cavities these vitamins are not recommended. We made a huge mistake with starting our daughter to these vitamins and now we have to deal with not only two cavities but also one baby root canal. If you still choose to use these vitamins, our dentist told us, they are better if used in the morning and immediately followed by brushing. They are extremely sticky and not good for children's teeth. I wish we had known this before.",

Also check them with ur kids dentist before using as many such products are known to cause cavities!",
