      "verdict": "Adding to the basketball-inspired roster of Reebok, the BB 4600 is a great iteration of the 1986 release. Retaining most of its authentic silhouette, this modified high-cut sneaker offers the same familiar comfort, support, and stability of the earliest version.Having the OG color variation available makes the shoe hunters feel like they had purchased or repurchased a pair from when it was first launched, along with the sentimental memories attached to it.",

These not only match my black and red uniform providing me with drip but I can wear them my entire 10 to 11 hour shifts with no feet paid. And for the 1st time EVER I haven't even put the Dr scholl's pad in them. They're comfortable just the way they are. Most definitely buying 5 more pairs of these before I never see them again (and mainly because working out back on tires can ruin shoes really quick)",
