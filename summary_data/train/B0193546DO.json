The tray may be used with the lip in the up position or the down position. I strongly suggest putting it in the down position so your cheesecake or whatever you cook in it can slide off the tray easily. Otherwise you have to pry whatever you're cooking over the lip to extract it from the tray.",

I have 'baked' both a pumpkin and a red velvet cheesecake in the pan and both were done to perfection. I may be adding another of these to my collection and I highly recommend it.",
