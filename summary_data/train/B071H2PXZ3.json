The hat fits well--not too tight, not too lose, though I expect to have to hold onto it in a stiff wind. It's felt, so it needs a little grooming now and then to keep looking sharp. Because it's felt, its a bit warm for summer--but i wear it anyway. i like the solid shade it gives my fair, skin-cancer-prone skin. And I don't find it terribly uncomfortable even in 90+ degree heat.",
