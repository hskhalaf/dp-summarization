Garlic is toxic to dog, according to the Merck Veterinary Manual along side with onion. According to the manual garlic can cause vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite. I will not recommend this treat or any treats that contain garlic.",

What I mean by that is 3 of the bags I have ordered have had issues with the ziplock portion of the container seperating from the wall of the bag.

Also easy to divide one treat into smaller portions as they are scored . Highly recommend and will be buying more once devoured....which won't be long!",

This product is all natural, made in small batches, so it has high quality control. My dogs absolutely loved them and even the dog with a finicky stomach had no issues digesting either the chicken or beef (only flavors we tried). We used to get a different brand that had similar quality, but was much higher priced and had too much excess packaging. I love that Rocco and Roxie really cares about their product and their customer. I was super impressed that the manager took the time to send a special note thanking me for purchasing their product.",
