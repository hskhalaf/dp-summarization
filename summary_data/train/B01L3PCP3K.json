This one is just good I fee I was able to ordered an 1xl, but just to be on the safe side I went up one size and the material is great. I loved it",

There is a lot of bulk in the top part of the coat so if you are small chested, again you won't get a fitted look. All together it is a great product.

If you are small and don\u2019t have a big bust or chest and want a tight fit make sure you choose just one size smaller but if you are wanting to fit layers under this jacket then I would say go with your measured size.

I will keep it but I am extremely upset that I can not zip it up if I wanted too. I ordered a larger and I am 5ft 4 and 170lbs and it fit snug on my arms but other than that great Jacket.",

Just wish this company made clothing in talls.",

I typically am a size 14/Large but ordered an XL because I have bigger arms, just in case but after I received it, I realize I could have ordered a large... which would probably also make it look a little better as well in reference to the shoulder pads. I also figure there is a way that I could probably take out the pads somehow also.",

My upper arms are a little tight, but only enought to be noticeable to me, not uncomfortable though.
