The perm black light, for me, goes back to my childhood in the mid 1960's, and a black light was a dark (when off) purple to black florescent light, that when you turned it on, only the day-glow colors light up, and nothing else. With this light, you might as well leave all the lights on, as it throws so much white light, that it washes out whatever you are looking for (in this case, cat urine). So, yes the light is bright, but not in the color range you are looking for. Maybe it is just the technology (LED vs florescent).",

It shows the spots in a dimly lit room; so when I spot cleaned, I knew exactly where to clean. After spot cleaning and shampooing the carpet, the spots didn't go away completely; but they were a little lighter. I knew how well the cleaner worked. Even though the cleaners say they remove urine, they really don't. If anyone knows a product that actually removes the stain, I would love to know what it is. This light will definitely let you know if it works.",
