It showcases a suede and leather upper with optimal cushioning and a sticky outsole for excellent board feel, control and a smooth ride.The Adidas Seeley Premiere will definitely keep its wearers on top of their games. With its minimalist yet stylish design and timeless profile, hardly one can go wrong in trying these kicks on.",

They fit well, my son loves them but I feel a little ripped off. I have nubuck suede shoes and these feel like the fake nubuck of cheaper shoes. Or maybe it's just really thin, inferior nubuck. I truly don't think these will hold up or look good for very long. My boys have had Adidas Busenitz in the past and wear them into the ground, yet the suede still looks great. This shoe, I think, is going to look crappy in a few months.",
