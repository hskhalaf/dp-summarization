When the second bag was delivered she turned her nose up at it. At first I thought she was sick, my dog never turns down food! A couple days later I gave her a bowl of the previous brand she used to eat. She inhaled it. The next day I tried diamond again, she wouldn't touch it. Eight years and she's never turned down food. If my dog won't eat it, I can't trust it. Switched back to her old diet and she's eating like normal again.",

The food smelled like skunk, none of our dogs liked it - and we didn't like the foul smelling gas emitting from our pets because of it. Threw this stuff in the trash and have gone back to the old food - no more of this stuff for us.",
