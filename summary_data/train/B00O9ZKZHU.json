Called company and was told we voided the warranty because we had it in the garage. SERIOUSLY. One week? There was nothing in the paperwork or warranty information about not using it in a garage. The paperwork claims they pride themselves on customer service, but that's not true. Fortunately Amazon stands behind what it sells and we were able to return to them. Amazon's customer service is excellent every time we use them.",

Delivered by UPS, (amazing for its large size and weight), the freezer arrived in perfect shape. Excellent packaging. EASY to set up. I immediately placed 3 thermometers inside and plugged it in. 2 hours later, the temp was -12 degrees. Set thermostat to warmest setting and my thermometers registered lower than 10 degrees after 6 hours. So, this thermostat is not good for refrigeration temperatures, Not to worry, there are many easy ways around this if you might someday need a refrigerator instead of a freezer.",

Shelves have cooling coils integrated which prevents you from adjusting shelves, but most items should fit fine (approximately 7.5\" inches of height in top and middle shelves, 10\" in bottom section). Top of freezer is textured and looks to be a good place to store kitchen items on top.",

Local trusted appliance repairmen told me since the compressor was running it maybe low on the refrigerant which wasn't available. When it worked it worked great.
