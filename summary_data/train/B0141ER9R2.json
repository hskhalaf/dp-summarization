      "text": "I was hesitant to purchase these headphones because they don't look like they would be comfortable. (I guess because the speakers are rectangle-shaped). But, the reviews were mostly positive and they were on sale, so I took the chance... and I'm so glad I did! These are so comfortable that you'll forget you're wearing them! The sound is perfect, and I'm impressed by the quality. Also, as soon as you put them on the noise around you is significantly muffled, even before you turn them on. Perfect for those of us who like to escape into our own minds on occasion, lol. I'm super happy with this find!",

Sound-wise, to me anyway, they are fantastic. They fit perfectly, even over a stocking-type cap I wear in the winter. Their service department is excellent (I had some minor issues when I first got the 240) and their response time was quick and fair. Everyone is different, of course, but I highly recommend these for wireless/bluetooth use (they also come with a connection to use as wired and a carrying case.)",

      "text": "Pretty good sound. They aren't designed for any activity at all. They simply fall off. Noise cancellation is passive, just in the soft ear pads. There is no difference when you turn them on as opposed to just putting them on. Had the older Kinivo headset they still sell and the mic pick up or noise cancelling isn't any better than those. Really was hoping. Also NFC works well, pairs readily, but periodically it won't work with calls which is why I'm returning them. Seller works with warranty issues fairly quickly as the first set the left earpiece was squeaky when moved.",

      "text": "I recently had to replace my Kinivo BTH220 headphones (that lasted for over five years with hours of daily use) and upgraded to the Urbn and they\u2019re just fantastic. Has the same sound quality and ridiculously long battery life I\u2019ve come to love from Kinivo. I almost never review products (and I am not paid by Kinivo or any other company for reviews) but felt these headphones were good enough to warrant leaving one. Battery lasts for quite a long time, over a week and I often forget to turn them off when done using so potentially longer. Fantastic sound, very comfortable on your head (the padding on the headband portion is a nice touch!) Would definitely recommend purchasing",
