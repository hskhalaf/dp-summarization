I kept using it for a month and tapered off to one pill at night. After a few months I quit using it altogether. I still have flare-ups every few months and restart with 1-2 pills per day depending on severity. Usually I can quit again in a few days and be free of pain for weeks or months. Nothing else has ever had this lasting effect for me.",

Because of my work moving and installing office furniture, and probably age too (50s), I suffer from almost chronic shoulder and knee joint pain and discomfort. The shoulders especially problematic, sometimes even a comfortable sleep position was hard to find. Been using Osteo Bi Flex for just over a week now and the results are fantastic, noticeable, especially with the shoulder joint pain. Highly recommend it. I'm sleeping sooo much better, and better range of motion during the day",

It was actually in my best interest my insurance was denied because THIS STUFF WORKS! The bottle says \"7 days\" so I committed to 14 days (good things take patients). I can actually JOG! I haven't been able to jog for atleast 10 years. I'm on my 3rd bottle. FYI: That 3rd ingredient \"Botswella\" is frankincense from the Bible! Go figure!",

Within a fairly short period of time, my pain and range of motion improved enough that I've stayed with it for the past 10-12 years. So I will always keep taking it until a doctor tells me it will kill me (not such a funny joke these days, given Zantac problems). I was a little taken that Amazon would ask me to rate the Flavor. Umm, these aren't gummies - they are regular pills. In the end, great product! I believe Osteo has given me a number of additional years of pain-free knee activity.",
