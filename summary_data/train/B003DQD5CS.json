There have been many ungrades since this phone came out, but it still remains the best music player of the Motorola phones. I accidentally washed my first one in a front loader washing machine, dryed it out before turning it on and kept using it. I recently dropped in while is was plugged in and messed up where is plugs in to charge, and that is why I bought a refurbished one to replace it.",

I also got it from Amazon Warehouse, and Amazon always seems to have items in superb condition.",

Pros: Fast Browsing, its a DROID, Its got a decent screen res, Great Camera, and easy texting Cons: For some reason, it wont add some contacts i put in it, i dont know why, but maybe its weird and idk what im doing. No memory card, i just realized this so i cant take pictures, listen to music or anything till i buy one. The keyboard doesnt feel good when it opens, it doesn't open smoothly. Other than that, its a god phone for the money!",

Please note that this phone does not have a sim card slot so you can only use it with Verizon in America. I had to return this phone because it did not work in my area. If you use Verizon and live in America and want a decent phone for the price, then by all means go for it :)",
