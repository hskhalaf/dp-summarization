I bought it simply for the single player campaign, so I could catch up on the backstory of the series after playing Battlefield 4. As cheap as it is now, it is very worth the price it goes for now, even as a timewaster.",

Even though it's only 24 players, most of the maps feel perfectly populated. The destructive environment is still awesome, but not as extensive as previous titles. Gun balance is great, but class balance is poor. There is really not much of a reason to play either the Recon class or the Support class, though they can be crucial in certain instances. The battles are fantastic fun. You'll never find a game (except for maybe Planetside, which isn't even on consoles) that has battles this grand.",

I find it acceptable as I have dealt with terrible games in the past that make a singleplayer unplayable. There wasn't any graphical, or audio glitches to be found. I would definitely pick this game up, but I would get the Premium Edition as the DLC content is a very nice addition to the game.",
