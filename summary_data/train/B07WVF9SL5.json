      "text": "I have owned both Apple TV and Fire TV and hated them both, mostly for the same reasons: they were slooow, hard to navigate, had extremely limited customization, and constantly pushed paid content to the top of your suggestion lists. The Roku Ultra easily solved all those problems. It's super-fast with great voice recognition, lets you customize what you want to see, and offers tons of free content. The Ultra can also control your TV volume, power, and mute functions. I love that you can plug in a pair of earbuds to the remote to watch a show without disturbing anyone. This is a very well thought-out device!",

Also the device gets pretty hot itself, so don't put anything on it. Well, unless you want to reheat your coffee XD. What's weird is it only uses up 4 watts, so how it's able to generate all that energy while consuming so little is beyond me.",

I've only been able to test it with solid access, will update the review after I've had a chance to move the unit around, use a mobile hotspot for WIFI, etc. Mobile app is a great feature.

      "text": "I have two Roku Ultra players. One is \"rebuilt\" and it works well. The other, the one that I purchase new from Amazon.com has recurring problems. Most frequent is \"Error 020\" which apparently references an HDCP error. The error message blocks access to programming and occurs at least once weekly. It stipulates that I disconnect the HDMI cables AND the power cords from both the Roku box and the TV. This is most annoying, especially when seen in light of the fact that the 'rebuilt' Roku Ultra has never had a problem. And, interestingly, the new, \"problem\" Roku Ultra is considerably closer to the router than the one with no issues. Further, Amazon's claimed phone support has been inaccessible.",
