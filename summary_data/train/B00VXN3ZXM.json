My big problem with these and why I gave 3 stars is because the quality is good but the opening on the pillow is at the top and not in the middle like most shams. So they keep sliding off the pillows as you sleep and you have to adjust them almost all the time, on top of that the opening doesn't close anymore over time and it's just a bit of a haste. They could really be 5 star if the opening was in the middle to keep the pillow from sliding out in place, which woulda been great.",

You put the pillow in through one side and kind of fuss with the sham to get it to look good, but that side won't fluff out as well as the other three. I thought this would be an envelope kind of sham -- the kind where you put the pillows in through the center of the back -- but it's not. I wouldn't order them again for that reason.",
