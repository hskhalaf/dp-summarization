The strap was sufficient and the handle worked reasonably well... wish it would move a bit further to balance the tube and lock in place... minor issues. The larger diameter means items retained less curl and I was able to store other mounting materials in it as well.",

The handle slides onto a dovetailed interlock - and slides right off - have your tube go rolling down an airport escalator while you are left with the handle - the strap detail is poorly designed and can't be adjusted properly. I have owned many paper roll Tubes - there are some crummy ones out there - but this wins the position of the worst. For a blow-molded piece of plastic, it is also priced too high even if it worked well.",
