However, I was overcome with blind optimism at the high number of glowing reviews this bar received that I decided in the middle of my late night shopping spree to get this in addition to the quest crisps (which are fantastic btw!) After my first bite, I knew I had made a terrible, terrible mistake. I am now left feeling confused about the type of people who would enjoy such a bar and even worse, a full box of this protein bar that I cannot stomach (pun intended). Buyer beware.",

Then, we want to hurry to chew so we could take a drink of something to wash the taste away. I will never buy again. The picture on box, shown here on Amazon, shows a very appealing s'more.

They have one of the lowest carb/fat to protein ratio. They're not loaded with sugar like some other products so if you're looking to gain lean mass, this is the one for you. I always buy these in boxes every once in a while for the value, and because I know I'll finish the box. There are several recipes utilizing Quest bars that make them much more enjoyable. Definitely look into those if you're not satisfied with the original taste, but the Oreo taste is very easy for most people!",
