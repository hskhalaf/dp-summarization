I did, however, use the size charts both on Amazon and on Teva's website. My girl's feet are are 11.5cm exactly. That being said, she hasn't tripped up in them (in our uneven backyard) and they seem to be good quality. Hopefully they'll fit her brother next year so we can get more use out of them. I have the Velcro tightened all the way and they don't slip and slide around. We will be putting them to the true test next weekend doing a lot of walking.",
