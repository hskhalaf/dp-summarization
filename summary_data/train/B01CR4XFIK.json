I'm 6'3\", 250lbs, and I have zero problems (at least so far) with it's build quality, stability, size, etc. I also don't know why some reviewers mentioned it won't lay flat -- it most definitely does. You just have to extend the leg under the seat part properly and then the whole bench is horizontal/flat. Definitely seems to be good enough quality, and it's a great price.",

It arrived in professional packaging with instructions and tools, etc. I am not handy at all, and I assembled this bench in about 30 minutes without any help! I've used it for several workouts, and it is everything that a proper weigh bench should be. It is comfortable, it is durable, and it is high quality. When you rest heavy dumbbells on it for a few minutes then remove them, it does not leave marks on the soft material. I love it, and I urge you to buy this one now!!!",

It feels very sturdy and if you adjust the leg brace part to where your ankles are, I don't find it uncomfortable at all. If anyone is still uncomfortable, you can always buy some foam pipe insulation from your local hardware store to add more padding.",

The fact of the metal frame is sturdy, the convenience of the wheels makes it easier to move and the lower storage profile when folded makes it take up less space than others that are thicker. However the thickness of the bench rest feels unsturdy, when I lean to reach for a weight off the ground while sitting, it feels like it could snap at any moment, as if the core material is made of plywood. I noticed is the cushion should be thicker and the bars that help anchor your feet would need softer cushions instead of rubber coating. Work great none the less, just need to make adjustments.",

The jury is still out on the durability of the canvas and padding the seat and backrest are wrapped in. Hopefully it doesn't prematurely start degrading with use. In closing, great bench, I'd buy it again in a pinch, but would opt for more comfort (padding) given the opportunity of shopping in an ample supply market. Hope that helps.",

Very impressed with the quality of metal and the welds for the incredible price of $105 with delivery! Started using it right away and it makes a huge difference in my workout. Certainly not a professional quality, but I am 5'6\" 175 lb and 77 so for my purposes more than enough (training more for repetitions rather than top weight). Very happy with the product and would buy it again if necessary. The bar holders also from Amazon, sturdy but light and easily movable.",

Also, the front leg goes so far forwards that I have to be careful coming off a heavy lift to make sure I don't accidentally drop my dumbbells onto it and smash a finger or dent the leg. As others have said, the leg bar on the front for doing sit ups is only good as a torture device, but with some towels/extra padding it's passable. The wheels on the back leg are a great plus.",

The directions in the book seemed to be way more complicated and not easy to decipher what/where you should be looking at and attaching the items. Lots of positions for making my weight workouts comfortable and easy to switch between the different exercises. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good quality and easy to use weight bench.",

So every time I move it I have to drag it. The other thing that annoys me about this bench is that I'm 6'2 with broad shoulders and this does not comfortably fit both shoulders on the bench.
