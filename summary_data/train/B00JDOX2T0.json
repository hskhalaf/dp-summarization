It took a little while for me to get to the game, but once I did I was hooked just like BL2. I'd recommend it to anyone who misses all of Jack's smarta** comments throughout the game and for those who enjoyed the game, but want something new.",

Lot of neat new features that are really fun like the hover bikes and the oxygen mechanics. The Helios Moon Base and Dahl Frigate levels were neat. Still though, it just isn't as good as Borderlands 2 was... something just feels... missing. You can tell that Gearbox didn't make this one; it just doesn't have the same style and hilarious politically incorrect jokes. They tried really hard to emulate Gearbox's wit but it just falls short. The humor uses stuff like lesbians and nerds for the punchlines which I didn't find as funny as midgets and psychos and firehawks.",

Although there is a lot of grinding to level up, the characters and weapons make the game fun with friends. The classes are fairly unique and you will definitely want to try a few out. Overall, this is exactly what you expect from Borderlands franchise.",
