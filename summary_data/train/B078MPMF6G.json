Great product. My only complaint is the flimsy Velcro attachment points. My opinion is that I'll end up replacing them sometime soon.",

I did not use it as a tarp, however, but after examining the snaps and grommets, this item looks promising. This item is not as heavy as the poncho I was issued in the military but it has a very similar form factor. Look no further, this is the poncho for you.",

Very curious placement indeed.",

Material gets a lot more pliable when it gets wet, which does make it easier to fold back up after it dries.",

No pockets either which would have raised the price slightly but increased the value more IMO. Maybe for the next version.",

It provides full coverage and I like the fact that it has real pockets. He will also be able to use this for camping trips for Boy Scouts.",
