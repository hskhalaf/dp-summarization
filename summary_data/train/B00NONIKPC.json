The Defiant allows you to set the self locking from 30 seconds to 1 1/2 minutes. Also the Defiant has 10 separate user combinations where the Milock has but 6. I would not buy the Milocks Electronic Deadbolt again... And surprisingly the Defiant actually cost less... a Win-Win. Jerry Edwards",

      "text": "Absolutely horrible product. It worked well for a few weeks then it started having issues. It would only unlock sometimes. Other times the lock would only open a little but not all the way. I finally received a replacement but it was even worse! It was defective too. It would not unlock from the first time I installed it. Don't waste your money. Spend a little more and get something better.",
