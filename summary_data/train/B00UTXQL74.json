I would recommend this amp over others if your running a couple speaker system. This paired with some kicker speakers and I can hear my two 6.5 speakers clearly at 80mph. It's a Kenwood amp..kenwood makes great products they always have.",

I ended up digging through the archives and ran caps & coils for mine. I also found that the POWERAMP app worked quite well for adding some bass-trebel or eq settings for further refinement as a bluetooth music player.",

On both vehicles, I have problems with the amp cutting out when the volume is too high. Its not even that high, but I have to lower the volume so it doesn't start rebooting or disconnecting during my songs. I think this amp may have just died on me yesterday too in my ski. Can't blame the amp yet, I need to take it apart to be sure, but there is no signal or power and battery connections are good. I'm looking at JL or even Rockford as a replacement.",

      "text": "I installed on a 2019 Road King with Kicker PSM3 4 Ohm. The amp is bridged two channel and the speakers sound incredible. This set-up replaced a Boss Audio 420 system. The amp and kickers sound more powerful and crisper with a little more punch. It is best to use this combo bridged. I tried it in 4 channel mode and there was not enough power to the speakers above 80% volume level. Bridged, it was perfect up to 100% volume and LOUD!. As my title states, the system when bridged converts the front to channel 1 and the rear to channel 2. The blue tooth signal is splits left/right into channel 1/2 respectively - maintaining stereo separation.",

The picture included is a bit \"dirty\" I had just finished 3d printing the backing insert and mounting the remote. I should have wiped everything down first :)",

      "text": "Excellent clean Bluetooth sound with 8\" Kickers. Nice wired remote. Be weary of too much movement at the remote's connection to the amp. It should be fine if you stabilize the remote cable somewhere near the amp but I would restrict any wire movement near the connector with wire ties so you don't pull on the small connector. I also question if the connections are truly of boating quality, and doubt they will handle salt water for very long. If you install on a salt water boat, I also suggest you use dielectric grease on every connection, and keep the unit protected very well.",

The controller is nice and small so it's doesn't look out of place on a motorcycle. It mounts easy but my only complaint is it doesn't lock into the controller dock,it just kinda sits in it. I'll probably use double sided tape inside of the dock to keep it from slipping out while riding. It also comes with ALL wiring that is needed",

    "title": "Kenwood 1177524 Compact Automotive/Marine Amplifier Class D Kac-M1824BT, 180W RMS, 400W PMPO, 4 Channel",
    "description": "With today's smartphones hosting a wide variety of listening choices such as stored music, internet radio, podcasts, etc., It is no wonder that customers want to use this as their primary listening source. Bluetooth offers the easiest and most popular connection, kac-m1824bt is not only your standalone Bluetooth gateway but if used with an in-dash receiver, it will double the power of a typical CD receiver with it's built-in 45watts x 4 of amplification. A water resistant controller can be used to adjust volume and change tracks. Many of today's power sports have very limited space to work in and tend to be a harsh environment for electronics because of the exposure to outdoor environments. Kenwood's compact performance amplifiers are small in size so they fit even the most limited installation areas. The amplifiers also use a conformal coated main pcb (printed circuit boards) which offer extra layers of protection to help prevent moisture or damp air from damaging the product.",
