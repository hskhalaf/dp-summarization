Before using this I had weak nails that were prone to peeling and breaking after using gel polish for a while. The nails were frequently down to the quick and I thought eventually they would get their regular strength back but it didn't happen after repeated growth. I decided to give this a shot after reading reviews. They still have some healing to do, but the pictures don't lie.",
