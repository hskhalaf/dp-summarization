      "text": "I have had this humidifier for 10 years when I had my first child it recently broke due to me getting water inside the unit. I was lucky enough to find sameone again. I'll be honest I never put it on the shelf it was always on the ground and it worked great. I don't believe that it's safe to inhale essential oils for anyone, so it really doesn't matter that you cannot use essential oils with this unit. I bought another humidifier but it started making loud noise and waking up the baby so I returned it. From my experience having this one for 10 years, it works great, very quiet and no light. Recommend it for sure.",

The only negative (with most humidifiers) is that it is difficult to clean the tank real good. But even after having this for a few years and cleaning it probably less effectively than we should, it still works great. I would highly recommend this product and if this one ever stops working, I will definitely be buying a new one. Please rate my review as helpful if you feel it was.",

Even tough we use filtered water the calcification happens very often, I have to soak it in vinegar every week.

We wake up to a puddle underneath it, to the point where it has ruined the furniture it is placed on. Wish I could return it, a total waste of money.",

I cannot figure out where the leak is coming from or what to do to fix it. It's very disappointing considering it costs more than other humidifiers. I contacted the company today. I have a feeling they will not be replacing my unit, but if they do I will update this review. My advice, buy something else. You are taking your chances with this.",

It'd be nice if there was an option to turn off the light coming from the front of the train. Our kiddo is used to his room being pitch dark at night...the light from this humidifier threw him off for a few nights.",

    "description": "Color:ElephantAdorable Design, Top Rated Performance.\nGet relief from Cold and Flu Symptoms and bring Wellness to your entire Family with a Crane Adorable Humidifier. Featuring an award winning, child friendly animal designs and top rated performance, Crane\u2019s Adorable Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifiers provide up to 24 hours of soothing moisture to help relieve the effects of dryness and congestion, helping you and your Family to breathe easy and sleep through the night peacefully. \n\nThe moisture that humidifiers add to dry air also help alleviate many common nuisances brought on by winter heating such as static electricity, peeling wallpaper, shrinking wood, and cracks in paint and furniture. \n\nAll Natural, Non Medicated Relief from Dryness, Cough, Cold, and Flu Symptoms.\nHumidifiers are an ideal choice for relieving the discomforts of nasal congestion, dry itchy skin and hair, chapped lips, nose bleeds, and dry throats. Recent studies by the Center for Disease Control have also shown that relative humidity levels between 43% and 60% helps prevent the movement of germs, including the flu virus. \n\nAn Adorable Baby Essential is the Perfect Baby Shower Gift!\nHumidifiers are especially important for Newborns because they are Obligate Nasal Breathers, breathing only through their tiny noses for their first 4 - 6 months. Any congestion can make breathing, feeding, and sleeping incredibly difficult for your little one. Not only that, but many pediatricians recommend the use of a humidifier as a safe, non medicated, all natural alternative to help relieve congestion from the common cold and flu instead of potentially harmful over-the-counter cough and cold medicine.\n\nStraightforward, Whisper-Quiet Operation With Clean Control Technology\nCrane's cheerful designs complement any children's bedroom decor. Not only are Crane humidifiers adorable, but they are easy to use, whisper quiet, and feature Antimicrobial Material in the Base to help reduce mold and bacteria growth by up to 99.96%*. This compact, BPA Free unit uses ultrasonic technology to add humidity to the air, is more efficient than a household light bulb, and includes a built-in auto-shut-off feature that engages when the water tank is empty to ensure safety.\n\n1 Year Manufacturer\u2019s Warranty\n\nMANUFACTURER CONTACT INFORMATION\nCustomer support number : 1-888-599-0992 by email : customer-service@crane-usa.com",
