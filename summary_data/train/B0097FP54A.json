I love the screen size and how vivid the pictures that I take turn out. The only thing is that my phone keeps beeping every hour. I don't know why. It is definitely an upgrade from my old phone. I hope it keeps working great.",

I do have my drawbacks...like my fingers are seemingly to big sometimes to type on the onscreen keyboard, and it took a little bit to figure out the power options...but I would not trade it for the world right now. I can get almost two whole days with one charge, and I found the microphone option if I am having a particularily difficult day typing. I love the camera, and some of the other options, such as getting the weather alerts on my phone.",
