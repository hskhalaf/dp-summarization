Took me 3 days to put together, but that was with working by myself, in between rain storms. It's manageable doing it alone, but I'd recommend a helping hand if possible, for some parts at least. Manufacturer includes some extra bolts, nuts and other hardware incase you need them, came in handy when I stripped out a t-nut (my own fault). All parts are labeled with a part number. Instructions are clear. Overall great product. No missing pieces at all. Would definitely recommend.",

There's many parts and most of them you'll have to readjust in order to make them fit!! I spent $860.00 on this and I'm very unsatisfied!! The set looks great once put together, but looks are deceiving!!",

But some of the bolts were missing and some of the boards split and you could tell they were obviously glued back together. The wood isn't treated so when it gets warm well have to treat it ourselves. It took almost 10 hours with 3 people putting this together. The boards are not as sturdy and thick like I thought they would be, but over all my 2 year old loves this. If she was older I probably would have ordered something bigger it's not as big as I thought it was going to be.",

Note for the Assembler: Have at least one good screw gun, 2 preferably. I recommend using stainless steel screws where possible The wood is similar to domestic cedar however it is softer, be wary of over tightening any hardware as cracks can occur rapidly.",
