This is the first time I have found something that does the job without pulling or snagging my hair. I'm considering buying another one for backup as I have found nothing remotely similar on the market. I really like the fact that it allows so much control and dries well without adding curl. Really terrific.",

The smell of burning hair resonated every time I tried to use it, so in the trash it went. The modified version gives you the option of opening this area and removing any hair that may get caught. Also, it has a hard foam piece behind the vent that gives more protection. Great model improvement guys!",

I also use it on dry hair to smooth out my bangs on days when I don't wash my hair. It works really well and easier and faster than using a straightening iron.",

The downside is that it does get really hot if you have a stubborn spot and hold it there too long, and it is not going to be good for really long or really curly hair. Overall I am happy with this so far....",
