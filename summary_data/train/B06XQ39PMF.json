This should allow for easy remove them when charging is needed. I was skeptical about the motion-activation when I first unboxed them, but it works exactly as you would expect.

I frequently use the stairs evenings to and from the upstairs bedroom but sometimes don't turn the overhead lights on. I magnetically attached these lights on the railing posts so as I approach the stairs the motion-activated lights automatically turn themselves on and off illuminating the stair area making it safer and easier for me to use the stairs and avoid making a misstep. A cheap and brilliant way for me to add an extra dose of safety and they are narrow enough so they are not visible to guests !",

I like that it attaches with adhesive and magnets. However after each time I have charged it, perhaps 5-6 times, the brightness and time between charges has declined drastically.

No drilling or measuring needed. Plus, when recharging is required, you just slide/pull it off the metal strip, plug it in and then return it to the strip which securely stays in place with the inch and a quarter double sided adhesive pads; 4 for each light.

I figured I'd try these and they are perfect - they give the same amount of light from previous homes with expensive under cabinet lighting - easy to recharge through a USB port - depending on the use they last about a month before needing recharging. SO easy to install - just put the adhesive strip under he cabinet then the light stays up with the magnetic strip - easy on, easy off to recharge. Amazing especially considering the cost. the motion detector works perfectly",

They are smaller than I had anticipated and yet the do work nicely: they give off sufficient light to see individuals in the room. They are 7.25\" long and 1\" wide. While they have rechargeable batteries, they do not really offer sufficient light for reading recipes at night as I had hoped -- even with the two light on, about 18-24\" apart.....[they are perpendicular to one another on different cabinets....] Still it is nice to have the light available at night as needed when on auto.",
