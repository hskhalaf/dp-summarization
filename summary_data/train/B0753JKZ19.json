But then when in the mountains of WA where there were only a few mosquitoes around, not only did the candles not repel, 2 mosquitoes flew in to the candle wax and died. Can't believe it actually attracted the damn bugs! Giving it two stars still as the scent and the ambiance of the candles are enjoyable, but don't expect them to repel a damn thing.",
