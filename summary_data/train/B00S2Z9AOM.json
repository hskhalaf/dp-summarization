        "Crafted from B8 bronze (92% copper, 8% tin), this cymbal is fast and punchy and it cuts through the mix well",

      "text": "The Cymbal received is totally different to the one shown on the website. The received Cymbal does not have any SABIAN marking on the top surface of the cymbal. Only BX8 marking is there on top of the cymbal. This does not sound as good, as may be the genuine SABIAN BX8 shown on the website. People have highest expectations from none other than AMAZON.COM, burt even AMAZON.com can ditch its customers, albeit occasionally by dispatching counterfeit stuff to them. I feel dejected after getting ditched by this leading e-commerce website. I can shre the photo of the received Cymbal as well. It sounds DUD. Disgusting Experience. I burnt my hard earned money.
