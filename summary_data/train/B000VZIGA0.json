I ordered this and a couple diamond bits because I was worried that the carbide bits (comes with four) might not be hard and tough enough to engrave all the tools. This engraver worked fantastic. I used only one of the included carbide bits to engrave all the tools, and it\u2019s still very sharp. It should provide a long life of engraving. I also tried one of the diamond bits on a couple tool. Worked just as good as the carbide. Happy engraving!",

My only gripe (and I do feel it's worth knocking off two stars because I'm anal about things like that) is that the engraver tip movement is not limited to only in and out motions. It will periodically also deflect side to side or up and down, making it impossible to get straight lines or smooth curves with any degree of predictability. So yes, it will do its job in that you can scribe legible characters onto solid surfaces permanently however, I like a little finish quality in things and the end results of this are similar to a toddler writing his name for the first time.",
