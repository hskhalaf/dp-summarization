      "text": "So I\u2019ve owned and used the Anycubic Photon S since April and made hundreds of prints with it using the regular resin. Traditionally UV resin has a lot of odor and is very toxic. I can\u2019t speak to the chemical nature of this new eco resin, but it is far superior in terms of air quality. The test prints I did were perfect with no decreeable flaws whatsoever. This resin seems fantastic all be it a little pricier than the regular and limited for now to a very bright pastel color selection. I\u2019m quite happy all together though, and will certainly buy more.",

I rinse and cure it just like any other resin, but without the headache.",

My only complaints are the price and the fact it settles or separates quickly and needs to be stirred between prints. Lives up to its claim of low odor, but even better when combined with a filter mod for the Photon. The translucent resins are great for models you plan to paint as you can hold it up to a light and see where you\u2019ve missed the primer but are harder to make out the details on otherwise. 10/10 would recommend.",

I was also VERY pleased with the models that I was able to produce. To me there is an observable difference from my use of other resins, and the excellent finish, hardness, and resolution obtained from my ANYCUBIC Photon printer with this resin, surpassed my initial assumptions regarding resins in general from the safety, use, and model quality obtained!",

Non-toxic, earth friendly, virtually odor free -- it captures astonishing detail and continues to impress me with every print, and the cleanup prior to UV curing with just dish soap makes the entire process a breeze.

I never had a print failure with this resin. The other resins I\u2019ve used always irritated my throat and lungs. This resin gave me little to no irritation whatsoever. Do keep in mind though safety is first. Always use a respirator and gloves when handling these type of resins. No matter how safe they are marketed to be. The only downside to buying this resin is the price. I hope that in the future they will have lower prices.",

This performs just as well as traditional anycubic or elegoo resin, and if anything cleanup is a bit easier, as I find the supports easier to remove. The reduced odor is ideal for someone who has their machine in a workspace or area they frequently inhabit. The only reason I do not give this product 5 stars is the price makes it prohibitive for use in volume, and at the time of this review it is not available in grey. It is however a fantastic resin!",
