I have searched far and wide for a glove which provides both warmth, and allows for the right amount of dexterity required for the physical manifestation of the Wu Tang logo. Most manufacturers fail to even mention the capability of their gloves in this regard, so imagine my joy when I saw from the product image that these gloves were specifically designed with the discerning Clan member in mind.

Then when you take them off and put them on later again they work just fine. Does this have to do with body temperature? Not sure....overall though I'm happy with this purchase.

      "text": "These gloves are a \"glorified\" version of the dollar store gloves I bought for my kids when they were little. They are stretchy and would fit a variety of hand sizes, but they do not offer a lot of warmth. They were described as \"wool lined\" and if there's any wool at all, it is weaved into the product. The touch screen aspect didn't initially work, and I had to take the gloves off to use my phone. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Theses are gloves for a child, not an adult trying to keep their hands warm and use their phone or any touch screen at the same time.",

And you really can operate a touchscreen phone and home security system while wearing said gloves. They are comfortable and keep your hands warm when the temperatures are in the 30s. Would they keep your hands warm when the temps drop below freezing? I'll know when that happens, if that happens this winter. (It doesn't happen every winter in Las Vegas.) But you can't operate a cell phone while wearing big ol' ski gloves.",

They are too slippery to make good driving gloves and are definitely not stylish. I wouldn't wear them to anyplace I want to look nice.",
