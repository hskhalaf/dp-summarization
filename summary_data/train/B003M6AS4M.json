      "text": "The mirror and suction cups function very well, and the build quality is fine. However, the design just isn't functional as it's envisioned. The metal prongs shown to be a razor holder slant downward and do not have a lip. This does not securely hold your razor (it falls constantly). Eventually I just took pliers to the thing and fixed it myself by adding a lip in the metal. My other complaint is the upper rack. It's designed to hold one standard sized shaving cream can, but realistically that's not a typical use case. Why is it designed in a way where it can't also hold soap or different shaped shaving cream containers?",

The mirror is distorted, kind of looks like a fun house mirror. And there is a film that develops on it. I image this is some kind of anti fog coating. But instead of fogging, this coating kind of turns into a gel on the mirror surface. After the mirror fell off, I didn't bother to put it back up.",
