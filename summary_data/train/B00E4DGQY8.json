La Croix was recommended for his new 'Paleo' diet (lifetime change) and he loves the 'hit' that it gives him, as soda did. I was so happy to find this flavor on Amazon and we now buy it on a regular basis,",

I still not 100% on which flavor I like best because its all natural contains no artificial sweeteners such as High Fructose Corn Syrup and Aspartame. Some of these negative reviewers do not know what they are talking about why they don't like the taste some how. Rule of thumb on the major other brands of Soft Drink sellers.
