I bought cheap last winter, they overheated and were always slipping down the seat and bunching up - these don't do that nor do they overheat and burn when I'm wearing denim jeans. I would recommend you pay a bit more and buy these. I like them! Halfway through winter and they work well. So far so good! They don't burn like some other brands. Another update: Used the winter, now going into spring - these are great! Yes, I'd recommend them!",

My 12 volt lighter turns off automatics after 60 mins so no worries about draining the battery if left on. I installed this on my 2017 F-150 with cloth seats. Non slip and stays in place when exiting the car. Easy install as well and it blends in with my upholstery for a good match. I was going paybfor something cheaper, but overall this was the better fit.",

My legs hold it down enough, that's why it's leaning forward off of the seat bottom, a little bit. I am sure the clips would curve it to the seat's shape. There are 2 clips included. I have a Fiat 500x and was worried it'd be to big, but it fits perfectly. I like that i's cut out to fit inside the seat design as opposed to overlapping. Hope the pics help. I highly recommend it.",

It doesn\u2019t shift around/move on my seat either. I drive a Cadillac CTS and I can\u2019t get my hands under my seat enough to attach the front clips but it doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s still not moving. It heats up hot too! I have fibromyalgia so I will be using this year round.",

      "text": "Installed this on 1996 diesel truck as the heater in the old diesel trucks doesn't work very well. It was easy to install. The instructions are not very good. They are translated from Chinese using a simple translate so it's English is broken and doesn't always make sense. It's pretty simple to install thou. It will make your seat uncomfortable. It does not stretch when you sit on it like a regular seat will so the seat will be quite firm. The heater part works well. On my old truck even with the truck running about 30 minutes it will drain the battery quite a bit. So be careful not to run your battery down to far.",

      "text": "Great warmer.. warms fairly quickly, gets pretty warm as well. Nice and toasty. love the thin soft material. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the clips for the base aren't very well designed. Will probably end up using some sort of small bungee cord to secure the warmer underneath this car seat..",
