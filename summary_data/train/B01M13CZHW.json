I definitely have screws at home that will do the job, but they will not have a rounded head, and they will not have the same finish, so the hooks will look like a lazy, crappy installation job. I would pay a dollar more to get these delivered with both short and long screws.",

There isn't any template so getting the screws in the right position without the hooks leaning one way or the other is a bit challenging. If I had seen them in person prior to purchasing I would have chosen something else as I could have compared my hooks with these and found an exact match.",

These hooks were easy to install but I used shorter screws than the ones that were provided, which were apparently meant to mount these hooks on a wall and were so long that they would have gone all the way through our door.",
