      "text": "I'm sure this pillow is good for some, but definitely not for larger or muscular people. The main issue is, YOU CANNOT RETURN THE PILLOW. the density of the foam is firm, which is good in this case, but the pillow itself is pretty thin. I saw the measurements of the pillow before purchasing, but didn't realize how thin it was until I received and tried a few nights. It's good underneath the knees/legs, but it terrible for a side sleeper, especially someone like me who's muscular, because the pillow moves a lot during sleep and I ended waking up with it not even between my legs. It should work for smaller people though.",

It is indeed very firm; perhaps it just wasn't the best answer for my specific issues - I was looking for lumbar and neck support. What this pillow does do well, though, is quickly discolor. From what? I don't know, but after about a week of normal use (and proper bathing by its user!), it was an upsetting orange-y color. And I've never been able to bleach it back. Using this pillow is better than using nothing, but I'm not crazy about it.",

I'm a culprit of both of these modalities. After my recent purchase of this pillow, I've had less of neck pain upon waking and it's also helped me by supporting my neck property so that sleeping on my back has become more comfortable.",
