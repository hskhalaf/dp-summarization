Everything that I have cooked in it so far has turned out awesome. My husband has been amazed! Everything that I go to cook in it he says \u201cif it cooks that I will be a believer\u201d. It has cooked everything so far from beans, rice, chicken, potatoes to sole fish. He now wants to use it instead of ho-humming at it. This has been fun. My only complaint is that it only has room for two pots, I need four. Haha!",

We have cooked pork roasts, corn on the cob, hard boiled eggs in the cardboard carton, country style pork ribs, baked potatoes, and even rice! And meatloaf. With this oven it is not necessary to continually focus on the sun. The average temperature is 225 degrees. And we have reduced the need for air conditioning because the cooking is outside!! It's great! Would highly recommend this product for every household. The unit is so sturdy that you never need to worry about wind, either.",
