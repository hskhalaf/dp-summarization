This heat tape is not cheap, but it's way cheaper than a complete bathrrom remodel after gutting it to the studs and replacing drywall, carpet, pad, and paint in the adjacent bedroom like I did last year.",

I have a gutter, and drain, on the floor of a second floor rooftop deck that is over my dining room. One year, a cheaper product failed, unbeknownst to me, and the drain was frozen with ice. We got a heavy rainstorm, on Christmas Eve, no less, and the rain, having no where to drain, backed up onto the deck, and leaked down into the living room below. This cable has kept the drain flowing all winter.",

I recommend installing on a warm day or maybe leave it laying out in the sun for a while before installation. You could also plug it in for a bit to warm it up. I replaced some old Frost King heat tape that was easily 10+ years old. This HeatTapePro seem MUCH tougher and I hope it will last even longer and work much better. We've had a couple storms (16 inches of snow) and it seemed to do pretty well. I'm happy.",

I've laid the tape along the underside of the downspout from my gutter all the way down to where the downspout enters a 40+ foot PVC drain pipe that runs under a rock pile to the street. The tape is fastened to the downspout with cable ties so that it lies directly against the metal downspout and then enters the pipe where it runs inside to just short of the street. The ten foot cold lead is a real advantage allowing me to locate the electrical outlet for it in a convenient location.",

    "description": "Size:18 FeetWe have actual humans available by phone. Heat cable is technical stuff and it\u2019s great to have solid advice on how to install it for your ice dam prevention project. We are the only heat cable seller on Amazon who is a simple phone call away 877-387-4218. Eat that impersonal, off shore competitors! Our cables are bad ass and so is our customer service. We\u2019re not sure if we can swear on Amazon, but we just did. Radiant Solutions Company is a direct-to-consumer manufacturer with over 25 years in the business of ice dam prevention. Unlike cheap cables, Heat Tape Pro can be overlapped during installation, can be installed on flat roofs, metal roofs and rubber roofs, will not light leaves on fire under any circumstance and operates effectively when it\u2019s 15 degrees or colder outside. Oh, and Heat Tape Pro is self-regulating, meaning it \u2018asks\u2019 for more energy as it gets colder outside and less energy when it\u2019s warmer. The entire length of the cable is temperature sensitive such that colder areas demand more power than warmer areas. Hence the term \u201cSelf-Regulating\u201d. Heat Tape Pro is serious stuff and holding it in your hand will tell you as much. It\u2019s a worry-free, long term solution to your ice dam problems. Our cable creates melted pathways through ice or snow on your roof that allow water to escape instead of backing up through your roof system. Problem solved. Heat Tape Pro can be used for roof and gutter de-icing as well as pipe freeze protection. It\u2019s suitable on pipes as small as \u00bd\u201d in diameter and can be used on both metal and plastic pipes. Be sure to order recommended installation accessories including Roof Clips and Downspout Hangers if needed.Product Description",
