I'm 5' 8\" and without shoes it just reaches the top of my foot. However with the right dainty stiletto sandals it still worked.

Foundation garments mandatory if you want a smooth, tight look. The sleeves are also snug but not cutting off circulation or anything. Overall, this is an incredible steal and a dress you can wear for so many occasions. Dress it down with simple hair, minimal makeup and only one piece of jewelry. Nothing needed to dress it up!",

The \"V\" neck isn't too low. It's a very classy looking dress. Note: I don't recommend this dress if you have a big belly.

I normally wear a size 8 and feel more comfortable in a 10. I bought the XL and it was WAY too big! The medium would have been perfect. I gave the XL to a friend as a gift and she loved it!!!",

The dress is very comfortable, and didn't show as much cleavage as I thought (a good thing, in my case!). The only thing is if you have a little bit of a tummy, you will probably want to wear spanx! It will definitely show. And with my work event being a dinner, spanx will be a must for me. Overall, however, I'd recommend!",

I can fix it with some tall shoes, but it might be tough for ladies who are shorter, at least with the large. I generally wear a large, being that I'm 5'5\" and 160lbs, and this large seems to have a comfortable amount of room, even in the arms, which is generally a problem for me. Problem two - there's a band at the back meant to frame your derriere, but the lining keeps it from being secure, so there will likely be some tugging to keep it in place. But for the price, this dress is amazing.",

Ideally it would zip up the back or the side, but it doesn't. Also, if you've got tummy pooch of any kind, you'll need a slimmer of some kind underneath. The control top of pantyhose would be perfect for tummy support with this dress. If you're thinking about it - just do it! It's fantastic. Totally classy!",

The dress was definately too long for me, and I didn't have time to get it hemmed, but it was manageable with some heals and holding the dress up. Definately get it hemmed, though, if you are short and you have the time. I would definately recommend, especially for the price.",

You will be receiving more orders soon, get ready! It does need to be sprayed with Static Guard, but other than that, it is an amazing dress -- so classy, so comfortable, and an amazing price!

The under $50 price tag made me wonder if it would be a flimsy, 'one and done' sort of dress, but it is actually very well constructed and easily withstood a nine hour day (including a lot of dancing!) without ripping or pulling out of shape. I've hand washed and flat-dried it without a problem, too.",

The dress has some stretch which is helpful for individual types. there is a small trim piece on the outside of the dress over the seams at the hips area that does not show up well in the pictures, and this does not stretch as well as the rest of the dress so there is some pulling here. I am usually a Large-Xl body type, and the XL is snug. the stretch helps, but if there was no stretch, this would not fit. It is long. I'm 5'7'' and wearing heals it still probably touches the floor all the way around.",

The right sleeve seemed a little tight. And the dress was shorter than I expected but ended up being a perfect length for my 5'-4\" height; I was able to wear lower more comfortable heels. The bow sat perfectly upon the top of my belly. But the seam that is below that bow-seam was not very flattering around back; it kept sliding up and was tight on the rear. But it all ended up working perfectly. Very comfortable dress!! Even 6-months pregnant.",

I read the other reviews and they all said pretty much the same thing \"the fit is pretty good to size\" I would have preferred if someone had said if you're a small order the small and if you're a medium order the medium and so on and so forth.",
