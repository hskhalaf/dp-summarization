In my first bluetoth helmet with microphone, so I can't make comparisons, but I have a WP-300 (no microphone) and it works great. In this case I wanted to try this version that includes a microphone. With this, the audio that I receive from the headphones is not fluid when the microphone is activated. Reception is deactivated when the sound source stops for one minute. when the sound source plays again the sound becomes intermittent. I have to deactivate / undock them and reconnect for the connection to return.",

Great battery life, comfortable, very easy to use controls (not so with many headphones). It stays on my head doing cardio or weightlifting, good for hikes too. Hell, I have them on now. Downer: the voice feature is mediocre. People on the other end have a hard time hearing me so this is emergency use only.",

However, I have been looking for a great set of bluetooth headphones that don't break the bank and these are them! These would be incredible at any price, but for around $60 they are amazing. The clarity of sound and bass are fantastic, the range is the best I have experienced, and setup is a breeze. They are also amazingly comfortable. I already own the Jabra (comfortable, sound OK, range is terrible), and the Go-groove air band (these are very good and range is good), but the WP-350 are the absolute best in every area. Highly recommended ! (in fact, I'm buying another set).",

When you place the cups on your ears to fit, the strap over your head comes way forward. It's a weird design choice. Apart from that, they seemed to function okay for the few minutes I used them. They're small and lightweight, and seem like they would probably be comfortable for extended wear.",

The first thing I did was watch a movie and the sound was very good. I did have to read the book to figure out how to turn them off.

      "text": "I was expecting this Bluetooth headset to be better than my Plantronic 995 with 2.4 GHz, since the Bluetooth is the newer technology. I was wrong. My Plantronic 995 sounds many times better, especially when watching a movie. I'm not saying WP-350 is bad, its just okay, its just barely good enough to listen to music during my gym session. I'm not an audio geek, so I cannot say what's missing from this headphone, whether its the mid/low high or bass, I don't know. I just know that its lower sound quality than my other headphones. I've tried to use it with apt-x devices, windows, ipad, xperia phone, its all the same. Something is missing in audio quality.",
