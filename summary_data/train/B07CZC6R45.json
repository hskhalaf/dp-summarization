      "title": "Works Well",
      "text": "I was surprised at how accurate the gauge appears to read. My 20Lb propane was near empty and I ran it dry watching the gauge accurately show the diminishing quantity. The only down side is that you can't use a 'tree' on one side as the valve will rotate due to the greater weight on the side with the tree connection. This really only matters if you are trying to put a lantern on top the 'tree' though.",
