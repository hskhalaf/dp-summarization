But for crying out loud, when a box says fragile all over it in three different languages, and \"GLASS\" is printed in big-ass red letters that Helen Keller could read, don't throw the box around like it's roofied coed during spring fling. I'm thru trying. I'm sure somewhere, somehow glass can be successfully shipped. But not to me, not today.",
