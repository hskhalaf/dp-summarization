It helps to ensure the rice doesnt stick as well. When cooking is finished, unplug it and let it steam. The warm feature will still cook your finished rice making it overcooked. As a caterer/chef, it has my approval.",

But if you do put the steamer basket in it while your cooking rice there is no mess at all. I've steamed frozen vegetables in it and at the same time added meat on top of that and it seems to cook everything in there perfect, and its all ready at the same time. I have cooked fish, shrimp, and even chicken in it. I couldnt be happier with the results.",

A lot of rice cookers have issues with spitting water while it\u2019s cooking but if you put the white steam container in this one while it\u2019s cooking, it stops it from spitting water. Also, some rice cookers will burn the rice to the bottom of the pot *cough* Aroma *cough* which makes it super hard to clean them, but this rice cooker doesn\u2019t leave any burnt rice at the bottom of the pot. Overall it\u2019s a great rice cooker and the only one I can recommend",

The medium grain was not undercooked and adding other ingredients into the rice didn't affect it. I look forward to trying other recipes like yellow rice mixed with cod \"arroz con bacalao\" and it comes with a basket so I shall give it a try with a piece of boneless poultry or maybe seafood.",

    "description": "Making rice and whole grains in the Hamilton Beach Electric Rice Cooker & Food Steamer is as easy as placing the ingredients in the nonstick bowl and turning it on. The rice will cook perfectly on its own, giving you time to prepare the rest of your meal. There\u2019s no need to worry about boiling water, adjusting the temperature or even setting a timer - it will automatically shift to warm once the cook cycle is complete. And with a 16 Cup cooked rice Capacity, you\u2019ll have enough to feed a crowd. Use the included 2-in-1 basket to rinse rice or grains ahead of cooking, or use it to steam everything from salmon to zucchini. Clean up is a snap with the dishwasher safe nonstick cooking bowl and rice rinser/steam basket. The lid liner can also be removed for quick cleaning.",
