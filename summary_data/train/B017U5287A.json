I'd rather just toss what I can in the toilet and toss the liner in the liner laundry bag everytime. Maybe if they were longer, we could tuck the back into the pocket of the diaper and it may help it stay in a good place",

I tip solids into toilet and throw into trash. Just saves me the hassle of having to rinse the diapers. I pretty much know my kids poop schedule so only use a liner once a day. They do remain a bit wet from pee though which isn't ideal but we haven't really had issues with rashes or anything.",

I wouldn't recommend flushing it though, in all honestly if you throw out dirty diapers already you know what the expected smell is going to be.

These are much thicker and more cloth-like which makes them slide around between my baby's bottom and the cloth diaper. They bunch up horribly when wet, so if the diaper was wet before it was soiled, the liner will very likely be useless in containing the solids. They're also slightly smaller than GroVia's which is clearly a downside, especially for toddler diapering. I don't like these at all.",

First, I notice you have to double them up to get them to work.Using just 1 strip isn't enough. When I use 1 strop it crumples and sticks to my baby. Therefore, I have to peel this wipe and the poop off of her. Prior to purchasing I read the reviews and it seems they're not flush-able. I haven't tried so I can't speak to that.",
