I had registered the umbrella within the first 30 days after purchasing it, so I emailed EEZ-Y customer service. They responded within minutes, even though it was in the evening. I explained the situation and sent a couple of photos to demonstrate. In less than a week, I received a brand-new replacement! Yea EEZ-Y!!",

It seems to be a very high quality umbrella and if I had to say anything negative about it, it\u2019s that the spring can be a bit strong for some. Also it is a little heavier than those cheap umbrellas you find for $8 but I think it will last years longer than them using better quality materials. Overall I really like the umbrella and actually ended up buying 4 of them for my friends and one for my wife. If you\u2019re tired of buying cheap umbrellas that last a few months, I can happily recommend this umbrella.",

A typical male college student, my son didn't think he'd ever carry an umbrella, but after using once he was sold and carries it with him in the water bottle pocket on his daypack if there's a chance of rain.

About as sturdy as the cheapie umbrellas you can get on a street corner in any major city during a rain storm. 2. It is difficult to close, particularly when it is wet.

Even with the weight of hers, she has almost lost it a few times in the wind while I can easily hold onto this lightweight umbrella thanks to the ventilation layer. Some of the reviews state that it's hard to close, which is true if you try to push it shut with your hands, but I just push it up against a wall or a step leading indoors and it easily shuts.",

I still got drenched, but I don't think any umbrella can completely protect from severe rain that is blowing in every direction. I will have to see how it does in less severe rainstorms. But, it does seem to be made very sturdy and the auto open/close works wonderfully.",

Therefore, that little slip cover is useless. It is really bulky. It's also extremely hard to close (surprisingly). But I do like the idea of it having a sunshade so I will keep it for that.",

Got caught in a downpour in Switzerland and had the only umbrella that held up to the wind and rain as compared to my fellow travelers! Thanks for a great product.",
