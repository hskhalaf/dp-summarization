Nope. 2 days after recieving the replacement, horizontal lines on the bottom of the monitor appeared, the line have slowly gone across more of the monitor over the course of a day. 0/5 Obviously some massive manufactuaring / quality issues with this device.

The size is amazing especially in 1440p lots of multitasking advantages and gaming. Using a 5700xt and boy does it perform great on this. As long as it's not faulty, it's all good.

Despite being TN panel the image quality is really good, the viewing angles arent an issue at all and the construction is sturdy and stable. Overall im happy with the purchase. HDMI cable included so no need to buy separately. To the marketing team you should change the wallpaper on the illustration photos because the one you used rather rejects than attracts due to it looking fuzzy and doesnt really show the screen potential",
