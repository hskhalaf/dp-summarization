My D7 was bad out of the box -- the LIDAR sensor would error out (error 4000) so frequently I was unable to complete a single run. Their tech support was beyond useless, all the way to insulting -- they were unable to provide any help beyond what I'd already online (\"have you tried turning it on and off again?\" \"Can you try cleaning the sensors?\" (shouldn't need to clean a BRAND NEW OUT OF BOX unit)",

      "text": "Great vac! I love the constant software updates. It now has more features then when we bought it in Dec 2018. I can tell it to go clean the kitchen. It it will, just the kitchen. Battery life it good. It does about 800-950Sq ft on 1pass.if it not done, it will go on its base, charge up and finish the job. The bin is easy to empty and clean. Same with the brush. No tools needed. We have a dog and kid and 2 adults. It does a great job keeping the floors clean. I have it on schedule for every other day. No issues. Best purchase I made in a while.",

It doesn\u2019t have that kind of suction but I don\u2019t have to vacuum as often.",

Also, it can\u2019t really navigate around cables, so it gets stuck on those too so be aware in case you\u2019re a newbie too. overall, i think its a great buy if youre looking for a high quality vacuum with a solid price. And cleaning/emptying the vacuum is SUPER easy, so you really dont need the super new Roomba with the auto suction which just pulls more money from you.",

Poor quality: After just over a month, the side brush stopped functioning. Easy to confuse: The botvac is supposed to save a floor plan once it runs with barriers set up (e.g., closed doors) and then use it thereafter. However, the botvac is endlessly needing to create a new floorplan. This prevents the automated running of the unit, and we end up needing to listen to the noisy vacuum when trying to study and work. It defeats much of the purpose of having this unit.",

P.S: my wife went after it one day with a swiffer, and it came back clean. So it passed the test.",
