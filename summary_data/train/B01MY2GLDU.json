      "text": "We liked the way this looked in the bathroom, and its easy on-off operation. The electrician noted it would take a while to actually heat up (much longer than a shower) so he recommended leaving it on. It doesn't use much electricity and it takes so long to get warm, that is what we have to do. But it helps dry the bathroom, so it is worth it.",

      "text": "This product is overall a good towel warmer. It works well and is very efficient in warming up my towels quickly. The product comes with plastic plug anchors with screws, which only works with solid walls, not drywalls. These plug anchors did not work well so I had to buy separate anchors that would work for walls. But other then that, I like this product and would recommend it to anyone. This product is good for one big towel or multiple small towels just because of its size.",
