There are probably better sounding head sets out there, but they are over twice the price of these. I did experience what one reviewer's complaint about them making your ears sore after hours of wearing. However I just turned the earphones to a slight different angle and was good for hours of musical enjoyment. Additionally the microphone is good quality. I have taken phone calls with them for months, and haven't had a complaint yet. I love all my JBL products.",

Ear pads are soft and flexible. If you buy beats or bose you are overpaying. JBL is a quality brand with quality products. Encourage anyone looking for moderately priced bluetooth headphones to give these a try. Note: I have not tried the mic (not hugely important to me). I purchased the warranty with Assurian for $15.xx and have found Assurian always backs the refund with no questions asks and pays full retail that you paid (even years down the road).",

Also, the cans stick out more than I prefer from the ears. Otherwise, these are really nice headphones. The charge lasts for many hours and they only take a couple hours or less to charge. The bluetooth connectivity is a great convenience, especially if you're moving around while listening preventing a cable form getting in the way.",

So now I'm stuck with $130 worth of plastic junk. Next time I will go to Best Buy where at least I'll be covered if I have an issue. Take my advice and don't waste your money on this",

After 3 months of normal use the arm has broken and the headphones are completely unusable. While normally extending the arms to remove the headphones from around my neck, the arm broke out of the plastic frame. There's no way to save it, for headphones this expensive, to only last 3 months with standard use is just shameful.",

Initially, the headphones are a bit complicated to use and take some time getting use to. 2. The control panels are touch activated which some would find an inconvenience where in reality takes a simple fix: don't touch the sensors. Other than that, the headphones are very stylish, loud, clear/smooth and hightech.",
