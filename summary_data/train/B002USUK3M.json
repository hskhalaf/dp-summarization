I bought it specifically to slide under the end of my counter- perfect, not only does it fit under, it also fits nicely front to back without taking up any extra room. I removed the basket- now my kitchenaid mixer fits like a charm, clearing off the counter top when I'm not baking- added pics to see the plan. There is no downside to this product if it fits your needs, I live in a small apt, and this snugs up just fine BTW, I'm just a buyer, although it sounds like a paid tester.",

I'm an engineer, and yes there's only 1 way to assemble some of these things and yes that way is actually backwards(holes were drilled in the opposite positions). This results in a product that doesn't really do what it's supposed to do. There was also a sticker on the topmost surface of the granite and that was a pain to remove without using chemicals that I wouldn't want in my food.",

Directions could have been a little bit easier to read as some of it didn\u2019t seem well labeled enough, but other than that it was super easy to put together. It also went together quite quickly even though I was the only person putting it together. The granite countertop probably could have had at least two more pegs to hold it on for some extra hold, but it seems to be sitting just fine. Would definitely recommend this if someone\u2019s looking for a smaller cart without sacrificing enough storage.",

Otherwise my admiration for the overall design, quality and finish of the wood, and especially the precision of the cuts, the milling and drilling, and labeling of the parts (all of them, down to the tiniest screws!) and the clarity and accuracy of the assembly documentation had me shouting my appreciation. I highly recommend any product by this group.",

It rocks and rolls quite a bit with any heavy dough. It is perfect for rolling out crackers, crusts, etc. - so it's a small complaint really. It provides a heat proof place to put down hot things, another work surface of decent size if you have an extra cook to put to work (in a small kitchen) and overall it's pretty great.",

I did not like the original wood color but I bought it knowing I was going to paint it. Very happy with this purchase.",

The parts all have numbered stickers on them, which helps greatly, but make sure you look at the pictures carefully so that you don't put a piece in backwards, upside down, etc. Once assembled, it is solid and sturdy and looks quite nice, especially the granite top.",
