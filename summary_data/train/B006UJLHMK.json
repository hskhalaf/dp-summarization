The biggest problem is its very difficult to wash bc you have to remove all the foam, and if you don't put a waterproof mattress cover around the foam pad you will run into trouble with stinky foam. It basically rolls into a large duffle bag, so may be difficult for plane travel but fine for car travel.",

He loves his new special travel bed! It is surprisingly light to carry. Easy to get into its bag, and love that it can be folded into a couch.",

It is really a great bed my son even took a nap in it and must of been pretty comfy because he slept for 2 hours. It is a little bigger then I anticipated but thats ok I can see him getting a lot of use out of it. The zipper thing that a lot of the other reviews is a little bit of a pain but it is manageable.",

I wonder if they even tried to wash it themselves. I'm afraid if you keep washing it (because it looks like you would have too because of the cloth covering) that it would ruin the foam fast. As soon as my toddlers stepped in it, it got dirty and the cloth is not one of those you can wipe off easily. Honestly, the price should have been half what it is now. The design is good though that's the only thing I like.",
