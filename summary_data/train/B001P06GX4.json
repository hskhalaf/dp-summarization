Our family preferred to work together to complete the game instead of \"blokusing\" the opponents. Either way is fun.",

The pieces are plastic and small so I would not recommend this game for younger kids--as they can easily put it in their mouth, swallow it, choke on it, etc. More of a game for high school students and above. This game test your mind's ability to analyze and think about geometric shapes and figures---great for visual-spatial people. We loved this game so much, we ordered one for a friend of ours and gave it to them as a gift. Would highly recommend to anyone who loves board games!",

You can teach Blokus in a few minutes, takes ~30 minutes to play and after you have played once or twice you can already begin to see all of the stratagey, but this game still has tons of replayability. Very fun if you are looking for a quick strategy game that people will actually play.",

My three year old and 9 year old request to play this game almost every night. There's not much to it, but the strategy behind the game is what makes it interesting and fun to play, and them knowing the simple instructions is all it takes to smoothly play the game without having to reiterate the instructions. I recommend this game for any family!",

Both my 7 & 10 year olds enjoy it. But beware, there are some colored block pieces are pretty small (3/8\" square) and can get easily lost or swallowed :O ... so keep away from babies & small kids.

It teaches strategy and requires the players to think about what their next move is at each stage of the game. Some games when it isn't the players turn can't hold the kids attention because they role a dice and go a few places or pull a card and do what it says. This game requires the player to always pay attention and think about their next move. We have had so much fun we bought it for 2 other kids and they both love it as well.",

It makes you think about the number and shape as you place each piece on the game board. Highly recommended!",
