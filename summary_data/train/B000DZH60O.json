I really like this model,Sony has come out with other version's, based on this one, which are slightly better,however,if you have one of these,or want to buy a used one don't hesitate,it is an excellent camera for all around basic photography",

They work fine even the 50mm stock lense that came with the Maxxum 7000 that I started with. I have shot some photos using the old lenses and the new one that came with the camera (18-70mm). I like the camera very much and it fits really nice in my hands. I have not had the chance to really push the limits of the camera but I really don't do that anyway...so the camera fits my needs.",

I have had the camera for a month and it has been all I expected. The super steady feature truly gives two f stops. The kit lens is useful and quite a bargin. I use it more than I thought I would. I truly get the same feel and results that I did with my old Maxxium SLR.",

    "title": "Sony Alpha A100K 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera Kit with 18-70mm f3.5-5.6 Lens",
    "description": "Cl) Sony Dslr-A100Kw/18-70Mm F/3.5-4\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWhy Sony? Because people want to take better pictures--and the all-new Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera makes it easier to explore all the creative possibilities of digital photography. Sony electronic innovations for higher sensitivity, smoother image stabilization, and superior picture quality give the \u03b1 system spectacular DSLR performance with amazing simplicity. Along with superb Sony and Carl Zeiss lenses and a full range of professional accessories, the Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera also builds on 20 years of Minolta camera optics to provide instant compatibility with over 16 million A-mount lenses sold worldwide.\n\n With advanced electronics, superb Sony and Carl Zeiss lenses, and amazing creative capabilities, the Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera brings better pictures within easy reach. It introduces Sony imaging innovations like high-sensitivity shooting with Super SteadyShot in-camera image stabilization, Dynamic Range Optimizer to automatically increase detail in bright and dark picture areas, new Anti-Dust technology to keep the CCD imager clean for better pictures, and Eye-Start Autofocus system for faster camera response. It also builds on a two-decade legacy of Minolta photographic leadership, accepting millions of A-mount lenses sold worldwide.\n\n Please note: The \"K\" in this camera's model number indicates that it is a kit version of the DSLR-A100.\n\n Superior Electronics, Amazing Simplicity\nIn the revolutionary new Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera, Sony digital technology takes you a giant step toward professional performance--with advanced imaging, image stabilization, and creative control functions, plus ease of operation that helps everyone take better digital pictures right from the start.\n\n Advanced Lenses and Accessories\nThe Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera is your gateway to an incredibly sophisticated array of lenses and accessories--including precision Sony standard and zoom lenses, Sony \"G\" Series lenses with advanced motorized autofocusing, amazingly bright Carl Zeiss T* coated lenses, professional-quality flash units, and compatibility with over 16 million Maxxum, Dynax, and A-mount lenses sold worldwide.\n\n \n\nThe Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100's CCD system provides SteadyShot image stabilization and anti-dust vibration. 10-Megapixel Super HAD CCD\nA large APS-size CCD imager with Sony's advanced Super HAD (Hole Accumulated Diode) design allows more light to pass to each pixel, increasing sensitivity, reducing noise, and providing greater detail when you make big prints or crop in close on your subject. Super SteadyShot Optical Image Stabilization\nWhen you shoot with high sensitivity, the shutter remains open longer--so to compensate for shaky hands or fast-moving subjects, the Sony Super SteadyShot system automatically reduces image blur. And because it works in-camera, you'll get the benefit of Super SteadyShot stabilization with every lens you use.\n\n Sharp, Clear Photos that Preserve the Mood\nWith high-sensitivity (ISO 1600) shooting, the Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera captures great photos without flash even in low light--which makes it an ideal system camera for shooting without a tripod or in locations (like museums and churches) where flash is prohibited.\n\n \n\nStatic-free anti-dust coating and the A100's anti-dust vibration system keep the CCD free of the dust that can mar images.\n(See larger image.) Anti-Dust Technology\nChanging lenses in a DSLR can allow dust to enter the camera--so to keep the CCD imager clean for better pictures, the Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera utilizes both static-free anti-dust coating on the CCD filter and anti-dust vibration that automatically shakes the CCD to dislodge dust each time the camera is shut off. Dynamic Range Optimizer\nTo recover details in dark or bright areas of the picture, the Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera provides two levels of Dynamic Range Optimization: Normal DRO, to improve shadow detail using standard gamma curves for fast shot-to-shot response time, or Advanced DRO, to adjust dynamic range area-by-area for the greatest precision.\n\n Bionz Image Processor\nAt the heart of the Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera is the advanced Bionz Image Processor, using hardware-based Large Scale Integrated (LSI) circuitry that responds ten times faster than software image processors--improving camera response time, handling Dynamic Range Optimization processing, and extending Stamina battery life.\n\n \n\nTo reduce blur and increase response time, an Eye-Start Autofocus sensor begins the DSLR-A100's precision autofocus adjustments the moment you bring your eye to the viewfinder. Eye-Start Autofocus System\nSome DSLR systems don't start focusing until the shutter button is half-pressed--but that can slow down camera response. The Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera begins its precision autofocus adjustments the moment you bring your eye to the viewfinder, to capture fast-action subjects other cameras might blur. 2.5-Inch Clear Photo LCD Plus Screen\nThe Clear Photo LCD Plus design of the Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera's built-in screen makes it easy to read camera setup menus even in bright sunlight--and gives you a better picture when you use your screen to set up shots and check results.\n\n Continuous Burst Mode at 3 Frames Per Second\nTo catch fast action more effectively, the Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera offers continuous JPEG image capture up to the limit of your flash memory card--plus RAW Burst Mode (up to six shots) with intelligent buffer management to allow more shots to be captured without waiting for the buffer to clear.\n\n 18-70mm f3.5-4.5 Lens\nThe Sony \u03b1 A100 kit includes a 18-70mm f3.5-4.5 3.9x zoom lens, equivalent to 27-105mm in 35mm photography.\n\n Super-Accurate Exposure Control\nA 40-segment honeycomb sensing system provides multi-pattern measuring for superior exposure control accuracy.\n\n Flexible Exposure Modes\nFor greater creative freedom in a wide range of shooting conditions, the Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera provides full manual exposure control as well as Program Auto, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, and Exposure Compensation modes.\n\n 9-Point Autofocus Selection\nThe Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera gives you all the focusing options you need for composing your shot with foreground, background or off-center subjects--including manual focus point selection, Spot AF, Continuous AF, and AF Lock.\n\n Lithium Ion Battery with Stamina Power\nA supplied NP-FM55H Lithium Ion rechargeable battery lets you take up to 600 shots on a full charge, recharges quickly with supplied battery charger.\n\n Dual Media Options\nThe Sony \u03b1 DSLR-A100 camera accepts both CompactFlash Type I/II media and optional Memory Stick Duo media (with supplied adaptor).",
