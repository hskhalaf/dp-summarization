If you know how to tune and/or dampen a snare (or just watch a few youtube videos on how) you can get a decent, non-irritating tone out of this, sufficient for practicing buzz-roll and other rudiments. This would never make a good concert snare, but it's fine for practice. Without tuning and/or dampening, you'll get an irritating metal ringing. I solved this within minutes (to dampen I just applied about a half dozen post-it notes to the batter head).",

Case is nice. Stand is a little short for tall kids. Good price if you do not want to sign a contract with the school provider and that is why you're probably reading this.",

For less than a hundred bucks, you get the drum, stand, pack, set of sticks, a case, AND the practice mat which mutes the drum sound so that practice can be done without waking the neighbors. The teacher said the set was just fine for what he was doing and it was the right price. This set deserves 6 stars for the value you get.",
