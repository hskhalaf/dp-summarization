The regular sizing fit and was wearable, but if you have a wide foot get wide width for comforts sake! So far they are comfortable and im happy with them.

The straps are so difficult to adjust but they don\u2019t even stay in place once you start moving, bending crouching, (normal activities) etc. The sandals were more frustrating to wear, and not all that comfortable, either, Due to some straps tightening too much while others become loose throughout the day.

      "text": "these sandals take a little getting used to, but once you do, they are extremely comfortable. I really like how you can adjust the straps to better fit your foot. However, the only downside I would say is that you really cannot adjust the back strap. I ordered a 9 and they are slightly large, but going down a 1/2 size wasn\u2019t an option unfortunately. I normally wear an 8 1/2 and was a little skiddish going down to an 8. I hope this helps",

For me it did not feel as good, but if you have high arches this may be a good fit for you.",

I have bunions and flat feet is what makes me feet wider than usual but NOT narrow enough to fit in most pointed heels. So far I can see why someone complained about the strap being too long...and so far I just tuck it in the back. I wear it loose enough that it doesn't rub me.",
