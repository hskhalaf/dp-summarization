It supports 5ghz too (one band at a time) but why go fast into the future when I can live in the past! 2010 was great. I was in a fraternity, met my now wife, and partied like it was 1999. This router has maxed out at about 150mbps speeds at the source (with cat6 and gigabit cables) but that\u2019s ok because I only pay for 200mb internet with xfinity. Either way I may have kids and be old now but this router helps me relive my glory days!",

I purchased this 3 years ago and it provides all the standard capabilities you'd find in most routers. This router works with the custom DD-WRT firmware which can turn this baby into a enterprise-grade router. I rarely find the need to reboot the router and so far have not run into any issues. I do tons of data transfer over gigabit and found no throttle or overheating of any sort. The wireless signal is pretty good and seem to work well even with lots of neighbors in the area also running Wi-Fi networks.",

Easy to setup (if you know what your doing) great wireless coverage, great connection speeds with wireless N and gig ports, it's pretty. The only thing that might cause some confusion for buyers is that it does not support simultaneous Dual Bands, you can run in 2.4ghz or 5ghz spectrum, but not at the same time, but who cares. This router is great, I would recommend this product to anyone looking to replace or even upgrade your existing router. Out of the box, it is ready to go, and if you're an experienced user, the setup is just as easy as it's always been with Linksys-Cisco products!",

Set-up was easy, I didn't bother to use the included CD, just logged into my router and saved my desired settings. I purchased this as it was supposed to be better for Netflix streaming, and also as I wanted to upgrade from the old G standard. Since setting it up, Netflix has streamed flawlessly (unlike my old router which constantly reset halfway through a movie), the speed via the Gigabit ports is definitely better, and the wireless speed and range is considerably better than my old Belkin Pre-N router. Solid router, I definitely recommend it.",
