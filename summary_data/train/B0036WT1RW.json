While the PS3 has great bang for the buck (game box, media server, internal HD, BD player), it's got one huge fault that I can no longer tolerate: the fan is too bloody loud! It all but drowns out the audio, so back into the box and say hello to the LG BD 570. Which is silent. Ahhhh. Setup was easy. Netflix activation was instantaneous, as was connecting to YouTube, Pandora, Picasa, and Accuweather. Streaming movies from my PC to the LG using Tversity was simplicity itself. I highly recommend this player if you need networked capabilities such as a media server and streaming Netflix movies. Outstanding.",

Live streaming WiFi: we've situated it closer to our wireless router than any of our other live streaming devices (PS3, Wii), but unlike the others, this DVD player drops the signal often and has to be reset often.

The initial set-up walks you through getting the network (WI-Fi or wired internet connection) set-up and allows you to update your firmware and preview the Netcast feature. I own an LG LED TV, so this made it even better, because the \"Simplink\" technology automatically links the two together. I pop-in a Blu-Ray, and my TV automatically converts to the Blu-Ray input and adjust the video settings. I also like the audio, MP3, and USB drive settings for pictures and music.",

However, the frailty of the firmware drops the overall score to a 3. 24p capability, which is what I primarily purchased this unit for, has been an intermittent problem. With the latest firmware as of the end of December 2010, 24p currently causes many Blu-Ray discs to skip chapters multiple times. You can change the setting to 60p and mostly eliminate the issue, but then you introduce unwanted jitter on pans and scans. If LG can finally fix this issue once and for all, then I will solidly endorse the BD570 with 5-stars. Until then, it gets only 3.",

It was also simple to plug in my USB hard drive and play movies and look at photos. I haven't tried any Blu-Ray discs yet but assume that they will play just as easily. One tip... Make sure to change the default video out to 1080p if you're connecting to a HDTV that supports it.",

It seems to \"fight through\" the scratches etc. on the DVDs we so often get from netflix. It is a blu-ray player, but on our older TV it didn't make much difference when I compared a regular DVD with a blu-ray one. My only complaint with the player is it does not allow 16:9 unless the TV can handle higher resolution. Overall it has done well.",

      "text": "I would have rated the BD570 an excellent product if not for one very annoying bug. When playing DVDs on it, it intermittently drops the HDMI video signal (audio continues playing though) for 2-4 seconds. I did not figure out it was a player problem until the 90-day warranty had expired so now I'm stuck with it. I finally found another review where the owner had the same issue. She was lucky enough to find the issue within the warranty period and have the unit replaced. So if you buy a BD570, I recommend you watch a few SD DVD's on it all the way through while it's under warranty to see if you have this issue.",

This blu-ray player did not recognize ANY wireless networks. I upgraded the firmware and that did not help. I also contacted LG and they basically told me that my wireless router was too far away from the blu-ray player. I purchased a Sony Bravia LED TV, which has the wifi capability, and it works just fine with my router.",
