They send you a lot of emails to follow up on your purchase so seemingly good customer service. Looking back, I would go with a cheaper alternative. In my case, it didn't work but it may do well for those who have a different skin composition.",

A friend told me about Deux Derme after a magazine article she read where is was on some top editor list... I decided to try it. I started ones daily and began to see pretty good results. When I stated using twice daily though it really worked... after a couple of months I couldn't be happier! Will recommend!!",

Mine are lighter in color since they are older and they are still just as visible as they were before I started using this product. Another issue I have is the container does not work as it should. I tried several times to get the lotion out by pushing down the top and it will not work so I have to unscrew the lid. I am a little disappointed since all the other reviews has awesome results.",
