The product now functions great. The only thing is that the erasers still do not work with the original expo markers I purchased. Other than that I love the product. ORIGINAL REVIEW: The boards are great but the erasers do not work AT ALL. I'm shocked there's no reviews listing this issue. I have to use water to wipe the boards clean which is an extra and pain in the butt step. Any suggestions as to how to effectively and easily clean the boards for efficient use would be much appreciated.",

I use these boards to track the status and upcoming to-do's on the various projects. Project status changes daily, often minute to minute. Instead of grabbing a notebook or sheet of paper to jot down notes that I then throw away, I use these boards. It works great and saves stacks of wasted and disorganized paper on my desk. I use fine point dry erase markers also sold on this site.",

Some colors might need a little more pressure to get off than others but the kids can do it!yay! They are a great size for little hands and big hands. The box is a great feature bc I store the markers in with the boards and erasers. Great set up. I would buy them again!",
