Here is a simple receipt that keeps them away: In a quart or so size hand sprayer, put 10 drops of peppermint oil, 1/2 ounce of Dawn dishwashing liquid and fill the rest with water.

It is cheap and effective, and has other uses too.",

I purchased this oil because my garden has been invaded by mice and didnt want to use anything toxic repellanta near my pets. This really works, I mixed about 5 drops in a spray bottle filled with water, I spray every three days all over the garden and even inside my home. The house and garden smell aswesome and even noticed less mosquitos and other bugs nearby.",

It also gives me relief from my muscle aches and pains. I mix it and put into spray bottles and lotions and found out that while it helps my headaches and muscle pain, it also keeps mosquitoes away. I was at a luau party where everyone got bit but me. Much better than chemical sprays and smells better too!! I also use it with my oil diffuser mixed with water to scent my home. Very nice seller. I will order Lavender oil next.",

It's definitively peppermint oil, though it seems some people believe otherwise in the reviews, and has helped ward off insects in my garden. It smells great and is a decent price at $17 for 4 oz. As far as why the dropper doesn't really work, fully submerged in the oil, having squeezed the rubber base in preparation for extraction, the most it'll get and then try to hold (i.e. drip out if you're not careful) is a quarter of the size of the dropper. It's not terribly precise, but you just have to be careful (and only do a bit at a time).",
