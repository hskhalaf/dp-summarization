Also, if would be really good if you could add email addresses in the web app that would show up in the scanner for convenience of scanning to email addresses. This would prevent you from having to input on that tiny screen with your fingers. It's really easy to hit the wrong buttons. That part was really not well planned, but I'm assuming it's a pretty easy fix in the software.",
