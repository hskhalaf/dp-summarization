For us folks with thin, sparse brows, it requires some effort to apply successfully. The thick gel has nowhere to go, so must be applied in a tiny amount and spread quickly and diligently to cover bare spots. Did not find it to be particualrly long-lasting. One issue I have is the color. I bought BLONDE, as I have naturally dark blonde hair with pale highlights. The color is MUCH darker than any other BLONDE I have ever pruchased. Because of that, I probably won't buy it again.",

The spoolie will create fine lines in any product that's directly on your skin, giving the appearance of little hairs. Two or three light coats gives a much more natural look than one heavy one. I have very sparse brows due to both past over tweezing and chemotherapy, and Wunderbrow gives a very natural look, plus it wears extremely well, even though I perspire quite heavily.

You have to do several coats, and by the time it dries, you look like you have leftover clay mask where your eyebrows should be. Product does last, but not as long as they claim [especially if you have oily skin]. It will last 1 day if you're lucky. And it's not dark brown at all.... it's more like an olive color...",

I always had a tendency to wipe off half my eye brow with my regular eye brow pencil and this product would stay on through rain, and sweat. The only down fall was it lasted about 45 days and got to thick to apply. Think for the price and don't want to spend 22 dollars every forty five days for eye brows.",

I followed all directions--apply to clean oil-free eyebrows, and only wash with oil-free cleansers--but no luck on day two, which was pretty much faded and back to square one on day three.

Once it is dry, they stay put. I actually swatched it on my hand and it stayed even after several hand washings - it came off with oil. It was definitely worth the price and I will be continuing to use it.",
