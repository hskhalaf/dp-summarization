These Audio-Technicas not only surpass the Mo-Fi in terms of comfort and compact storage, but the sonic range and definition is truly amazing. Some of the $1,000-range headphones I've sampled didn't accomplish what this set does. Highly recommend for anyone who needs a high-quality workhorse that you won't require you to take out a loan to own.",

They are analytical and show the flaws in old recordings, which is ok. Modern recordings, tv, movies are well presented. Noise reduction is good. As they break in they are improving. They are not bass_less as a few reviews allege. Do not have the imaging as good open back headphones, but they do allow for more private listening without as many outside annoyances.",

Mobile devices use the L cable and for computers use the long straight cable, also do some tweaking in the EQ on the computer by right clicking on the speaker and going to playback devices and then the advanced settings in that and pick what sounds best for you. Also if you have a headphone port on the front of your computer it won't give good power so use the motherboard Jack on the back. They do bring out instruments you've never even heard. I cannot stress this enough if you just listen to badly recorded mp3 tracks then I'd give this set a pass...it exposes bad recording",

You could twist the cable once it was in the headphone and it would switch to the other channel (mostly left to right). So I returned it for another one that had that very same problem. What\u2019s up with that? Is there just a major flaw in the manufacture of these headphones? If so, why isn\u2019t anyone else talking about it online? Anyway, I\u2019ve heard great things about these headphones online. I\u2019d love to be able to hear a pair properly (in stereo).",

There's a fatal flaw though: the mid-treble response can be harsh and fatiguing with the frequency response produced by most songs. And the bass response is a tad underpowered unfortunately. So I had to return mine. These might work for some people, just not me. If you have any sensitivity to high end harshness, look elsewhere. I ended going with the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0, after returning Bang & Olufsen M6 2nd gen (WAY overrated), Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro, ATH-M5Ox, DT-770 (80 ohm), and this headphone here, the ATH-MSR7.",

Your mileage may vary, but they do sound nice and the bass isn't crazy overpowering; kinda' only there when it's necessary.",
