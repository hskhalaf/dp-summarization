We tried lots of cleaners over the years -- used much elbow grease but had poor results. We tried this product and at first we had similar, poor results, because we sprayed it on and started scrubbing and dried it. But -- after re-reading the directions -- we now just spray it on and let it sit. No rubbing. And like magic the mildew is gone. White and blue vinyl look like new. We do rinse the vinyl the next day, but not until the product has done its magic.",

It smelled very strong, very similar to Clorox Mold and Mildew cleaner; however, it did nothing but send a strong smell through the house. I even scrubbed the spot as recommended but still nothing. I paid double for a cleaner that may work at the same strength as a Clorox product. Disappointing.",

Re-applied and waited another 10 minutes, scrubbed one last time, and then rinsed and dried off. All said and done, I would buy this product again and would also recommend it due to its results at its price point. Well worth the money. See attached photos for results.",

I had originally tried another boat product and a pressure washer and saw absolutely no improvement. I then sprayed this product on one seat, went and hooked up the pressure washer and came back to rinse off the product about 5 minutes later. Unbelievable! Not only was the mildew gone, but the true color of the seats showed through with the removal of general grime. I have now ordered one additional spray bottle and a gallon refill.",

You might have to give really tough stains a second spray and occasionally a light scrubbing with a soft brush, but the majority of the stain will just melt away. Make sure you rinse it well as the chlorine in the cleaner could damage the fabric stitching if it's not rinsed. Recommend that you buy the gallon bottle and save $5.00!",
