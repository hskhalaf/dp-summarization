      "text": "Exceptional mini red dot reflex sight. Works great on Smith & Wesson M&P CORE pistols. Added bonus, the raised iron sights on the CORE co-witness with the Viper. So, on the off chance that your Viper fails, you still have iron sights without having to take the Viper off the pistol. While it isn't built as tough and rugged as a Trijicon RMR, it is rugged enough for normal everyday use (don't run it over with the truck). The controls are easy to use with multiple brightness levels, and an automatic shutoff after 14 hours.",

A couple things i recommend if you have a glock 19 MOS is that you DO NOT purchase the shim that Vortex recommends. Finally, make sure to contact vortex to receive the correct screws to mount to your glock. Awesome red dot so far. Co-witnessed the red dot RIGHT on top of my suppressor sights and I hit dead center with each hit. Very happy with this purchase. I strongly recommend the Viper.",
