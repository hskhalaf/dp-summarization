It kept perfect time, and the band is easily removable to be cleaned, as the watch pins are cast into the watch case; a great feature. A damp paper towel with Windex and the watch is clean. In March, the second hand fell off. I contacted them via e-mail, and they agreed to repair my watch for free.",

At first I figured I needed to put on my reading glasses but that did help. When the date is in the teens you can barely see the 1 digit. I compared this to my expensive Marathon watch and had no problem reading the date no matter what the day. I bought this for work because I need a light watch that can hand a little bit of abuse. Time will tell and I will update this review as needed.",

Most field watches and are run of the mill stainless steel. This feels light and tough. 2) The model I got was water resistant to 200 meters. 3) The model i got has a date feature. An attractive titanium field watch with a date feature and 200 meter water resistance for sub $150 is a great deal.",

What I don't like so much after 5 years: 1. It wears \"small\". Not so small that you can't read the dial but small compared with other contemporary watches => if I would buy another one I would get a larger model 2. Despite being \"hardened mineral glass\" I managed to get a scratch on the crystal since I frequently wear it to work => if I would buy another one I would pay the extra for a sapphire crystal model",

    "description": "Our Story, Your Watch\n\nOur story is a simple one. It\u2019s all about building a better watch, and it\u2019s all about our promise of performance to you. This is derived from a belief that long lasting quality, and attention to detail matter. It is this focus and integrity that drive us - an honest, true and authentic way. We believe if a watch is done right, it connects with you, creating an emotional touch point that says something about you. This is how we approach watches at Bertucci. This could only come from a company solely focused on field watches for you.\n\nWhat is a Bertucci Field Watch\n\nIf you were to own only one watch, it would be a watch well suited for life\u2019s endeavors. It would need to possess the qualities of durability, singularity of purpose, and versatility in use. In essence, equally rugged and refined, with a classic, understated, and enduring style.\n\nFor years, Bertucci Field Watches have been field tested and validated in places far and wide. They generally end up in places where time is best spent, or places that bridge the human experience, or places where life may travel at the same speed, but where it holds more value. Bertucci Field Watches are ready to survive the day to day challenges that come your way \u2026 wherever that place may be.\n\nDurability By Design\n\nYou\u2019ll feel it the moment you wrap a Bertucci Field Watch around your wrist. You\u2019ll notice the innovative, ergonomic design, quality materials, and the premium features and components that went into it. When we create a watch, we study the ways in which it will be worn and used by people that demand the most from the products they depend on. This approach requires an attention to detail - an attention to performance. That\u2019s no accident, it\u2019s the result of our Durability By Design certification process and the foundation for our Promise Of Performance. Simply put, Bertucci Field Watches perform like no other watch because they\u2019re built like no other watch.\n\nOriginal... Our Passion\n\nIt\u2019s in our blood and it\u2019s in our brand. Bertucci Field Watches is a 10 years old, independent start up, stand alone U.S. Company. We are the market leader in titanium field watches, offering the widest array of solid titanium styles in a variety of case shapes, designs, sizes and finishes. Our watches are designed, engineered, tooled and manufactured from the ground up with a passion for performance - it\u2019s about doing things the right way. Our unique approach results in watches that are truly original.\n\n\n\nVersatile design with wide appeal. The Bertucci solid titanium A-2T Original Classics\u2122 strike the right balance between tradition and innovation. The U.S. patented classic 40 mm round design is cast and then machined from solid titanium, a material we believe to be the best for a watch case. 1.9 oz. of pure performance - the A-2T Original Classics\u2122 feature a highly functional, and yet simply classic dial.
