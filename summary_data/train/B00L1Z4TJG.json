Anti-hot start technology is a nice assurance that the ballast will only strike bulbs if cooled sufficiently. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the internal timer is unreliable. Loss of power or power fluctuation causes ballast to reset timer so it won't turn back on again. Not ideal! I do not understand why Solis Tek designed it this way. Good news is there is a simple fix for this. If you buy this ballast, be sure to also buy an external timer that is compatible with electronic ballasts (which not all are).",
