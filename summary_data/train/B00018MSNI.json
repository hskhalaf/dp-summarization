Mids are there. Bass is reverberating nicely. The soundstage is full broad and wonderful. Classical, rock, jazz - wow. Depth and breadth of articulation is fantastic. I can hear even the scratch of a violin bow here and the clatter of flute keys over there. Day 2: since I had it, I plugged the HDs into my Pyle-Pro PHA40 4-Channel Stero switcher/amp and it can raise the volume to ear splitting levels without any distortion or flavoring at all.

To me, It's better for recreational listening as opposed to the HD 600, which is a bit more clinical. The HD 650 is a pleasantly warm listening experience without having too much bass. Bass is extended quite well and It adds to the articulate nature of these exceptional cans. Sound stage isn't that big, but extremely well defined and to me, that makes up for it. I jumped at it when it went to 315.00. To me this is one of the best values in headphones out there. It holds its own against many models between 500 and 700 dollars.",

These headphones are no joke, they do require a good amp and I personally feel the matrix m stage barely fullfills the power requirements for these hd650s. I've started down a road of collecting different headsets. So far i have 2, hd650s and jvc livebeat imported from Japan. Looking at akg next and a higher grade amp and dac.

I found these on a list and went for it. I am so glad I did. They are comfortable, durable, and sound great. There's no colorization and I used to have to take one phone of the ear to record vocals to stay on pitch. But I don't have to do that with these. They are really great.",
