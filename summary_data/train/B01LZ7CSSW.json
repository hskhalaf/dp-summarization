It seems the image of the gray cover on amazon is darker versus the one I got. I provided a photo, if anyone else purchased the gray option please provide an image to compare...I'm considering going for a black cover but I'll see. I really wanted a dark gray versus this lighter gray I received.",

No, but I heated it with a blow dryer which probably helped. Is it durable? Been using if for three weeks \u2014 no problems. What about the look and feel? It\u2019s comfortable to the touch. No odor at all. Looks nice. Classic design. Is it leather? I doubt it, but despite the word \u201cleather\u201d being in the title, I didn\u2019t expect real leather for the price. Once installed, it looks and feels like leather so I\u2019m five-star happy with this cover at this price",
