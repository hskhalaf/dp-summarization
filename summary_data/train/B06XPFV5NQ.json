If you like to keep your hoods with your lenses I'd double check to make sure these arent too small. Even if they do fit the fit might be a bit tight for your liking. Honestly I'm giving this 5 stars because I couldn't find my treat bag and I was able to use the smaller one as a treat bag while walking my dog. Can be used for other stuff :P",

The sizes work well from smaller to larger zoom lenses, and the diameter of the bags increases proportionally. One of my objectives has a larger 77mm diameter lens, and it barely fit into the medium-sized bags. Photographers with large diameter lenses should probably look elsewhere. The bags are closed using a pull-line, making them not 100% dust- or water-proof. Also, the soft purple top material is at best water-repellent, but won't withstand a heavy downpour.",
