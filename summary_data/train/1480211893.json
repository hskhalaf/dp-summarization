It's a short piece; took me about 2 hours overall. Yet, I feel like I've actually learned something new to help me strategize and quit glossing over the reading comprehension passages. I'd recommend this to anyone that wants supplemental material to their practice tests. I kind of wish that it were longer just because I liked his no-bs style that much.",

His point of view is so refreshing, and I loved the sometimes crass way he refers to the test - everyone is already thinking it!",

Nathan Fox swears liberally, as others have noted, so take heed if you're easily offended, but it feels to me like just an outgrowth of his no-BS approach to the test. Well worth the price, as it showed me quickly what I need to focus on so I can direct my LSAT prep resources to the areas of greatest need.",
