Unfortunately Olukai has chosen the path of all other shoe makers and created these narrow high-arch things that do not feel anything like any of the Olukai's I have ever owned. Dear Olukai, If people like your shoes from years past, they will hate these. Maybe you should consider being loyal to your loyal customers?",

I think these are great if your foot isn\u2019t very wide - if they are you may have issues.",
