By the time I decided I couldn\u2019t handle the contractions at home (24 hours from the start of labor) I was 8cm! I got on the birthing center ball and really didn\u2019t like their ball! Wish I took mine with me lol. Now it\u2019s like my babies sleep kryptonite. No matter how fussy he may get, if I bounce on the ball holding him he clonks right out! This ball has gotten so much use and held up so well. I absolutely love it!!!",

      "text": "This is as simple as it gets. A great product for a great price. The ball comes in a small box and extra 'stoppers' (plastic piece that stops the air flow), a stopper remover, and even a two-way hand pump. The ball is very solid and very comfortable. The material provides a nice grip, so you don't feel like you're slipping all over the place. If you're doing core work, I suggest you fill it up more than you think.. you want just a little bit of 'give' so you can get the best core workout. Pros: Great materials Extra items included Air stays in longer even after heavy workouts Great price Cons: None. This is the one to buy!",

Truth is, anybody can use almost any size ball, larger is easier with less load and range of motion, and more support/stability. Smaller the opposite. If you're heavy, or doing dumbbell presses on the ball, go with a bigger one, because it's safer. Just like bigger tires on a truck, they support more weight with less chance of bursting.

I wanted to use this at my desk since I'm 8 months pregnant I needed this because the office chairs are so uncomfortable. The ball itself actually seems to be good quality but its just way to small to use in an office. The customers saying that its not to small must not be using it for work, or not using it as a birthing ball. Anyway will be retuning - to small and does not work for me.",

You can\u2019t see the glitter specs in the photo but the color is good. It appeared lopsided at first but upon putting more air in, and being patient, the ball expanded to a normal size. I\u2019ve only had it blown up for 5 or so hours and I\u2019m waiting on the lines from the packaging to disappear.",

I have to do this once a month. Other than that, I haven't used it as a chair or anything. Can't complain besides what I mentioned.",

I'm here to recommend the 75 cm size to other 5'10 inch people.
