If I weigh myself, drink a cup of water, and weigh myself again, I have to slide the weights a little farther to the right. I also use this to weigh my suitcases when I travel. I can't do that with a regular bathroom scale because my suitcase covers up the display. When I get to the airport, sure enough the airline scale shows the same weight that I measured at home.

It was relatively simple to put together, but it is a little heavy for those who do not have the luxury of someone strong to help you move it. Once it is assembled, the manual tells you how to adjust it at zero (with a screwdriver or butter knife), and that is it.",

I wanted a scale that would be accurate everytime and be around for years. This is definitely it. It is big like the doctor's office scales, so won't go in most bathrooms (it is not pretty anyway). I rated it a 4 out of 5 because the mechanism was bound up when we got it and had to figure out why it would not work. I good pull while I was standing on it freed it up. The hole where the scale needle goes through is a little bent, but works ok. Not bad enough to send back.",
