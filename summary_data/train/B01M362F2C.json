It wont slide around underfoot, but neither will it stick to the floor like a suction cup. When my cats jump from the sink to the hard floor, they could get injured. Elderly cats especialy. Getting a mat for your cat is just good preventative maintenance. Its also nice for human feet. If you found this review helpfull, please press that helpful button to say thanks.",

I don't understand the high reviews at all - I got black, and any time it gets ANY dirt on it, it is very noticeable! My dog walked in with dirty paws and the dirt gets caught in the texturized surface. Had I known this would happen I wouldn't of bought it. The mat DOES NOT wipe clean at all. I used vinegar which works wonders on everything however this does not wipe clean easily, you have to scrub the dirt out of the little textured sections... VERY annoying. Seriously disappointed. Looking for a new model and will probably return these.",

I don't want to turn anyone off these because I'm sure once you get use to having them around you probably automatically become aware that you need to slightly step up onto them.

I'm sure there's a reason for this, but for my specific application, I would have preferred the mats have vertical edges, as I've got several of them laid out side by side. Still very comfortable, but if you stand/step across the seam, it can be uncomfortable because of the sloped edges.
