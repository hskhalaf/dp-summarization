Assembly wise you really have to hammer the poles in hard, to make them go in flush. I tried using my body weight to push down on it and one of the wheels bent out of shape. So I recommend you put on the wheels last... I do like the wheel brakes and I do like the lip on each tray, which helps secure the equipment.",

I used a hammer and a short wood dowel to set the wheels as a final step. The user will find that you cannot force the wheels down tightly without turning the assembled cart upside down and using the hammer and dowel gently drive the wheels tightly into the leg sockets. The leg sockets could be damaged by not driving the metal leg posts straight into the plastic housing. Once assembled and all gaps closed the cart is a solid sturdy product.",

Assembly is super easy, but you will need a plastic mallet and piece of wood to hammer the legs down flush. The wood is so you don't damage the plastic with the mallet, just tap it down until it sits flat and it will make assembly a breeze. (Took me less than 5 min to setup completely). I use this as a detailing cart to keep all the chemicals/tools organized and WOULD RECOMMEND this for anything under 100lbs.",

This cart is great! Lightweight, easy to push/pull and maneuver, yet sturdy as well. I also use it to cart cases of water and tea from the storage closet to the frig - what a back saver! Their customer service is excellent, too - the bottom tray cracked when we tried to push one of the wheels in (I think the opening was manufactured too small), and they sent a replacement immediately!",
