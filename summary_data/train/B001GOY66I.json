The last 3 times I\u2019ve used it (slow learner here), I have found that they have completely changed the formula. I have experienced chemical burn on my ears and neck, runny nose and swollen watery eyes. They have changed their formula, probably sold out, and are NO LONGER TOXIC FREE! I though it was me, but I followed the instructions to a tee, it is toxic and dangerous. PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!",
