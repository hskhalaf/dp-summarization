      "text": "These fit my 2002 GMC 2500HD perfectly. With no knob to tighten they look like factory OEM. Perhaps the single best feature of the mirror extensions is a screw that allows the user to tighten or loosen the adjustment tension for the mirror. I was hesitant to try these because my previous mirrors had knobs to tighten them. These come with removable strips inside the mirror. If they are too tight of a fit, remove 1 strip at a time until they are somewhat difficult to snap into place - you want them on tightly! In my case I needed to only remove the center strip for a tight fit.",

Nevertheless, they stay in place and I use them. The left one I use primarily to see what's behind me (I can see a little bit of a trailing car), but the passenger-side mirror is pretty useless. It's magnified and jiggles a lot, despite me using the screw to tighten it down. Basically, the left mirror gives me what I want.",

I have had other slip on mirrors and so far like these the best and would recommend them to anybody that wants to keep their stock mirrors. Good fit and great look, so good it fools many.",
