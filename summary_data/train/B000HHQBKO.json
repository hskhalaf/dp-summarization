I\u2019m not sure what the difference in price the company would save by using proper outdoor fasteners but for 30+ bucks each, it should unquestionably be included. So I replaced all screws on my box for an additional $1.57 of SS screws from lowes, and I mounted mine with a high rated galvanized deck screw that I know will last more than a few months outside.",
