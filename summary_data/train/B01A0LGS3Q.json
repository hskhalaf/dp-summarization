The size is perfect for our apartment we got the 43\" we had to buy a new stand cause ours was to small so we got a 50\" black cherry stand. TV was easy to set up. The sound isn't great we might have to buy surround sound speakers. Everything comes in clear. All around happy with it just not the sound shouldn't have to put the volume so high.",

I know it is inexpensive for what it is, but 1 year lifespan is ridiculous. I am only giving it two stars because for the 375 days I had it, it was great.",

The only issue I have had is that I have it on the wall and because of the placement of the speakers, if I have it too loud or there's a lot of bass, it will vibrate the wall and make an annoying sound. I also wish we could re-program the buttons on the controller if we don't use the channels they point to. Otherwise, extremely satisfied with this purchase.",

If there is any background noise (like when I'm watching TV as I walk on a treadmill) I can hear the sound, but the words are not crisp or clear enough. I will have to purchase an additional speaker. Otherwise great TV",

Also the TV loses its WiFi settings constantly and has to be set up again about once a month. I would definitely go for another brand of higher quality. Reduced my rating to two stars. This is a spate tv for the bedroom. No longer watch anything in 4K on it.",
