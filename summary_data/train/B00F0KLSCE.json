This rod has a better reel seat and a slightly larger handle than the 6 foot model but the rod diameter is only slightly larger which makes it just as nimble but stronger plus add 6 inches to it's length. This rod is not a Pro-Level rod but for the serious fisherman it puts us right in the game and I can't wait to hook my next fish, what a nice rod...!!!",

I wish they would make the butt section longer as I think this would be a viable slow jigging rod. Additionally the guides are not very strong and can be bent easily due to the lack of a secondary support. For 40 bucks it is definitely worth it!",
