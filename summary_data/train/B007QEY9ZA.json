So I wasn't surprised when the zipper finally gave out. I liked the first one well enough to buy the exact same replacement in November, but now it's only April and the fabric placket (either side of the zipper) is already tearing. Unfortunately there is only a two-month return window, and it didn't start ripping until just over four months. Another thing I'd noticed: It's not nearly as sturdy as the old one. The walls tend to sag. I guess I'll be looking to a different manufacturer this time.",

But the overall main compartment size is bigger and that's really nice. Worth the money and works very well.",

I think these are irregular buys from the manufacturer and not worth the money. It is now in the trash and I have gone to a completely different brand.",

Otherwise its great - keeps things cold or cool with a single blue gel, even on 12-hour shifts and even on days when my transit but cabin temp is running in the mid-80s. The separate storage in the domed lid is handy for condiments, plasticware, and napkins - things that don't care what temp they're at, that you don't want in the main compartment. Interior is easy to clean and lined with heavy plastic of some sort.",

Also the strap is nothing but a hindrance that gets in the way, first thing I do is cut this off, got a great handle why do you want a strap? Your only carrying your lunch, it's not that heavy! My recommendation, spend the money you save by not putting on the strap back into making the lid top webbing securable.",

It\u2019s just the right amount of space and with regular ice, stays cold for numerous hours. I use this for my lunch and several bottles of water everyday for lunch. The upper compartment is great for syoring cutlery, napkins, condiments, etc. I highly recommend.",

The bottom section is large enough for real size plastic food containers which allows you to keep them flat, inside of jamming them in sideways like other smaller coolers/lunch bags. It can store my lunch containers as well as my breakfast containers. The top section is good storage as well. I use it to keep my two eye glass cases, my ipod and headphones and there still is extra room. several of us at work have these and they work out well.",
