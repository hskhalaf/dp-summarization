      "text": "I purchased my charger in the fall of 2018. in August 2019, the amp gauge needle started to stick not allowing unit to shut off. So I contacted customer service and they advised that if I'd put the new gauge in myself they'd send one right out. Being pretty handy I said OK. Well after another 6 or 8 emails I have yet to see the repair part and I can't get anyone to return an e-mail. Oh, the gauge needle finally fell off and now at least the unit is automatically shutting off again. Needless to say, I won't be recommending these chargers or the company. So sad to see a company treat customers this way.",

So I call the factory tech support, and they told me that the batteries need to have at least half voltage for this charger to do anything. They said that all \"intelligent\" chargers are that way. Their literature did not say anything about this. When I put my meter on my batteries they read 10 volts on a 48 volt system. So they told me it would not work and so I boxed it back up and returned it.",

The unit would not power on, LED on the back indicating power. I feel very strongly this chargere had been sold at least once already because it did not work and then just re-shipped to me as \"brand new\".

The main reason I purchased this one is because of what I call the \"battery tender feature\" and that is the charger turns itself off when the batteries are fully charges and then monitors the batteries to be sure they stay at 100%.",

Also, while charging with the \"Factory\" charger you could smell the electrolyte aroma in the garage while charging. Not so with this charger. Not to mention that this charger is ~ 1/2 the cost of a \"Factory\" replacement!",
