Last week I cooked 2 bushels of Maryland blue crabs in 5 batches using this pot, could have done it in 4 batches if I wanted to. So the basket holds 1/2 bushel of crabs! Worked great, very heavy duty.",

It's really designed for steaming and the basket sits up several inches below the bottom of the pot so its more like a 42qt boiling pot with basket. I got a good price from warehouse deals so I'm fine with the capacity. I didn't assemble the stand or burner because I already have one so I will save this for when mine finally rusts out.",

We boil water in our cooker to scald turkeys and chickens before plucking and it does the job quick and well. There were a few very small dents in the bottom of the pot when it arrived but it did not affect the functionality. Also, after a few uses I can see the base/stand paint is peeling off a little but nothing that can't be fixed up with some high heat spray paint. I definitely recommend this to the occasional user since I could see how it may wear out quickly if used on a regular basis, but the price reflects that.",

Using the strainer cuts the space some but very handy for a boil (strainer sits inside, so it cuts your radius by 1/2 inch or so, and it sits a few inches above the bottom of the pot so it can be used for steaming). Could probably get more capacity if I were to boil potatoes and corn, then dump those and then cook the precooked smoked sausage and raw shrimp after. Paint burns off of the burner ring - but I am not concerned. Might spray paint it with high heat paint sometime down the line.",
