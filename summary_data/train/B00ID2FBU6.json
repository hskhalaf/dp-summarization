I took a star off because the metal 'shell' that comes off for component installation is rather flimsy and prone to being bent if you're not careful. The (single) fan that came with the box was rather loud, which was quickly replaced with a nice Noctua fan. The original fan was pre-installed on the interior of the case, but I was able to fit the Noctua between the face-plate and the main frame. This saved some precious space in the main compartment.",

Of course you have to buy the motherboard and power supply, but the case is fairly open and installation was very easy. The cables have excellent labeling letting you know what goes where. The connectors were perfect for me. The case has plenty of vents and two good sized fans in the right spots. I am very impressed. It is my first Cooler Master product. Again, if you are after flashing lights and being able to see your motherboard, then this isn't for you. If you just want a sleak little rectangle that is quiet and works great, this is it!",

      "text": "There are a number of issues with this case. The power supply is an ATX, but it is located directly over the motherboard, severely limiting CPU cooler choices, in most cases to a small AIO water cooling solution. The power supply also protrudes over the motherboard backplate, limiting access and it looks weird. Internally the case has a strange layout that seems to be designed to maximize interference from cables. There are no dust filters and no easy way to install them if it had them. I built a similar system using a fractal case of nearly identical footprint, , and I think that case is well worth the few extra bucks.",

Cons, (if you can call it that) limited mounting places for fans. I would definitely use a modular power supply when building in this case, the ability to limit cables to those you need helps make the case easy to manage and avoid a rat nest of unused wires.",

Also, an SFX power supply is pretty much a must-have with this case. Make sure you get an ATX to SFX bracket though, as the PSU cutout is sized to ATX.",

      "text": "Hands down the best computer case I have ever had. Computer stays cool without the fans having to work very hard which also makes it quiet. The only problem I had was that I used a third party cpu cooler that was quite big and I didn't have room for the big fan at the top of the case. No problem though because I didn't need it. I bought a second one for my brother and used the fan in his with a stock cpu cooler and it works great as well.",

Stock fan that comes with it isn't PWM so you can't adjust the speed and it's kind of noisy but I planned on swapping that out any way. The 80mm I took out as well as it was not in a place that was going to benefit my cooling in any way. Like I previously stated it's tiny. Your cables are going to be tight, and if you have a big cooler on your GPU thats probably not going to fit too great either. I have a founders edition 980 and it fits great.",
