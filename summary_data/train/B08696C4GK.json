      "text": "I only gave it 3 stars because of the fan exhaust placement, they just heat your cables and mouse plugged in the USBs. Also the charging port should be closer to the screen, it`s awkward to have a external HDMi monitor and the AC Adapter plugged in. All in all is a well built laptop with a powerful config",

      "text": "There's no denying the power you get from such a small form factor is amazing. However that power comes at a price, battery life. Even running on \"Silent\" or Windows Powersave mode, doing light tasks like reading PDFs I struggled to get more than 2-3 hours battery. Speaking of \"Silent\" mode, don't be fooled, the fans can be quite loud, but to be expected when under load. Ultimately had to return as finger print reader developed a hardware fault and Asus think there may be a battery malfunction to get that poor battery life. Had the potential to be the perfect combination of power vs portability.",

(See the Pictures for more detail) Keyboard: I saw many asking about the keyboard layout so here it is (Att. Picture). I bought the white version and the lighting in the keyboard is not bright at all, it's actually easier to see the keys with the lights off. Plug: It comes only with a UK plug, no adaptor The laptop is great I have had it for a week and the only thing I can critic is the keyboard lighting.",

Very good build quality I would say good as or better than macbooks. Fans are not too loud and mine didn't really get too hot while gaming averaging 75c and 38c idle. All in all a decent laptop. Oh yeah the led lid is pretty cool as well.",

It still didn't start, even if the charging light was on. I tried the advice on the Asus FAQ page, but none seems to work. Quite dissapointed as a first experience.",
