I use Bumble and Bumble's sea salt spray regularly and with a little scrunching, I get pretty decent beachy waves without much work. However, B&B is crazy expensive. I figured this might be a decent alternative. I was wrong. It does nothing. It smells great, but I simply cannot get it to give me any kind of wave. I tried the whole twisting thing as suggested and still nothing. It makes my hair look dirty and stringy and just gross. I really wanted it to work for me, but it just didn't. Boo.",

My hair is like a long bob. Just be aware that it's not that the product doesn't work, it's that you have to have enough length and use it properly.",
