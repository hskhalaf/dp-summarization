We installed underground and the best explanation was a drawing at the end. Sure wish the multiple uses were outlined better with a supply list. We needed aluminum tape and fire retardent insulation to wrap around our pipe. I called twice for assistance but though the gentlemen was very polite I am not sure he was of any help. We figured it out and now we wait. Since it\u2019s buried and only works when it\u2019s 37 degrees Fahrenheit we may never know for sure if it works. Here\u2019s hoping to no frozen pipes.",

    "title": "Heat Cable for Pipe Freeze Protection, 18 feet, with Built-in Thermostat and 16 Feet of High-Temp Installation Tape, Heavy-Duty, Self-Regulating, 120 volt",
    "description": "Size:18 FeetTHIS CABLE WILL NOT WORK unless it is in a cold environment. We've received a couple bad reviews because people 'tested' the cable in their warm living room. Eye roll. Please don\u2019t be that guy. The built-in thermostat will NOT TURN THE CABLE ON unless it is in a cold environment. Now for the good news, this kit includes 16 feet of high temperature glass cloth tape for installing your cable. Pipe Freeze Pro is a commercial-grade, self-regulating heat cable which provides years of reliable freeze protection for pipes of all varieties, including copper, steel, PVC, ABS, PEX and more (pipe diameters up to 2\u201d). It may also be used in drains and culverts through the winter months to promote drainage. Don\u2019t buy from companies without a human available by phone. Heat cable is technical stuff and it\u2019s great to have solid advice on how to install it. We are the only heat cable seller on Amazon who is a simple phone call away. Eat that off shore competitors! Pipe Freeze Pro is jacketed with a commercial-grade fluoropolymer and comes standard with a flame-retardant thermoplastic interior jacket. Our 16 gauge heating wires are 200% thicker than the conductors found in cheap, constant wattage cables like EasyHeat and Frost King. Thicker conductors mean greater heating efficiency, more melting power and long term cable integrity. Pipe Freeze Pro is self-regulating, meaning it \u2018asks\u2019 for more energy as it gets colder outside and less energy when it\u2019s warmer. The entire length of our cable is temperature sensitive such that colder areas demand more power than warmer areas. Smart stuff. The stated cable length DOES NOT include an additional 24\u201d unheated cold lead. For example, a 6 foot cable is 6 feet plus 2 feet of unheated cord. Installation is simple. Run Pipe Freeze Pro along the pipe, secure with fiberglass cloth tape (included) every 12 inches and wrap with standard pipe insulation. Read the manual for full instructions, of course.",
