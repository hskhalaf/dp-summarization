There is a cushion at the back of the show that adds more comfort. Great shoes. I use them for Zumba and they are wonderful. I didn't give 5 stars only for the reason I would have personally liked them to be a bit higher as I have an old ankle injury that the podiatrist wants high tops for better support. They do support my feet and ankles but with softness.",

There is room for an orthodic also. They support your ankl but there's still room to move. The sole has a supportive circle for spinning (alot of turning & twisting in Zumba) this circle on the sole takes pressure off the ball of your foot. You can glide with control. The sole is a bit to smooth for other types of exercise like boot camp.But for any kind of dance they are perfect!",
