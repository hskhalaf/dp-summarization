I was born with short, thin lashes, and within a few weeks of using it my lashes have always begun to grow much longer and thicker. However, the product I received from this company is counterfeit! I began to wonder about it after I had been using it for several weeks with no results. Then I looked closely at the tube and compared it to the photos on the Revitalash website. The lettering on the product I received was black, not blue as in the photos. Also, there was no batch number. I\u2019m returning it.",

My mom has very little eyelashes and eye allergies. She can use this product without issue and the make-up artist for my brother's wedding noticed the difference in my mom's eyelashes from the first consulation to the week before his wedding!!",

      "text": "RivitalLash works outstanding! It said it would take approximately 6 weeks for eyelashes to become longer and thicker. After only two weeks there is an unbelievable difference! This product by far is the best one on the market. I have tried numerous others and this one is the best. The problem was when I just opened and started using my new 2 ml bottle. It was only a third full. There is definitely a defect. Can you please send me a new 2 ml bottle and I will send back this bottle that is clearly damaged. Than you,",
