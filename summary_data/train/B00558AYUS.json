I use the Voice Booster to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ on the streets and on campuses. It packs alot of power and has great features. You cannot beat it for the price. The Voice Booster seems to be very durable and will give over 12 hours of use on each charge of the batteries.",

I bought a waterproof lightweight zippered travel bag to protect it from splashes and a 20' audio cable to extend the microphone from the amp. I strap it to seat 5 with a couple of bungee cords.

I have fillings which are metal. I don't know if it affects it or not. I think the headphone cord should be longer .",

The recharge feature will save me a lot in batteries and the volume power allows me to be heard in much larger venues with my Vortex 2 voice changer. I highly recommend this amp for costumers who want volume and rechargeable battery life over compact size.",

The major design defect I see in this unit is the lack of ease when replacing batteries. I know my wife will be walking around with the item, so when the batteries die out or wear out, she will need to replace the battery quick. I can't tell from the instruction what kind of batteries it requires. I am little surprise that for an item of $90 dollars its not real well produced. Maybe I have too high of a standard.",
