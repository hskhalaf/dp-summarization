      "text": "After struggling with several of the \"hanging\" style hitch-mount bike racks which really don't fit our cruiser bikes very well at all, we finally invested in the flatbed-style T2 Pro XT -- and what a difference it makes! This rack is absolutely rock-solid when attached to the hitch and the bikes mount easily and quickly. The rack is expensive, no question -- but after owning it for a couple of months now (and it's gotten heavy use) we are totally thrilled with it. One note: the rack is *heavy* -- my wife (who is very fit, but not all that strong) really struggles to get it on and off of the car hitch by herself.",

The biggest issue I've had was that there was something \"broken\" when I got it -- meaning the little pin that connects the handle to the mechanism. I didn't find this until I'd put it together so I had to take it apart to fix it. Also, the integrated lock only works on narrow tires and even then is only for locking your front wheel to the rack. But after taking this on several trips I do like the way it works.",

The only other thing is that the unit is quite heavy but then again I suppose that accounts for it\u2019s sturdiness. I am very satisfied with this unit and really like the fact that no part of the system comes in contact with the painted parts of the bikes.",

The trick is to reverse mount the Curt dual receiver where the secondary receiver is on the lower side. That is where the rack goes in.
