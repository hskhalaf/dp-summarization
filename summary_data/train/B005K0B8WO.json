The red and yellow are bright and easy to see, but the blue and purple are almost invisible. The other problem is that she uses them up rapidly. An older child might carefully draw clever pictures, but this little one just scribbles all over and then gets a new card.",

The only reason for 4 stars is that you can't just use any stylus to write. The wooden one it comes with was the only thing That could write very clear. Don't try to use dull pencils, pen caps, paper clips, etc. only the wooden stylus...which sucked when I had a ton of people trying to write at the same time. BUT Will definitely use the entire box for future projects!",

Since it only comes with one wooden stylus, we use toothpicks to draw out their art. The size is just big enough where they can draw their pictures without complaining about having no more room. I would say it is the size of a coaster tile and the cards are thick like card stock. Will be buying more when I run out of the current stock.",
