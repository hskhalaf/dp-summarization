      "text": "This is a good jacket for those days when it is too warm for a heavy coat but too cold for short-sleeves. I don't like wearing long-sleeved shirts, so this became a good alternative for me. It also easily fits under a heavy coat for added heat on those really cold days, and it makes a great raincoat. The only reason I took a star off is that the sleeves are a bit long for my comfort.",
