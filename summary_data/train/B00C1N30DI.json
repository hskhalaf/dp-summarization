Replacement tips and parts are all inspected and stamped with various insurance lab approvals so you can maintain this soldering iron indefinitely at factory new condition. I've been working with electrical engineering products for 30 years, Hakko is one of the finest companies I've ever come across.",

I also like the soldering iron stand, which holds the iron securely while isolating the tip. When I made the order, I assumed that the stand would be a lightweight affair, but it is hefty enough to stay in place.",

Hakko came highly recommended. After a few uses, I can see why. I love the programmable base and the ability to change temperature to use for different types of projects. A master can do great work with even poor tools. For amateurs, good tools compensate a little for lack of skill. This is a great tool.",

The Hakko is an absolute joy. Set it for the appropriate temperature, and you're off to the races. It works great, it's comfortable, and this kit comes with a range of tips for almost any job. The included stand is very high quality. For a home hobbyist, this is a great unit.",

Of course for big items, like soldering to a steel chassis, you will need something with more wattage. The procedure for programming the preset temperatures is a bit cryptic, but there are plenty of instructional videos on YouTube that can help with the process.",

Honestly, I haven't had any issues other than accidently changing the calibration. That was an easy fix. Just search the following on YouTube: Reset the Hakko FX-888D. Why settle for the cheap radio shack or Weller soldering irons. Sure, even I became highly skilled with them, but they took too long to heat up and suffered while working. The tips on those would always disintegrate. The FX-888D unit heats up in mere seconds and the tips last forever. I highly recommend the Hakko FX-888D to anyone from the hobbyist to the professional.",

I've used it primarily for RC Aircraft wiring, but also done a fair bit of home electronics repair and a bit of surface mount soldering since. The adjustable temp is fantastic. High quality item.",

The holder/cleaner is steel and heavy won't tip over and fall with your hot iron in it, with two different ways to clean your tip one wet sponge and brass wire this thing is amazing! This will always be on my bench. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality soldering station. Would definitely buy again if lost or stolen.",

    "description": "Reliable digital technology by HAKKO \u2013 Introducing the HAKKO FX-888D Excellent thermal recovery Heater output has been increased by 30% compared to that of the conventional models HAKKO 936\u00b7937. Also FX-888D delivers excellent thermal recovery by using T18 series tips for their terrific heat conductivity. This allows soldering at a lower set temperature and reducing the thermal impact on components as well as tip oxidation that can shorten tip life. Thermal recovery graph Rise time to 350Degree C is 20 seconds faster and tip temperature drop is reduced during continuous work. HAKKO FX-888D performance comparison graph with conventional stations Able to shorten the time required for the same work and improve work efficiency significantly. Designed to be User-Friendly Small footprint Compact station body requires a space of only 100 (W) x 120 (D) mm. What\u2019s more, points that come into contact with the floor are positioned as close to the outer edge of the body as possible to improve stability and make the station difficult to fall over. Simple and easy operation With only two operation buttons of UP and ENTER in the center, operation is simple and easy. Even if you\u2019re not familiar with operation of machines, you can operate it without difficulty. Iron holder with full of functions An iron holder of the same color of a soldering station comes as a set. The highly functional iron holder not only improves ease of use, but also brings a sense of visual consistency to the work environment. Silver Soldering station Iron holder Blue & yellow Soldering station Iron holder Strict temperature management Digital display The FX-888D\u2019s digital display makes it easy to check the set temperature at a glance.",
