      "text": "This thing rides good on any terrain! Smooth surfaces like in a mall, concrete, damaged asphalt, dirt and sand. I have not tried it in mud. Depending on the surface, it does make the ride a little bumpy for your pet. Be careful if you lift up the back wheels and depend on the front wheels only. It will tip over. It's very light and easy to push, however it tips over easily. Probably because of the 3 wheel construction. I would probably prefer 4 wheels.",

She loves going outside and really likes being strolled when she gets too tired to walk. The stroller came in earlier than expected and was very easy to put together. I love the storage it gives you under the stroller and the cup holders on the handle. The stroller came with a rain cover and it also folds for easy storage. It rides smoothly.

It is worth what I paid and was easy to assemble. Only took me 15 minutes and that was because I put the front wheels on upside down at first. The instructions are not the best but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out. Very happy with it.",

The quality is better than we had first anticipated by just looking at the photos and we should not have waited as long as we did to purchase this. The navy color that we chose was accurate in its description and the ride is smooth over ruff surfaces. We will certainly recommend this product to all of our friends. Thanks.",
