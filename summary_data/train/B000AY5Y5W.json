I also like the ability to change the tracking speed on the fly. All in all, I would repurchase this mouse and recommend it to anyone looking for a wireless solution.

While being able to swap batteries on the fly is great, I've noticed a few issues that I did not experience with my other cordless. First of all, the overall pointer movement across the screen is quite jerky at times which is very annoying. Additionally, while battery life is very good for general mousing, it depletes much more rapidly during moderate gaming. Not a bad mouse, but for the money, it's not really that much better than my old MX-700.",

Now, you are never without a battery if you straight exchange the batteries in the charger, but you are having to change the battery quite often, which can get annoying. Other than that, I would highly recommend this mouse if you are looking for wireless freedom and gaming quality.",
