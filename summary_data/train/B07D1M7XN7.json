Users were pleased with the practical arch support and the balanced cushioning. However, there were various complaints about the shoe\u2019s quality and durability. Likewise, many users thought it was not as comfortable as the previous version. Overall, it was an acceptable running shoe but still needed some improvements.",

Now gone for the Gel Kayano instead and that seems great so far. The photos show them after less than 6 weeks!",

There is no toe box - it just doesnt exist. The entire thing is made of thin mesh with no durability whatsoever. Also the previously sturdy leather wrapping of previous versions has gone. This is basically a sole with a mesh wrap. I have no idea how they can call these things stability shoes since they provide none at all. And given its nothing but mesh I cant see them lasting more than a few miles. Returned for a refund.",

I was excited to get the latest version as I'd worn out my GT-2000 v5. However, these were a massive disappointment. The sole was really too firm and felt too unforgiving whilst out running. At first I assumed they just needed a bit more wearing in than usual. But after a dozen runs in what felt more than clogs than running shoes I gave up and bought some competing brands. I'm getting my money's worth by using these just for the gym and they are fine in that context.",

However not much of an issue as it\u2019s a running shoe. Overall better than the v4\u2019s I replaced given weight drop and vent improvement. Hopefully ankle issue will go after they have been run in.",
