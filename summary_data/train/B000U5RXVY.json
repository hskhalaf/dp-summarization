      "text": "Very effective tool, but has two caveats. One, the handle is not completely fixed. I tried to twist it for some reason for leverage with a screwdriver inside of the handle hole, and the handle rotated. Two, and more of a concern, this is not water resistant. If water gets inside of it, the extension can jam. I had to knock it with a hammer and wedge to release the mechanism after it was lightly rained on. The water did come out, and it now works again, but I would not want to do that again. The extending handle is very effective to adjust depending on how much room needed or torque desired.",

But this really is a superior product. I wanted a rotating head vs fixed (mainly because this also works with my jack where a fixed angle won't). I liked the idea of having an extension handle if I need it. Most of the time you don't need it, but some times you do. The rubber handle on the end is nice to have. No complaints or any areas for improvement. Would buy it again.",
