I have had this heater running for one hour at the highest temperature control, high heat fan setting and the heat produced in a 10 x 10 room is minimal. The room is not any warmer now than it was when I turned the heater on. This heater might be great in a small bathroom to take the morning chill off but unfortunately it does not seem to live up to the whole room advertisements. Can honestly not recommend this product. For the price you can do much better elsewhere.",

Best use of it is under your desk to somewhat keep your feet warm. Now I need to find something that kicks out real heat.",

It doesn't make the room toasty warm or hot, and it's not the kind of heater that shoots out a small blast of heat that you can stand in front of for warmth. It circulates the heat and takes the chill out of the air so the entire room is VERY comfortable. I haven't used it since February or March and it's still working perfectly now. I highly recommend as a heater for a small space or as a way to make a medium size room really comfortable. Original Review January, 2015: Really good for a medium size room.",

The reason for a one star deduct is that the fan cannot be used without the heater function which I knew going in.

When Vornado states it's a whole room heater they weren't kidding. Temps have been dropping where I am at the moment into the low to mid 20's to mid 30's but this heater maintains a comfortable 65-70 degree.",

It was exactly what I've been looking for. Plus, energy-saving features that actually work and barely budge the electric bill running near constantly at 78 degrees! Every cold house needs a warm zone!",

      "text": "I like this heater but I am continually trying to pick the right number on the dial to keep our babies room at 70. It doesn't seem to be based on the final temperature in the room. On nights when our furnace is on more her room is hotter for example. It is pretty cool to the touch for the kids. Also it easily shuts off when tipped. You do have to make sure you know if it has been tripped off sometimes because it still looks on.",

Nice design, can swich to lower watt usage to decrease chances of flipping a circuit breaker, has a tip off safety mechanism. Finally, it has an attractive design. it is the best 1500 watt heater of over a dozen that i have owned; pricier than others, but worth the extra cost for the nice performance.",

It warms the rooms immediately, and it has been 7 to 27 degrees here. you can hear it, but it's not disturbing. It circulates the heat so it warms but not all the heat in one direction. Unit or cord does not get hot enough to be harmful to touch. I would highly recommend this heater to anyone,",
