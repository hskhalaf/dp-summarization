I know that isn't much of a difference but the reason it matters is that my spring clamps, that have been used on a true 1\" bar for years, wouldn't work on this new bar. (too loose) Easy enough fix, just had to buy new clamps. Wish this bar would ship with clamps but still would recommend this bar to anyone that wants an EZ Curl bar. (Just buy some clamps to go with it)",
