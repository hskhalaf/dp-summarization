Justice League favorites Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, Batgirl, and Supergirl are represented with retro logos on 28-ounce BlenderBottle Classic mixing cups. Shaker bottles include the patented BlenderBall wire whisk that moves inside the bottle as it shakes, mixing even the thickest ingredients with ease (note, may not work on Kryptonite). BlenderBottles feature a secure screw-on lid, carry loop, wide mouth for easy mixing, and embossed markings that measure both ounces and milliliters. Dishwasher safe and BPA- and phthalate-free. BlenderBottle can be used as a mixer, a leak-proof water bottle, or without the lid as a super drinking cup. Alfred-approved, BlenderBottles are perfect for protein bat-shakes, bat-smoothies, bat-pancake batter, scrambled bat-eggs, bat-drinks, bat-dressings and meal replacements prepared in a Flash. Lasso of Truth: exterior measurements only go to 20 oz (but actual capacity is greater).",
