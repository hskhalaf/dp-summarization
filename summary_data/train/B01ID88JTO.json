I have 3 sets of bushes that are 10' - 14' tall and a pole trimmer is a must. This trimmer is half the weight of the Mantis and with no cord, a breeze to work with. Had no problems going through 1/2\" branches and the battery lasted the entire job (2-3 hours off and on) with plenty to spare. The trimmer is a little top heavy but I'll take that trade off for the overall lower weight. First time trimming in 15 years that my arms and shoulders weren't sore the next day.",

When they did talk to me, they took the information, put me on hold, and when they came back, they disconnected me. They did not call back. Amazon took care of the problem by issuing a refund. Another example of Amazon's great customer service. We can summarize that if my call was 124th in line, they are having major problems with their equipment. Perhaps they should revisit their business plan.",
