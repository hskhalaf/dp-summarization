The natural color perfectly matches light-color wood of our table (purchased via Amazon from another manufacturer), which is why we picked them, but you never know how closely the actual product will match the photos. It was spot-on. The chairs come fully assembled, ready to use as soon as you pull them out of the box. They seem well-made. Manufacturer's caution note says they NOT for outside use, with a maximum weight of 170 pounds (I'm about 20 pounds over that, and feel perfectly secure sitting in them).",

My major problem with these chairs, is attached to the bottom of EVERY chair are warning/safety instructions that have been entirely glued to the full length of one of the slats. Also the paper it slightly wider than the slat so it\u2019s visible from the top of the seat if not removed. I tried to remove it and it came off in pieces. I will have to get adhesive remover to get it off. It\u2019s completely unnecessary. A paper in the box would have been sufficient.",

They are easy to store in a closet and two folded chairs, stacked on top of one another, come to about 6\" high so you could potentially store them under a bed. They are a light color of wood. I bought these to go with the \"Winsome Wood 42-Inch Round Drop Leaf Table\" and the chairs match the height, however, the color of wood is lighter than the Winsome table. I'm not picky so it all worked for my needs.",

Due to the loosely screws, the chairs do not feel very solid, especially if kids rock them side to side. The small round plastics each of the legs breaks and comes off easily. Worse, the staple stays on the legs and scratches the hardwood floor. These chairs are light, good when you move them around, bad because they are not sturdy.",

But in general they accomplish they purpose, they look good and help you to save some space if you are not using all of them.",
