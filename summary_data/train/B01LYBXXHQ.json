      "text": "UPDATE: This diffuser worked great...for the first month. It then stopped working all together. I am greatly disappointed. I hate wasting money good money on products that don't work. I am so incredibly happy with this purchase. It works beautifully and I love that I can diffuse my oils in the car and don't have to rely on air fresheners that are filled with chemicals. I would like to recommend a bit of a longer cord though. I have to set this in my front seat cup holder, which happens to be right next to my second cup holder. Sometimes my drink get sprayed. Otherwise...pretty sure I'll be ordering another one for our other cars!",

      "text": "I really like this diffuser. I've tried several other styles of car diffusers, and this one beats them all hands-down. There are two (minor) reasons why I didn't give it five stars. 1) You can barely see the different colored lights. I don't care about this, but I thought I'd point it out in case you do care. 2) It goes through water pretty quickly. I found I need to keep a small bottle of tap water in the car to refill it on longer trips.",
