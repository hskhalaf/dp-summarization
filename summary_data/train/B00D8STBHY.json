Finally after beating me time after time, she admitted that one of her pre-school teachers had taught her game strategy on winning in this game and she took pity and tried to teach me some of her tricks. :) Gotta love the little children.",

Other than that, very quick, easy, entertaining, and builds strategies for young children where their brains are still developing via the Connect 4 game (probably not the jellybeans part).",

Game also says adult assembly required. So the game maker expects a parent to put it together and take it apart every time, which is ridiculous since if they'd spent a few extra cents on a larger box, the problem would not exist.

      "text": "It is okay. Serves the purpose as a decent game, but is definitely not the Connect Four I grew up with. Not nearly as sturdy as the game of old. The locking mechanism at the base used to keep checkers in place constantly gets stuck. As a result, I am sure it will eventually get broken. Nevertheless, it is still a Connect Four game, and has given my children the same fun and entertainment it provided me 35 years ago.",

The price can't be beat, but it's entirely plastic and definitely not made to last like the original. I've had no issues with the game functioning, it just feels cheap. Great for a quick gift to any kids 2 and up. My 2 year old just likes dropping the chips in and making them line up.",

I buy games that will build upon coordination skills, etc. So, this game fits right in perfectly. It is basically tic tac toe style of game, but you have to get four in a row rather than three.",

My son and I started playing this game when he was about 6, and it was good for him to learn a bit of basic strategy. My 2-year-old daughter has taken to playing with it now too. She loves to fill it up with all the little checkers... then watch them all drop when I pull the lever. She just loves it. Great game.",
