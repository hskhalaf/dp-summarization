      "text": "One of the best pair of shoes I have ever owned. Its actually a little difficult to describe how great they feel. If you have had Nike React before, it's a little like that, or maybe even the Nike Joyride... ...but EVEN BETTER! The cushioning system is about as good as you can imagine, the upper isn't too loose or too tight, and the shoes are even designed to give great support and comfort to the heel. Nothing bad to say about these shoes. Try them and see for yourself! I am so happy with them, I have just ordered my second pair!",

The down side, as mentioned by others, is heal slippage. The \"sock\" upper, with only 4 eyelets, does not allow me to comfortably lock my heal in place. Therefore, the NB is prefered for me.",

Finally the tapered design of the shoe caused sharp pain in my mid foot. I can not recommend this shoe to any serious runner...",
