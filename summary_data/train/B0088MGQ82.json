It definitely got some comments - it was perfect for me and my husband's first halloween together. it wasn't as sturdy as i imagined it, but it did the job. i had to stuff the front of the egg with a sheet so people could see the entire thing (i'm pretty thin so it folded over), but overall it was just as described.",
