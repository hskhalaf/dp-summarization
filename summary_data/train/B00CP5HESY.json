You have to remember that as you get started down the stairs -- there won't be a stair stop each tread so you can readjust your grip. Be ready and slide easily! You can control the descent and the pull on your arms by changing the angle of the body on the way down. This is a great tool.",

The handtruck is rock solid (close to a work of art if you are a tool guy). It went together, note you need your own tools for this - if you are buying a hand truck at this price point you doubtlessly have some tools (helps to have a clamp to pull the 4 part top handle together for the first bolt on each side). It works as I had hoped, bull nose on oak stairs are no issue, neither was an overhanging threshold (this one really surprised me).",

The direction leave out the fact that there is a bushing that needs to be installed on each set wheels. Figured that out after I put it together!",

You should also be able to tell that 4 wheels contacting ground would make it harder to turn. Careful making tight turns as it will mark floor.
