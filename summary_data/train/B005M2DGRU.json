It still looks well, it is definitely used, but looks better than others I have seen. If you purchase it, as with everything periodically check the screws that hold the mask in place as they will loosen...lost one and had to go to the screw ben to find a replacement....then used lock-tight on each screw so as not to lose them again. Daughter likes it as it looks cool, but I like it as it protects the face and the expensive metal in her mouth",

This prevents tangling with hair and glasses as is the case with my daughter. It's also very rugged. After spring and summer seasons in excess of 300 games and practices, it looks as good as new.",
