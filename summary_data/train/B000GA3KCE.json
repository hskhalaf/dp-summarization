After a couple of days, it seems that air will slowly leak back through the rubber cork, oxidizing the wine. It does extend the shelf life of the wine by a few days (especially in the refrigerator), but not much longer than that. I'd like to have one of these that had a more industrial, commercial-kitchen feeling to it, which created a really hard vacuum within my wine bottle.",

Easy to release the pressure and re-enjoy the wine (instead of using it to cook or merely turn your sink a pretty crimson colour) For the cost of wine, the minor expense of this pump and stopper system will pay for itself immediately.

At the end of the 3-4th day, the wine tastes like it has been open for 12hrs, so it allows some \"breathing\" but doesn't allow it to overly oxidize giving you bad flavors.
