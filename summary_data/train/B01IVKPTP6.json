Only complaint I have is that I wish the magnet head was just a tad more powerful as it can barely hold any screws already that are being pulled from a hole.",

I'm betting it will be even better than the clumsy tools I used last time when it comes time to replace my iPhone battery again. This kit was worth every penny, not to mention it was delivered same day when I ordered it and I had the watch repair done that same evening.",

Second, In following the product image exactly, I placed the ruler in its rightful spot, but with significant resistance - the pocket seems to have been stitched incorrectly and tore slightly as the bag is of cheap material.",

The plastic tools all seem fine but the screwdriver bits and the rubber pieces that hold them could be better. The rubber pieces do not tightly hold the bits so they just flop around in the case and it's only a matter of time before I lose one. But, I like the number of bits and I can just be careful with it.",
