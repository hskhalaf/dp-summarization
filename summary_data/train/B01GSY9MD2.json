I obviously would only allow use with close supervision anyway, but kids do stick things in their mouths, it just happens. I noticed after the fact that elsewhere it says for ages 3+. This posting is misleading. I wonder if the \"thick\" version would be a better option for littler ones, but I am unsure how much larger they truly are. I will have to post the question and see what others say. I do like that these crayons are natural and non-toxic though.",

      "text": "Hi, Everyone. Have a blessed, healthy, and safe 2020. Finally I have a natural way to mark my jars/containers in my kitchen, since I refuse to use chemical laden markers, pens, etc. Works perfectly, either labeling jars on the glass and/or lid, as well as every-other container. Using a scrap piece of cloth to rub off ~ incredible use! No more falling out papers between lid/ring of jars (though it works) or tying string with paper tag around jar necks. Great to have a variety of colours depending on the background contents in the glass. Thank you, honeysticks for making this product.",

At 16 months I got here large washable crayola crayons. She is having lots more fun with those.",

I didn\u2019t want to return all of them and Amazon offered a partial credit which was a fair compromise for me.",
