I transitioned my sleeping (8 month old) from my bed where he fell asleep this evening to the new mattress in his pack n play and he hasn't moved. Normally he wakes up. I had some cheapy pad on there until this one came. If I was a baby, I'd love this mattress. It also fits PERFECTLY inside my Graco pack n play. A must have if your baby is going to be spending some time in the pack n play.",

All in all, very glad I got the one with the innersprings instead of just foam. I think it will hold up better and not get flat, and is probably more firm.",
