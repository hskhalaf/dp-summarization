My 6 month old could barely be squeezed into the seat without having to remove the snack tray first. Which would then entail removing both the regular tray AND the snack tray and then putting both back on. What is the point of the silly snack tray? I feel like whoever designed this has never actually had a kid. I've been feeding kids for 9 years. I hope Graco figures out they need to stop designing chairs like this.",

Be cautious with products you clean the red head rest with as it gets a little red coloring on it. Soap and water would be best. Raising up and down is good.

The only issue I am seeing is when my son gets bigger, there is a center piece that is separately attached, that keeps kids from sliding out, but his thighs are already pretty wedged in there, so I will have to remove the tray, then this center piece just to get him out. I think it must be a special feature of this \"table fit\" chair. Kind of a hassle. Still a great buy and would highly recommend.",

This works great for both our kitchen table and even lowers to the right height for her to sit at the kid's play table that we will pull into the kitchen when we have people over. It is pretty easy to clean and folds up so we can put it out of the way, when needed.",

On the other hand, the plastic guard that fits between the child's legs to keep him from falling out has no adjustment ability at all and is already becoming too tight for our 11 month old grandson.",

Realized it left marks too late :-) Still a fantastic buy and will definitely use with our second child!",

The tray has been through the dishwasher a time or two and the cover has been through the washing machine and held up great! We previously had a chicco high chair and I would say this one is very comparable and would be the obvious choice given I purchased it for about half the price!",

    "description": "Your new little one is a big part of the family, so why not start a tradition of family mealtimes, right from the beginning? Graco's TableFit Highchair does just that. The Graco high chair's ingenious design properly positions your child right to the table and is designed to fit a variety of tables, from dining room tables to kitchen tables to kitchen countertops. The gently sloping front of the highchair and special tray means that your child can be at the table's edge, unobstructed by a bulky tray or frame. The TableFit is designed to suit your child from the earliest meals. As a new baby, your child will be positioned correctly for early bottle feedings, thanks to the 3-position recline. Then, as baby grows, you can adjust to a more upright position. Plus, this highchair has an infant body support that keeps babies comfy and supported from the start. Then, it removes as your child needs more room. You'll love the 1-hand removable dishwasher-safe tray, so you can get your child in and out of the chair with just one hand. The adjustable footrest keeps your child comfortable as he/she grows and makes it easy for you to find the right position. When you're not using your TableFit Highchair, it easily folds, so that you can store it. It slides compactly into to a closet until the next mealtime. Safety is always your first priority when it comes to your child, so you'll feel great about the convertible 3- and 5-point harness, which keeps your little one secure. The 3-position reclining seat makes this high chair perfect for early mealtimes. The seat pad features wipe-clean fabrics that are also machine washable. TableFit has 8 height positions, so you can adjust it to suit your table. A handy snack tray is included for quick and easy versatility.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy Graco",
