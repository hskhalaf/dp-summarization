They are kind of slippery when stacked so the storage bag and stacking pole they come with are totally necessary. They are a very thin plastic and are very flexible. The kids basically see them as a stepping pad. No matter how many times we tell them not to. The disc will get distorted from the abuse but you can just pop them back into shape. I've only used them once so far, so we will have to see how long they hold up. So far, so good!",
