Out of the box the 3700x hits the max boost of 4.4GHz when not all cores are needed and when all cores are under load mine settles at 4.1GHz. Idle temps do seem to bounce around somewhat with it constantly settling between 36c and 43c and under load running Prime 95 the processor settles around 62c. Of course it is hard to show any sort of performance increase over the R5 1600 without many benchmarks etc but take my word for it the Ryzen 7 3700x is worth the investment.",

This is a common issue but the customer's fault. Simply go to Start and Search for Device Manager, Select IDA ATA/ATAPI Controller and if anything below that says anything other than \"Standard SATA ACHI Controller\" right-click it and select roll back.

The only downside is the supplied Wraith Stealth cooler is a bit fiddly to install although that's maybe because I've never fitted a CPU & cooler before.

      "text": "I bought this CPU for a basic pc with a little bit of graphical power (Intel don't offer that yet !!). The cpu features 4 cores and 4 threads. Under normal desktop operation the cpu performed very well. It will run older games at 1080p with low settings. Capable of running fortnite decent at 720p also. Most recent titles I have tried run at 720p low settings and are very playable. This processor is ideal for anyone on a low budget and just starting a gaming pc. It has enough power to be paired with a dedicated graphics card once your budget allows. Overall I'm impressed with the performance of this CPU for the price.",

      "text": "Bought this CPU as part of my first gaming build. Though by any means it is not the fastest CPU on the market, it packs more than enough processing power for gaming on my build at 1440p. Installing onto my motherboard (X570) was mostly straightforward, the chip itself clips in nice and simply. I'm using the stock cooler that comes with the chip, getting all the screws in place and tight was a little tricky but I got it fixed on eventually (tip: screw opposite corners in first!).",
