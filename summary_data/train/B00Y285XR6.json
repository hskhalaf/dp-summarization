Those that are complaining about the bench being unusable when a car seat in on the front part probably missed the instruction to remove the tray part of the arm bar at the front. The newer click connect car seats need that part to be removed so that it latches on to the bare arm bar several inches further forward.",

My baby also finds it very easy to nap in the reclining position and my 4 year old loves standing on the back. The cupholders are great. I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 because we are a family constantly taking items in and out of our bag which is hard to get to in bottom basket. Really glad we purchased this stroller as some of the more expensive brands have lower weight limits and larger footprints.",

The awning is high and narrow, and doesn't do a lot to block sun, but is really awkward and in the way, especially when folded. We had the stroller for three months before realizing that the awning came of, and it wasn't for not trying. Also, the adapter for the car seat is black, and is tucked under the beverage tray. Only by searching Amazon reviews did I discover THAT tidbit. At first I thought it came with no adapter. The assembly instructions are minimal.",

Plently of room for my 3 year old or 18 month old. The front seat is definitely meant for a younger child. I would say 3 and under depending how big your child is. Drives great, easy fold up, can put easily into back of vehicle. Do yourself a favor and buy it! Can't beat the price!",
