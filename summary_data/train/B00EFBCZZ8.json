It is very lofty but the twin XL fits easily into a front loading washer. My son said it is really comfortable. The only negative is that the bottom liner under the pad is thin and can rip easily if you aren\u2019t careful when washing and drying. I did have to make a small repair to the liner and it has been fine ever since. I have recommended this mattress cover to many college students and haven\u2019t heard any complaints. A great purchase and a great price!",

I rotate the mattress pad a quarter turn at each changing to make sure it wears more evenly. I would recommend it!",

Measures maybe like 1-2 inches while fluffed, and then flattens when you lay on it, as you would expect with down alternative. I feel like it doesn't add much to the bed, but there is a little extra cushion. Due to the quilted look, it makes a quilted pattern on my sheets when you lay down on it too. Not that big of a deal. It comes in a little vacuum compressed package inside of the pictured little baggie. Once you cut it open it makes a hissing inflating noise and comes out to its full size. Overall okay purchase.",

I've bought 2 other types from amazon but this is by far the best in terms of quality, softness and feeling like you're sleeping on clouds. I bought my 1st one which was queen size, and then I recently bought the twin size which made the bed so much more comfortable. It's good to be placed on firmer beds b/c some beds take some time to break in but you don't want to buy a softer mattress either b/c the material will degrade over time. Would definitely recommend.",

Most people like me use to follow previous reviews, and particularly I like to read those unsatisfied evaluations, but during that time I did not find any kind of unhappy people telling their discontent about this product, so seeing that all those people slept peacefully and happy I decided to join them. I\u2019m very happy to find the right mattress pad. Now I feel so bad and miserable to leave my bed because this mattress pad makes me feel like I 'm sleeping on a cloud.",

      "text": "We ordered this to use over a sleeper car mattress for an extended train trip. The train mattresses can be brutal on the hips and back and this did the job wonderfully. It fit perfectly over the lower mattress, was easy to carry in its zipper bag with handles, puffed up nicely and provided great cushioning. We had tried air mattresses and foam pads prior to this, with limited success and poor portability... And the hospitology twin sized mattress pad was perfect for our needs. We haven't tried to wash it.. And at the price offered on Amazon, even if it doesn't hold up well under washing, I would just buy a replacement for our next multi day train journey.",
