We had to do a work-around, because my remote control was acting glitchy. Anyway, the tech that helped me was infinitely patient. (With no trace of irony, she told me that her name is \"Nice\".) I just wanted to acknowledge the great customer service I received, at no charge, on an older tv with no extended warranty. Great job, TCL!",

I called but they blamed it on the cable company, I have two toshiba tvs in the same house that do nto have the same issue. Nice price but really you get what you pay for, should have stuck with Samsung. Since writing this review I have come to find out the delay is not the television but the local cable company, we all know working with cable is a mistake. So thank you Comncast fo rthe delay. TV is doing well. better sound than expected, very good picture. I am satisfied with the value",

Normally, when it comes to items like TVs we purchase from a store just for the \"see what you are getting\" peace of mind.

I own plenty of familiar brand name products but that certainly doesn't make them perfect. Bottom line, the TCL was affordable and is a wonderful TV. Easy setup, great picture and well worth it. On a side note, if you are using a TV mount I found the instructions to be a bit limited. The manual says that 400 x 400 M6 screws are required but it makes no mention of length/depth. My online research yielded no help either. I later found out that 25 MM depth is the correct size for the M6 screws with this TV.",

I can't speak to the sound quality because I hooked it to a sound bar, but overall it's a fantastic TV for it's price range... I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good 40 inch on a budget.",

It's not fancy with 3D or internet-ready, but it has all the inputs we needed, the picture is good, remote works well, and I can watch through my computer, a blue-ray player or cable.

    "description": "TCL LE40FHDE3000 40-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LED HDTV with 2-Year Warranty. Enjoy a big screen viewing experience with the TCL 40-Inch 1080p 60-Hz Direct-lit LED HDTV.

Whether you're hosting movie night, cheering on a favorite team, or sharing your latest vacation photos on the USB connection, you'll love how this high-definition LED television brings your media to life.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nTHE CREATIVE LIFE\nWelcome to The Creative Life Allow us to introduce ourselves. We're TCL, The Creative Life. We're one of the three largest television manufacturers in the world, selling premium consumer electronics in over 130 countries across 6 continents. And we've been making high quality CRT, plasma and LCD televisions for over three decades. In fact, we probably made many of the components in your old TV, so even though we may have never officially met, chances are, we've been in your home for years. So, it's nice to meet you. Again.\n\nTHE ULTIMATE VIEWING EXPERIENCE\nEnjoy The Creative Life with the TCL 40\" 1080p back-lit LED HDTV. It delivers premium picture quality and tremendous value in a sophisticated slim frame design perfect for bringing entertainment to any space. This flat screen LED HDTV features Full High Definition 1080p resolution, a dynamic contrast ratio of 3,500,000:1, two HDMI inputs, TCL True Color, providing a broadened color spectrum for more natural color, TCL Smart Volume, for level sound when surfing channels and during commercials while meeting ENERGY STAR 6.0 Guidelines. Color Your World with affordable technology backed by an industry-leading 2 year limited manufacturer\u2019s warranty.\n\nMODERN, EFFICIENT DESIGN\nFit more picture into less space with Thin Frame design. ULTRA-THIN BEZEL\nThe thin frame design of TCL's E3000 Series TVs gives it high-end appearance without the high-end price. Thin frames maximize the big screen experience, by letting you fit more screen into less space. And images seem bigger without the frame getting in the way.\n\nSAVE MONEY, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT\nTCL E3000 Series LED TVs are Energy Star 6.0 compliant. That means they not only meet energy efficiency standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency but they save you money. And all TCL LED TVs are both lead and mercury free. Which means TCL LED TVs help consumers save money--and the environment--by efficiently using energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping harmful pollutants out of landfills.\n\nGET CONNECTED\nThe TCL E3000 comes loaded with all the inputs you'll need to get connected. The two HDMI inputs support copy-protected HD broadcast content and provide an uncompressed, all-digital audio/video link for the highest quality connection.\n\nThe E3000 Series also has two audio output connections to maximize audio connectivity, one for headphones and a second digital audio coax output for connection to your home theater receiver or other audio device. Other inputs include two HDMI ports, composite video, component video, a USB 2.0 port and PC audio and video for easy connection to the latest Blu-ray or DVD players, sound systems, camcorders, and game consoles.\n\nThe PC inputs let you stream your computer's digital media to the big screen, while the USB port allows for quick connection of a digital camera or other USB device.\n\nPERFORMANCE AND QUALITY\nENHANCED PICTURE AND SOUND\nYou'll enjoy crisp, vibrant images thanks to dynamic LED backlighting. The TCL E3000 Series automatically adjusts the LED backlighting based on what you're watching so you'll see perfect edge and shadow detail during dark screens and vivid, colorful pictures during bright scenes. Dynamic LED backlighting is the difference between a good picture and a great picture.\n\nAnd to complete the fully immersive experience, the E3000 provides surround sound with Dolby Digital processing through two built-in 4-watt speakers. And the 176-degree viewing angles ensure optimum enjoyment from multiple vantage points--a great feature for large spaces or social gatherings.\n\nON-SCREEN ADJUSTMENTS WITH CLICK OF A BUTTON\nWant to change the picture and sound settings to suit your personal preferences? It's easy with the on-screen user interface that is controlled with the remote control. Select customized presets or change individual sound and picture attributes with the click of a button.\n\nAdvanced Video Modes let you adjust the TV for the best possible picture depending on what your watching and the specific lighting environment. With Vibrant, Cinerama and Sports modes you'll always get the most from your TCL LED TV. Select Vibrant mode for daytime viewing in sunlit conditions, Cinerama mode for a true home theater experience or Sports mode for the big game or fast pace gaming action from you PC or gaming console.\n\nBACKED BY A 2-YEAR WARRANTY\nNot all TV brands have the confidence to stand behind their products with a 2 year warranty. But TCL believes you should get piece of mind with a new TV purchase. That's why TCL E3000 Series LED HDTVs are backed by an industry leading two-year manufacturer's limited warranty.\n\n2013 TCL MODEL COMPARISON\nSeries E3000 E3000 E3010 E3010 F3310TA E5510 E5510 Screen Size 32\" 40\" 50\" 58\" 32\", 48\", 55\" 40\" 50\", 55\" Resolution 720p 1080p 1080p 1080p 1080p 1080p 1080p Backlight Technology Direct LED Direct LED Edge LED Direct LED Direct LED Edge LED Edge LED Dynamic Backlight Refresh Rate 60Hz 60Hz 120Hz CMI 120Hz CMI 120Hz CMI 120Hz CMI 120Hz CMI Energy Star 6.0 Thin Frame Design Elegant Glass Base HDMI/USB 2/1 2/1 3/1 3/1 3/1 4/1 4/1 Dolby Processing Sound Equalizer SRS TruSurroundHD Channel Labeling PC Connectivity Sleep Timer Alarm (Wake Up Timer) TCL Smart TV Built-In Wi-Fi",
