      "text": "I did a lot of research on portable projectors and this one definitely is the best brightness, best quality for the price range. For everyone getting this projector you need to know two things: 1. Get a usb battery pack to extend battery life of this projector the built in battery is good but not great. 2. Pair with a bluetooth speaker, the built in speaker is crap - I paired mine with bose portable bluetooth speaker and it's an amazing combo. I plugged my roku stick into the projector and can play literally anything I want in my backyard on the projector. Highly recommend",

      "text": "Overall we have thoroughly enjoyed this projector. There are only a few things keeping this from being a five star projector in my opinion. At this price point you would like to see an autofocus and some sort of zoom capability. The focus lever works fine, but other models at this price point have that autofocus. Also the remote basically has to be within 3 ft of the projector to work. Still not a deal breaker. The quality of the image is what makes it all worth it though. The picture is excellent and still clear when there is some light which is great at this price point.",

My favorite part is the auto keystone feature! The internal speaker is average as to be expected from an internal speaker. Battery life is good. Lasts about the length of a movie. LG OS installed is great, and so easy to navigate and use!",
