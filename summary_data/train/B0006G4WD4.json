      "text": "This is a well-made collar. I can't speak to the durability of it, but it appears long lasting. It is definitely comparable to another H-S brand, without the middle plate. This was unfortunately way too large for my dog, even with all but 4 links taken out. This is more my mistake than anything else. The ends of the prongs are well rounded. It is difficult to separate the links to take it on and off, but that is the nature of the collar especially with a heavier weight prong. Overall great buy, would have happily kept and used if it was the right size.",

She is not aggressive but, just wants to be \u201call over\u201d anything that gets close. I transitioned from a regular collar to a choke-chain and was still barely able to hang on to her. This training collar made an instantaneous difference. Now I can walk her without it requiring every ounce of my strength and energy to keep her under control.",

Did that twice with this, yelped slightly but not a mark on her, probably just surprised. The adjustable nature of the prongs also makes it possible for them to snap apart if the dog twists the collar up, so a good fit is important.",

Much lighter than the bulky generic large prong collar bought at Petco for double if not triple the price of this one. We had a 3.2mm one for our 80 lb APBT/American bulldog. And he was more responsive so we bought this one for our other dog. Only docked 1 star because ot would be nice to have the option to incled 2- additional prongs since this one is slightly narrower than our other 3.2mm collar but it is perfectly fine otherwise!",

This collar has magically kept her focused and grounded and keeps her in control when another dog tries to lunge or starts growling and cursing at her. If you have a puller, dog with aggression, etc this is the last and only collar you will need. Always thought they looked barbaric, but they just give the dog a firm grip without choking them out. Super effective!!",

I tried click training and lots of practice and nothing was working. I bought this as a last resort and am amazed! Immediately upon putting the collar on she walked perfectly on the leash. It doesn't appear to cause here discomfort when she's doing what she needs to be doing but also doesn't cause harsh punishment if she's not. She now walks like a show dog and is such a pleasure to take a stroll with. Thanks!! I would recommend this product.",
