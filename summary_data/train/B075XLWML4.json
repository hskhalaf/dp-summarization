I had bought the device in order to be able to access one particular app/channel that I had been informed (wrongly, as it turned out) would be accessible via the streaming stick. Of course, the channel/app in question was not one of the available channels/apps at all, so my purchase turned out to be a waste of money. Roku should clearly indicate all the channels that are accessible to potential customers, before they buy the device, so that people can make an informed choice as to whether the product is suitable or not.

      "text": "Easy setup. Really easy; easier than the Amazon Fire TV. I got this to replace my Fire TV box, being on the fifth one now; it was pretty unreliable. The Roku also gets the Amazon Prime TV, and has dedicated pushbuttons for Hulu, Netflix etc. Part of the setup is to get it to recognize the TV so it's single-button on-off, volume control from the Roku control, also nice. It has much better wifi sensitivity than my old Fire TV box, too. The only mildly annoying part of setup is that you have to go to Roku.com/connect to activate it and finish the setup. Otherwise, it's a snap, took maybe 10 minutes to install and activate Prime, Netflix, and Hulu.",

If you call in, yes you will be asked to pay to activate. Its simple, go to the website it tells you to fallow the on screen display type in the code and create a account when it asks for credit card imformation to be on file scroll to the bottom and click SKIP. Done, roku activated. On a quality note, this stick has great video output compared to the lower 1080p models worth the money if you want 4k",

One thing I'd like to see, is a way to reprogram the preset buttons, so that it would go to the apps I use most. My old stick has an Amazon button, but this has ESPN. I only use one of the four preset buttons.",
