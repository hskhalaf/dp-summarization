One; colours are captured very true; and two, this camera has a fast shutter compared with my old Olympus and Canon. I ordered the electronic view finder and love its versatility. I look forward to learning more and to being creative with my new favorite camera. It will be even more fun once we buy a zoom lens.",

I am not a professional photographer by any means nor would I say that I am well versed in using dslrs, but this one has been pretty fun to play with and figure out on my own. It comes with a user manual, so that helps too. I've already bought the 40-150mm lens that I love, but the standard lens that comes with it does well for mostly every day shooting.",
