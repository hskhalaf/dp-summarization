It's not a magical foam that will lift all of the brake dust away, but it will loosen it enough to be easily removed with a brush. My biggest complaint is that it sprays in a very narrow stream and does not produce much foam with each pump, even on the \"wide\" setting. I only have 17\" wheels on my car and it is a chore to make sure I get the foam all over the wheel.",

To make the most out of it, make sure to agitate your rims with a wheel brush to reach the insides (a good one is no more than $20). ALWAYS wear gloves and protective glasses! Your fingertips will peel if you don't wear gloves because the foam will slowly leak out of the tip while you're spraying. Your safety glasses will prevent the foam from getting into your eyes when you're using the wheel brush.",

With the nice weather I treated the car to a personal car wash. I followed the instructions and the wheels are clean. The only problem is you need to use a lot of the foaming spray to cover the wheels various surfaces. On my car one 24 oz. bottle should cclean the four wheels twice. Since this is the first wheel cleaner of this type I'm not sure if that expensive. However, I'm very please with the easy no touch results.",

Rinse and voila! Wheels look brand spankin new! I could eat off it if I had to! This isn't spray and rinse folks...you will have to put some effort but believe me, you wont be disappointed!",

I found Mother's Foaming Wheel & Tire Cleaner gently removes the stubborn brake dust without harming the paint. I use a very soft brush to get into the nooks and crannies and this cleaner makes my car look spectacular!!! So glad I found it!",
