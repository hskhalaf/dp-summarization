Unless you coat them, these are not water resistant but they will provide much needed warmth on a cold morning. Size is exact so if you want to wear them with bigger socks, you may want to go up a size but IMHO, they\u2019re much nicer just on your bare feet. \u2728",

    "title": "UGG Women's Classic Tall II Boot",
    "description": "Our Classic boot was originally worn by surfers to keep warm after early-morning sessions, and has since become iconic for its soft sheepskin and enduring design. The Classic II Tall features two new updates: a pretreated exterior for stain-and-water resistance and a lightweight sole to increase cushioning, durability, and traction. These versatile boots pair well with practically anything \u2013 try a flowy floral dress, a silk slip, or loose boyfriend jeans and a velvet top.If you are unsure which shoe size to purchase, please follow the following steps:1)Draw a straight line, longer than your foot, on a piece of paper.2)Place the paper on a flat surface. Stand on the line with your heel and longest toe centered on the line. If measuring a child's foot, it may be easier to hold the paper up to their foot.3)Place a mark on the line at the tip of the longest toe and at the back of the heel.4)Repeat steps 1-3 for the other foot.5)Measure the distance between the marks. Take the larger of the two measurements. 17mm Twinface sheepskin upper. 17mm sheepskin lining. 17mm sheepskin insole.",
