My BIG DISAPPOINTMENT is I purchased them in Feb. and less than 5 months they no longer work. I reached out to the company Cell Emporium and they said there is only a 90 day warranty. I've had 3 other LG headsets and they lasted minimum of two years, In fact I had to revert back to my old one that is about 3 years old. I would beware of this company as I have to believe these must be refurbished to only last 5 months.",

Other than that they're great headphones. i recommend the HBS-910 instead, theyre better in every way except that the 910 is Bluetooth 4.1 and the 920 is 4.2",
