      "text": "This gel does work on proud flesh on my horses and summer sores on my dogs. I have a rescue ranch and this seems to do the job on just about any deep cut or just plain sore. I like the gel as getting under a horse, anything that sticks when sprayed on is perfect. It is expensive but it does seem to go far. I will continue to use this on any injuries because it does the job in a shorter healing time.",

The dog and cat put up with having it applied--in fact the dog sees the bottle and lies down so I can apply it, knowing that this will make her hot spot feel better.

Although veterinary prescription products (such as Neo-Predef) may work more quickly than using a spray, Vetericyn is relatively cheap (a vet visit to obtain a prescription of Neo-Predef may run at least $70) so I highly recommend this spray.
