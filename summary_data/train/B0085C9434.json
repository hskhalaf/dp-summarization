I wouldn't have paid so much for this if it hadn't been for Gordon Ramsey's YouTube video, but now I know why he was so impressed with his Bamix. I'm impressed with my Bamix, too.",

The taste of the tuna when it is so well flaked is delish. It's quick and easy too.",

Thus the choice is what attachments you want and perhaps the color of the unit. As you would expect from the inventor of the hand blender, the quality, durability, and ease of use outshine any other blender on the market. We had a Braun for many years and it was excellent but if you are making squash soup or some other dish that has pithy ingredients, this unit will give you the power and speed to pure\u0301e the ingredients to the smoothest consistency.

Just understand which blades work with your application. I made a chipotle butternut squash soup and and a poblano corn chowder with shrimp and used the immersion blender for thickness and it worked really well. It's a little pricey but well worth it.....",

The first time I sent it in to local service center provided by Bamix, they lubed it and found nothing wrong with it. I guess I'm still having the same problem, but I don't think this should be happening. It was expensive and even the mixing power didnt stand up to my other calphalon, which I cannot find anymore.",
