      "text": "I bought these so I don't have to mess around with my Shure SE215's when putting them on, these are just simple plug in your ear and play. No wonder they're the best earphones under \u00a3100. They sound way better than my Shure SE215's. 10/10 would recommend. EDIT: Honestly, you won't be disappointed with the sound quality of these earphones. I am picky when it comes to earphones and I can say that these definitely pass my expectations, if not, exceed it. Triple drivers ( 2 armatures and 1 dynamic driver) are amazing and you'll definitely hear the difference if you're coming from a single driver.",

I really enjoy listening to music and have a high end system at home ( MBL) and wanted something for travel. These really fit the bill. Build quality looks excellent, however i am concerned by by some of the comments below, and that has stopped me buying a second pair until i have had these a few months.

Three sets of foam..11-13-14.5mm which I found to be not very good sound wise, and six sets of silicone tips from 10mm to 14.5 which provided a better fit and sound. The supplied contents box is brilliant containing a leather carrying case,airline adapter,lapel cable clip, and earphones. IMORE also sell a Quad driver earphone which is \u00a3100 extra but to my mind the extra speaker would not sound \u00a3100 better. Very happy to recommend these headphones.",

Because on the begining was strange to listen music or use for gaming. Bought these as universal buds to listen sometimes music and for gaming. Well the tripple drivers does good job, but need time to get used to them. Good mic. Give 4 start only bacause of high price. In my opinion they a little bit above of AKG ear buds, but price way higher than AKG (I talking not about chinese copy).",

The earphones sound amazing, deliver clear and crisp sound through the mids and uppers and a well-balanced level of bass. Extremely durable too. The wire is a little bit unwieldy.

I contacted Amazon who quickly replaced them but did not advise me to return the originals. A few months later, after discarding the original pair, Amazon charged me for the replacement.

Took a while to get used to though as I wasn't used to it at all, but they're not overly bass heavy either. It's just there for when it's needed.

Comfort is very important when it comes to earbuds and you get a variety of different sized ones to find the ones for you.

      "text": "Bought these several months ago and after I lost them bought again... I'm not an audiophile but the sound is better than anything I've tried up to this point(excluding expensive over ear headphones) I use them for 1-2h every single day and am completely satisfied. One piece of advice :use the provided foam tips and when they wear out buy new ones-the experience is waaay better with foam tips. The one negative about these headphones is that the mic isn't the best when it comes to hands free calls-sometimes people say my voice sounds a little distorted if in a noisy environment.",

Amazing for a commute, and as others will say this is probably the best u boxing experience I've had for any tech product. Truly 5stars. You will hear elements of songs that you've never heard before. You will honestly be blown away by these even if you aren't an audiophile. Just save yourself the hassle and buy them",

These do all that and more. I've used them while running/sprinting as well as weight training and didn't have to adjust them once. I was also pleasantly surprised by how long the battery life is and how quickly they charge. They also work well during phone calls and pairing with devices is super easy. I have recommended these to several people and will continue to do so in the future.",
