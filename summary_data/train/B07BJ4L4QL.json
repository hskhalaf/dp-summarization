They are strong and their seams hold. We decided to save some pennies and forgo the flex feature, as we seem to fill up the plain and the flex with the same amount of garbage no matter what. We also saved some more by forgoing the scented bags--we disliked the flowery fake perfume scent more than we dislike the smell of the garbage.",

When these arrived it was like Christmas morning! My life was changed! I no longer had to live in squalor amidst the heaps of trash accumulated by myself and my roommates. The absolute joy brought to us by these trash bags is unparalleled by anything I've experienced before. I would highly recommend these for your household trash disposal needs!",

I was putting our recycling into the bag and a cardboard box quickly tore a hole through the middle of the bag. These are clearly not Glad trashbags so don't expect much quality from these trashbags. TIP: Also if you are strung on using these bags I suggest you double layer your trash bin,etc before putting trash or recycle in the bags,that way when you take it out if it tears you will have an extra layer so that your trash or recycle does not spill out.",

I have taken an evening walk with a full bag with no spills or ties breaking. Strong bags to put my leaf and branch cuttings into as well. what really impressed me is when I poured cooled cooking oil into Solimo garbage bag and it did not leak into my wastebasket. I have never actually seen a leak from other liquids as well.",

Plus, all the bags in the roll are already separated, you don't have to look for where you should separate the bags. I will certainly buy again.",
