It falls out every time you wash this bottle. It is very hard to put back on. It also collects dish soap, so you have to rinse few times. During wash number five or six it broke in half and now the bottle is unusable because it leaks like crazy. This design needs to change. I am shipping it back. Don't buy.",

That little gap is exposed and it creates that humidity smell you get when you put a wet glass facing down on a table, and then grab it to use after a day and it smells like crap.

      "text": "The bottle is beautiful, I really like how it looks and I have received many compliments about it. It keeps the water (so far I only use for water) cold for long period of time and the price is right. But it gives the water an after taste that I don't get in any of my water bottles. It's a metallic taste. Since I just get it , I will rewash it several times again to see if that will fade away, otherwise I will have to return it",

      "text": "Love these water bottles! We have one for every member of our family (each a different design) They all look amazing, keep water cold forever, are durable, and are so easy to drink out of compared to widemouth bottles! What more could you want? If there is a drawback it would be that some of the bottles are really big (so pay attention to what size you order). We have dropped these bottles more times than I can count, and they all still look brand new. It is so nice to have a bottle that works equally well on the athletic field and in the office meeting. I have mine with me day and night.",

If it's possible to curve the lip a bit more while preserving the seal, that would improve the overall design.",

I contacted Simple Modern and was informed that their products only have a 90 day warranty. Simple Modern wouldn't replace the bottle but did offer me a 10% discount on another purchase. The first one didn't last 4 months without becoming unhealthy to use, why would I buy another problem product?",

      "text": "This bottle is the best one I've purchased, which I did after reading the other reviews, thankfully. I'm only using my 17oz bottle for water, but it seriously keeps it at the same temperature, no matter if it's been filled with icy cold water and sitting in the hot sun in the car, or if I have room temp water and it's been in the freezing Chicago weather. Holds the temp of what you put in there. Excellent product, and love that it's 18/8 food grade stainless steel. Thank you!",

So far it has survived being pushed off my vanity with only minor scratches.",

The bottle don't leak and are very sturdy, even after an accidental drop. Solid insulated bottle for a great price.",
