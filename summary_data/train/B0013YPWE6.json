      "text": "11/9/20178 - Bought this 07/08/2016, used very little. Owned a bit over a year,The machine leaks all over the place. The rinse setting still leaks soap through the machine into your carpet so you never get a real rinse, you get a carpet full of soap. This is the 2nd one of these ive owned, last one lasted 3 years - the same thing occurred. Once it starts leaking water all over and soap into the rinse only setting - its all over - throw away and buy new. Very cheaply built - very poor quality. DO NOT BUY this machine.",

      "text": "I really like this. we had a hoover steam vac. What I like about this over the steamvac is that the trigger controlls are electronic, the upholstery attachment seems to be deigned better. We've used this many times since it arrived (3 dogs, 2 cats, and a toddler) to clean messes, and to generally clean our carpets. One thing I do note is that the cleaning solution does seem to mix inside the water tank, at least to some degree. It seems to be lighter than the steamvac, and is built differently. I'm still concerned about the longevity of this machine over time. It's almost all plastic and the power cord seems to be flimsy.",

      "text": "I've used lots of different carpet cleaners over the years & I must say I was very impressed with this particular model. Alot of other shampooers were good at putting water down but had poor suction which means the carpwts were just wet n dirty... But the hoover max extract dual v got excellent suction so the floors not only getting the dirt up, look cleaner but the carpets completely dry within 30 minutes whereas with my other carpet cleaners the carpets would be wet for hours due to it not sucking up as much water that it put down. Its definatley not a miracle machine but for the money its a excellent choice, I couldnt be happier :)",

It works great, even though I don't really have a pet stain problem, my girls use their boxes all the time and never get sick. I had no problems with leaks at all. It work wonderfully for me.

The dispenser dispenses extremely small amounts of cleaner fluid into the water. Very, very ineffective. I started mixing the cleaner fluid directly into the water and it worked fine. However this negates the use of the \"Rinse\" function. So it's kind of a catch 22; you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.",

Due to the set up it is a bit heavy when the clean water tank is full, so if you have shoulder or back issues you may need to find something else. Good luck finding something that works just as well and so simply though. We have a young child, 2 dogs, 2 cats and husband works on jets so we get a lot of dirt traffic despite not wearing shoes in the house. After 3 years of living in our house the carpets had a lot of wear and after one use they were fluffy and bright again. Worth every penny!",

I was pleased with the performance of the old one although the functionality of the resevoirs, especially the return tank, was overly complicated and I thought the brush action weak. Both of these problems were addressed with this machine and in addition it is more powerful than before. I have no complaints for this carpet cleaner, the performance is outstanding, I especially like the separate resevoir for the detergent meaning no more mixing in the clean water tank. The operation is simple and easy to use. Thumbs up!",

It took about 4 cycles (as recommended in the instructions) but it did the trick. After each cycle, an improvement was appearant. Read and follow the instructions and be very pleased.

Some parts are made out of really cheap flimsy plastic. Another issue I have is that I'm pretty sure it came without one of the tools.
