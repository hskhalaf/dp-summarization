I apply it everywhere that fabric could rub against my skin (ladies those jog bra burns are a thing of the past). I apply it to heels, in between toes, under my sports bra, thighs. You name it!! I ran the NYC Marathon in 2015 (It was my first full marathon) and I came out chafe free. ChafeX has become an essential on my run gear list!!",

I've been using ChafeX for about 3 years for everything from half-marathons to 50-milers, and I've found it works well in a variety of environments/temperatures, moisture levels, and distances. I use it on nipples, groin area, sides/balls of the feet, and between the toes, and it keeps away blistering / chafing during the whole race day without having to re-apply. It's also not slimy or smelly and won't leave a residue on clothing, which is great.",
