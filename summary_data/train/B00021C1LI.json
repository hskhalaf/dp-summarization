I can even open my eyes after I have the face wash all over them and it doesn't sting or burn. I great, gentle (but powerful) face wash that leaves your skins feeling soft and clean.",

Absolute miracle worker. My boyfriend has very oily skin and when he uses the purity the oil is dramatically decreased. It also removes makeup with having to use make up removing wipes!",

My pores aren't smaller, I have been breaking out more (I'm blaming the hot weather?), and my skin doesn't feel softer. It smells great and you only need to use a little. I don't know if I'm not giving it enough time to work, so I'm going to keep using it to see how it goes. I also bought some more products from philosophy so maybe in combination I'll get better results. I'll update my review if my results change.",

Great for sensitive skin!!",

When I used it for the first time, I said WOW! It got mascara off like I had never been able to get it off before, and my face did feel as though I had used toner; it did not feel tight,just clean. No more extra steps for toner and eye makeup remover, because Purity Made Simple does it all. Amazon has it on Subscribe and Save, so I will order it that way next time.",
