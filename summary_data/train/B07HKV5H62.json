He loves the fit and he says they are very comfortable. I do think they are a bit on the heavier side but it has good cushion and traction on the bottom. Seems like a solid build and should last long time. This one fits as expected! Hope this was useful... and if it was, please click on the helpful button below. Thank you!",

Overall, a good shoe so far.",
