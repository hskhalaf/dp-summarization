      "text": "This Powermatic replaces my jointer of the same size and performs as expected. Beds were spot-on upon arrival, no adjustment needed. Fence mounts needed help, but a minor issue. Once set up, it squares the work perfectly and the fence returns to square with no fuss. Dust pickup: The reviews on this are a flat out lie. Chips stream out from under the in feed table, ignoring my 3 HP cyclone system that has always and continues to support 4 other machines admirably, including my previous jointer. 3 calls to Powermatic tech support indicates this is a known issue with no solution other than \"more CFM\". This remains a pleasure to use, despite chips on the floor.",

Adjustments are easy to make, bed is really nice and flat. The motor runs very quiet, and while it's cutting, it doesn't make a lot of noise either. Dust collection is really good as well. Instructions are really good, and it comes with a few extra cutter knives and some push blocks as well. I give it five stars.",

But it arrived safe and sound, and the first jointed board (a reclaimed barnwood 2x4) came out beautifully square and smooth. The helical cutter head is quieter than my dust collector. Have completed about half of my first project (a kitchen cart) and this jointer has been amazing. Straight and true, powerful, quiet--what else do you want? Finish is so smooth I doubt I'll fuzz it up by sanding. Need to day it, I guess: Thanks, Powermatic!",

I eventually went to Lowe's and purchased some new set screws, put locktite on them, and haven't had any issues since. I also recommend spraying some silicon on the surface.",

The infeed table lever can be used to rapidly position table height, then the handle rotated for fine-adjustment of cut depth. Fence tilting is accomplished by a worm gear system, smoothly operated by a simple handwheel. The tables provide 73-Inch long extended support. A non-mar insert in the fence protects the table from scratches during adjustments. The jointer is available with a three knife cutterhead, or a helical cutterhead with four-sided knife inserts. The operating switch is high mounted for easy reach, and the push blocks have a magnetic base - store them on any metallic surface for instant access.",
