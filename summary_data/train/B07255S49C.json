      "text": "i was not expecting anything amazing out of this helmet for 70$, but i was very pleasantly surprised. The window is very large and the helmet fits great. adjustments are easy to make and it stays on better then my snap on helmet. lens changes are cake and the settings are easy to adjust even with gloves on. Im sure it wont last as long as my snap on helmet will, but considering i could buy 5 of these for the cost of one of those, i think this is an excellent helmet, especially for someone who is learning or doesent need to weld every day.",

It seems to require changes in light level to stay dark, which is fine for MIG or stick spattering along, but no good for a stable TIG arc. I was able to stick some spring steel in place over the test switch and just use it as a non-auto-darkening helmet, and finish the work confirming, that it's really just the helmet acting up.",
