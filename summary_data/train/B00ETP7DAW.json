(It saves you money too, from buying a cup of coffee on the go.) I can pour a hot cup of coffee from my coffee machine in this mug at 6:00 am in the morning and it will still be hot from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm, as if I just poured it in the mug. I can turn the whole mug upside down, shake it and it does not leak! I highly recommend this mug for people on the go!",

I didnt have my thermometer with me but I could say through a 12 hour work shift it maybe only dropped 1 or 2 degrees in temperature. This mug works better than my hydroflask mug and that was twice as expensive! As long as you don't mind maybe burning your self periodically throughout the day then this is the thermos for you!",

    "title": "Thermos Stainless King 16 Ounce Travel Mug with Handle, Matte Black",
    "description": "An ideal choice for people on the go, the Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Travel Mug is built to last and loaded with features to make for a more enjoyable drinking experience. Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is an insulation layer that performs better than any other. A superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer. This travel mug keeps beverages hot for 5 hours or cold for 9, making it a great choice for long days out and about or in the office. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 16 ounce travel mug is virtually durable, yet its sleek design is both eye-catching and functional. The contoured body shape is easy to grip and fits most automobile cup holders and is single serve compatible. For tea drinkers, a built-in tea hook is just the ticket to brew tea on the go. The tea hook can also accommodate most loose leaf infusers. The Stainless King Travel Mug comes equipped with a 100% leak-proof Drink Lock sealing lid which operates simply by pushing the lever 45 degrees right or left to open and close. And because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the travel mug just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the mug with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. The Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Travel Mug is made of BPA-free materials and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.",
