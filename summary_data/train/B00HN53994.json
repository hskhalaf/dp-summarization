It does have the hood, of course, but it would be more appropriate for town, out for dinner, etc. than a more trail/sport jacket. I was concerned about the size as I usually find medium sizes too short in the sleeves and larges too loose in the chest. Tall sizes are overkill for me. I'm longer in the arms than torso. However, I ordered the medium and the sleeve length is fine. Fits perfectly for me (YMMV).",

I initially got an XL, but returned it for a XXL because the jacket was a bit too tight in the shoulders and I didn't feel like I could layer anything under it if I needed too. Size issues, aside, it's a great jacket perfect for cooler fall days or as an outer layer when the weather gets really cold.
