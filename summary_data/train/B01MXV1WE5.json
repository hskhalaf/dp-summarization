      "title": "Does not play nicely with my 2017 MacBook Pro 13\"",
      "text": "These headphones have good sound quality and they block out a lot of ambient noise. Admittedly they don't compare to set of studio level headphones, but for home use where perfect reproduction isn't a must and you don't want to spend a fortune they're great. My only real complaint is that they REALLY don't get along with my 2017 MacBook Pro 13\". For some reason whenever they connect they have a really rough sound that stutters and breaks in and out. Occasionally the problem seems to resolve itself and the audio sounds fine, but the vast majority of the time this issue makes listening via my laptop near impossible (will update this review if apple software update fixes issue).",

      "text": "Excellent overall sound quality, it is very balanced with excellent but not that overly fake bass. CLEAN midrange without muddiness and treble without clashing distortion. That's all my average sound quality expertise can convey but hope that provides a good idea. Good battery life, comfortable for an on-ear style. Very nice to find it here for about 1/3rd of it's original launch price. Only downsides are no APT-X for low latency so very slight lip sync issues when using with a TV and earpieces do get a little warm over time. But for this considered a mid-range brand name set, and it's competitors don't have APT-X either in this price range, so not a huge deal.",

My one criticism of the design would be that the on button for bluetooth is on the back, so if you are laying your head down and you move it too much you risk turning the headphones off. Easy solution - wear them backwards! The quality for price is outstanding.",
