It said large on the chart and XL by the reviews. I went on with XL and fit just right. It is a little snug in the crotch area but having irish genetics It fit fine. low 60 degree water temps and it worked great at making that very tolerable for swimming.

To put suit on -turn it completely inside out then put your legs in first and pull the suit up over arms. Then pull up zipper using the long leash.",

If you have a straighter figure or are a guy this won\u2019t be an issue, but you may find the suit oddly shaped for you. The suit has quite a bit of curve in it to accommodate a curvy figure, so it\u2019s kind of a mismatch in its design. It really just needs a zipper that\u2019s about 6 inches longer.",
