      "text": "I had great delivery from seller. However \"Y\" key went bad and hard drive CRASHED. Sent back to Sony repair and they replaced hard drive, fan and repaired keyboard. Unfortunately this is the 3rd (TV, 3-laptops )product I've purchased from Sony in past few years and ALL three went bad. I have admired Sony products since I was a child because my Father (deceased) always purchased and loved SONY. I will have to give it very serious considerations before purchasing Sony products going forward because it appears QUALITY has fallen quite a bit!",

Pen input can be glitchy. Windows 8 to 8.1 upgrade a disaster. caused complete meltdown. the machine not responsible for this, but the mfg software - VAIO Update - should pick all this up before it melts down. Required COMPLETE reinstall of system. Be WARE of Win 8.1!!!",

It is a great bother, They offer only 1 position. In my offices, I have to prop it up to get away from the glare from the florescent lighting. I just got a foam calculator wedge to prop it on. The only other issue thus far, I would have preferred the screen is protected when closed.",
