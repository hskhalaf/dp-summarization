Doesn\u2019t seem like it could tear easily. I didn\u2019t even notice it had cushioned arms around the edges which was a plus. I didn\u2019t want to set this on the lawn and kill our grass so we placed it on pinestraw. I worried it wouldn\u2019t be comfortable to sit or stand on but it\u2019s not at all. Update: Using for a ball pit indoors for the fall. Successful so far",

I put it on my porch to be in the shade, with those large foam puzzle pieces under it for cushion! Easy to empty and super light to move/store (when empty of course). Also a plus for kids: the bars are padded! Took me all of 20 mins to put together. Completely worth the money!",

If the legs didn\u2019t constantly fall off I\u2019d give it 5 stars.",
