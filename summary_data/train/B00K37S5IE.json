We just ordered a new one and it\u2019s hard to believe it is made by the same company. Aside from the fabric on the outside being the same, everything else is different. The new one is significantly lighter, thinner, less dense and inflated unevenly. One end is flat and permanently smashed. We paid more this time around for something that is so much less. After hundreds of Amazon purchases over the years, this is my first product review, because I am so disappointed in the quality of this mattress.",

These mattresses are more comfortable than the king mattress on our bed that we paid thousands for. We've only had these for a about a month so we'll see how well they last but so far they are a great value.",

One corner of the mattress has a slope/inclined and I think it is because the springs never really opened up/straightened out correctly. The second mattress is fine. We bought these and had the two mattresses opened and left flat on the floor for about a month as we bought them before we were going for a long trip hoping that they will open up perfectly. Sadly, it was not meant to be. Not going to buy it again.",

That being said, even with bunky boards I feel a little sagging in between the slats when I sit on it. Just a little. The biggest problem is we have to stand on the lower bed to tuck in the kid in the upper bunk. This means sliding in between the slats if you don't step in the right spot. Not a deal breaker, but a little unsettling. I would buy a regular spring mattresses if I had to do it all over again.",
