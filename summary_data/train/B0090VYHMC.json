Cons: Customer service not so good, needed a replacement adapter for my bike seat, sent me the base and seat instead, no way to connect to bike. Seats are okay but if you tape it down with electric tape, it become steady. Hard seat and spike pedals, cant use other pedals because the hole is limiting. Overall It did help me reach my weight losss goals and survived years of me. I got this as a replacement as years of using might have been too much for the seat and pedals",

It doesn\u2019t take up too much room in the house. The bike runs smoothly. The resistance works great. I had no issues standing while cycling either. I definitely recommend purchasing this bike if you\u2019re looking for an inexpensive home exercise bike.",

So it will tell you you've burned the same number of calories regardless of the resistance.

It comes from the wheel rubbing against the friction piece that you use to adjust the resistance. The smell hasn't been bad, but the residue from the friction pad that's left on the wheel gives me a little concern about the longevity of the bike. I will update with any changes.",
