I bought the last two Cybershots as gifts for my grandchildren. It's an affordable camera to give pre-teens a real camera experience. The only thing I've found wrong with the one I own is that the battery latch isn't secure. It pops open easily, and the camera turns off in the middle of a shot. Otherwise, I've been pleased enough with the pictures that I have chosen this camera for my grandchildren.",

    "description": "Sony dsc-s750 digital camera\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n With Sonys Face Detection technology, the DSC-S750 detects up to three faces and optimizes focus, exposure, and color for accurate, natural photos of family and friends. You can capture stunning detail thanks to its 7.2-megapixel resolution and 3x optical zoom lens, while high ISO sensitivity helps reduce blur when shooting indoors or at twilight, even without flash. Compose your shots on the bright, 2.5-inch LCD screen. \n\nCyber-shot DSC-S750 Highlights \n\n7.2-megapixel Super HAD CCD More megapixels give you more detail and definition when you make big prints or crop in tight on your subject. The advanced Sony Super HAD (Hole Accumulated Diode) CCD design allows more light to pass to each pixel, increasing sensitivity and reducing noise. \n\n2.5-inch TFT LCD display The large, bright 2.5-inch TFT LCD display makes it easy to compose shots, check results, and read menus in sharp natural color, even in bright sunlight. \n\n22 MB internal memory Even if you forget your flash memory card, you can get the shot because 22 MB internal memory lets you capture a limited number of shots with in-camera convenience, then easily transfer your shots to a PC or optional Memory Stick Duo media. \n\nMemory Stick Duo media convenience A built-in slot accepts optional Memory Stick Duo media or Memory Stick Pro Duo media -- the compact, high-capacity storage media that make it easily to upload photos to your PC and are compatible with millions of devices worldwide. \n\nBurst mode You can fire off three shots automatically at 1-second intervals (VGA standard mode) or 2-second intervals (full resolution mode) -- a great way to capture a childs first steps or a pets best tricks. \n\nConvenient Photo modes To adjust quickly for specific shooting situations, you can choose from several convenient photo modes, including Auto, Program Auto, and Scene Selections such as Twilight, Landscape, Soft Snap, Snow, High Sensitivity, and Beach environments. \n\nFace Detection Face Detection technology automatically controls focus, exposure, color, and flash to help reveal faces in shadows, make skin tones look more natural, reduce red-eye, and eliminate harsh facial glare, so your photos bring out every expression on every face in every shot. \n\nFunction Guide This beginner-friendly function helps manage various functions and settings by displaying the description of chosen functions or settings on the LCD screen. The Function Guide can also be switched off. \n\nHigh Sensitivity (ISO 1250) mode For sharp, flash-free photos without blur, high sensitivity (ISO 1250) allows shooting at higher shutter speeds for better pictures in low-light conditions -- great for birthday parties, indoor gatherings, and candid portraits. \n\nPicture Motion Browser software Supplied software makes it easier to upload, organize, and search photos on your PC. When shooting photos using your camera and an optional GPS unit, the software even provides a convenient map view function that lets you sort photos by location and display their origin on a world map. \n\nQVGA Movie mode Capture 320 x 240 audio/video clips at high frame rate (up to 30 frames per second), with length limited only by the capacity of your media. \n\nSimple setup controls A quick press of the Home button opens your user-friendly graphical interface -- and you can select functions by simply moving a cursor vertically or horizontally to the appropriate icon. Function names and the on-screen Function Guide display make it easier to learn camera setup operations. \n\nSmart Zoom feature The Sony Smart Zoom feature intelligently \"crops into\" the central portion of interest in your photo, helping avoid the image degradation of other digital zooms. \n\nStamina Battery Power Provides extended battery life and shooting capacity when using a fully charged Lithium Ion battery-- enough to cover a long weekend or a whole vacation.",
