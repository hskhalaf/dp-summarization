The delivery also worked out very well and they had the flexibility to arrange a time that was more convenient for me. As for the product itself, in my 15,000 gallon pool it will heat up the water about 2 degrees an hour. It came in handy in late May/early June, but hasn't been needed a whole lot during July and August in the warmer weather.",

Amazon offered a new heater...but no money for install!! What good is that? They offered a 30% discount or nothing. What choice do you have? Amount saved by buying from Amazon evaporated when you pay installers and Amazon does not act like a local supplier would. Will never do this again. Fine for small items, not for big projects.",

Not sure if it's my individual unit, or it's a bad product. I wish the manufacturer would reach out!",
