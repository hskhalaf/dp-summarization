If your thighs are at all muscular skip these and opt for a shorter length, or a different brand entirely.",

Long enough to pull my feet inside for warmth when on the couch watching TV and my feet get cold. Looking forward to getting a pair in gray when I can. All in all I love them!",

If you are shorter than 5'5\" or would not consider your legs thin, then look for a boot sock instead of a yoga, or dance warm up.",

I'm just not sure if someone who is larger than I would find them too uncomfortable. Then again I have just gotten into dancing so maybe that is the norm.
