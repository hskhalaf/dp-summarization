Overall it's decent and not a bad value, but if you're going to spend the $ ob a massager it's probably worth getting a more powerful one.",

      "text": "I got this in April 2020, I guess as of may 31st it was no longer eligible for a return. It worked great the first few times I used it but it seems like it\u2019s lost its power/strength soon after. I have a TON of tension and knots in my shoulders, so maybe that\u2019s what wore it out. Regardless I\u2019m super disappointed about that because I haven\u2019t even 3 whole months. The massager itself is ok. It\u2019s sits on your shoulders a little awkward and bulky, you can only sit up or sit leaning forward while using it. So if you wanted to lean, lay or sit back while using this, it\u2019s not for you I promise.",

I scrunch up my shoulders and it relaxed my neck and shoulders amazing. I started using it all over my back the second time and it was equally helpful and felt amazing.

A pillow by definition is soft. The machine does work well - gets tight muscles loose wherever you can position the machine to work. Back muscles and the lower leg muscles seem to get the best relief.",

I do the recommended time that it says is okay so that I dont overdue it. I have really bad neck, shoulder and upper back arthritis. So I'm constantly in pain. This does bring me some relief. But sometimes when I'm done using it, I cant help but feel like it bruises me. Probably not the products fault. I hold it down to make more pressure, to get the deep tissue. Like I said, I like it, but sometimes it makes it more uncomfortable.",

      "text": "When purchasing I wondered if it would just be a smaller and thus less useful version of a massage chair- but it is infinitely better! It has great pressure and can be moved to different parts of the body to get pain relief easily. Massage chairs never hit the right spots and are designed for someone much taller and bigger than me... but this really allows for anyone of any size to get the massage in the right places. I have chronic neck and shoulder pain and I feel better after using this for 30 minutes than I do after a deep tissue massage. Highly recommend!",

Though, after a month and a half, the turning wheels activated by the motor became dull of edge and couldn't turn the massage roller balls anymore. Plus the motor just got weak from the sounds of it to begin with. It is useless now. I wish we could send it in for repairs or placement parts, but all in all the motor is just weak so this is bound to happen often no matter how often you get a new one. I do not recommend going through these problems for anyone!",
