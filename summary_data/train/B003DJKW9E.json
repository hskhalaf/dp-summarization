I have no plans to leave it up days at a time, so hopefully will last for years to come since it will be minimally exposed to the elements. I will say one raquet had the grip tape start to unravel, but that was an easy fix.",

The set is fully complete even with a pump to pump up the volleyball and a durable cord to mark the outline of the court with spikes to keep it in place. The net is VERY durable not like those cheap nets I've bought before. And it can all be contained in the bag that is included. Very pleased.",

The only downside is the shuttlecocks are really light so they don\u2019t go very far when hit. I got some extras on Amazon (different brand) and those were much better and more what we\u2019re used to using. Overall, we love this and look forward to using it for many more seasons.",
