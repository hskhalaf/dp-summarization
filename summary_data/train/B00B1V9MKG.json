There was an alarming amount that had built up in her ears over the times she had used these, and some even had skin starting to grow over to where removing from her is causing her a bit of ongoing pain (however, I expect this to decrease quickly as the sore heals).

I can't address how effective they would be while swimming, but I doubt if the seal is that complete. For my needs, it hasn't been an issue. Take great care removing them. You want to push up on the back of the ear to dislodge them, and slip them out intact. Leaving tiny bits of residue inside the ear will cause more problems than the Putty Buddies can solve. Be sure to discard them when they start to fray. It's cheaper to replace them than to have to rush to an ENT specialist.",

      "text": "These ear plugs work as they're supposed to. I bought them for my infant to take baths and i can easily tear them into smaller pieces to fit in his ears. They are soft silicone so you may mold them into whatever shape they need to be. I tried them myself and they're very comfortable compared to foam ear plugs. There is a small container with a lid to help keep them clean, as the ear plugs are reusable many times.",
