The pallet has been USED, you can see in the pics and the lipgloss is stale and stinking! The mascara was dry as a bone! The hangover spray was halfway and the label was coming off! Disgraceful! $55 for used garbage you shouldn\u2019t be selling and I\u2019d bet it\u2019s a knockoff! I\u2019m ticked!",

Contacted Amazon right away I had pictures but they didn't ask for anything and I had choice refund or send another. I asked for another. It was overnighted.. I seen it came from another site but Amazon was the seller. The Company it was mailed from I give -3 no packing on either one the box was crushed still it's the too face box. Amazon was amazing on customer service. The company that just threw it in a box to mail be careful from that company. Reason for 3 was because of packing and both times the tooFaced box was crushed.",
