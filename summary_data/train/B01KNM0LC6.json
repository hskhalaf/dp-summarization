The inside walls are not so steep that she minds putting her head in the bowl, but it still slows her eating, and coupled with elevating the bowl, it has greatly improved her issues with regurgitation. I wash it in the dishwasher and so far no problems with wear and tear. My cat is happy, and I'm happy!",
