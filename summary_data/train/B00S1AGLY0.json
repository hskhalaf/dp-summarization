The handle wiggles a bit, since it is not one long piece. Therefore, one has to be careful and only lift the vacuum by the special handle on the upper back of the unit. Overall, a great vacuum.",

We had a Miele about 10 years ago and it worked well until the bag kept coming unattached and the vacuum spewed crap everywhere. It was caused by a small little crappy attachment the holds the bag from breaking off and the bag wouldn't stay attached. Several years later we bought this one thinking that the Germans would have certainly detected this design flaw and fixed it. Well, they didn't. This time around my wife pulled the full bag out to dispose it and the crappy attachment came off with it. She didn't realize it and threw it away. German quality my foot!",

You must push the handle down into the main apparatus securely or else it will turn on but when you move it the connection will be lost and it will shut off. Returned it because I thought it was broken. Amazon immediately sent me a new one, but had the same problem so called Miele customer service and the rep knew exactly what the problem was. Miele should write that in the instruction manual under trouble shooting.",

After doing research I bought one. It is amazing! It is German-made and sleek and powerful. I have lots of pets and it does a stellar job of sucking up all of the hair. I have tried to vacuum my pets directly with it, but they aren't too crazy about that part.",

I had an issue with a broken belt and the local dealer was able to fix it right away. Hopefully it lasts a long time!",
