These are the only boots that fit her fronts in a medium with room to spare. Their so easy to clean and put on. They also stay dry in wet and hot weather. My horse is clear she likes these for her work and I like them for cost/ease of use. I ended up buying another set in a different color.",

I would suggest using some electric tape to keep the Velcro attached since it's not double lock. But these boots are great otherwise. I love the different colors. Really helps with cross country color themes!! And since they're neoprene they work well with water and don't weigh down at all. And are incredibly easy to wash. Will definitely be buying more pairs in the future.",
