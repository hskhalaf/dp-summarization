Would definitely buy again and hopes the picture helps those that are unsure about the compatibility",

However, if you want to use NVMe and M.2 SATA at the same time, pay attention to the dual M.2 connectors since you will either lose half bandwidth of your NVMe or give up installing the m.2 SATA SSD. =>The shorter one in the picture only supports PCIe x2 and does NOT support SATA interface. And, there is a longer one next to PCIe slot( which will be under graphics card if your graphics card need 2 or more slot width) supporting PCIe x4 and SATA. So, you can install NVMe under your graphics card giving up your M.2 SATA SSD, or install NVMe at low speed M.2 Connector.",

Performance-wise it gets the job done and doesn't look half bad either. You have a decent amount of different RGB lighting modes (I believe anywhere from 5-10).",
