They didn't work because the menu option was not on the phone at all. When I tried to get support I found out that this phone was not made in USA but in Hong Kong and that is where I go for support. I have tried around the clock however, there is not chat available or phone number or even an email address. Yes this phone has a one year warranty and I just opened the box but I am out of luck. Don't buy this phone.",

It comes with the same bloatware that's installed on most phones these days, but Samsung did us a favor by shipping with an unlocked bootloader, so if you're technically skilled you can install Cyanogenmod on it. It can run Jellybean or ICS this way. The two that we received are both the unlocked I9300 international versions. I would be quite unhappy if I ordered it and received the locked AT&T version as some reviewers here are describing.",

As with all android phones it is supported by 600,0000 applications. This is like. The best part about this is that all the features now available on the iphone 5 were on the galaxy long before. Most people don't realise but the iphone is actually behind in terms of features. It you want features and to be untethered get this phone.",

Love it, it has a big screen I can change the font to help with reading fine print its fast and feels good in my hand slim but something to grab on to the only negative is its not just plug in and download photos you have to download a program or use a chip to move photos its not complicated but I prefer just plug and go like my other phones",
