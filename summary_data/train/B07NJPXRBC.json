      "text": "I bought this for the Google assistant integration. This is a great smart speaker for the acoustics alone. I had a google home that we loved, but wanted something louder for our patio. The integration with google assistant and streaming music is not great and somewhat difficult to integrate ( for instance I cannot ask google to play Sirius Xm). After some troubleshooting I found that Alexa is better for streaming integration, and changed the settings to make it an Alexa Sonos instead of Google assistant. So far so good!",

The Alex constantly locks up, fails to connect and has other issues requiring ongoing reboots. I am going to just disable it and put my dot back in use, because its too frustrating and undependable. Also while researching the problem, I saw the manufacturer support deflecting and appearing to blame owners WiFi, and other network issues for their devices Alex problems, which has me wondering if they have any intention of ever correcting it. Bottom line, great speaker, bad Alexa implementation.",
