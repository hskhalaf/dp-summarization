However, if I took a picture of a light object, a white wall for instance, there was a dark circular spot in the center. It looked like a dark shadow. So I had to return the camera and I bought another one and it works fine. It takes great pictures and love it. It's easy for a beginner. Good luck!",

All in all I'm happy with my camera.",

Previously I owned Sonys and was expecting similiar performance but was very disappointed. I've tried serveral settings and still can not take good indoor or outdoor pictures where fill flash is required.",

I have fiddled around with the settings trying to find the right balance, and there isn't one! After reading other reviews, I presume that I purchased a faulty one! Shame on me for not taking it back sooner! I do not recommend this POS and simply suggest spending a little extra money for a D-SLR. Trust me, you will be much happier in the end. (Sorry Nikon... I love my D200, but this thing stinks!)",

It wouldn't focus when turned on, gave me an error message and then turned off. I took it back to the store because I had purchased a warranty package on it, and it's been 8+ weeks now and no camera. Being a picture fanatic, it's upsetting to have to \"steal\" cameras at weddings and family gatherings and then beg for the owner to email me the pics. I miss my little coolpix 2500.",

      "text": "I've had this camera for 2 weeks now. In well lit scenarios pictures are perfect, no complaints in this, even in cloudy days the pictures are awesome, very well detailed. But at night, this is where it's a bit disappointing , the flash is not good at distances greater than 6 feet. Faces look too dark, sometimes you only get to see fuzzy circle instead. I guess this is where they save the money. Other than this it's a highly recommended camera for the outdoors, and indoor during the day.",

    "title": "Nikon Coolpix L2 6MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Nikon Coolpix L2 combines an array of high-quality components including a 3x Zoom-Nikkor lens and a bright 2.0-inch LCD screen with in-camera image-improvement features, housed in lightweight, compact, yet elegantly finished bodies.\n\n It boasts powerful 3x Zoom-Nikkor lenses with a focal range equivalent to that of a 38-116mm (35mm equivalent), providing the freedom to zoom in for tight personal portraits or out to capture expansive outdoor scenes.\n\n The CCD delivers higher performance within tighter dimensions, greatly adding to the camera's compact form and portability while offering generous effective megapixel values of 6.0, ensuring the refined image clarity that users have come to expect from other members of the Coolpix family.\n\n The camera also features a bright, easy-to-view 2.0-inch LCD that's now even easier to operate with new icons and function selections as well as a new color scheme that is easier on the eye.\n\n The specific design aspects of the Coolpix L2 makes it streamlined and comfortable to hold, with a smooth, elegant finish that suggests a much higher level of sophistication. The curved grip contributes both to the camera's design elegance and its shooting stability.\n\n The strikingly compact dimensions and light camera weight make the L2 ideal for taking anywhere you may go, reinforced by the convenience of AA-size battery compatibility. One of the most widely available battery sizes in the world--in alkaline, lithium, rechargeable, or other forms--AA compatibility allows near-ubiquitous use anywhere in the world.\n\n In common with the entire current Coolpix digital camera range, this latest addition features a number of Nikon-inspired capabilities that give the user the power to automatically improve recorded images in-camera. Available in playback mode, for example, the D-Lighting function selects and creates a copy of images with excessive backlight or insufficient flash illumination, adding light and detail wherever needed while keeping other areas as they were.\n\n Nikon's Face-priority AF function automatically detects and focuses in on people's faces, regardless of where they are in the frame, ensuring superb crisp-focus portraits. The In-Camera Red-Eye Fix function analyzes each image, automatically finding and then correcting the accidental red-eye that sometimes occurs in flash photography, for more natural-looking portraits.\n\n A choice of 15 different Scene modes--four with Scene assist--makes the challenge of achieving desired results in a wide range of everyday situations that much simpler. By choosing the Scene mode best suited to the subject at hand, the Coolpix L2 automatically selects the ideal settings for exactly the picture you had in mind, whether indoor party or outdoor nighttime fireworks display. Scene assist displays useful framing guides in the monitor, helping you compose shots for optimal results.\n\n All three of the latest Coolpix L class cameras are compatible with widely available SD memory cards. The provision of 23 MB of internal memory for the Coolpix L2 allows the user to keep shooting when no additional memory is available, as well as easily moving images from one SD card to another.\n\n The Coolpix L2 digital camera also offers movie-shooting capability in three sizes: TV movie size (640) for viewing on TV or computers; convenient Small size (320); and Smaller size (160) for extended recording or Internet usage.\n\n With the Coolpix L2, ease of use and convenience are still priorities, even when the shooting is over. Printing is kept simple, with PictBridge capability enabling connection to a compatible printer without the need of a computer and USB connectivity eases data transfer to computers and other peripherals.\n\n Completing the picture is the complimentary PictureProject accessory software, which greatly simplifies the importing, editing, and organizing of images. It even offers compatibility with a range of plug-ins that allows functions to be extended on demand.\n\n Nikon Coolpix L2 feature highlights:\n\n High performance from a small CCD\nUtilizing space-efficient design parameters that help facilitate the compact size of the Coolpix L2, the 1/2.5-inch CCD adds the advantage of outstandingly high performance. Boasting an effective pixel value of 6 million for the Coolpix L2, the CCD enables the capture of crisp-focus images that retain their high quality even when significantly enlarged.\n\n 3x zoom capability\nThe remarkably compact dimensions of the Coolpix L-line cameras belie the incorporation of a powerful 38-116mm Zoom-Nikkor lens (35mm equivalent), ensuring the freedom of a 3x zoom. This precision lens allows zooming in for tightly composed portraits or zooming way out for expansively wide views, providing greater compositional independence than the average digital camera. Macro mode allows shooting from as close as 10 centimeters.\n\n Simple-to-use features improve images in-camera\nA range of unique Nikon functions enables the photographer to actually improve images in-camera. Available in playback mode, the D-Lighting function selects and creates a copy of images with excessive backlight or insufficient flash illumination, adding light and detail wherever needed while keeping other areas as they were. The Face-priority AF function automatically detects and then focuses in on people's faces, regardless of where they are in the frame, ensuring superb crisp-focus portraits. The In-Camera Red-Eye Fix function analyzes each image, automatically finding and then correcting any accidental red-eye, which sometimes occurs in flash photography, to produce more natural-looking portraits.\n\n AA-size battery compatibility\nDespite its compact dimensions, the Coolpix L2 is compatible with AA-size batteries, one of the most widely available battery sizes in the world. The power to shoot approximately 180 shots for the Coolpix L2 when using alkaline batteries greatly augments its compact convenience.\n\n Other features:\n\n\n * Unique combination of all-round quality, ease of operation, and elegant styling makes Coolpix L2 the compact digital camera of choice for entry-level photographers \n * Compact, portable dimensions: 91 x 60.5 x 26 millimeters (3.6 x 2.4 x 1.0 inches) (W x H x D) \n * Light weight for Coolpix L2 of approximately 120 grams (4.2 oz) (without battery and SD memory card) \n * BSS (Best Shot Selector) automatically selects the shot with the sharpest focus from a series of consecutive images \n * Blur Warning informs user after shooting if an image is blurred \n * Time zone function enables local time to be set regardless of where you are in the world \n * Single AF and Continuous AF selectable in Movie mode \n * Capture modes: Single, Continuous, and Multi-Shot 16 for Coolpix L2 \n * Built-in flash: Features settings for Auto, Auto with red-eye reduction (In-Camera Red-Eye Fix), Off, Fill Flash, and Slow sync. \n * Noise reduction provides more attractive results in low-light conditions \n * Digital zoom of up to 4x \n * Choice of White Balance: Auto with TTL control, 6-mode manual (Daylight, Incandescent, Fluorescent, Cloudy, Flash, and White Balance Preset) \n * USB connectivity allows quick and easy data transfer to computers and other peripherals",
