      "text": "Forget Epson's ! I bought this scanner just as a temporary while I was looking for Epson Perfection V700, to my surprise this is twice as fast, colour rendition is as good if not better, scanning software can be set to your liking and it will scan, crop and save several photos in one go. I have Canon large format printer too, so included software works like a photo copier. Insert A4 photo in the scanner and it will enlarge it to A2, A1 or A0 and print it on the large format automatically. Fantastic. No power supply needed as it's powered from USB. Scan negatives without back light and just reverse in Photoshop. Simply amazing.",

Additionally it started generating streaks in scanned images, this was resolved by recalibrating it but the option for this is thoroughly buried.",

It also cannot handle this above a small size, although this is mainly down t the software. This is really a great little scanner for everyday tasks, I would not recommend it for professional digital archiving, but then for the price, you really can't do much better.

This is a good scanner and about 10 seconds on a standard 300 DIP A4 scan. However one small issue is that the physical scanner buttons do not work in Mac OSX El Capitan. After a conversation with Canon support they claimed this is due to changes in El Capitan. On Yosemite and earlier the scanner buttons will work as they always have. Otherwise this scanner works fine.",
