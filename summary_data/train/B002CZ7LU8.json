They are well made, easy to install, easy to clean (no glass!), and I get compliments all the time on them. I have 2 installed over my kitchen island. These are also for sale at Home Depot, but are more expensive there than on Amazon. I absolutely recommend buying this lantern...but don't just buy one! They look awesome in multiples!",

We had to take the light down after we connected all the electrical because we didn't have a part on correctly that holds the decorative cover on. Had the instructions told us how to do it, we would've been fine. The other thing I'm disappointed about is the middle candelabra piece is bent, making the entire center piece look off. I'll continue to work on straightening it out, but it may go back if it doesn't work.",

I recommend putting in LED lightbulbs so they last longer. It's the perfect amount light for the area.",

It is a striking look in our entryway. I love that it doesn't have glass to clean--the old fixture was forever getting dusty and filmy, and being so high up was a challenge to clean. This fixture has a classic shape, yet the black color and details lend an industrial/contemporary vibe. Very pleased with this light.",

We were purchasing to replace a larger, more elaborate bright brass fixture with a lot of glass content and debated if the size would be correct for the space. Fixture arrived packaged for easy removal. No assmbly except threading in the 4 bulbs ( not included & stated so on Amazon info ). Once hung, the fixture size seems pefect for the 6' X 8' two-story foyer space. The fixture is well constructed and finished. I would buy again.",
