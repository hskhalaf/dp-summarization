The first card I got corrupted an entire photoshoot and I was left with only my JPG backups on card 2. It happens unfortunately so I sent it back and got another one. Now I decided to shoot raw on both cards just in case. Every few photos I still get a completely scrambled, corrupted picture on the Sony card and zero issues on the second card. Absolute garbage cards for this price. Sending card #2 back now and going to another brand. Really disappointed.",

It makes burst and continuous shooting so much easier when your buffer can keep up. If you don't photograph a lot of action or use burst/continuous shooting much, the extra speed may be unnecessary for you. These cards are VERY pricey for the amount of storage they hold, though, so I would only get them if you know you're going to need the extra speed. Otherwise a UHS-I card will serve you just fine for half the cost.",
