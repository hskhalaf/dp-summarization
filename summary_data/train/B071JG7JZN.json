Fit wise they feel very restrictive, probably because of the shiny plastic outside. Make sure you have about 10 minutes to put them on. I don\u2019t like spending time on something like this, especially when I\u2019m getting ready for work. The heel feels like it\u2019s an inch too tall for the platform, they are hard to walk in. I\u2019d return them if the colors weren\u2019t so perfect, but the comfort is lacking so I won\u2019t be wearing them too much...",

Yes, you need to break them in, like all leather boots, especially if your going to lace them all the way up. I would buy them again and again.... love them! Color is like a dark Dr.Pepper red/black. I swear it\u2019s perfect and can be pulled off with black or darker brown outfit. Really stunning and unique, I actually prefer this color over straight black.",

I have an old pair of heeled lace-up docs that I\u2019ve had for years and can no longer repair so I ordered a new pair and had to return to size down partly because they were a little big but also because they looked like brick houses on my feet. I got these in an 8 and fit just snug but still look so bulky on my legs.

      "text": "A little more work to walk in but so so worth it! Gorgeous color that seamlessly goes with everything. Even though the leather in this style is suppose to be stiffer than their other boots, I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they were from day 1. **Sizing is not the same as my other Doc\u2019s. I am a US sz.6 but my other Doc\u2019s are a size 5. Perhaps due to the heel on this particular shoe.",

    "description": "The Kendra ankle boot by Dr. Martens is minimal yet tough, with a 10-eye high-heeled silhouette and a chunky commando rubber sole with heavy tread. This season, it comes in Arcadia, a classic cherry-red rub-off leather with a high shine.\n\nDr. Martens is the stuff of legends. It all began near Munich, Germany in 1945 when Dr. Klaus Maertens injured his foot in a skiing accident in the Bavarian Alps. To make walking easier during the healing process, he designed a shoe with an air-cushioned sole. Using old rubber tires, he constructed soles that had air trapped within closed compartments. He showed his prototype to his engineer/inventor friend, Dr. Herbert Funck, and together they decided to develop and produce the shoes. Not only did the shoe solve the doctor's immediate problem, but it also started to sell well in Germany. By 1959 the two decided that they needed a company to produce and distribute the shoes, then called Dr. Maertens, in other parts of the world. At first, many manufacturers rejected the concept of an air cushioned sole as a short-lived gimmick. However, the R. Griggs Group, located in the village of Wollaston in England, decided to go along with the idea by creating the first work boot with the revolutionary sole. On the first of April 1960, the first cherry red eight-eyelet work boot was produced and named 1460. To sell the brand name better in England, the name was anglicized to Dr. Martens. The range was branded AirWair and the rest is history.",
