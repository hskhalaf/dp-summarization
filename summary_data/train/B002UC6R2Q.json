One person can do it but there are certain moments when it needs two sets of hands; one to hold it place and another to put the screws in. 2. when the directions say put the screws in when the stairs are upside then leave it upside down. I snapped the treads into place and I thought I could turn it right side up before attaching the braces. that doesn't work because then the holes on the braces won't line up with the holes on the treads.",

They are made nice and fold down nice. Just measure and make sure you order the right size. These were only 21\" high and we could have used the 28\".",
