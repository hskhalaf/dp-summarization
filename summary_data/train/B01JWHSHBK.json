      "text": "Very, very rarely do I give a 5 star review, but this product deserves 6 stars. First off, the quality is that of any $200-$300 kit you would buy at a home improvement store. The rails are straight and sturdy and powder coated. The bearings are smooth. I have used two of these now and they work great. Installation is straightforward and simple. One thing I have noticed in other reviews is folks commenting on the door bumping as you roll it....if your door bumps you have the rail spacers backwards, the fat side goes to the wall, not the rail (see the photo).",

THIS always has to mount over a door frame, and when anybody builds a door frame there will always be a variation in where the studs will be, so you will never get the holes to match up no matter what you do. I had to use a wooden runner, which is no big deal and looks good. Just keep in mind that the pre drilled holes won't match up to your stud locations.",
