After returning the other two flat irons I went ahead and spent the extra money on a Paul Mitchell (which I have a 1.25 ion-and love it). I purchased this PM from Perfect Heart via Amazon. I was excited to have a quality flat iron in my hands but was disappointed-this flat iron was clearly USED and defective-only one side of the iron got hot. You should not purchase from this seller.",

When you close it onto the hair, you get that cheap smack sound and it even pulls the hair!! I cannot believe this is a Paul Mitchell product. This one is no better than a $30 straightener. But for $125, I expect Paul Mitchell quality. Super disappointed and would not recommend. Only 1 pro: heats up fast.",

It's just as great as the other one and with the digital display of the temperature you can watch how quickly the temp climbs and it is quite quickly. I don't think I'll ever use another brand ever again. I've always been extremely satisfied with the Paul Mitchell flat irons.",

I like that the display tells you what temperature it is as opposed to other flat irons that just have a light to indicate it's heated. And it heats up v quickly. It's also very handy that the cord has a velcro strip on it to keep it folded. Don't have anything bad to say about this!!",

      "text": "I was super disappointed with this product. I have curly hair and it takes several attempts with this iron to get my hair close to being straight and it still fails at doing it's job. It's doesn't get hot enough and it doesn't flatten well. I had an earlier style of this same product and it was the best. But when I sought out a replacement and chose to go with the same product, it was a huge disappointment. They have changed something about the heating element and it is not as good as their previous products. I suggest saving your money and buying a different flat iron. This one is a joke.",
