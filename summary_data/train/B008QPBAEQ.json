I like that the watch is fairly dainty and doesn't call a ton of attention to itself, but at the same time it is very beautiful. The small stones help dress it up so it is quite versatile and can be dressed up or down. As a mom, it has been perfect so I don't have to constantly carry my phone around the house to keep track of the time, and it goes with nearly my entire wardrobe. I would definitely purchase again!",

Great for everyday use, but would also look good with an evening gown for more formal occasions. Very versatile. Also, the watch band was very easy to adjust. I'm not savvy in tinkering with mechanical / electronic devices, but I was able to adjust the watch band myself with a couple of youtube videos and a random, simple watch repair kit from Amazon.",

I had to go to a jeweler to get it adjusted to my wrist since it was too big for me, but that is easy to do. I love watches that look like bracelets, and this is perfect in the silver color. Also love that it is solar powered so I don't have to keep getting the battery replaced when it dies. It was well worth the price, especially since I got it for such a big discount!",
