HOWEVER, if you do not have a whiteboard, and need to use a projector in your classroom, consider getting a camera with a light. I didn't consider this and found out that I couldn't turn out my classroom light without turning on my lamp so that the item could be seen. Hindsight is 20/20, but this is exactly as described. I wish it had a light, but that is my fault for not researching the item first.",

It's really easy to use and does a lot, but I had trouble sincing the audio with the video. It could just be my computer. Anyway, I'm using a free copy of Cyberlink Ucam and it's working great!

It was a great surprise to see the quality projected by such a small and low cost doc cam. This makes it afforadable for all teachers. It captures work as video and as pictures. Connected to a projector, it reduces the need for transparencies, making it good for the environment as well. Now I just need to find a low cost projector....",

      "text": "I recently lost my precious IPEVO doc cam on a business trip -- and so I ordered two more of these little jewels, just in case I ever lose one again. As a national public speaker, I find that many hotels and conference centers will charge $200-$500 for a one-time rental of a document camera. Meanwhile, my bitty little IPEVO cost me just $70.00 and I bring it with me on the road every week. It's light, has a good image, and the software sets up perfectly in under 10 minutes. Among a world of often over-rated, super complex and costly tech tools, this is a true value.",

I have to put the camera on a few books so it's high enough to view the entire paper, but this isn't too much of a hardship. I use the autofocus to allow the camera to focus one time on the paper, then I turn it off so it doesn't focus on my hand while I'm writing. There's a little bit of a time lag, but overall it does the job I want it to and you can't beat the price.",

This item is a great low cost way to overcome that problem and small enough that the teacher can take it with them when they leave the classroom. It works just the way it is advertised and took almost zero effort to get it up and working.",

With its excellent 2 Megapixel resolution and unmatched versatility, the P2V will quickly become your favorite for video chats, business presentations, family photo sharing, and much more. The key to the P2V's wide range of uses is its unique stand.
