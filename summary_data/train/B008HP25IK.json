I took the nozzle and filter apart to clean because I learned from a previous gun that the more you clean the better it is for the next time. Like any tool: take care of them and they will give you years of service.",

The best thing is how FAST you can cover a house. If it had a 30 inch wand you could paint a single house without a ladder. moving the ladder did slow down the job. Having said all this DON'T RENT OWN you own!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Takes a few minutes to set up and clean, but it's not rocket science. Just a heads up, thin your paint. I had to clean it out twice (still only took a few minutes) because I was using a thick latex paint. After I thinned it, there was no stopping it. If you're doing big projects on a budget, this is definitely a great choice. The paint went on smoothly and evenly. Very impressed and happy!",
