      "text": "We have several of these now in my department that we are using with VMware Workstation VMs. They are pretty snappy as a portable drive to store and run your VM from. There is noticeable difference when firing up VMs from the Transcend SSD vs conventional drives (and we have conventional USB 3 drives from server vendors). We'll see it how holds up in the long run - but thus far I really like it. I do like the original case style better than the new all black one. I have the original design, my coworker the newer style.",
