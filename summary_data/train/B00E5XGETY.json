It is heavy, it is sturdy, the color is cool, I just wish it was the same style as shown in all the photos... If it was as shown in the photos it would be 5 stars... But it's not, so it's not...",

The good thing is it's a solid, heavy piece of metal, and not just thin crap. The item description says it comes with rubber adapters, but they aren't there, just the plastic threaded inserts.",
