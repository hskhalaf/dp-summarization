      "text": "I had a hell of a time installing this because the nuts that come with it are too small. The center of the holes of the nuts sit in the line with the bottom edge of the holes on the terminal. The nuts are too thin, as well, and so, trying to thread on the supplied bolts pushes the nuts out of reach. I basically had to jam a flat head screwdriver under the nut, then jam another flat-head screwdriver behind the nut in order to get the terminal bolts to thread. Poor design. And no, this isn't typical...my other motorcycle batteries don't have this issue.",

I agree with other reviewers on the included screws... about 3mm too short to catch the threads, even though I have a very thin stainless steel battery bracket on my bike, Just take 2 small screwdrivers (realy small, like for electronics screws), one on each side, to hold the nut up. Or jam a small piece of wood or a piece of matchbook in there. We'll see how long it lasts!",
