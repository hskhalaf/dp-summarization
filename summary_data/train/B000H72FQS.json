No liner in boot, lable is different and sewed wrong, logos are slightly different. I have two old pairs I keep for yard work so I compared. These are knock offs. Dr. Martens are always tight to start and tight around the ankle. Once they break in the are very comfortable. I do recommend using water proofing and toe gaurd. Any steel toe boots will wear on the toes and also will rub on your big toe.",

I work as a senior engineer on the mechanical engineering team at a data center, and I have worn many, many types of work boots. Cat and Timberlands to name a few. These, by far, take the cake. Easy to slip on, a firm, but supportive hold, and easy to wear around all day. 10/10 would recommend.",

They are very durable and last him on average 2yrs. He wears them daily. He says they are ugly as sin but wear like a dream. I like that they last a long time and protect his calves and feet from dangerous things.",

They loosened up so bad that I tried putting two extra insoles in them. It didn't help very much and now I can't even wear them. They slip in the heels so I have to drag my feet when I walk and I can't climb the towers. They were great at first. Doc's just have weird sizing so be careful.",
