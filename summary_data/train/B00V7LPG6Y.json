If you want a throw away item for a party or special event this will probably suit your needs; although the light isn't very strong nor does it cover a lot of territory. And of course the darker the room the better. I saw the other reviews saying it wasn't durable but I thought I'd take a chance on it since there would be no children or wild parties anywhere near near it. If you are looking for something to use long term I'd look elsewhere.",

Pros: nice bright light, variety of ways to use it(color modes, dome on or off, etc), seems to be fairly well made, easy to set up, looks amazing! Cons: angle adjustment is a bit rough, no separate off button or back button so you have to cycle through all the options before looping back to the one you want, preset off timer with no way to adjust it.",

That being said I wish there was a way to have more than one timer setting. While these are working great for them initially falling asleep due to being forced to use the one hour timer if they wake up in the middle of the night their rooms are pitch dark. Which they find less then stellar. Would love to be able to keep it on all night or at least have a longer timer option.",

The icing on this cake it the built in speakers that you can hook an Ipod or you're phone to sound pretty darn good.

Turns out the little slit that the main button has to stay aligned on the bases notch is short so if pressed hard it will slide to the side and not engage the color changing part properly. To fix this I put a small piece of double sided tape on the button and now it can not slide out. Works great now.",

There is no way to turn this feature off, so it's ok for falling asleep as long as your kid takes less than 20 minutes (hahaha). Don't buy this one, get the newer model that can stay on continuously. Review edit: customer service was really great! When they saw my review they refunded half the cost and let me keep the light.",

My 8mo loves the more muted lights (with the lid on) and my 5yo prefers the 'lazer show' lights (without lid). I plan to purchase another one! Truly the coolest night light around.

Best of all it shuts off in an hour so it's not wasting electricity while he's asleep. Love that it has the option for battery or can plug into the wall. Know that it really only reflects on the wall or corner where it's placed and a section of the ceiling. The range does not allow it to dance around the whole room but he is OK with that as it's very colorful and lively. Will be buying another for his brother as the one I bought for him wasn't even close in effect to this.",

      "text": "Very cool lighting effects with this lamp. It has the option of real sharp dancing lines with the cloud effect behind, or a covering lens that softens the entire effect. It also acts as a speaker so you can plug your MP3 player or whatever into it, but it is very quiet with my devices. It will take USB to power it or use the 110V converter. My only complaint with this item is it times out after a short while and turns off so if you want to turn it on and forget it, you are out of luck. I had to reset it about 6 times over my last party.",

You can take the top off to display sharper looking lights or you leave the top on to display a soft light. The lights also fill the whole room. My 6 year old uses this as a night light every night. You can also change the light movement setting to be fast or transition slow. Well worth the money.",

Helps settle the kids and give them something to keep them occupied while they fall asleep. The 1 hour timer is perfect. Cons: Was a little hard to position. Kids insisted on using it without the dome cover, so the lights were very strong and it needed to be put above eye-level so it wouldn't shine in their eyes. Would be nice if the power cord was longer.",
