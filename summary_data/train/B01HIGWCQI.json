The park had a heavy duty blower, but it burned up recently, so we puchased this one for our use. It is very light weight, but has enough power to manage the leaves. It's not as strong as the old, heavy unit, but it works for what we want. Taking the nozzle off makes the unit easy to store. With no power cord, it packs very small.",
