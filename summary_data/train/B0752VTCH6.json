I wore it to an outdoor wedding with 2.5 inch heeled ankle height booties. No leg showing but also not hitting the ground at all. I'm wearing it today as well with 1.5 inch sandals and the length is perfect, not touching the ground but hitting just below the ankle. The cut is super flattering. I prefer shape wear underneath for a smooth silhouette as the fabric is thin. It's wrinkle free even after being wadded up in my suitcase. Love this dress and will buy more like it!",

I would've kept it because for the most part the pattern was still decent like in the picture. However, the pattern on the sleeves were way off.

And, btw, don't think I have particularly big and'/or muscular arms. Also, if I ordered a large to get bigger sleeves, I feel like the rest of the dress would be too big.

The length is to the floor in flat sandals, and the arms are not too tight, though I did have to pin the front to prevent overexposure. I do not typically buy clothing online, so I was pleasantly surprised.",
