Believe me when I say this is a very firm mattress, probably more so than most would prefer. Actually, it's pretty much what I was looking for. I figure it's better to have too firm, which can be remedied with a topper, than too plush. Overall, it seems good for the price. I just hope it lasts longer than it's predecessor.",

      "text": "Unfortunately the wrong mattress was delivered. I just moved in and waited one week. When it arrived I was at work and my kids did not know the difference and unboxed it while I was at work. It seemed odd to be when o got home because it looked so different. The box is now outside and in the trash because my kids wanted to surprise me. Either way this one that came in was a spring mattress and was not foam at all !! I really wish it was picked Correctly to begin with and I feel deceived and I am hoping it was an honest mistake !!!!",

I'm a side sleeper; specifically a left side sleeper. My left hip was hurting from what I assumed was from my old mattress. This mattress doesn't give enough support to allow comfortable side sleeping. It's like sleeping on the floor. I will update this review of things improve. 09/13/19: I was glad to learn that I have a total of 97 days to return this. It's still not very comfortable for my position as a slide sleeper.",

I don't know if the 12\" is different and that's where all the positive reviews came from but I wouldn't recommend the 10\"! You'd be better off sleeping on a piece of plywood.",

This mattress made me realize how bad, and way too soft, my old one was. The first night I slept on it, I woke up with no back pain. It is firm yet memory foam comfort. If you\u2019re used to extra pillow top etc this is not the mattress for you! I\u2019m beyond pleased with this purchase especially the price! Highly recommended!",

I've owned Ashley furniture and the value for the dollar is excellent. 2. The description of the contents this mattress is comprised of made sense to me. I've used this mattress for about a month, and can honestly it all I hoped it would be. I arise each morning feeling fully rested and there are no aches I encountered with a traditional mattress.",

It\u2019s a firm mattress but it\u2019s not a rock, when you first lay down you may feel like is to hard but as soon as your weight settles is like the mattress hugs your shape. I\u2019m a 140lb woman and have no back pain or anything like that so I couldn\u2019t say if it\u2019s helpful for any particular condition but for me it was a GREAT purchase at a very fair price.

The other reviewer was spot-on, this is a fantastic mattress. Within about four hours it had inflated to its full size, and the firmness is perfect. Looking forward to less body aches in the morning! Time will tell how it holds up, but it was purchased for maybe 1/5th of the price that the inner spring mattress it replaced cost me about eight years ago.",

You can make a firm mattress softer, but you can't make a soft mattress firmer. Once that soft mattress begins to sag, it's Game Over. I prefer replacing a topper every 2-3 years, versus the entire mattress. If you love a firm mattress like me, this is perfect already. This is a bed you sleep on, not in. If you're a hot sleeper, that's important. Overall this bed is very high quality. There was no smell and it fluffed up in 30 minutes.

For starters all Ashley-Sleep mattresses are designed to be no flip\u2014now isn\u2019t that a relief! |How to care for your mattress: |To help keep your Ashley-Sleep mattress clean a thin mattress protector is recommended so it breathes to allow airflow and heat dissipation. Ashley-Sleep does not recommend you use a quilted mattress pad as it will change the feel of the mattress you selected at the store. It may also trap heat that needs to escape. Don\u2019t use dry cleaning fluid of any type on your mattress. These chemicals could damage some of the comfort and upholstery materials. Vacuuming is the only recommended cleaning method. If you must clean a stain use mild soap with cold water and apply lightly allowing the mattress time to fully air dry. Please remind the kids not to jump on their Ashley-Sleep mattress as doing so can break down the inner construction and materials.",
