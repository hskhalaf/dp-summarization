What I like most about this toy is that he doesn't need another person to play with him but the adults enjoy it too so either way he's having fun. Numbers are sturdy and weighted accordingly so adding them up on the scale and either using the number that is the sum (1 + 2 on left = 3 on right) or just balancing them with the monkeys is very satisfying.",
