My 4th grade daughter is going for her black belt in Kung Fu, and she's also in sparring competitions. We tested these out with her sparring gloves, and they work great. They fit me fine, and they even protect me from her biggest punches (and she's a tough kid!). She thought the logo/design was really cool too, goes with the theme of her other Kung Fu gear, which is Chinese.",
