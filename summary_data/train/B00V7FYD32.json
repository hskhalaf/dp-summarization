The screen burned in the image of top line of my keyboard, the notification bar, and the lower toolbar for Instagram after about a year which is pretty annoying. Also when my phone hits 20% there's no telling how much battery I really have left. It will suddenly jump to 3% at any moment when in dips below 15-20. And if I plug it in below 5% it will almost always cause the phone to shut down.",

My issues with the phone are that the battery life is absolutely atrocious, the device gets super hot to the touch when using (especially if it's charging while using) and the fingerprint reader just would not work consistently. It locked me out of the phone on one occasion. So back it went.",

If this is refurbished quality, pass. Next time just buy one for $20 from the guy on your corner. It probably has a ring tone and not a screech.",

The edge designs feels great in your hand, however, the integration in to the software and functionality is very limited. The edge screen helps create shortcuts to your favorite apps, top contacts and even allows you to set up shortcuts to execute certain tasks. The battery is not as strong as that of the Samsung Galaxy S6 (non-Edge) but I guess that is the trade off for visual design and feel. The functionality of the light up edge screen based off preset contacts is useful however not a true necessity.",
