When reading the comments, many people were disappointed with the box the knives came in which seemed strange. I was more concerned with the quality of the knives than the box. As it turns out, that was what my daughter cared about as well. Actually, she even liked the box because it will give her a dedicated place to store them - but it certainly wasn't the focal point of the item. These knives are comfortable to use and the one-piece design means they will last with no worries of them loosening or coming apart.",
