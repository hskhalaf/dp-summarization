I am now so into making smoothies now, I got this one for an upgrade into the high tech Vitamix realm. It is beyond expectations!. This Vitamix is the culmination of the many years that this company has been making them and evolving them to higher standards. This 750 Pro series is the perfect blender for the smoothie making health person. It is very easy to clean the wide low profile 64 oz. canister that comes with the Vitamix. And for power, this one is tops!",

      "text": "Works pretty well. Had to send it in after only a couple of months as the drive socket made a bad sound after trying to make a smoothie with frozen strawberries. Vitamix sent out a return label and fixed it very quickly for me, but after spending so much money on a blender, I am surprised the blender couldn't handle the frozen berries! I have seen the BlendTec machine chop up a block of wood! Now it seems to be working well, but we will see. I was very impressed with the customer service though and this does have a 7 year warranty.",

Even watched demos on YouTube comparing them with other units it came out on top ever time there are a couple units that were just as good very close. This is the same as the VitaMix 780 just not touchscreen why pay so much more for the same machine not hard to use the dial vs a touchscreen. You don't need sharp blades to do the work like those made in China no turtle power needed with sharp blades and plastic parts.",
