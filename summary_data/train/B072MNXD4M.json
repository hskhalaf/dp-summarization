I will say that this style is more narrow than the flip flop version, tide, so if you are wider side will def. need to order accordingly.

I was really surprised at the loose strap given that my feet swell regularly, so normally straps tend to be tight rather than loose. I have ridiculously high arches and a tendency for Achilles tendinitis, so I was really hoping they would work well. I will be returning these.",

It has definitely helped with the pain at the end of the day. So I would highly recommend these shoes if you have a problem like this to help with walking and have less swelling and pain.",
