Opened a second, same thing happened. After the third attempt, I grabbed a different roll of bags, thinking it was just a flaw in the roll... after splitting five bags I gave up trying any further. I was too annoyed with the situation to go through the work to return the purchase and angry that so much plastic was now wasted. Unless there\u2019s some vital step to unfurling a garbage bag that I was never taught, I do not recommend these bags at all.",

Plus I love that the blue bags distinguish diaper waste from regular waste in my house. I bought them for my Ubbi stainless diaper pale. Bags are not required by the pales, but I like the convenience when it's time to change out. These bags are a perfect fit for the pale --and by 'perfect' I mean they still have plenty of room at the top to tie it off.",

However even without a fresh flower scent I give these 5 stars!!",

They fit in there great and we have never had an issue with them ripping when we remove the bags and our Ubbi is usually full when we empty it. After you tie the bag it does contain the smell, but if we have a full bag in our Ubbi and you open it, the smell does have the power to knock you off your feet. So don\u2019t expect these bags to keep the diapers from smelling in the pail. They are great but they are not magic.",

Still reeks whenever you open the pail to put a new diaper in and sometimes the smell lingers which is exactly what you are trying to avoid I thought. That said-they are durable trash bags and they do last a long time so I ordered another set because I\u2019ve just accepted that the smell is unavoidable.",
