Switched to this the last night of scout camp as we had to be up early to take tents down. This made the morning go so much faster, unsnap a couple clips, stuff the thing away and we were ready and helped the rest of the troop members load the trailer. Definitely earned a permanent spot in my pack! The net worked perfect as promised, no bug bites, and paired with a hammock fly we were nice and dry from the light rain that moved through.",
