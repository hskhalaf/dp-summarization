As stated above, I was on my knees for several hours, and the thick padding that formed to my knees was ideal. I had no pain at all. (By the way, I'm 57 years old and have arthritis.) I also used it for sitting several times. This kneeling pad was extremely comfortable, easy to use, and inexpensive. Highly recommend!",
