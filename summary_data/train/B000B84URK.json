My feet are wider than a average person and Keens have been the only shoe that has been truly comfortable. These shoes have great for arch support as well. I've owned this pair for 3 months with every day usage and part of the treads are separating from the bottom of the shoe. Something that really shouldn't be happening on a $100 shoe. I'm probably just going to super glue it back on. Maybe I got a lemon?",

I used them to go to the office and the occasional trail walk but nothing serious. My previous pair is worn but still going strong as a work shoe. No idea what happened to this company, but I'm not going to risk buying their products again.",

It's not the insole, nor the squeak of rubber on the floor - it appears that the glue holding the sole together has begun to fail and separate, and the noise comes from the outer layer of the sole rubbing against the next layer when the shoe flexes. Searching the web for 'keen squeak' turns up tons of complaints, so this isn't an isolated incident. I believe the quality if Keen's workmanship and/or materials has decreased lately - this will likely be my last purchase from them.",

Shocked to discover that the toe box felt a lot more snug than my old pair. Checked the size, yep, 11 medium. Model Targhee II, check. Thought maybe they needed to be broken in. Took a short walk. A half mile out I realized I was experiencing some serious pain in both big toes. Turned around and gingerly walked back home. The toe box was so tight that it jammed my (well trimmed) toe nails into the cuticle, causing them to bleed. You've lost your edge, Keen, and a customer. Returned for refund.",

It's likely I could have tightened down the laces extra (after breaking the shoe in) and worn heavier socks, but overall it didn't feel like it was working. I ended up returning these shoes, and going with the slightly cheaper, narrower Targhee Exp hiking shoe instead. That gives up leather for synthetic, but both the fit and appearance are better.",

My toes are always weird due to neuropathy so I did not think much of pain in my toes until one day I was cleaning them out when I noticed a flap of folded material inside the toebox at the front of the shoe. Additionally there were some minor imperfections with the stitching (stitches not lining up) which I thought odd. Furthermore there was no care instructions or marketing materials inside the box. So my thought was that these were previously returned and resold to me. Or possibly factory seconds. I tried to go directly to Keen for a solution and have heard nothing back.",

I got over the granny look. If you aren't fussy about color, Amazon has a different price for each color. I selected the pair with the lowest price, and it was $50 cheaper than the pair in the store.

I attempted to put prescribed orthotics in and even loosened the laces but it still placed more pressure on the tops of my feet than I'm used to. I've owned and have enjoyed Keen's for years but this model just isn't right for me. Unfortunately once you wear them in your natural habitat, they become nonreturnable.",
