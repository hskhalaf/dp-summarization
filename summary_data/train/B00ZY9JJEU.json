I recommend setting the camera to P Mode, ISO 1600, SNAP focus at 2.5m for documentary style shooting. The camera is very customizable as well. You can't go wrong with this pocketable powerhouse. (Auto focus is slow and lacking, however the SNAP focus option more than makes up for this)",

I also looked at the X70, which looks old-school as well but again, the lens popping out made it seem a bit bulky as well (plus the $100 price difference). I'm now just a GR fan.",

It does what it's supposed to and I'm pretty happy with that. It's not a replacement for a larger camera, but when I'm traveling for work (and I work in the photo/advertising world) I'm not going to lug around something with interchangeable lenses in a separate bag or on my shoulder all day long.

I don't care for the video, if that's what you want look elsewhere. This is a photography machine. Overall a very nice camera that allows you to be able to shoot anywhere anytime because it fits right into any jacket pocket, some pants.",
