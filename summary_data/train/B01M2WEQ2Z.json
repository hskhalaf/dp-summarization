Before I ordered these socks, I was a bit worried about the uncomfortable feeling of the individual open toe spaces, but actually they are very comfortable and feel like grab your toes to get more balance and strength during your posing. I tried a few different versions of yoga socks before and they are easily lost their fit or shrink after washing and drying but these socks stay their fit and flexibility after washing. The design is also cool and I like the exotic pattern which functions great as well. Highly recommend these socks.",

Anyways, I like everything about them and I would totally recommend them to anyone for any kind of workout. The cute design is a plus, too.",
