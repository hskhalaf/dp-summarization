I use it with ice cream straight out of the freezer and as long as you have the strength to push it in, the scoop seems ready and able to get the job done. I also like the deep dome shape. The ice cream presents nicely to company, and it doubles as an egg scoop when I have to drop them into boiling water without cracking them.",
