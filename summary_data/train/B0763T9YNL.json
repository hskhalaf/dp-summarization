Perfect combination of coils and gel, and it still fits in a small package. This is the minimum width (12 inch) that I would buy, I've had the 8\" width and it's not as comfortable. Really an excellent mattress at a terrific price! It feels very soft and plush when you first lay on it, but then you realize that there is a nice firmness supporting you below the top layer. I like this as much as our much more expensive memory foam mattress that we bought in a sleep store.",

There was no major distress on the box, w/mattress secured well inside the box. Feels comfortable...not too soft and not too firm. I didn't notice much of a smell initially after \"self-inflation\", however my son said it had a scent of markers. At any rate, it dissipated quickly...24 hrs. I rated it 4/5 due to my expectations of a taller mattress. Overall, I am quite pleased w/this purchase.",

      "text": "I had ordered two mattresses in the past online at one of those big mattress companies and told myself I'd never order a mattress again without sitting/lying on it. Well, I did it again and this king mattress was inexpensive so my husband said before we received it \"you get what you pay for so it will probably be awful\". Well, this is the most comfortable mattress we've had. I like a softer mattress and he likes one that is more firm. We are both very happy and comfortable and getting good nights sleep! I also have pain in my hip and wake up in the middle of the night with excruciating pain. Not anymore! This mattress is wonderful!!!",

On the edge of the bed it's even worse... the mattress basically depresses to the very bottom like a panini or something. And it's not like my partner and I are particularly large as well. Overall, I wish I had gone with something else. Never really had a problem with a mattress offering so little support, and I'm not sure if it's a fluke or by design.",

I bought this one specifically because of the individually encased springs hybrid with the memory foam. Should be best of both worlds - comfort and support. However, the edges of this mattress lack integrity. If you\u2019re a single sleeper, you\u2019ll be fine. However, with two adults (one who prefers a pillow cocoon) plus the random nights of a kid crawling in at 3am, you need those edges! These edges roll off. You\u2019ll find yourself moving towards the middle to avoid the edge slope. Annoying. I imagine it\u2019s a massive hassle to send back and then I have to find a new one if I do! Frustrating.",

The stairs are kind of tight, so getting a stiff normal mattress down them to the bedroom in our basement is a challenge. This was much easier. Bought it for a family member who recently moved in with us. He's in his 40's and has some pain and back issues. Once it had aired back out for 48 hours, it is the most comfortable mattress he has slept on in years!",
