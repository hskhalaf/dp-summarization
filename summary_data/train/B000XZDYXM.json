When an Amazon bag ran out, we bought the same food at our local store, and the problem stopped entirely (that was over six months ago). So we keep on buying it locally. Maybe it\u2019s not being stored properly?",

He loves Blue Buffalo, and since he gets bored with the same food all the time he really likes the fact that we can keep three flavors in rotation. The vet recommended some prescription Iams at $80 a bag. Buddy hated the stuff, we hated the stuff. Then someone recommended Blue Buffalo and everybody's happy. Except the vet who's not selling $2.50 a pound dog food any more.",

I am not one to believe what I read online, but it was the exact same food and the condition looks exactly like what my dog has. As soon as I read that I stopped feeding him the stuff and switched him back to TOTW. His coat has improved almost overnight. This is awful! This food is making dogs sick!",
