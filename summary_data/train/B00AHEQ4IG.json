I am sure there are better gloves you can buy but I don't see the need of spending $50 on a pair of gloves when these work so well and the cost is at a great price for this level of quality.",

Initial reaction: it's a very snug fit, but the fingertips are in the right location. I'm afraid if I went large they would fit better, but I'd have that extra slack in the fingertips which would not be ideal. There is also no padding on the top, otherwise they seem nice. I'll be putting them to use at Yosemite in a couple of months and maybe some indoor climbing before then. Will update the review after those experiences.",

I use mine daily to ascend ziplines and things of that nature, and they've held up pretty well after a few months of use- just a few small holes in the palms. They're also about half the price of the Petzl gloves, so you get what you pay for with these, I think. I still keep them as a back-up to my Petzl Cordex, and lend them out for short-term use.",
