Installation is just locking it onto a wall bracket you install - meaning you can take it off the wall easily if you move/travel. Downside was that wifi function died after 2 1/2 months. Called support and they were quite helpful & immediately sent me a replacement. The good news is that the unit was able to charge my car after wifi died, just not on a pre-defined schedule.",

The feature which attracted me to the Juice Box specifically is the app integration, which allows you to track usage etc. This is much as others have reported where it's a bit tricky to ensure the box picks up the house WiFi network, but as long as it does then everything is solid and reliable. So the trick here is a good WiFi repeater near the juice box. All in all, very happy with the unit.",

Connecting it to our home network was simple as well. I recommend installing a 100amp electrical meter because as electric cars offer the ability to charge over 32 amps, all it will take is to install a different JuiceBox, not the entire electrical meter and wiring.",

Longer term, this company understands smart grid marketing, they seem to have very high quality staff who demonstrate why Silicon Valley companies understand technology. As one example, the Juice Box security enrollment process incorporates an extra step that allows the home user to install a strong network password with a triple confirm process using the plug and unplug process to confirm that you alone are authenticating the Chargers network enrollment. Great idea!",

Only thing I would change about it so far is the cheap-ish plastic bracket that holds the charge cord. A metal bracket with a more substantial holder for the cord would have been nice, especially given the generous cord length.",

Install was quick and easy from our electrician and everything has been functioning properly. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive(compared to the other 40a units), well functioning unit. Not the prettiest looking one compared to some of the others with their sleek designs but as you can see from the garage, it doesn't have to be pretty to work!",
