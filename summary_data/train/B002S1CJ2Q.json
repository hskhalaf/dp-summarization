      "text": "Loved this turntable for about 2 months, dramatic improvement in sound quality and tracking (no more skipping) over the LP-60 I had tolerated for years. But after 3 months a nonstop motor pulsation noise showed up and has gotten progressively louder ever since. Tried replacing the stock platter with several different cork and thick rubber sound-dampening mats, but the motor noise persists. I can't listen to anything with quiet passages or the noise is infuriating. Unfortunately I'm outside Amazon's return window so I'm stuck with this piece of garbage.",

I'm glad I went this route, If I get serious enough about vinyl, I can \"upgrade\" this tt with a better cartridge and pre-amp. Out of the box, it already sounds great. The build quality is excellent and nothing really feels cheap or poorly executed with this turntable. If you are on a budget, look no further than this one.",

Thus I must conclude that the problem with my turntable is not unique. Such noise, IMO, renders the AT-LP120 unsuitable for anything resembling quality listening experience. IMO the AT-LP120 is only suitable for use a a DJ device where any noise produced by the turntable would be irrelevant.",

Additionally, they have a placement for the felt/round cleaning attachment, but I am yet to find it with the merchant. I wish that was included. Just nit-picky two things, otherwise, this is perfect!

When the tone arm is in resting position the lever won't lift it up. It only keeps the tone arm up when over the platter. Threw me off a bit at first until I realized that. Also you should download the Audacity software directly from the site. The disc has an old version. I also recommend you change the software to listen to the disc as it records (it is in the help section) Works great for digitizing albums. Better than anything I have used in the past.",

Unfortunately, the motor rumble is pronounced between tracks and during quiet moments of the recording. This has been stated and repeated many times through previous reviews. I can only echo those evaluations. The pervasive hum detracts from what would otherwise be a five-star player. Eventually, I grew weary of the rumble and purchased an Audio Technica AT-LP1240-USB XP. It is twice the price but is a dead quiet turntable.",

The setup is easily adjustable, and the cartridge can be swapped out if you desire so. Great set and quality.",

If you are just starting to spin with vinyl this is a great choice, easy on the wallet and a standard middle of the road piece of kit.",

    "description": "Color:SILVERAudio-Technica's AT-LP120-USB direct-drive, high-torque professional turntable is perfect for DJs and other music enthusiasts, especially in an era that many would call \"postvinyl,\" when it's no longer the norm for audio/video receivers or even integrated amplifiers to offer a dedicated phono input. Connect the Audio Technica ATLP120 to your computer to digitize your old LPs (laptop not included). It also includes a selectable internal stereo phono preamplifier and a USB output that connects directly to your computer-perfect for digitizing your old LPs to high-quality MP3 or FLAC files for playback from your computer. USB cable and adapter cables are included, along with Mac- and PC-compatible Audacity software to digitize your LPs. The AT-LP120's S-shaped tone arm assembly comes with an adjustable counterweight, an antiskate adjustment, a tone-arm height adjustment and lock, a tone-arm lift with hydraulic action and lift lever, and a tone-arm rest with a locking mechanism to keep the arm stable during transport. The turntable uses a DC servo motor to maintain accurate rotational speed at either 33-1/3 45, or 78 rpm, governed by a selectable, high-accuracy quartz-controlled pitch lock-all of which gives new life to 7- and 12-inch singles you may not have played for years. Unleash your inner DJ with the 'table's pitch-adjustment feature, with variations ranging from either +/-10 percent or +/-20 percent. A pop-up stylus target light and stroboscopic platter speed indicator offer visual assistance in queuing and playing your favorite tunes. Forward and reverse play options unlock countless creative doors. The turntable comes with a cast-aluminum record platter, a slip mat, and a professional cartridge and headshell (model AT95E) that plugs directly into the tone arm. Adjustable, antivibrational feet keep the platter level, regardless of your environs. A start/stop button with remote start/stop input lets you integrate the player with your more sophisticated DJ tools. The player also includes a 45 rpm adapter with storage receptacle for the adapter and for a surplus or replacement headshell (sold separately). If the turntable is connected to a sound card, powered speakers or AUX -type inputs, set the selector to LINE, which will activate the turntable\u2019s internal pre-amp \n\n\n\nThe half-inch standard mount AT95E phonograph cartridge offers outstanding clarity and detail. Reviewers have rated this affordable, high-performance cartridge as a best buy value. Manufactured to Audio-Technica's renowned quality standards, each cartridge is meticulously assembled with remarkably tight tolerances. The elliptical diamond stylus is designed to track record grooves with high accuracy for outstanding audio reproduction.
