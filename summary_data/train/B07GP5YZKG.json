The design of the bellows allows precision application of just the desired airflow exactly where you want it. I highly recommended the bellows method!",

On my unit, the vinyl became very soft from the heat and pulled away from the rivets that fasten it to the wooden paddles. This after only three uses. Returned, but did not exchange, as a vinyl fireplace bellows is just a bad idea for anything but a display piece. It will fail if exposed to heat.
