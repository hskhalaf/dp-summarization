Most of the totes I first looked at, the zippers don't go the full length of the bag...this one DOES!!! Which was preferred to ensure my valuables (keys, wallet, phone) were not at risk, since they are so visible. Also purchased a vinyl decal to personalize the tote & it worked great!",

There's an inside pocket and an outside pocket. The inside pocket is only attached at the top of the pocket, so it can drag down that side of the top of the bag.",

(I had another HUGE bag that we carried towels, toys, and sunscreen it, but it is mesh - so that's why I needed a water-proof & sand-proof bag.)",
