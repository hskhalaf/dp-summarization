It has been blown up for a few days now and hasn't appeared to lose air at all which is also nice. It will be great for visitors in the upcoming weeks, but until then it will be great for entertaining children and my husband if he annoys me ;).",

I was nervous because I never used and air mattress, but my guests said they loved it! The bed stayed inflated and blew up super fast. We blew it up the night before so it could stretch out and then topped it off with some extra air the next day. It kept its form and held the air well. I may grab another for our beach house, these things come in handy! The company made sure we were all set, great product and great customer service!",

She even loaded ALL of her considerable luggage on top of it when she arrived and it didn't matter at all. She says this air mattress was even more comfortable than most traditional mattresses and wanted to buy one herself. This was definitely a fantastic buy!",

Even though the 2nd picture is accurate, pictures 1, 4, 6, and the video show a bed that appears to be much higher than 13 inches. It was not \"false\" advertising, but very misleading to say the least. If you're going to describe an airbed as \"double-high\", it should be higher than your knees. Will not buy again.",
