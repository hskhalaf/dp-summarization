Sure, it's functional but I wouldn't want that odor to stick to myself nor my bag when I bring it around.",

Also the cords are a pretty tight fit in there. But it really does do everything it needs to and is convenient for being able to take everything at once. Looks pretty good too.",

It\u2019s very tough, and I feel like it could be smacked a great amount before it\u2019s even slightly damaged. Overall, very satisfied with the product. Oh! And the zippers have a very red and white lining that was a wonderful surprise",
