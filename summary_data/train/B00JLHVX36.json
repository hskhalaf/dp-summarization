The magnets stick to anything metal (but not stainless steel), as does the vehicle. Child puts a letter on the vehicle and it sings, naming the letter and it's sound: \"The 'b' says buh, the 'b' says buh. Every letter makes a sound. The 'b' says buh!\" For something that a parent will hear over and over, it's kind of cute, not really annoying. To REALLY get the most out of this, it should be accompanied with the DVD (or whatever medium) of Leap Frog's \"The Letter Factory.\"",

I can't stress enough how glad we are that we bought it! When you press the letter into that slot on the bus, it says the letter, and the sound, and sings a simple little song about the letter and the sound. Press it again and it gives you a little sentence with the letter. Great educational tool that makes learning fun!! My kids love this! It has held up great with no issues! Well worth the buy!",

Very disappointing. But it is fun when we are learning them together, but I don't let him play with it by himself, as I dont want him to learn the mumbled letters.",

My only irritation is that this is apparently the European version that calls the letter \"Z\" \"ZED\" instead of \"Zee\". I popped the back off to see if this was a regional setting I could change and you cannot. You will just have to YELL over the \"ZED\" parts. Haha!",

The \"ABC\" song which my daughter already knows and \"Wheels on the Bus\" which we sing better together without the toy. Wish I hadn't wasted $15 on this.",
