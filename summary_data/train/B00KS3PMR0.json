If it weren't for this I would give the table a good review. It is well packed and as sturdy as this type table could be.",

I am happy to say that this product was delivered timely, was in perfect condition once unpacked, took less than 10 minutes to put together and the USB ports (and included cables) work as designed. I now have my home/work iPhones, iPad, and Mac Air all plugged in to the table recharging with no problem. It frees up multiple electric plugs and acts as a handy secondary bedside table. I would most definitely buy from this company again.",

We had to buy new screws and drill new holes to stabilize the front of the drawer. The drawer was also pre-assembled crooked on the table, of which we were not able to correct. Besides the drawer issues, the rest of the assembly was fairly easy. The top of the table also has a dent/scratches on it. While these were minor, I expected to receive a table that looked brand new. I do not recommend this table.",

The paperwork inside the packaging says that two of the ports are higher voltage to allow for fast charging devices, however none of the four ports will fast charge my Samsung Note 5, with either a fast wireless charger or USB charging. It still looks good, and it's definitely a table, so it's no big deal, because I didn't buy it for the USB ports.",

I can't go out to a furniture store and needed something of quality; quickly.
