I also bought a 7\u20196\u201d Cruve a yr ago and the padding is thicker, but this is the only 7\u2019 mini log bag that I could find So oh well.",

However, the seller immediately contacted me and resolved with this issue with sincere apology. Having said that, if you are a regular surfer and looking for a surfboard bag to protect your surfboard but do not want to spend crazy amount of money for it, this is it. You cannot find any better deal than this one. Price is perfect. Efficiency is even better. Zippers have no issues and the fin zip works perfectly fine. I would definitely recommend this product.",
