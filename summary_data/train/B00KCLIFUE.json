I liked it so well when it was time to upgrade one of the other computers in the house I bought the Asus A88XM-E. Both installs went beautifully, both booted up the first time I turned them on. I guess there are several features of each motherboard that would allow me to overclock the computers but I never mess with trying to eek out minor performance gains. I enjoy the stability of the recent builds and not having to mess with them to keep them running in tip top shape.",

After a lot of research I discovered that the Kaveri line up has really hit and miss support on Mobos. Always check with the manufacture's website for best results. I neglected to do this on my first Mobo purchase and wound up with a serious idle temp problem (was running 60-70 C). Picked this board up as the replacement and idle temps are now between 34-40 C with an aftermarket CPU cooler.",

Sent everything in a week after receiving it and was notified they didn't get the proof. Called Asus and faxed copies including a copy of certificate of mailing from post office on June 23. Called again June 25 and told to check back the end of the month. Their website still claims proof hasn't been sent. Will keep you posted. Update: I called ASUS again about the rebate and they have approved it; however the tracking number was changed. Changing my rating to 5 while I wait for the rebate. As for the motherboard I couldn't be happier.",
