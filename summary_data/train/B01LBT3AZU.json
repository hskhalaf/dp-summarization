Started the project earlier today which was just drilling some screws into a flange then into some wood. got 6/8 screws in and then the drill will no longer spin for more then 2 seconds at a time and the output is very weak. Thought maybe it was the battery, charged the battery to full and this is still happening. I wasted a lot of money on this drill and now I can't use it. I would be willing to give it another shot if I could do an exchange.",

It was money well spent. My hands and wrists hurt much less. Plus, the screws sink right in. It's amazing. I and sticking with DeWalt so I can save on battery expenses. They are not cheap.

Bought some socket adapters and use it while working on the car. Used to to take some rusty screws out of the threshold in the doorway and it actually broke the phillips bit. Probably a cheap bit, but who knows. There are 3 LED lights at the base of the chuck and they cast a perfect 3 way shadow of the bit right over the screw your going for, minor annoyance, but still better than holding the flashlight in your teeth and reefing on the driver.",

This won't necessarily prevent it but it will make it much easier to drive a screw in and 9 times out of 10 it does it without stripping the screw head. The compact size is also nice, giving me more clearance than my drills for tight spots but that wasn't my reason for the purchase. I'm very happy with it and if Dewalt continues to make good quality products I'll continue to use them.",

One thing that bothers me about DeWalt tools and some others is that they have a picture of an American flag on front of the box leading us to believe that this is an American made product, but in the fine print it says made with globally sourced parts, i.e. parts could come from anywhere, including China. Other tool manufacturers are doing the same thing. I don't think everything from China is necessarily poor quality, but I think the American flag on the DeWalt package is misleading.",

It is lightweight, compact. has so much power that it can do most home improvement projects, and the LED light is fantastic addition that should be standard on every tool.

Powerful, easy to grip, and easy to change out bits. Only negative though is that one battery isn't enough for bigger projects so I find myself having to constantly charge it. A second battery would address that though.",
