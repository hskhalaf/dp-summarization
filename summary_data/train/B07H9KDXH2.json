The reason for only three stars is that after 2 months of use (riding 2-3 times per week for 1-2 hours), the front of the shoes' shape has narrowed (or caved in). Small and sharp creases have formed inside which pinch the toes. Having bought these as a snug fit, this pinching now requires two socks to protectively cushion the toes. I've contacted fizik in hopes that this pair's defect is singular and could possibly be replaced.",

Also the Velcro strap near the toe does nothing for security. The soles of my feet get sore after about 25 miles but perhaps an insole would solve that problem. Overall glad I purchased.

    "description": "Tempo Overcurve R5 is a quick-fit road cycling shoe designed to suit every rider and every ride. With a timeless look and verstaile performance the classic road shoe has been redefined with a distinct fi'zi:k identity and a smart form-fitting construction.\nThe shoe features a staggered collar that wraps around the ankle tracking the natural misalignment of the ankle's two boney protusions; the lateral and medial malleoli. The result is an asymetric shape, with the throat of the shoe curving over the foot from the outside to the inner side.\nThe closure is fast and easily micro adjustable using a BOA IP1 dial and velcro strap to fine tune the fit in the forefoot area.\nSpecifications\nOutsole - R5 carbon reinforced nylonBOA IP1-B dialApproximate weight - 253g (size 42 1/2 pair)Sizes - 36-48",
