Well packaged. The plastic mount at the transom, seems weak, so I bought the aftermarket metal one. Mounts sturdier and its stronger, no chance of it breaking off which is the impression I got from the original mount made by Garmin. Beautiful screen cover with the GARMIN logo. Connection wire after fuse should be longer.",
