Well after just several uses I noticed some small bubbles coming from the test tube when I inserted it in some 110deg wort. Upon inspection I noticed a very small crack in the bulb of the unit. Now I know that these are fragile and have always been careful when using it. So I contacted Brewing America, I explained to them my problem and they shipped one to me right away. Can't beat that with a stick. Would definitely buy from them again.",

Only thing is that the hydrometer leans slightly to one side 3 out of 5 times, even after giving it a spin.

I was really pleased that it was calibrated at the factory and was spot on accurate. It also has larger markings which is easier to read and uses less liquid than other brands to take a sample reading. The price is very fair for this hydrometer and what you receive in the kit.
