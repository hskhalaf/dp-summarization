It is a natural weave so expect it to have a few small holes in bottoms or sides. Only downside is that the color on the pictures looks like a brown or a natural banana leaf, it is not, it is a tan, very bright color similar to bamboo. (I need brown so I will return) Overall I think it's a good buy!",

It's big enough to discard old magazines, mail and other papers in it, for example, and other things of that sort (covering plastic from dry cleaning and so on). and still have room for more. I use it in my bedroom with the matching magazine rack and they look great together. I am delighted with it and glad I purchased it.",
