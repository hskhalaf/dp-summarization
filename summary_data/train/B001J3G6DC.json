I ordered this table for my law office conference room after water damaged my previous table. I couldn't be more pleased with the quality and look of this table. I shopped for other tables, but they were just too expensive. This table looks looks like I paid five times the price. It is that pretty. I have received many compliments on it, even though I have had it only two weeks! It is also easy enough to assemble. My daughter put it together for me. Don't hesitate to purchase it. You will be happy you did!",
