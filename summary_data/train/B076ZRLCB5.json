It's a lot more \"feminine\" looking in person, as the color is more of brassy/copper and is lighter than in the pictures. Also the outline of the cutouts and the buttons are a very noticeable and bright shiny gold, which you can't tell at all in the pictures. Luckily I love the way it looks in person more than on here, but I had to knock off a star just so others can beware if they are looking for the masculine dark brown leather in the pictures.",

Even though my pockets are extraordinarily small; in a pinch I can slide it at least halfway into my pocket if I need my hands for something. No chance of that with the other case!!!

My only very minor complaint is that the opening on the back of the case isn\u2019t centered over the Apple logo on my phone. I\u2019m sure that has to do with the case being designed for the 7+ and my phone being the 8+. It is a great case and even looks nicer than the $50 one my husband purchased from the Apple store!
