If you are a cat owner, you know that it doesn't matter the litter, it will get tracked to some degree, but that comes with the territory. My only complaint is that it does create dust when I clean the litterbox. I keep the littlerbox in my craft room, and anything very close to the box needs to be dusted often. Still, this is my preferred litter for my cats. I like it much, much better than clay....",

I don't think that World's Best is perfect but I am glad to be going back to it after my experience with sWheat.",
