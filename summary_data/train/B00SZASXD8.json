It was only $20 more than the manual knobs. I push the button, it says \"come back in 29 minutes\" and 29 minutes later it's done.

It is not flashy or cool looking, but its built like a tank and fast. The downside is its drum is smaller than we would prefer. However, we chose reliability over cosmetics, and the price point was acceptable. Bottom line we are happy and this machine washes our clothes exceptionally well.",

The three temperature settings make sure your clothes suffer no damage when the proper temperature is selected. There are bleach and fabric softener dispensers which distributes those items itself when it gets to that point of the cycle.
