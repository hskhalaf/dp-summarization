Some users might have digestive issues if it is not dissolved. Any easy way to resolve this is to put about 4 oz of hot water in your cup or blender bottle and then add the creatine. Stir for a couple minutes and it should be completely or sufficiently dissolved. Add some cold water (I add Spring Water with a couple ice cubes). I then add my Whey Protein Powder and shake my blender bottle. Adding the hot water may be a slight inconvience but is worth it. Think of it as \"pre-digestion\".",

I\u2019ve been taking this brand for years and have noticed changes from the start. Helps increase strength, water retention makes you gain size, win win. BEST WAY TO CONSUME- Just take a scoop directly in your mouth and drink it with a few sips of Gatorade.

Took some time off around the holidays to nurse an injury, and have been back at it during quarantine, but with consistent post-workout creatine daily. I\u2019ve made more strength progress in two months with just body weight and 15 pound dumbbells (shoutout to Ryan Humiston\u2019s youtube channel and his \u201clight weight\u201d workouts) than I made in over a year and a half in the gym. I have a much better understanding of muscle building now than I did two years ago, but the difference with this supplement is easily noticeable.",
