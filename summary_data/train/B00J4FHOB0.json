When it comes to a doorbell, I cannot accept that. I went out to test it, and the ringer button itself needs to be pressed exactly right. It's cheap plastic as usual so it looks like it just became frail with a few dozen or so pushes over the months (a lot of deliveries because of moving). And because of this, it will obviously only become worse and less reliable. To me, this is not acceptable. A doorbell needs to work 100% of the time. You have been warned.",

Since mine had to be installed with full exposure to the elements, I added one thing: before reinstalling the cover I placed a sheet of plastic wrap over the circuit board and battery, then snapped the cover on and trimmed the excess plastic wrap. I'm hoping this will make it much more water-resistant. I deducted one star for the contradictory information .",

Each one permanently consumes a plug and are large enough that trying to plug in something else that is oversized into the same outlet may be troublesome.",

My grandparents can finally hear us when we ring the door bell! - Various ring tones make it fun as well Cons: - We haven't had many!
