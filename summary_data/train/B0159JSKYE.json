We lay a beach towel over the top and clothespin it on to block the sun. It works, but we shouldnt have to do that.

      "text": "I purchased this product for the upcoming spring and summer season as I am fair skinned with two fair skinned boys. I did open it inside my home and was amazed at how easy it was to put up and take down. Also the tent is more than adequate for me and the two kids. I haven't had a chance yet to set it up outside but look forward to using it both at the beach and the sports field. I will post another review after the summer and finding out how it holds up.",

It allows plenty of room inside allowing me to enjoy the outdoors while protecting me from the harmful UV rays of the sun. Relatively lightweight and sets up and packs quickly. Very satisfied with this purchase as recommended by my doctor!!!",

You can roll the window shades down and up for a breeze or extra sun protection. You literally pull chords and it pops into place. Then you push on two points and it folds down. So wonderful!",

It started to storm on the beach and we were able to fit 4 adults inside the tent but we were cramped up...in my opinion it fits 2 adults (comfortably) with bags, cooler, chairs, etc. I am also a softball mom so I plan on using this at tournaments.

My wife timed the setup at the beach and it was literally 4.5 minutes. So easy to setup and breakdown. Meanwhile, I see a couple struggling with their tent that requires pole assembly; it takes them a good 10-15 minutes to setup while their kids are running wild! Only thing I suggest is that you may need an extra beach umbrella if you want more shade in the front to block the varying angles of the sun. You also want a sheet/towel to extend beyond the initial floor mat included.",

Thoughtful features like window shades and mesh gear hammock! I'd give a star for each thing mentioned = 8 stars! Add an extra 2 stars for fantastic customer service as recently encountered during a phone call to the company about an issue we had with a tent pole. They responded quickly and resolved our problem! Few products meet and exceed functional expectations like the Pacific Breeze Deluxe XL Tent does and the customer service is top notch!",
