I will advise that the clamp will only hold up to 2 /12- 3 inches max and it will not stand upright on its own. I felt that reading most of the reviews and seeing some of the photos, that it could stand upright without being clamped but it cannot. Other than that, it\u2019s worked wonderfully and it\u2019s drastically helped my lighting and increased my sales. Highly recommend this ring light!",
