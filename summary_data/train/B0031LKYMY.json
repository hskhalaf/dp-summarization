Armrest aren't to high to be in the way, and I love that the chair swivels making it easy to turn and see what my fur babies are up to. Only con, it's a bit heavy and not so easy to move on carpet. Otherwise, a great buy! You'll find yourself feeling more immersed in your game with the speakers so close to your head and the vibrating function. A gamers must have!",

We took it off the base and he uses it on the ground so he can rock back and forth. I've removed the base and put it back on a few times, so it's kind of versatile, the chair is heavy, but easy to put together. The vibration is pretty intense, wish the volume was a little louder, though. The wireless set up was a little confusing, but after finding other cords in my house to connect it to different systems and TV's we got it working.",

The subwoofer is awesome and provides very decent bass. The vibrations are also cool, feels like a massage and very fun in gaming. I love that you can alter the bass, vibration, and volume with knobs. The leather on the back wasnt fully stretched out but again, that's the least of my worries. Overall, absolutley worth 200$.",

I wish it wasn't so low. and I wish the arm rests were a little more sturdy. nothing a little tightening cant fix.",

Essentially it allows for a comfortable seat, low level sound/vibration but you still have to wear a headset while sitting in chair to communicate with other gamers. There is no point in having sound through speakers if you have to wear a headset while seated in chair. Better off just purchasing a comfortable chair to sit in. Last but not least, the faux leather chair covering ripped in less than. 1 month after delivery of item. Very disappointed with this purchase.",

Very easy set up, 1 or 2 holes for the arm rests weren't quite inline with each other. I went with this one because of the stand. Materials don't feel cheap. Think if I had looked harder, maybe could have gotten a better price. All that being said, the kid loves it, and hasn't destroyed it yet.",

      "text": "This is by far the best gift my fiance got this year for Christmas. It has great sounds quality and you can control settings right from the chair. It is very simple to hook up to the PS4 and Tv. Great for gaming, movies and TV. The chair is very sturdy. Super is easy to build and adjust. The lower back support is the only comfort missing, but adding a small pillow for your lower back makes it very comfortable.",

I contacted the Seller/Amazon and they were more than willing to correct the issue...However, I specifically requested ONLY a replacement power supply. I have a very strong suspicion that I will receive an entire new chair and power supply! Other than this minor issue...My son loves this chair!",

I believe the one we received must be defective because we had not seen this problem mentioned in any reviews. Ordering a replacement and returning the defective one. Hopefully it was an isolated issue and the replacement will be noisy.",
