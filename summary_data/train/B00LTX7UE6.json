Easy to remove/install, carpet catcher isn't a gimmick, they stay pretty well put when driving around. Won't slip under your feet. I recommend keeping your original mats underneath so you wont have to worry about this ever slipping. Two complaints: 1. Not wide enough for all vehicles, especially the back mats. Wish they were bit wider. 2. The carpet claws are actually great, I just wish they had some up at the top of the mat as well. Pros: 1. Cheap 2. High quality 3. Not a bad rubber smell",

I have tried scrubbing them on numerous occasions--the embedded dirt will not come off; no matter how long and hard I scrub them The surface of the mats now has an all over grimy appearance. The rubber surface seems to absorb the dirt for some reason.",

So we chopped the long piece in half, straight down the middle just so the middle does not raise up like a tent.

The mats are rather thick, with deep grooves to catch any water that happens to find its way in there. There is a boarder which is higher than the rest of the mat, which will trap any water from leaking over the edge onto the carpet. If you have a clutch, these might be a bit thick...might prevent the clutch safety switch from closing since the mat will be hard to compress.",

Hopefully they rework it so it can stay in place a lot better. Overall, would not buy a second time due to it sliding around.",

I think the Carpet Claw is a nice feature, but on my car they line up right where the mounting post is for my stock car mats, so they don't make contact with the carpet.

Mat on the driver side was not wide enough under the pedals ( accelerator, brake and clutch) and yet below close to seat portion was way too wide even after cutting.
