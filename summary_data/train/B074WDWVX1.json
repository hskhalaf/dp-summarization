This one failed within a couple of weeks, so at least I can return it to Amazon. I'm very disappointed in Belkin; they used to have a good reputation for making good reliable products. But no more. If this poorly-made but slickly-produced adapter is representative of Belkin corporate culture, then they have outsourced quality.

      "text": "Have been looking for a solution since Apple saw fit to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone. I refuse to use Bluetooth audio because it sounds horrible in my experience. Tried several other charge plus aux lightning adapters but none worked reliably. This is my setup- - short lightning cable and short aux cable plugged into BELKIN adapter and into my car aux port and usb power adapter (this all hides in my cars center console) -Belkin adapter plugged into a lightning extension cable (female to male cable) So I only have one cable coming out of my center console to my iPhone! Not elegant by any means, but Apple forced my hand.",
