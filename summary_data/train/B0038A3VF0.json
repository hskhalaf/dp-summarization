If you're actually planning on using this, buy something else like a kershaw camp machete. If you need a prop for a halloween costume, buy this, cut with it a few times, the blade will dull to a harmless, useless edge.",

I did not hit any rocks, nor was I chopping thick wood. So, within three minutes of use I had a useless piece of junk that got thrown away. I have the tomahawk by SOG and it has been a very nice utility axe, but stay away from this machete... it is a waste of money, it is brittle and it is dangerous!!",

Took it out on a camping trip and took a few whacks with it. <TING> Blade snapped right in half after just a few swings. Might be good against the zombies if it's all you had and your life didn't depend on it. As for your battle with nature, the SOGfari caught a beat down. Don't waste the cash. Amazon was great and replaced it quickly, but the SOGfari has been benched until I'm up 40 zip against the undead.",
