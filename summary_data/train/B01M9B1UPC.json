I thought this was standard size when I ordered (& the same size as what I use in Iyengar yoga). However, I later discovered that the blocks we use in yoga class are actually 9x6x3. They are smaller & easier to use, turn & grip with my small hands. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find the smaller 9x6x3 size made by Reehut on amazon. So I ordered from a different seller.",

When I'm lying on my back, balancing a block at its highest level to stretch my sacrum, it bends a bit underneath the full weight of my body (118 lbs.), which interrupts the posture and leads to readjustments that shouldn't be necessary. For beginner yogis who are using these as a balancing aide-- I give these 5 stars!",

I purchased the 9x6x4 version for the extra inch of height, but take note of which size you are purchasing to make sure you receive the correct dimensions for your needs. The quality of this product is good - I will be purchasing a set in purple for exercise. Recommended!",
