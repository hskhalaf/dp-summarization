But the sights are poor to useless; future iterations of the 92 series have improved on the sights. But for the 92s, this is the ONLY way to improve accuracy of sighting. And it really, really does help! Not cheap, but excellent. Yes, depending on the actual gun one has, the laser may be 'off' somewhat, and, with no adjustability, that is what one has to live with. But, once adjusted to the inaccuracy, if present for your gun, it still provides infinitely better results -- just adjust your aim accordingly.

To activate either of these modes you need to hold the on and off switch down for a while, the green laser will flash once and it will go into strobe mode.

But the deviation has only been 1/2\u201d - 1\u201d at 7 yards which is well within my personal tolerance for self defense.
