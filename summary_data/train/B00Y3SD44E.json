After a full charge, which doesn't take as long as it should anymore, it drains down rapidly at medium volume levels. I am very disappointed. Initially, I loved it so much I also bought a Flip 3 to compliment the Charge 2. Well the Flip 3 got sent back to JBL two weeks ago as the charger quit working. Thankfully it was still under the warranty. Needless to say, I won't be a JBL fan anymore. I have friends that have other brands 1-4 years old and still working great. Buy something else.",

These do sound great and the battery lasts pretty long, 8-10 hours at near full volume for me. JBL takes care of its customers too.

I have had and i'm still using my original JBL Flip which was fine and is still working, but the Charge 2+ is much better sounding speaker with a decent bass that kicks it up a notch.

I'd but it again. It's plenty loud for my purposes but I'm not using it for big parties.",

A day after that it was never able to establish a successful Bluetooth connection. So sad, it would have been perfect.",

Connection using Bluetooth was easier than most connected devices I used. The group sharing connection feature easily allowed anyone to take over playing the music from our group without any trouble. The biggest surprise was how loud and great the sound quality was. Great product overall!",
