I had plenty of room for my phone, 2 cliff gel packs, an ibuprofen, and my ID (just in case I had a medical emergency while in route) as the race didn't start until 8:15pm. They are well made and the price is completely affordable. Should I ever need another water bottle holding running belt I would buy these again.",

Didn\u2019t originally bother to look at the product reviews and I see that various other people reported this problem (that\u2019s on me!). I have yet to put it to use during a run.",

It doesn't sit comfortably when running because of that lack of elastic. The water bottles and positioning are great, and secure while easy to access.

If you're walking you can loosen the straps put down around your hips. Generally these kind of materials slip and slide due to friction, but this product is pretty well made. I love it.",

Straps flap around in that case. No room to carry any nutrition/gels. The pocket fits my Galaxy S7, ID and maybe cash, but nothing more. Wish it had an extra zipper for cards/cash. Bottle are fine, a little on the smallish side, and have bands to secure them so they don't fall out, nice reflective tabs on them. Used for up to 1/2 marathon distance, but if you're a big water drinker, this is not for you.",

Not a complete deal breaker as I usually have a small pocket in my capris. Overall, a very useful product and a great place to start if just getting into running longer distances.",
