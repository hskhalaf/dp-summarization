I have been terribly disappointed in this product. The cord is extremely stiff, making it very frustrating to use. Its impossible to move the computer without the cord popping out. That is EXTREMELY inconvenient all day long. I hope I can find another one that works better. I would NOT buy this. It certainly works, so it deserves a star, but its an awful product.",

This means that moving the computer around might cause the magnetic connector to part more easily. But in my experience the magnets aren't nearly as weak as some reviewers have reported. It works fine for tabletop use; it takes a little more care during lap use. I would never, as Griffin suggests, leave the USB-C piece plugged into my computer, as it's fairly large and would cause damage it if got knocked when carrying the computer around. The fact that the magnetic link between the two pieces isn't reversible hasn't been a problem.",

Third thing is the thickness of the cord that plugs into the power supply brick. Its thickness makes it quite inflexible.

It's worked okay to begin with, but soon became finicky, and then eventually stopped working altogether. The little nib that you have to keep in your power port is also annoying, and feels like it could easily snap off in a bag, or could be lost. Bottom line: it stopped working after light duty, so I can not recommend this. In the meantime, if you're reading this Apple, I think a lot of us will take a few extra millimeters on our computers to have our beloved magsafe back.",

    "title": "Griffin BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Breakaway Power Cable for MacBooks and Chromebook Pixel",
    "description": "Apple's MagSafe connector has saved literally millions of laptops from destruction caused by tripping over one's power cord. But with the introduction of USB-C on new MacBooks, this safety feature is absent. The BreakSafe Connector BreakSafe's patented quick-release magnetic connector plugs into your laptop's USB-C port and safely disconnects from the rest of the cable when under stress or strain, like tripping over the power cord. The streamlined magnetic connector is only 12.8 mm deep so you can leave it plugged into your laptop's USB-C port when not in use. BreakSafe is Designed to Protect your Laptop and You Because it is designed to carry power sufficient to charge your laptop's battery (up to 60 watts), BreakSafe incorporates four different safety features to protect you and your laptop from accidental or intentional misuse: Visual: Visual markings on the connector housing show the user the correct way to attach the cable and connector. Magnetic: BreakSafe's magnets only allow it to be connected the correct way, and ensure the cord's polarity is consistent with both the power supply and the device being powered. Structural: BreakSafe has two small keys molded into its magnetic connector that physically prevent the magnets from engaging, and prevent the cable from connecting incorrectly. Electrical: BreakSafe's central ground pin is the first conductive element to touch when joining the cable and connector. This ensures that any static electrical charges are dissipated before the cable begins passing power from supply to device. Using BreakSafe Use BreakSafe with the USB-C power supply that came with your laptop. BreakSafe is rated up to 60 watts (20 volts @ 3 amps), and has been designed and tested to meet USB-C power standards",
