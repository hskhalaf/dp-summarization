Also it would help if there were some rubber stoppers under the device to stop it from sliding along certain surfaces. When the air pocket was inflating I was getting excited as it was lifting my lower back, but felt let down when it stopped before giving a full stretch.",

After reading the reviews I decided to buy this for him for Christmas. For the first time since his surgery he has had major pain relief and is actually able to have chiropractic adjustments. My lower back has always hurt when getting up in the mor I g thanks to twenty years of gymnastics and after 2-3 sessions on this, I wake up feeling like a teenager again. It\u2019s definttely worth the investment.",

      "text": "Works like a charm. Three bulging discs (L3-L5). Was skeptical but purchased because of the reviews. After just a couple sessions, this replaced paying a hundred bucks for each traction session at a physical therapist. Much better mobility and less nerve pain thanks to this device. Have had it for about three months and still works great. Massage may be a bit too aggressive, but settings with just inflation do the trick too. Would definitely recommend to anyone with lower lumbar issues Best part is the portability. Can take it anywhere, fits in small/medium bag, great for travel.",
