I live in an area located between 2 of the remaining rain forests which of course is paradise for mosquitoes . Regardless of how careful you are several manage to sneak into my home. Fruit flies or gnats are a problem as well in this humidity. These traps emit a small amount of uv light which the little buggers can't resist exploring. The fan sucks them into the trap & they die from lack of food & water. These small traps use very little electric so cost of operation is minimal.",

Our yard got infested over the summer & we\u2019d find 5+ fleas in our home everyday even though I was washing everything nearly daily. So I started leaving this trap on the floor at nite and it attracted fleas, flies, gnats, everything and zapped them. Soon we stopped finding fleas in the home.",

It didn't work that great outside so I put it in my house for the bugs that snuck in. Indoors, it works fantastic!! I'm sure the bigger ones would be fine outside. There are some aggressive mosquitos in Costa Rica, really nothing works there. It's too bad it's plug in only. I would've liked to have hung it in a tree.
