That's backwards to most curtainrods, but you need to do it here, because the designer never used a real screwdriver and didn't leave a LOT of room to get the screws in. Certainly not enough for a screwgun or electric screwdriver.",

Additionally the paint flakes off the brackets really easy. I would recommend going to target they have similar curtain rods of higher quality for about the same price.",

Also, I ordered four sets of these and the finials were all scratched or had pieces chip off. The finials are also pretty small, though I guess it matches the 1\" rod. Could have been bigger. Super glue and being high up helps to hide defects on the finials. If you're just looking for the cheapest double rod that's fairly decent looking, then this is the best price I've seen on the net. If you want something nice, I would suggest spending the money to buy a better rod set.",

They box came with the materials needed (screws and mollies) to install the rods, plus instructions. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I wish had done it years ago, instead of wasting so much on blinds. Lesson learned.",
