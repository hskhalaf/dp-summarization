The remote is easy enough to use, but like with other home theater devices, your best bet is a remote such as a Harmony. My main complaint with this device is the short cable. This is case by case specific as the short cable could benefit those that keep this in a comm closet; however, this issue is easily mitigated with an extension cable. I have not really used the apps on the device so I cannot comment too much on those. Overall, I have been very pleased with this product and would definitely purchase again.",

The downside is the apps are glitchey and limited from the Roku. Even after resetting the device and making sure it had current updates it is still glitchey. We needed to upgrade to BluRay so we will keep it, but probably go back to the Roku for streaming when finances allow.",

      "text": "It's a fine blu-ray player, but if you're buying it for streaming capabilities, move on to a different device. It freezes, refuses to turn on or off, stoops mid-show or mid-movie, among other things. We end up pulling out a long HDMI cable and using my laptop to stream content to the TV - even all that hassle is easier than trying to use this player. Plus, it doesn't have HBO Now. I very much regret making this purchase.",
