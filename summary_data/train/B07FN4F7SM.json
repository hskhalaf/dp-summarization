It doesn't matter what humidity target you set it up to, it keeps running and running and running and running (and barely captures any water because the room is not actually damp at some point...). Also to change the fan power up, one cannot press the fan button, one has to power down and then back up, or use the laundry mode, then get back to standard. I was so impressed by the 25L Meaco, I can't believe this product is so poor. Given the price, avoid, avoid, avoid.",

Compared with the one I used different brand in Asia previously, this one is only fair. I still feel the moisture in the air. Probably the temperature is too low..

It\u2019s a little louder than our oven - not too noticeable in day to day life but will be absolutely fine overnight which is when I intend to use it.",
