      "text": "We have really enjoyed having these taco holders. We got tired of having the ingredients spill out when they fell over. * The flat bottom shells fit in well. Some shells are more snug than others, but they all fit. An added and unexpected bonus was the use of holding whole fried fish (after they cooled down and the oil wouldn't melt the plastic). After we fry the fish, if it lays on one side for too long on a plate with paper towels, it loses its crispness. The crunchy skin is one of the best parts.",

I was going to get a different set that took up less room, but read that they weren't sturdy enough to hold up a stuffed taco. We have had no problems with these holders and taco spillage. I also like that you can use one alone or have them hooked together. I only give them 4 stars because it can be hard to get them together. Some slide onto each other easily and others take some real force. They snap apart easily, although I'm always afraid I'm going to break the plastic but so far so good.",
