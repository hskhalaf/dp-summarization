He likes this pair but for some reason the ankle on the right boot is rubbing really hard and irritating him through two pairs of socks. He weighs 140lbs so I know they aren\u2019t too tight. Just something about how they are made. Besides that he doesn\u2019t have any complaints.",

I ordered a size 8 but had to return them and get size 9. I have never worn size 9 shoes in my life. 9 fits great and just enough room for this socks when needed.",
