For a 50$ bra this is unacceptable. I understand that flaws happen but I guess the lesson is inspect everything with a fine tooth comb within the return window. Ridiculous",

The clip is easy to use for nursing and it folds completely out of the way. It feels smooth and comfy and doesn't dig in or pinch anywhere. The only con is that this bra is expensive but it's worth the price. I figure three of these bras costs the same as just a few weeks of baby formula! For reference I wear a 36 C or D (fluctuates) and the medium fits perfectly. If you're a 38 you may need next size or an extender since I use last set of hooks.",

After trying on this bra my husband remarked that people have been making bras for at least a hundred years, how can they still be so very bad at it! While pregnant and nursing my breasts have never been larger or heavier, why are nursing bras made with less support when more is needed?! Stay away from this one.",

The elastics is starting to do that weird stringy thing. I would not recommend. I ordered two KinderedBravely bras at the same time and have washed/dried those just as much as this one and they are still holding their shape.

If you plan on wearing this under something else at all times and never having the tank exposed, neither of these are an issue. Also the fabric tends to roll up a lot so I'm constantly having to pull it down. I won't be repurchasing, definitely not worth the money!",

I only wear my nursing bras on the weekends to places a nursing tank is not appropriate. Therefore I got very few uses out of this bra before it came apart.

After I had my baby I started wearing these and within the first two weeks, a clasp on BOTH of my bras broke and deformed. My daughter is 10 weeks old now and I am still managing to wear one of these bras but the other one would randomly come completely undone throughout the day so I stopped wearing it. Needless to say I am very disappointed in this bra.",

It also provides great coverage without being overwhelming. My only complaint is that the band was too tight, I had to add an extender on the back to make it fit comfortably. I did try the next size up but the cups were way too big, so I kept the large and just added the extender on the back.",

The only minor annoyance is occasionally the elastic that holds it together when unclipped sticks out the armpit - just make sure to tuck it in after nursing. Best nursing bra ever.

This is the first bra in months that I can wear without putting an extender on the strap! It's super comfortable and supportive. I also found it easy to latch back together after nursing- no different than other nursing bra or tank latches I have used. It is worth every penny!",

One side looked ok but not great, and the other side just looked terrible - you could see the entire outline of the cup.

First, even though there is no wire, it provides sufficient support. Having size 36C, I could not find before wire free bra with good support. Underwire bras are not recommended during breastfeeding period. Second, the bra stretches and fits to different sizes. Basically, you may buy only this one bra for the pregnancy and breastfeeding period and it will stretch with your growing breast. Third, it has removable cups which hide the nipples and may be used as breast pads. Strongly recommend this bra!",

However, the small is much too tight and I can barely get it on the loosest hooks. Apparently 32F is in between sizes, so I will be using an extender.",
