Luckily, my apt wasn't super infested and didn't extend past my room to my kids room. So I purchased the 16 oz bottle just test it out. Turned out that was the only bottle I needed and did not need to do the second treatment. Haven't seen another since but ordered another just in case. Thank God for this stuff!!!",

Full-house heat treatment is still the best, but if you can't afford it or don't want to prep hassle, use this spray & repeat in two weeks while putting all your clothes, sheets, etc through the high-heat drying cycle & bagging. It is non-toxic to animals, has a slightly odd, but not unpleasant smell that fades quickly, and can be sprayed directly onto anything - mattresses, walls, floors, clothes, interior of night-table drawers, etc (don't forget the electric outlets by the bed - that's a favorite hiding place). Buy by the gallon & use at 2 week intervals at least twice or 3 times. IT WORKS. Nothing else is as good.",

I searched Home Depot, Lowe's, & other Amazon products and ended up buying things that didn't get rid of the bugs. After reading these reviews, I took a chance on EcoRaider and boy am I glad! The bugs were greatly depleted after one bottle but completely gone after two. I would recommend buying two at a time just to attack completely. I really liked the smell and so did my husband. It reminded us of cedarwood oil, which we had also tried as a natural remedy. I've already encouraged another friend to purchase this for her own bed bug issue.",
