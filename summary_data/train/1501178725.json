The author's take on fitness and overall physical and mental health is great, and his smile and positive attitude are infectious. The recipes are delicious, nutritious, and easy to cook and offer a lot of variations to change things up. They are the perfect size to meal prep for one or two people and reheat well. I highly recommend this book! :-D Oh yes, and the photos are beautiful!",
