This is a poorly designed feeder that will certainly fail in the same way with time.",

Had feeder up for 2 months during the prime migration/nesting season here in Florida. Hummers would come to their known feeder location and run in to this foreign shape. Fly around and depart without drinking. Went back to the inexpensive inverted feeder and placed it 1 foot from the HummZinger (hoping the overflow Hummers would not wait but drink from the other feeder). Hummer families are back feeding at the original inverted feeder and ignoring the HummZinger. I took down the HummZinger and would not recommend it.",

As there is no bottle obstructing the feed ports the humming birds enjoy just hanging out staying dry from the rain. As the bottom is clear you can see their tongues hitting the nectar. Will be ordering two more to replace the ones out back.",

      "text": "Hummingbirds love this feeder! We have hummingbirds visit us all day long. I'm making my own nectar using the recipe that comes with the feeder which saves us money and allows us to give fresh food to the birds every week or so. The feeder does a good job of keeping other bugs out of the food reservoir but occasionally I'll find a fly or bee inside. Overall this is a great product.",

Hence i am unable to use the hummingbird feeder at all....unless of course i just put it on a table....oh well...unless the company is good enough to send me a new threaded hook i guess it will just sit in the closet! A shame because i think its a good feeder if i can ever get it to hang. Update....Amazon sent me a replacement and now that i have the good item i love it....!!!!",

I have had several hummingbird feeders over the years including some beautiful blown glass ones but if they got the smallest air bubble they would leak - not to mention attract ants and bees. This feeder is awesome. I have gotten more hummingbirds in a week than I did in a year before. The nice part is they actually sit down on the edge to enjoy their snack. I had one hang out for a few minutes just looking around. I purchased one as a gift for someone who has never attracted hummingbirds and within the first hour he was getting them too.",

I got the 12 oz. size as I have only ever seen one Ruby-Throat hummingbird here. Because of the way the Hummzinger is made and the lack of yellow used on the feeder there are NO bees or wasps on the feeder. I didn't want them as they can kill hummingbirds if they sting them. The Hummzinger is easy to clean, easy to fill, and easy to hang up. I had my very first visitor this afternoon and he or she sat very calmly on the perch while drinking the nectar I had made. :) I'm delighted!",

The Highview also lets you actually see the birds beak/tongue as it\u2019s drinking, if you are fortunate enough to place it close. The only downfall is the bee guards are sold separate. For that reason, I don\u2019t have them on my feeders, but I don\u2019t have many bees in my area so it\u2019s not been an issue. If you do have lots of bees, buy the guards.",

But then when I hung the bird feeder it became obvious that the threaded insert that holds the rod was installed crooked. The bird feeder is not plumb to the rod, so the nectar leans to one side. Hopefully, the hummingbirds won't notice, but it looks sad hanging crooked outside my window.",

They already use so much energy they need a break! Another thing I LOVE is that the wasps, bees, etc. mostly leave it alone because the liquid is too low in container for them to reach. Ants cant get in either. PLUS this is very easy to clean.",
