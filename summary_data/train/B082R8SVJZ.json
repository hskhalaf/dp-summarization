      "verdict": "The Acer Chromebook 314 is a return to the principles that made Chromebooks so appealing to many people when they first arrived. You won\u2019t find expensive displays, quad-core processors or touchscreens here, but what you have is a cheap device with excellent battery life that can help kids do their homework, families organise their lives, and pretty much all the basics that most people want most of the time. It\u2019s also lightweight and acts like a proper laptop rather than some weird hybrid. Old-school, with modern aesthetics and performance.",

I use mine for university work, streaming and video calls and it's fine for that. Certain apps don't work (iFollow, Now TV) but a lot do. The only downside to this chromebook is that you are restricted to online usage, however a lot of Google Docs have since become available offline. It is a brilliantly priced product (this is my second chromebook by Acer) but only buy it if you're not tied to Windows/Apple services/can work online.",

Nice design , yet very poor performance.",
