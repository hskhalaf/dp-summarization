Seriously, you can put it On a flat surface and it will slide off onto the floor. I have dropped this thing half a dozen times in 1 day of having it. It has slide off the couch arm, table, even the charger a few minutes ago. Sorry, but it\u2019s going back. It looks cool and is as described, but way to slippery for me.",
