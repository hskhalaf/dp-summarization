The metal piece that hooks around the bike was completely snapped in half. This was a complete waste of money. I never thought to see that the pieces weren't damaged. It was brand new, and unfortunately, now, I'm past the return window. On a positive note, my daughter is safe. This could have been way worse if this had snapped while she was riding on my husband's or my bike. So glad I was never able to use it.",

I was getting tires of pulling her around in her cart and this is great for long adventures. Feels super stable for both me and the baby.

The bracket to the bike is very sturdy, but the bracket to the seat mounts with one dinky little pin causing too much wiggle and play back and forth with my daughter in the seat.

      "text": "This has been a great seat for us. I bought it for my 2-year-old and have been using it almost daily for about 2 months. Install was easy enough, and it seems very safe and secure. It takes some getting used to, as there's a change in weight distribution than riding solo or with a rear-mounted seat, but after one ride with a spotter, I felt confident to go riding with just my toddler. My only complaint is that the straps seems almost useless-- with the way they're positioned, they don't stay on my son's shoulders. Still, the front bar keeps him in place, and I don't worry about him falling out.",
