      "text": "It's an ok bike. It seems like it should be priced around 200$. It seemed really nice at first, but after using it for a few weeks it seems to be cheaper construction. Rubber hand grips are loose and already have wear and tear. The brake system and gear shifters should be better quality. It's not a terrible bike, but I thought it would be better. If it was priced around 200$ then I would of been happy with it compared to 300$.",

Wish the tires were a little higher quality, but that's a small drawback. It's not an elite bike, but an affordable everyday option for paved trails and city riding.",

      "text": "This bike was pretty easy to put together. The seat had to be adjusted a few times to stop shifting around and tipping backwards. I like the placement of the kickstand, as it's behind the pedals instead of in line with them, so they don't get in the way of each other when you're trying to move the bike out of the garage. One thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a pass-through bar. It's tricky to mount and dismount. Other than that, it's a great bike.",

Its perfect size and an awesome deal. I had a Schwinn 700c that was much bigger and heavier. I can keep up to my fiance\u0301 better on this. My sister and law stopped over and wanted one immediately but when we brought it up on amazon the deal was gone and it was up to $269. This was a great buy. Hope it hold up. Sharp looking too.",

The handles are really small, maybe 3\u201d long beyond the shifter part. The pedals are small, about half the width of my foot. The seat is BRUTAL! You\u2019ll need an aftermarket seat immediately. See the stock phot of the bike? Where the handlebars are above the seat? Yea... you\u2019re gonna need a handlebar extender as well unless you\u2019re 5\u2019 tall with short legs. Beyond that, it rides well on prepared surfaces. I do not recommend taking this bike with its narrow tires off curbs or on dirt or even grass.",
