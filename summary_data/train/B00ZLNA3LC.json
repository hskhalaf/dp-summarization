I put many miles on each pair and they look as good as the day I bought them. The shell/ body of the sneaker are well made, but the downfall is that for the miles I power walk that I do, the sole of the sneakers wear down after 8/9 months. When it's time to trash the sneaker, they still look good as when you bought them. I'm still looking for sneakers that have tough soles that can handle MANY miles, recommendations would be appreciated. As to wear for normal walk and activity, these are great and look good.",
