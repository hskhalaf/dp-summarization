Subsequent phone calls to Poulan Pro were a waste of time. They refused to take responsibility or offer any solution. Given the lack of customer service from Poulan Pro, avoid and look elsewhere. In addition the serial number on box was missing from product itself. Serial provided on box did not match Poulan Pro database.",

I went in and got the same fuel I use for my chainsaw and it worked fine. Son is an engineer and still is put out by the poor documentation.",

Blower would run a little better if you used throttle lock position. I ordered a new spark plug hoping that this would solve the problem without taking the blower in for service. The new spark plug made no difference. I dropped blower off for service on 07/23/20, just picked up today 08/28/20. I was told by authorized repair center that Poulan has decided NOT to go ahead with repair, because repair exceeds 70% of machines value. This blower has only been used approx.10 times in just over one year. POULAN 2 WARRANTY BLOWS HARDER THAN BACK PACK BLOWER",

      "text": "Game changer. I like my leaf blower a lot. Raking my yard and customers yard is at a bare minimum now. It blows debris real hard. IMO its a champ just like the Poulan Pro Chainsaw. The price was easy on the wallet. The other brands were $300-$500 at the store where i live. All in all i am happy with the product.",

I can\u2019t sell it used because that would just be rude. DO NOT PURCHASE.",
