I heard that emu oil really helps when you're trying to repair and regrow your hairline, so I've been using it for a few weeks. The insta natural brand is the third brand I've tried, and it's the best. It arrives professionally packed. The bottle is sturdy. The oil itself has a great consistency: nice and thick. This brand has been the best, so this is the one that has made it to auto-ship status. My hairline is slowly growing back, and I also use it for my skin now.",

However, I had also read it can help relieve inflammation (not chronic though) so I started rubbing it into the strained tendons around my knee. Within 2 days, the pain was significantly less and eventually, 80% better and I can now climb stairs again. This is a really nice product and I will be placing another order. I really think it helps with tendonitis pain. Update: It\u2019s been months since I first purchased this Emu Oil. I love adding a little lavender or peppermint oil to this before applying at bedtime.

Together they are working wonders for my face. It's very soft but so far I haven't seen any decrease in the lines and wrinkles ... but then Rome wasn't built in a day and neither were my lines and wrinkles! This is a good company in which to deal and they seem to care about their customers. I asked a couple of questions and got replies very quickly.",

My previous brand had an eye-dropper applicator, which was rather messy. This is in a pump and delivers just the right amount with no mess. Excellent product and company.",

I didn't have to reapply it after using it, it absorbs quickly & just like that, smooth, soft & shiny. This Product is the next big thing & I will definitely come back because I'm seriously can't live without it. I will be forever customer to InstaNatural.

It was much smoother and softer. I could probably go without using it daily, but why would I? My only wish is that there were larger sized bottles. I'm about to order my third one!",

I have found that adding a few drops of water OR applying to damp skin helps to smooth it on. This oil IS actual odorless and does not leave a greasy feeling.
