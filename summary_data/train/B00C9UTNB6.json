      "title": "Brilliant",
      "text": "This laptop is fantastic. The battery life, screen resolution, and overall speed are excellent. The touchscreen works perfectly, and makes Windows 8 much easier to get to grips with. The keyboard feels great to type on, and the backlit keyboard feature is a lovely touch. I was very fortunate to get a great price - probably the best \u00a3380 I have ever spent. The only issue so far is that after upgrading to Windows 8.1, I could no longer adjust the screen brightness, and had to roll back the graphics driver to make it work again. But aside from that, it's superb.",

I have not had any problems with the screen, which seems to have been an issue with other reviewers and almost put me off buying it. I do not do any gaming or high tech stuff so perhaps that makes a difference. I think that this has been a good buy for the money.",

The touchscreen works awesomely (although its not strictly necessary to use most of the time), the keyboard is one sexy back-lit mother, it plays games well and runs quietly as. I would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone, although if you have the cash to spring for the i5 or the i7 processor I would do, just to make things run faster for the sake of it, but as is this is a pretty spectacular piece of machine.
