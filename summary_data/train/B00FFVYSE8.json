They auto-updated as soon as the devices were turned on with super easy setup to our secured wireless! Absolutely no issues/complaints about this product. What more could you ask for??",

Realistically, it may not have the horsepower of some of its much more expensive brethren but for the basic things such as playing games and the like, this unit is not that bad. I was pleasantly surprised. This unit is not going to be used for anything except average games and reading the news and the like so I did not need something with the power of an iPad or a Windows 8 tablet. I was therefore happy to not have to pay iPad prices to do these few things.",

I was deleting games daily so ABG and Chug vould have space to update. The 16gb hd effectivly triples useable space compared to an 8gb as you have 12gb after OS comoared to the kindles 4gb.

If the charger (and I've tried several) is not plugged in at the perfect angle with just the right amount of pressure, it won't charge. So overall I'm not too thrilled.

Battery life seems to be a little light as I tend to charge this quite frequently. The front camera is only 1.3MP and it pretty much shows.

The metal connector end does not fit snugly into the tablet - it is very loose, and is probably a well-known design flaw with this connector style as I have the same issue with another tablet with the same style connector. The problem varies with different connector cords, but it can be very difficult to charge when the connection isn't secure - meaning you think it is charging but it is not. You have to put it in just the right position and verify it on the screen to ensure the charger connection is made.",

While I cannot speak to the next generation of these tablets from Dell, I can say that this unit is great for a first time tablet user.",
