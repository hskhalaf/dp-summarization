I donated it to National Mill Dog Rescue for the larger dogs, I volunteer there with the smaller dogs & wanted a good training leash that's not too thick. It would help if the company included the size of the cord & not just the length on their site. It came in great condition, new & I like the leather parts & the suppleness of the cord, the price is fair & that's why I didn't return it. I would buy from this company again if they were more specific in listing the sizes.",

Its been left outside in the elements a few times and the green color has faded a bit, but after two years, the nylon mesh has not frayed nor has the stitching on the leather come off. Just a great leash overall. My father in law who is nearing 70, loves how light the leash is compared to the leather ones we have, easier to carry and control the dog with. Highly recommended.",

You can find directions on the internet. Made a huge difference in walking my dog and she learned to heel almost instantly. After walking a few times, I slowly went back to using it as a normal slip lead. Would definitely purchase this product again in the future.",

The leash is short enough that I do not need to worry about the dog running in front of the scooter. Also the leash is soft enough that the dog is not hurt when I restrain it when it wants to chase a squirrel or a rabbit.",
