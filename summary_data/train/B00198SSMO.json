I also had a question for the company, and received a response today on Sunday. Have never had customer service like that. Thank you so much to the makers of UroMAXX. I would give 10 stars if possible. A forever customer in Texas.",

There is no way she would ever eat it in her food...very finicky. So, I use a dropper to squeeze it directly into her mouth. Her frequent bladder infections are no more.",
