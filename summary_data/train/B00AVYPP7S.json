I finally reset 8 in Windows RE wiping out the info I had entered and signed up for an outlook account. Now everything works fine. I hope sometime to modify the Windows 8 desktop to reflect what I want to see but for now, I am okay going to Internet Explorer. I do love the touch screen. The Acer is sleek, light, performs beautifully but I hate mouse touchpads in general and the Acer's one does not change my mind.",

Then install the new driver 217v3 once you do that it should run smoothly. I haven't had any problems since I've installed the new driver. Watching movies on this computer is only average.
