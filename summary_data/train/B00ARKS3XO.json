I had to respray the entire area with real Round-up. I conclude that the manufacturing process has terrible quality control...consistent with the idea that they don't have much of a brand to protect.

And die they did, have acres of totally dead weeds, followed the mix examples on packaging. So, will take a week, week and a half to show progress, but I promise you this works as well as terrible Roundup, just takes a bit longer.

I used to mix a large amount in to kill Virginia creeper, poison oak, poison ivy, etc. I would see initial effects in just a day or two. This time, I used much less, as I was not targeting those hearty plants. I did not see results quickly, but I am seeing results. Things are dying where I sprayed. It has been a week, but I'm not worried about the timeline, just the end result. If you want things to die faster, mix a stronger batch; otherwise, be patient and save money by mixing weaker.
