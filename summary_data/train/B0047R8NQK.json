Once the boat is not appropriately inflated it is very uncomfortable on the water. What I did is buy duct tape to secure the air plugs.",

      "text": "I like it so far... but... 1. Way too small for even 4 people, 3 is comfortable... 2. Does not come with a user instruction guide. I wonder what the black valves are for on the floor of the boat. 3. Cant tell if there is the right amount of air filled in the 3 chambers. Would have appreciated a gauge. 4. Would have also appreciated a set of oars and a pump to inflate (I had to but it separately) 3. Material seems to be thick, which is good. But only time will tell how the boat really performs. I will sure to come back and post my comments after my first use...",
