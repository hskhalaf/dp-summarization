I ended up selecting the Spigen as the keeper for these reasons: the Spigen takes up much less space on my night stand, the Spigen does not require permanent adhesive to stick in place and the Spigen does not put a sharp bend in the charge cable, and has two placement options out each side. My pictures show the side by side size difference. Used both products, both do the job, but I like the Spigen model much more.",

The Spiegen stand was made for the previous 42mm Watch dimensions. On Amazon, Spiegen says it's compatible with the new 44mm AW4. I disagree. My AW4 \"sorta\" works with this stand. Some nights the Watch constantly pings as it disconnects and reconnects to the charging stand because the connection between the charging disk and Watch is compromised. Spiegen needs to redesign it for the 44mm AW4 if they want their customers to not have this problem.",

      "text": "This little stand is perfect for my bathroom counter. It helps me remember to place my watch on it before showering, or getting ready for the day/night etc to give the watch that boost it needs to make it through the day. Once it is on the counter it holds very well in place. Note, you do need to have a separate watch charging cord, as this is just the stand/holder. It has an insert for the smaller apple watch, but ours is constantly used with both sizes and I have not put the insert in. The magnet holds the smaller watch in place just fine. Would recommend for a bathroom, night stand, or desk!",

The only thing I noticed is you must push the actual charger \"the magnet circle\" through the whole in the stand and make it slightly stick out the front side of the stand. If you don't do this and you leave the \"magnet circle\" flush in the hole the watch will not always charge or start charging and then you wake up in the morning to see that the watch never charged. After figuring this out, I have not had one issue with the stand and I love it. Hope this helps someone that might be having my same issue when i first got it.",
