As many of you know vitamins and supplements take a while to work (usually about 6 months) I've only been using this for three weeks. So it's far too soon to tell. But I can report that it is completely tasteless. I just add two droppers to a glass of water in the morning and drink it down. My hairdresser says she just squirts it under her tongue! I try to remember to post another review in February. BTW, if you have a Sprout's Farmer's Market nearby, they carry this item in a 18oz size.",

Look at your muscles!\" Well I knew they were nice and firm but it's great to have confirmation other than my sweet husband. I also take it because I know the human body is extremely deficient in minerals. Silca is also great for bones, teeth, nails and skin!",

I also took this product with vegan magnesium, which works with silica. This product was non-irritating after consumption. The product dries as a white, flaky residue. I think I'll repurchase because of the health of my nails. I bought this product for collagen production, and I figure it's working based on the noticeable difference in my nails.",
