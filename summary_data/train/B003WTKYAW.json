Using it about twice a weed to grill vegis, chickens, and fish. The Chicken is harder, takes lots of time to cook well, unless you cut into small pieces. The fish cooks nicely and does not come out dry. I have not tried the steak yet. Overall, having good experience with this grill.",

Thought it was a good value but you're really just paying for the risk and now we don't have a grill ready in time.",

It\u2019s very simple to operate, the drip pan was easy to remove, and washing it after use was a breeze (I washed it in the sink and followed the instructions). Although the power cord is short, using an extension cord was fine; I had no issues in doing so. I was surprised to see that it was able to hold a good amount of food to be grilled! Definitely recommend this product!",

It does spatter, so I place a reusable piece of foil underneath to help with cleanup. For thicker burgers, I cover them with a foil tent to hold in the heat so they cook better in the middle.",

The oils dropped neatly into the drip pan, and it was going all night. The temperature stayed consistent, the food was good, the guests were happy and it was super easy to dismantle & clean at an off site event.",

The grease doesn't drain off well, and splatters everywhere. The max temperature isn't really high enough to cook a steak well either. Might be ok for other things but if you are looking to cook beef inside, look elsewhere.",

It was consistent across the surface! Fantastic! If there are any issues with it later I\u2019ll update this review. I purchased this outright and did not receive any compensation for it.

The Temperature somehow lost connection, you have to plug in hardly then, make sure it connects well. When I use it over a few times, seems it became easier to lost power connection. Besides that, It is easy to clean and easy to set-up. But we have to keep clean the BBQ waste during cooking, otherwise, meat is easy to be overcooked. Overall, Compare with its price and quality, this is a good BBQ Product! I will recommend small family to buy one for Indoor BBQ.",

The product takes time to get used to as it is much slower than an outdoor grill, but it works just fine for an occasional steak or burgers in winter. It's grilled, but you just don't get quite the flavor you normally get from a real grill. Much better, though, than pan frying. The surface is very easy to clean and you don't get a lot of smoke or spatter produced as the fat is drained away from the meat.",
