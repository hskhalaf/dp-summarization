Paired with driver problems with their wireless adapters and two routers failing on me, I decided it was time for a change. Enter the Trendnet TEW-639GR. This router had extremely easy setup, and 100% uptime since I installed it about a year ago. Software configuration is simple, and it has been compatible with every wireless product I've connected to it. No problems are good problems, what else can I say (and the price was right too). Highly recommended!",

However, this router was awful. It would not keep my internet connection alive, random drops all the time that would require a router reboot. The wireless signal was not very good either, my older D-Link DI-524 802.11g Access Point provided much better coverage throughout my house (2-stories with 40x40 footprint). Returned this router (gotta give props to TigerDirect for 100% refund) and bought a D-Link DIR-655 XtremeN which has been so much better. Very disappointed in this router, I do not recommend that you buy it.",

None of my five wifi devices could connect when I selected the WPA security. I then downgraded to WEP security and was successful with all of them.

Installation was a breeze, and the tech support really is 24hr! I have never had to reset this router since installation which is amazing considering how many times it gets unplugged momentarily and used for informal networking. The set up is actually Easier that a same generation Netgear router I had before. This does a great job of handling simultaneous downloads, uploads, and live streaming over several wireless G and N laptops in my apartment.",
