I print a lot of documents and some of the larger SOW's (Statement of Work) need to be stapled and filed as a hard copy once signed, scanned and emailed back to the client. A normal stapler doesn't work on the thicker docs and paper clips get caught on other papers. This works perfectly for my needs. It has a sleek look which I like and is not industrial looking or bulky like the old-fashioned clunky ones. I have it on my desk using the power adapter and haven't tried with batteries, but I don't see any reason those wouldn't work just as well. Very happy with my purchase!",

It was working when I left the office on Friday and it wasn't working on Monday morning. It's just 'dead' - it's plugged in, everything looks fine, it just no longer works. I think a two year life-span for something lightly used, that costs as much as this one does is NOT GOOD VALUE. I liked it while it worked, but I will certainly not be spending this kind of money for another one with a two-year life expectancy. So disappointed . . .",

Everything comparable to this older model had terrible reviews and the throat depth was too shallow. I decided to give this one a go, and it has surpassed expectations. I use the stapler everyday and I staple up to 500 fabric swatches to cardstock each day. I did have to tape this little one down to the table so it didn't slide, but so far it has not buckled under pressure. I'm hoping another Heavy Duty or Industrial grade stapler comes out that gets better consumer reviews, but until then, I'll keep buying these.",

I love that you can adjust the slide when easy. This is also a new feature that I have never had before. It is not bulky and is easy to transport around the house. It also goes thru thick papers that I use at times. The staples don't bend or go in just half way. Say goodbye to paper clips!",

My new stapler is much smaller so takes up less desk space. It also uses batteries which makes it portable, which is a great feature. I would definitely recommend this stapler.",
