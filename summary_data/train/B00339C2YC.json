For the price it's a great value and the case really does keep the glass protected. I dropped it from about 4 feet on hard dirt while it was in the case and it didn't break. I also don't like how the propane tank doesn't fit snug into the stand. You have to pick the stand up and move it when you move the lantern. I bought it as a secondary lantern for camping and it worked fine. The propane lanterns with mantles are the best in my opinion. They're very bright and efficient.",

    "title": "Coleman QuickPack Deluxe Propane Lantern",
    "description": "Make packing up your lantern as easy as possible with the Coleman QuickPack Deluxe Propane Lantern. The 2-mantle design of this lantern creates a steady, bright glow of up to 1000 lumens of light that reaches up to 22 meters away. A quick match strike is all you need to get your lantern started, then simply dial in the perfect brightness with the adjustable control knob. Once your lantern is lit, the wide base provides stability when placed on a table, and the bail handle allows for easy hanging. No matter where you go, the PerfectFlow pressure-control technology produces a steady fuel stream and consistent performance in all kinds of weather. When you're ready to head home, the QuickPack storage system helps get you on your way quickly, since the lantern base is also the bottom of your case. Just place the outer cover and you're all packed up until you're ready for your next bright adventure.",
