I scan the original patterns onto office paper, run those sheets through my Creative Station , peel off the cellophane from each side, place the pattern sticky side down on my wood, then cut out my project.

Side note: Not to mention the disposable waste that this thing will generate.

I think laminate/laminate might be more apt to do that. But for getting sticky on intricate cuts (I use a cricut), this is a must have. And the magnet for pictures or promotional business cards/etc. is super cool. And perhaps laminate/laminate might be great but I have a traditional machine for that.",

Three warnings, keep printed stickers/magnets you make out of direct sunlight, use indoors only, and avoid full sheets of paper (8x11) for use. These don\u2019t withstand water and the sun makes the ink disappear. Using full sheets works, but sometimes when running through the sticker maker, it\u2019ll start to angle which will cause it to crinkle and screw up your entire piece. I made a gigantic magnet once with four papers taped together and it worked but barely and it wasn\u2019t perfect. Great for cute things and organization, but nothing of the industrial level.",

Plus it's so fast. I've been careful with positioning the things I'm working with because unlike the wet glue there's no sliding your piece around to get it in position, but so far, so good.

      "text": "It works well with the small laminator, but the cartridges are wasteful. You have a plastic cartridge left after each refill, and no way to recycle it. It would be nice if the creative station let you just load the adhesive into a cartridge that was part of the machine. Also, we go through these pretty quickly. It would be nice if they came with more adhesive for the price.",
