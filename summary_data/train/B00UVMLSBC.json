When I was on my way outside to turn the burner up a little more I heard a loud pop. The block exploded. I'm just glad it didn't explode 1 minute later (when I would have had the lid up to check on it). The manufacturer notes that they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee but I don't see any way to contact them to get a replacement.",

Getting a replacement so will amend my review soon, hopefully for the better. ***UPDATE*** Second block looked better, more solid. One hour in oven, 30 min at 275 30 min at 375 degrees then on grill at low heat, 400 degrees. Opened lid and saw the mess. Now I have to get all the salt shrapnel out of my grill.",

On the second try I let the salt blocks really get sizzling hot (as I was thinking that perhaps the salt blocks hadn't gotten as hot as they should have, thus the steaks spent too much on them). I grilled Salmon and I couldn't taste much salt, but I certainly did NOT detect any enhanced flavors whatsoever! I then grilled a steak and again it came out VERY salty! So, if you like salty food, then this is for you. But if you don't, then skip this \"fad\"!",

    "title": "Charcoal Companion CC7167 Himalayan Salt Plate & Holder Set with Salt Plate Recipe Book, 8 x 12\"",
    "description": "Using a salt plate results in a milder flavor than when using ground salt. Himalayan salt is rich in trace minerals, which adds to the depth of flavor your foods will achieve when cooked, chilled, or simply presented on the plate. Himalayan salt plates have naturally low moisture contents, which allow the plate to be heated or chilled to extreme temperatures. Our salt plate holder eliminates excess pressure to any one area of your plate, while protecting fragile edges and extending the salt plate's life. As your salt plate begins to wear down, you will get more use of the cooking surface by using the holder as a frame to hold together the pieces of salt.\nDIRECTIONS: Your salt plate will work well on the grill, gas range or chilled in the refrigerator. When heating your salt plate, heat gradually over the lowest flame possible. Slowly increase the heat to medium for approximately 30-45 minutes until the plate reaches the best cooking temperature of around 300 Degree F. If heating on the grill, keep the grill lid closed while heating. Once the plate is heated, you may either continue to cook over heat or carefully remove the plate and cook off heat. The plate will maintain its temperature for some time. Please keep in mind that food will acquire saltier flavor as the plate cools.\nWe do not recommend using in the oven.\nPLEASE NOTE: 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed. If you have any concerns with your salt plate or salt plate holder, Charcoal Companion will refund or replace immediately.",
