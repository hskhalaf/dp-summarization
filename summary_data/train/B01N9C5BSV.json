Since using this face butter my skin has cleared up and I even see fine lines disappearing! Just a small amount is needed and it deeply moisturizes, absorbs into the skin well leaving no shine, and feels and smells luxurious.",

A small amount absorbs well and is light enough to wear under makeup while a little more before bed makes me wake up feeling as soft and pampered as if I had a facial the day before.
