This one arrived already warped--the back side of the case had a large bubble/warp, and the home button and camera cover are cheap--the texture of Saran Wrap. Yuck! It's a piece of garbage and returning, but what a waste of energy and time to repackage and drop-off at UPS Store....",

Very disappointed in this product for failing so quickly in a relatively minor short time and in a critical area. Manufacturer needs to exercise better quality control over the products. This problem seems to be an inherent problem, not one caused by use, overuse or abuse. I would really like them to refund by purchase price or, at least, replace the damage item.",

We went with the cheapest color we could find and then ordered a \u201cskin\u201d (decorative removable covering- think contact paper for your phone case) in the color/pattern my dtr wanted. This way she can change it out when she gets bored & we saved some $$ on the case itself. Win/win!",

It can be cleaned with an electronics screen cloth, and the waterproof feature with gasket is a plus. It does take very careful cleaning before installing your phone; otherwise the staticy nature of the plastic will attract dust to the screen. This is really the only problem. Finally the case took too much abuse after nearly two years, and I had to replace it. I would recommend this case highly, still.",

Has a built-in screen protector, which is much better at protecting from scratches than the rubber-to-glass front seal that previous models had. The charging port door/seal seems sturdier and the attached headphone port plug is a big improvement (lost the last one, which was not attached).",

As far as protecting the phone goes, it is durable; however, the transparent screen-cover section scratches quickly/easily (even just being in a pocket with random daily items like keys, pens, etc), degrading your view of the screen. This model fits more \u201cflush\u201d against the screen and fingerprint reader than previous models, which is a big plus. Phone\u2019s ability to read fingerprints through the case is a bit touch-and-go (pun intended?), but this can be remedied easily by re-inputting your fingerprints with the case on.

Also, the laminate material on the home key bubbles and does not lay flat, impeding the use of the fingerprint scanner. Better to go with another company.",
