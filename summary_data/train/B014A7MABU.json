This was the first thing we felt safe putting him in to sleep (in his crib). I know it's not totally recommended but we did do some testing first to make sure he wouldn't couldn't move out of it, and showed the pediatrician as well who agreed it was a safe position. This is the first thing that got him sleeping alone and it's been a dream come true. If something happens to this one I'll certainly buy another.",

      "text": "I could rave over this pillow for paragraphs! I purchased this pillow for my son at 4 months after finding out he loves the one at daycare. All the babies prefer it. He has torticollis (a tight neck muscle causing a left lean of his hed) and this pillow allows him to lay more natural, like being held rather than an infant chair where he slides down. It's firm in support but comfortable like a reclining chair for an adult. It still fits him great at 15lbs, 23 inches (size in picture).",

We did order a second and had an issue with the pillow not expanding completely or appropriately and had to return that one but still have and use the first one.",

We plan on passing it around with our siblings for their newborns. We're at 6 weeks and still using it. Baby likes it better than lying flat on his back, and it's great for daytime napping, or giving the baby a secure perch in bed with a napping, exhausted mom or dad.",
