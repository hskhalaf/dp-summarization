It's very manly and very strong and I am going to have to go wash it off. Total waste. I had used the regular version and it also smells bad, but nothing like this. I was hoping this one would be an improvement. The other version seems to have some small effectiveness, but the smell was irritating so I figured I would give this one a try. I think I will keep looking for a product with a better scent. Thinking it's mostly women using this stuff, so why make it smell so extremely manly?",

      "text": "I have been using this product every day for one month and have noticed a difference. I think it is a combination of stepping up my workout routine, getting a summer tan, and this product, but I think this product is a key factor (as I have worked out my whole life and not noticed any changes in cellulite). Worth the purchase! I don't know if it is scientific at all, but it 'feels' like it is working when it tingles. Also, added bonus, it smells like thin mints!",

But I can tollerate it. If your very sensitive to strong smells, this wouldn't be something you would like. But it does work great!!!! I'm buying more!",

I love the tingling feel,like it is working the minute you put the cream on and then the massager brush just solidifies the whole process. The only thing is just my son & husband ,doesn't like the smell, I love the smell it's like sort of a fresh sea breeze scent and my dimples are becoming less visible, I think..I have never tried others but this one seems to be doing the trick.",

The ingredients and more positive user comments convinced me to try this product instead of the other. I have been using this for just a couple of weeks and I've been told that most people see results after 6-8 weeks. So while I can't claim noticeable results just yet, I can say that the cream/gel goes on very nicely, leaves a wonderfully cool sensation on my legs, smells clean and fabulous, and that my legs feel a bit firmer.",
