Inside temperature is 81 degrees when the unit is running full blast. Update: Just determined by reading the manual that you need to remove the hose to dehumidify. So there\u2019s no easy switching between modes. I specifically got it so I could cool (of course) but also switch quickly in the winter between dehumidify and heat. And, well, now I\u2019m out of luck.",

On the hottest days it can only keep the un-insulated garage in the mid-80's (but dehumidified!) but I don't think there are any 120v units that would do better. I have a in-line current meter and it pulls aroun 1280w when at full tilt. I suspect this unit might be even more effective in heat mode but I haven't verified it yet.",

Our apartment is super comfortable this summer now. We hit 106 several times, and it has been nice to come home knowing it wouldn't be unbearable in our house.
