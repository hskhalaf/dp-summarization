Consistency is key to a stable reef tank, and a refractometer allows you to be consistent with your water changes and monitoring of the salinity by removing the junky improperly calibrated hydrometers from that equation. What convinced me was watching BRS TV (bulk reef supply) do a example of 3 different hydro's... Each was different and each time they checked water, it was different on the same HYDRO! That = terrible for your reef!",
