This makes me uneasy as chipping nonstick can be dangerous, and there are now 6 starting points for additional and expedited chipping to occur.",

Cooking bacon on the stove top is messy, splattering up your stove and countertop, plus it's easy to overcook. Using a microwave seems like the best way, but the steam and grease that eventually clog up your microwave after a few years will ruin it. Not to mention, most microwaves vent the fan through the bottom, which horribly stained my granite countertop...so badly, I now have to keep the microwave in that spot to conceal the stain. Baking your bacon is how the restaurants do it and it works so well. I highly recommend this sheet pan.",

Awesome large size. Terrific value. Wasn\u2019t planning to spend this much but glad I did and worth every penny. We use it for baking frozen foods meant to be fried and meats/veggies that are good grilled when weather is poor for outdoor cooking and pizza. Don\u2019t even actually make cookies. We use the drying rack as a cooking rack. There\u2019s literally nothing you couldn\u2019t use this for that cooks in an oven. I\u2019m most pleased it isn\u2019t staining or getting burn marks!",

I have cooked fish, wings, fries and roasted carrots/potato's/green peppers on this rack and it cleans up like a breeze.

      "text": "We will use this for other dishes, but this is the easiest way for us to cook bacon for our family. I place parchment paper on pan to catch the bacon grease. before placing rack, . This makes the pan even easier to clean. Bacon slices cook easily on rack, fat drains off into pan. No need to turn bacon, it cooks evenly on both sides since it is cooking in hot air instead of a hot solid surface. No burn spots, and no leftovers! The non-stick coating on both the pan and rack, makes for easy cleanup.",
