If you are coming back for a second then don't get this one because it's too small for your (2+) toddler but for any kid younger it's perfect (first time parents, you will be getting a second one, accept it, this one is a great starter). My 2 year old is suffering through scribbling on a mommy-hand sized surface, compared to a daddy one and weirdly doesn't care! Anyway, I've spoken with friends and the general consensus is that kids use these until they break... so make this one your starter because it's great though just a little too small for 3 year olds.",

My 3 year old lost all of them the first time we gave it to her on a plane. The rest of it was good until it broke about 3 weeks in. The handle broke off the magnet so she can\u2019t erase any more.

Every now and then, it will pick the broken piece back up and erase, but it\u2019s very sporadic and my child gets frustrated with it.

All it took was one small fall and the magnet under the screen detached from the eraser, rendering the tablet useless as you can no longer erase anything.",
