      "text": "Good cushioning. I have used it for 5-10k runs and been comfortable the whole way. Removable interior socklet is good for quick drying, Snug fit all the way along. Good cushioning without being too squishy. It also has bluetooth! Sounds like a gimmic but it gives you 12 months VIP on MapMyRun and some decent insights e.g. I know I need to increace my cadence and the app tracks it and reminds me and it correctly anylises my heel striking tendancy. This bluetooth gimic is not worth buying the trainer for alone but is the icing on the cake of a good set of runnners.",

I contacted Under Armour and they said that should not wear that quickly, and if I had bought direct from them they would have given me a full refund. I will be filing for an Amazon return on these.",

The only slight problem I had with them is that the step tracker in them would not work at all! But for me I already have a fitness watch so I wasn't that bothered! If you're buying these shoes because of the step tracking I wouldn't get these because mine didn't work, it wouldn't even sync to my phone. On a comfort level they are excellent, and I love how they look too",
