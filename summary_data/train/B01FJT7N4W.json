Not about the OS which has been updated to N by the way. The performance is great and the battery lasts more than a day. I have about 40% left the next morning after a full day/eve of use. The size of the phone is perfect and feels very natural. I get people asking me what kind of phone is that? I am liking not being part of the Apple/Samsung crowds. People should start doing some research before just getting what everyone else has.",

If you want a more reliable phone, save up for the more pricy phones that Sony does, but this phone is pretty good for the price. The screen has become pretty scratched, but I have not used a screen protector as the market for cases and screen protectors for this phone are very slim and low quality. Camera is very good, but my only stipulation is that it overheats and shuts off after about 5 to 7 minutes of recording.",

      "text": "I got this phone in November and its been fine until today (February)- It has an exclamation point next to the signal (not WiFi) and LTE is now flashing and the battery is rapidly draining. I've restarted the phone, turned on and off data, turned on and off WiFi, etc. but nothing helps. Disappointing for a phone that is over $300, only a few months old and has never been dropped, not even a scratch on it yet.",

Many support softwares, such as z-device-test and MyAndroid, can\u2019t detect the camera info. When i use Antutu, it shows the rear camera is a 8.3 mega pixel camera. Related to the pressure test, i think the phone might be a assembled phone or a personally refurbished phone. The rom is a third-party rom, not the us original version. And the IMEI is worrg too. So i think it might be a assembled phone, and somehow it goes into Amazon factory.",

It's fast as expected, good ram, good processor well it is not the highest one but this deserves it. I'm not a gamer at all I have not experienced by that term. It covers my needs.",

I have to order a pair of earphones separately, apparently disappointed since this is a gift for my mom and I wanted to make it a perfect combo. Also, the phone only works with GSM network which is so annoying, I tried with a verizon SIM card and it didn't work so I think I should warn people since the feedbacks here are all positive.",
