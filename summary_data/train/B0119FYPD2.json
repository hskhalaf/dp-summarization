It does give off a fair amount of heat so having a room where you can vent some of the air is useful, but it's bearable. The only complaint I have is that you have to place the projector pretty far from the screen or wall in order to project a large image. It would be awesome if I could just resize the picture as big as I wanted without having to physically move the projector back. But for the price, this has been perfect for my needs.",

The colors are vibrant, the picture is truly HD (I use the Althaus 4K projector screen fixed) The brightness is incredible and more than perfect with 3300 lumens for any room. Even if you don't have blinds and want to watch a soccer game while your room is bright, you can easily do that. I am so impressed with the ease of use and adjustments. Very glad I purchased this projector. Little hint, if you don't like the fact that there is only one buy this with it for 10 bucks.:",

      "text": "Great projector - bright, affordable, light and has common input/outputs. This is good enough for most non-commercial applications. Keystonining is very easy because the horizontal axis can be controlled with a slider and you can fine tune both axises with the keystone button. The projector also auto-keystones when you move it which can be good or bad depending on the situation. However, I think this function is useful to most people. Also, the built in speaker is surprisingly loud. The only downside of the projector is it runs really hot and the fan is somewhat loud. However, I expected a lot worse for a projector of this size and price.",

      "text": "Purchased one for a small classroom in a normal fluorescent light setting. Setting is very easy and can be done in a few minutes (depending on how much you want to set) The projector was mounted on the ceiling using a universal mount from the previous projector (Boxlight) Colors are projected vividly on a screen even under fluorescent light and natural light combined. Fan noise is quite minimal and does not interfere with our activities (watching a short video clips or presentation) Overall, the projector was a good choice for our use considering its cost and performance.",

The picture quality is amazing even in a brightly lit room. In my opinion, it's no louder than my older projector and an overall decent price for the quality you get for this unit. This was one purchase I've been saving up for and I am so glad that I found it. If you are looking for a similar projector, don't go for any lower models than this one to save a few bucks. Spend the little extra for this one and you won't regret it!",
