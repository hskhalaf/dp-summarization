    "description": "Item Package Quantity:1For white dogs and cats, finding a gentle shampoo that will cleanse, moisturize and brighten without the use of harsh ingredients is challenging. Snow White Shampoo is specially formulated for pets with white coats to effectively remove stains and coat yellowing without using bleach or peroxide. Patented optical brighteners safely eliminate the appearance of yellowing and dingy fur while bringing out your pet\u2019s natural bright white coat. Making you and your once not-so-white dog or cat very happy! The gentle coconut-oil based cleansers in the 17 oz. bottle of Veterinary Formula Solutions Snow White Shampoo will leave your pet\u2019s coat clean, fresh, moisturized and shiny. The mild shampoo contains Vitamin E and green tea extract, and is pH balanced specifically for your pet\u2019s skin. The exceptional long-lasting blue coral citrus fragrance has patented fragrance extenders so your clean and white pet will smell amazing long after bath time is over. It is gentle enough for frequent use and will not wash away topical spot-on flea and tick treatments. For best results, follow bath with Veterinary Formula Ultra Oatmeal Moisturizing Conditioner and finish with our Gloss and Glide Detangler and Conditioner Spray. Safe for horses too. We know that your dogs and cats are more than just pets - they are part of the family - so Veterinary Formula Solutions designs premium cleansing products that pet parents can actually afford. Your pet will once again have a bright, white coat and you will like knowing that no harsh ingredients were used to get it that way \u2013 making you both happy and able to focus on more important things like snuggles, games and treats.",
