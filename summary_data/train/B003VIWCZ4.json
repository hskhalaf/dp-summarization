I'm contacting amazon in hopes for a replacement, but I'm not sure what the warranty is on an item like this. I've only had the item since Mid February 2015.",

I haven't noticed any filling come out but the baffles are clearly not constructed well. It starts to get lumpy and uncomfortable after washing it. Time to find something new.",

I was concerned about the regular queen size completely covering her bed but she insisted that was what she wanted, so that is what I ordered. It turns out (not for the first time) that she was correct and the standard queen size fits her bed and her duvet perfectly. She told me that is was light AND warm. She is very happy. If I ever need one for myself, I will order this one.",

It will surely flatten out over time (as they all seem to.) This may be the best value I've received from an online purchase in a long time - don't hesitate to try this duvet out.",

It's nice and light weight enough for Southern California summer nights but add another blanket and it will be perfect for cooler temps as well. It's super fluffy and as the other reviews state, it came that way right out the box unlike others. The only thing I should mention is that it is definately not as \"oversized\" as the picture may seem but it does fit a pillow-top queen nicely - maybe 6-8\" of overhang.",

We were wanting fluffy and comfortable, something to snuggle into - this is great for a first-time, non-experienced duvet buyer. The only issue is that it seems a little too small for the cover we purchased, but by no means the fault of either seller - I should have paid better attention to measurements. The insert doesn't fill the cover entirely, and maybe it shouldn't. Anyway, love it!!",

It is so fluffy and soft, I feel like I'l laying under a much more expensive blanket. I also really like the subtle stripes, they give it more of a polished look. I definitely recommend.",

I ordered the oversized king and it is very full in size--fully covers the bed with a decent amount of overhang.
