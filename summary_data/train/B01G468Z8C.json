My and husband and I would pick her up from daycare and her little armpits would have an odor of musk which we thought was unusual because of her age, so we made a Doctor appointment with her pediatrician and he said its normal, which was a relief. The doctor told her to get a natural deodorant without fragrance so we came across Fresh Kidz and we love it!! We put a small amount under her arms at night and in the morning and we don't have that issue of smelly armpits anymore.",

She also did not like using a roll on though I felt like it dried fairly quickly. I think I will try a different brand next time for her but overall think it's a nice product.",

It smells great and very girly and my daughters no issues with her sensitive skin while using this. The price kills me but other than that it is amazing and because of that I will continue to buy this for my daughter.",
