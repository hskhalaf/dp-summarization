This product was a little to large for her legs as we had to tighten them all the way and sometimes the velcro would release due to pressure and not alot of hold. I tried it out, it is a great product. Really compresses your legs to hit pressure points and releases at intervals that really relieves pain. Would definetly buy another for a family or friend",

My lymphedema massage therapist recommended a machine that was bulky and to cumbersome, and there was the uncertainty of whether or not my health insurance would cover it. This was worth every penny for me. I use it when I go to bed, and its it's safe to use because it shuts off after 20 minutes. I usually do two rotations. In the morning, my legs feel lighter, look great, and I am ready to face the day. Thank you Fit King!",

The foot area and the calf area have massive adjustments via the velcro, and all you do is make them bigger than you would expect. Easy fix. I have poor circulation to my feet and 1-2 cycles with these and they feel great again. Pretty decent for this price point. If they are too tight for you (you will know right away) just open the velcro up until the pressure intensity is to your liking.",

I've been using at bedtime and the Fit King does provide symptom relief such that I can go to sleep sooner and sleep a bit sounder. I'm having trouble, though, trying to figure out how to alter the product to accommodate my larger feet. The \"cut sewing lines\" instructions do not yet make sense to me. I'm reluctant to cut. Until I can figure that out I believe there will be too much pressure on my feet which is quite uncomfortable. It would have helped if the manual were written by someone better acqainted with the English language.",

In the end, it's all about the patient and in our case, my Dad has found relief using the massager. I can visibly see pressure in the veins is being released.",

The sound is a bit high when you use and it\u2019s a bit bulky so have to pack it after use but that\u2019s not the reason I bought it. I bought it to get relief in my feet and legs and that it took care of from the very first use",
