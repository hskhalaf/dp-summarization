I have owned every ThinkPad since the T20 and still have working T40p and a T61p. Gone are most of the things that made this a great laptop. The build quality is mediocre and the trackpad is shot, and the keyboard...well that is destroyed as well. Skip this as a purchase.",

      "text": "Im Chinese, I tried to love my own nation's brand, but I have to say fairly that, I bought a lenovo, not a thinkpad any more. It gives me a different feeling from my old IBM thinkpad. It looks much more like Dell or HP if you cover the logo of \"thinkpad\" with one of your fingers. But still, as a lenovo product, it works well. Just no more that feeling, that I could work another 10 years with it, never perish..... I am just curious if you guys who bought Mac, is it just because thinkpad is not that good and you don't have other choice for a well-built pc?",

Absolute worst experience trying to scroll / right click or even just click on stuff. There is just one square and it will frustrate the heck out of you when you try to get things done!! Stay very far away from this one and get other models which have better trackpads.",

The change in the keyboard/trackpad configuration makes the 540 nigh-impossible to use comfortably. They've gotten rid of the independent buttons for mouse pointer and trackpad, both, instead forcing users to click, HARD, on the trackpad itself even if they're using the pointer mouse on the keyboard. That, combined with the fact that they've moved the trackpad away from the center and into a weird, uncomfortable location on the left, makes the 540 series very, very difficult to use without plugging in an external mouse.",

The startup of this laptop is much better than the w520 due to solid state disk. Con The w520 had a great keyboard, this has a terrible one, with reorganized keys for extra confusion. Beyond terrible trackpad, you need to use it with a mouse. Too much finger resistance and too much force required to click. Real productivity killer. No charging LEDs. This means you do not know if it is actually charging unless you start it up. This is a real pain in hotels in the developing world.",

The entire button depresses, and it depresses so much that you'll get tracking errors. The \"MultiTouch\" features built in are nearly useless as well, due to all the tracking errors, ignored input, and poor surface texture. This is probably also the thickest, heaviest, flimsiest \"mobile workstation\" your boss will ever buy for the poor non-management types who don't rate a decent laptop.
