      "text": "I bought this item as a gift for a family member. I usually use Noga deburring tools, but went a little bit cheap and got burned. The first time i went to use it, the retaining collar fell off. I called Vargus (the parent company) about the warranty to get an exchange and inquire about the warranty (missing form their packaging, documentation and website). I was told by Vargus that i have to go through Amazon. Amazon only has a 30 day return period. So apparently the warranty from Vargus is only 30 days.",

    "title": "SHAVIV 90094 Mango II Deburring Tool Kit M With Mango II Handle (8 Pieces)",
    "description": "The SHAVIV 151-90094 Mango II Deburring Tool Kit M includes one Mango II handle, one M blade holder, three B-series blades, and three E-series blades for long-reach deburring of hole edges and straight edges. The Mango II handle has an ergonomic design for comfort and control. The M blade holder is for long-reach work and holds SHAVIV B- and E-series blades.\n\nThe kit contains one each of B10, B20, and B30 high-speed steel blades. The B10 blade is designed for deburring straight edges and hole edges on steel, aluminum, copper, and plastic. The B20 blade is designed for deburring straight edges and hole edges on brass, cast iron, and plastic, and rotates clockwise as well as counterclockwise. The B30 blade simultaneously deburrs the inside and outside of holes up to 0.16\" thick on steel, aluminum, copper, and plastic.\n\nThe kit also contains one each of E100, E111, and E200 high-speed steel blades. The E100 blade is designed for deburring straight edges and hole edges on steel, aluminum, copper, and plastic. The E111 blade is designed for deburring straight edges and edges of holes with a minimum 0.06\" diameter on steel, aluminum, copper, and plastic. The E200 blade is designed for deburring straight edges and hole edges on brass, cast iron, and plastic. It rotates clockwise as well as counterclockwise.\n\nDeburring cutters are hand tools used to remove sharp edges and small unwanted bumps, also known as burrs, from material. The cutter typically consists of two pieces: a handle and a blade. The handle holds a blade that is typically made from high-speed steel, carbide, or ceramic, and may have a coating to extend its life or for work on tougher materials. The blades have different designs for deburring in a range of applications, such as straight edges, hole edges, through-holes, slots, and corners. A blade holder can be connected to a handle to hold the blade for long-reach work.\n\nVargus manufactures cutting, grooving and deburring tools under the Vardex, Groovex, and SHAVIV brand names. The company, founded in 1960 and headquartered in Nahariya, Israel, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 9001:2000.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n * (1) Mango II handle\n * (1) M blade holder\n * (1) B10 blade\n * (1) B20 blade\n * (1) B30 blade\n * (1) E100 blade\n * (1) E111 blade\n * (1) E200 blade",
