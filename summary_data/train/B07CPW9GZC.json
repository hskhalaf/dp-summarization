If I press on the ball fairly hard with my thumb its almost bearable tracking, but that defeats the purpose. Trying to target a particular cell of a large spreadsheet or a particular section of text to cut and paste is nearly impossible. (Yes I've taken ball out and cleaned and looked for debris on the sensor lens, with no improvement.) Mash ball... finally line up with submit button.. go.",

Also tried the Elecom which was too glitchy for me. This one works well, the only negative is the body was a little large to begin with but after a couple of days I got used to it. I will not be returning this one !!!",
