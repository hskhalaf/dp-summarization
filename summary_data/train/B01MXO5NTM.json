Cons; None whatsoever, everyone is jealous of my cotton candy machine. :D",

The machine is louder than i expected too. It is a nice lil machine it was super simple to put together right out the box. But it is just so slow. Im going to make a video today and post it.

It broke only after a few uses, hard to use, hard to clean etc. I bought this one due to the appearance, weight and size (easy to store). It works very well. I actually use the cone shape holders versus the ones that come with it as it is easier to hold cotton candy onto the cone. I also love the suction cups on bottom to hold it in place. I have used it 3 times and the kids (6 and 7) love doing their own cotton candy. I bought this for a few play-dates in July 2020 and this will be a hit.",

The sticks that come with the machine are a little annoying when the cotton candy becomes bigger, it gets harder to spin so I would suggest buying or making your own paper cones so that the floss has something better to grab onto. The sticks do come in handy because you have to break off the sugar stuck to the sides after every other round of sugar. Let the machine heat up for 5-10 minutes.",
