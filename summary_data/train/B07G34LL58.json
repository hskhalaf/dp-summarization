Even though they are very controllable, she is still flying forward with nothing between her and any obstacle!",

So if you hit anything taller than small pebble, the wheel stops! You can kinda make it over small bumps if you take it carefully like a speedbump, but it is risky. That stated.. I got to ride these for a week in an empty office building, and they are WONDERFUL if you have lots of sq/ft of open space. Easy to learn, easy to control.. yeah.. just don't take them outside where you might come across a rogue acorn.",

Wish I could trade them for a onebot. Don't even waste your money on these things. Choose a different segway product.",

Sometimes I have no issues, other times... the skates seem like they want to eat the rug, and I go flying. Totally worth it though!",

The other HUGE issue... couldn't ride down sidewalk, because every small crack they jarred abruptly shifting my weight causing me to have to jump off. Didnt even give them an hour of my time. Packed right back up and sent back. ONLY MEANT FOR SMOOTHE SURFACES and probably teens or people with less than average body builds.",
