The other is the caps are a bit of a nuisance to deal with when trying to reattach to the bottom. They're meant to fit only one way and I find them dropping off constantly because I didn't get it right the first time. Other than that it's a recommended buy from here.",

Yesterday, the pepper grinder just sort of disintegrated all over my eggs! I am so disappointed that they only lasted such a short time. Is there any kind of warranty on these? Love these salt n pepper battery operated grinders. Using the salt n pepper grinders is awesome! So much easier than all the twisting and grinding. I bought some Himalayan Pink salt on Amazon and had peppercorns in my pantry. Easy to fill and wonderful to use. Highly recommend! Would make an awesome gift!!",

I removed and reset the batteries several times, but no joy.....it simply doesn't work anymore. Looks like there is some corrosion in the battery compartment, likely from cheap metals. If it's to be used in the kitchen, while cooking (which generally generated steam) it needs to have more corrosion resistant components. It looks nice.... but It grinds too slowly, and the battery issue makes it a no-go for me. I like products DESIGNED to last a lifetime.....and this isn't it.",

The pepper stopped working all together despite using new batteries. The products we\u2019re about six months old. I reached out to the manufacture (Latent). Without even asking they quickly replaced the product with a new set. I really love the design and durability. They don\u2019t have the best battery life and you always want to make sure you use brand new batteries but overall I am very happy with this product. Furthermore, very pleased with the communication from the customer service team.",

Simply twist and remove the top, drop in the 4 AAs, and replace the top with a twist - easy squeezy. The adjustment for coarse/fine grinds is easy to understand and use.
