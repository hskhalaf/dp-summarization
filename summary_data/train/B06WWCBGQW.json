I usually play games to the 100% quest mark and to do that with this game, you constantly have to protect your fortresses by playing siege missions. It gets old fast. I also wasn't a fan of the micro transactions they have for loot boxes. You don't have to buy them to beat the game but you do have to collect enough miren to get more captains later which can be done in normal game play. It just felt like gambling when you had to use the loot boxes.",

However, I quickly lost interest as the late game was very tedious and seemed pointless. Why search for a perfect Uruk when in order to get him, I have to ruin him in the process? That and I kill/lose some many of the buggers that the names etc keep repeating and I dont develop any emotional ties to them. I hate to say it and I didnt believe it at first when everyone was complaining about it, but the fact of the matter is that loot boxes ruined this game.",

This gold edition is fairly cool because it comes with a steelbook. It's a steelbook with a cardboard-like sleeve. It's not good of a steelbook as the Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2 steelbooks, but it's still a steelbook version that has some cool-looking artwork on it. Would definitely recommend as the best value for the game if you want the game + all the DLC in one package. The DLC comes with a voucher (which is never good, DLC ought to be on disc), so get it new.",

Only problem is that monolith kind of spoiled a huge portion of the game with their endless advertisement and non stop gameplay reveals before the games release.",

      "text": "I played through Shadow Of Mordor a number of times, trophy hunted it, and basically bled it dry for everything it was worth! I loved that game and now as I am chugging through Shadow of War I notice all the little things that were lacking in Shadow Of Mordor being put to rest and changed or evolved to be far beyond my expectations! Shadow Of War is, to say the least, BIGGER, better, more comprehensive, smoother, deeper in story, and endlessly fresh. In summary I recommend this to any lover of Middle Earth Lore, player of Shadow Of Mordor, or gamer looking for a fresh and very enjoyable RPG experience.",

For those people on the fence about whether this is a true sequel for just a remake with a few changed mechanics. Let me tell you, you are wrong. Almost every system has improved while still adding more mechanics that just make the experience grand. I can't even finish this review I have to start playing again.",
