An excellent product not only for its symptoms relief but the information for an advanced treatment regimen is most helpful. I am now two weeks using this ointment. Now an advancement of the treatment regimen must occur. I have partial relief with no signs this is going away anytime soon. I am most willing to follow well detailed instructions in order to effect healing. This is a most uncomfortable disorder of the skin, internal vascular structures, and rectal opening. I feel as though following all recommendations provided with ointment I will heal. Wow.",

I am doing sitz baths after going to the bathroom, which does help, then I apply the cream. The pain relief is very short-lived-like it wants to help, but just can't quite get there. My doctor has now prescribed Nifedipine. I will give it a 3-week trial, and if it doesn't work, I will be seeing a colorectal surgeon. I think Dr. Butler's Hemorrhoid and Anal Fissure Cream may work for those who have less severe cases than mine.",

The product has provided me with instant pain relief and seems to coat the area for many hours. Because it is a soft but thick ointment, it doesn't drip or stain garments. I heartily recommend Doctor Butler's Hemorrhoid & Fissure Ointment.",
