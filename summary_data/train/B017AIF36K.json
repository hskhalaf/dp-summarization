My dream magazine basket would be just like this but not so tall, so that the really cute file folders could be seen better poking out the top. But this is still very attractive AND very functional. It is really easy to lift because of the handles and is very sturdily constructed. It holds a lot of file folders and looks fashionable sitting out on the counter.",
