I have no problem with cords and hate running out of battery power on a cordless. Also the rechargeable batteries add alot of weight. This is a great saw for the money and it does everything it should, so far.",

If you unscrew the big plastic \"knob\" on the side to clean out debris, the chain and bar are going to fall off. This is a pain because now you have to balance everything together to get it reassembled without dropping it in the dirt. This is probably a product of the \"automatic chain tensioner\" system, but it just seems like it could have been handled better.",

Also don't have to worry bout gas sitting in carb to long or trying to pull start it in the. Old. It's always ready to go. Another awesome feature is the auto chain tensioner.

Otherwise this had a lot of the similar features, like the metal spikes, 18\u201d bar, and the amount of power. If you occasionally need a chainsaw, this is a good one to get.",

The WORX exclusive, patented tool-free chain replacement and auto-tensioning system eliminates the headaches faced with most other chain saws. You don't need to be a lumberjack to operate a chainsaw. The auto-tension system includes a single, oversized knob that secures the bar and chain and maintains proper tension during operation-automatically. The WORX auto-tensioning system also works to extend bar and chain life by eliminating any chance of over-tightening. What's more, all-metal dogs at the base of the long, 18-inch bar help add stability during cutting, while an easy-to-lubricate sprocket on the bar nose helps preserve the life of the tool. Powerful enough for your toughest jobs, the WORX electric chain saws produce anywhere from 4.0 peak horsepower. The WORX 18-Inch chainsaw also offers gas-free, hassle-free operation. Different from gas-powered chain saws, our electric chain saw doesn't require you to mix oil and gas or deal with difficult startups.

Additionally, a rubber over-molded rear handle and ergonomic full-wrap front handle provide optimum operator control and comfort. POINTS TO REMEMBER: 1) Remove oil cap and immediately restore it after operation. This relieves any pressure during the oiling process. 2) Allow the saw to cool down before storing. 3) Remove oil from saw before storage. 4) Wipe down the saw sprocket area 5) Use only enough oil for the task at hand\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nThe WORX WG304.1 18-inch Chain Saw is a robust and lightweight power tool that is perfect for quick, easy jobs around your yard or farm, such as cutting firewood, clearing brush, trimming trees, and more.
