The morning system could be more flexible. The bar itself is pretty heavy, so you need to mount it in studs.

That is not the case. This sound bar will only sync sound properly in Dolby Digital mode with the newest, Q series Samsung TVs. Other tvs will have to be switched to stereo, defeating the purpose of buying a high-end soundbar. I'm utterly disappointed, and expected better from Samsung. I'm now stuck choosing between inferior sound or a small delay between the image and the audio. Might as well have bought a cheaper soundbar from a different company.",

I paid over $400 to be disappointed with the Samsung Q60R 5.1 soundbar and woofer. The sound blinks often while watching movies and while streaming music, and in between blinks the treble/bass balance changes on its own as if it goes from full sound to partial sound, again and again, then the sound pauses for a second in time, then resumes, all on its own. No sound consistency at all. So glad I held on to the box, since receiving it one week ago.",

If they added in an option to further boost the volume of the satellite speakers independently from the main soundbar, this may be fixed.

      "text": "Been thinking about buying a soundbar for a while, and did a lot of research before buying this. So glad I did! Subwoofer is awesome - because you don't normally hear it. It isn't obnoxious or over done. But you'll notice it during a dramatic part of a movie - I swear you'll feel it more than hear it. Starting a movie on Netflix - even the quick Netflix bum-bump is awesome. Literally get excited for the movie just off that feel. Music sounds great, but there is something about movies that are so different with this system. So happy I am now going to invest in the rear speakers too.",

The frustrating issue is that once in a while the TV remote cannot control the soundbar volume anymore (even if the TV shows it as the current sound output device), until I press the input-select button on the soundbar and cycle to the same position (i.e. \u201cD.IN\u201d again). Probably a firmware bug that Samsung should definitely fix as soon as possible.",

I think it sounds best with the center channel boosted slightly and the left and right channels set to -1. My room (and wife) wouldn't tolerate actual rear speakers, so I knew I couldn't get real surround sound, but this gives me what I need, loud, accurate reproduction with a full frequency response.
