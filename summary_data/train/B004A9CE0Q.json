The metal however is pretty thin so as a stand alone piece it looks good, but may not stand up to much abuse. I would also recommend purchasing a cover or drill a small hole to let the water escape so it doesn't rust. I still think it's a good value and I would buy it again.",

After reading other negative reviews of this, I can definitely understand where most folks are coming from with the thinness but for $69 bucks its a good deal. I would suggest for others considering this product, don't have a high intensity fire for hours on end with this particular pit as it is not a thick cast iron and will corrode through. But it's perfect patio fire pit to relax and have a glass of wine by with friends and family or to roast marshmallows with the kids.",
