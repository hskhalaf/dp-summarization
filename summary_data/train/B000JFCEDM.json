Be sure to consider the weight of an object as well as the temperature. If you are dealing with heavy, very hot objects you might do better with leather welding gloves and an additional thermal pad. I was not surprised that there was only one glove but I was surprised that the max temp is rated at only 480 F. There are other gloves which are rated to almost 1,000 F. You might consider those if you do a lot of work with hot objects which are also heavy. I got what I paid for and am satisfied.",

Which I suppose is beneficial for some (pro basketball players, Samoans, etc) but for an average adult hand, expect a loose fit. And for a small handed man or a woman... expect it to be too cumbersome to be useful. There should be sizes offered. Granted, I didn't actually try it on, for concern that if I took it apart from the packaging I may not be able to return it. Maybe if I put it on it would surprise me and fit like a glove?",

So far holding up very well, a little dirty, but no tears, frets or melting after 3 months of continuous use",

The surface of the glove itself gets quite warm if you're handling hot pans, but your hand won't sense it. As you may have guessed, the shiny elements seen in the photo are grips--in this case, they're very grippy. The sleeve or cuff (whatever you call it) also serves to protect your arm from heat and burns. It's way better than using a potholder or mitt when retrieving pans from the oven or holding a saucepan's handle. I absolutely recommend getting at least one of these gloves for anyone that cooks at all.",

It is so much easier handling hot trays or bake ware wearing these gloves compared to a conventional oven mitt or thicker silicone pot holders, much better feel of handles etc. The gloves are extended in the wrist giving additional heat protection against you contacting another oven rack or the side of the oven. I also used these to empty the charcoal bricketts from the starter to my Weber BBQ. These gloves give me great confidence when handling hot items with their grippy surface on the fingers and palms, which is on both sides so you dont have to worry about which glove goes on what hand.",

It is perfect for indoor or outdoor use, for the oven, grill, Stovetop & the barbecue.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nHeat Resistant Fireplace and Barbecue Pit Mitt is flexible, provides all fingers grip, can withstand extreme heat and even an occasional flame. Perfect for indoor or outdoor use, for the oven, grill, stovetop, barbecue. Made of Aramid on the exterior and double knit cotton on the interior, this mitt fits like a glove. Do not uses wet as water would transmit heat to the inside of the glove. Aramid is a man made textile with amazing heat protection characteristics. It is used by race car drivers, astronauts, fire fighters as well as jet fighter pilots whose survival depends not only on skills, but also proper equipment. Although aramid could burn when a flame is held up to it, the glove will stop burning as soon as the heat source is removed, which illustrate its flame resistant property. Aramid arranged in a thick woven structure is also a poor conductor of heat, which makes it the perfect oven glove material. Machine washable, dry flat, do not bleach.",
