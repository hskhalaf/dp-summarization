I borrowed one of these jackets from a friend to wear over my wetsuit and it makes all the difference! The sleeves fit snugly, which helps to keep me warm. I imagine that you could wear this alone in warmer water conditions. These jackets run very small. Based on the borrowed jacket I bought a size 12, which is quite snug. For reference, I normally wear a size 8 (small) 34D bra, so you might want to size up.",

I lost a dress size this summer walking in the pool for 60-90 minutes a day. I didn't want to lose the momentum this winter and this jacket will help me do just that!

I'm a small person 5'2\" 105lbs usually wear a 2/4 in clothing. Ordered a 6. The forearms did feel a little tight when I tried it dry. I will probably order an 8 to try but didn't have time then. I packed it and thought I'd give it to my daughter if it was tight. I put it on for snorkeling in San Juan and never really thought about it being tight. Was so glad I had it!!! It feels so well made and doesn't restrict my movement. I love it!",
