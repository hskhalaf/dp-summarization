I told them I needed the 9.5 and returned the shoes. I received another pair of 9's in the mail, I didn't even try them on as they were exactly same as what I had returned. I returned them and again stated I needed larger size and received word today that another pair of size 9's (replacement) are being sent. Somehow I need to derail this and get the refund as I went out and bought a pair that actually fit.",

Please note, these are best for regular width feet. I have wide feet and I've slightly rolled my ankle twice within a month of regular play. Very infrequent but something to keep in mind. Overall a super well built, stylish pair of shoes!",
