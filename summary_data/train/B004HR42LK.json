After assembly I could not disconnect the top rails without a tool, so the next time I assembled, I simply didn't twist the bars to allow the clips to engage: still stable, yet ready for quick disassemby. Tough to beat at this price. Simple, clean stand - even more useful after a couple tweaks.",

This is definitely NOT a commercial grade unit and it's not advertised as such. But for home use or occasional client jobs, it works perfectly. I was able to do a few head shots at a client location twice and I have zero complaint. You are not going to get anything better for this price. Eventually I'm going to look into converting the two studs (M10 threading by the way) on the top of each stand into something for a light stand.",

      "text": "I love this backdrop kit. I needed something inexpensive that would hold a simple backdrop and this works perfectly. It's made of metal and the legs are sturdy. It's easily adjustable and can be taken apart quickly, fitting perfectly into the carrying case for storage. This was a good purchase and I'm glad I didn't waste my money on a more expensive kit because it wasn't necessary. This one gets the job done.",

My only concern with this stand is that the legs slip easily on smooth surfaces & cause the stand to be lop-sided on either side if the backdrop is too heavy. I used a 10x12' black muslin backdrop for a Photo Booth & had to keep checking the legs to make sure they weren't slipping even though I tightened everything. Muslin cloth is relatively lightweight, but the next go-around I'll probably invest in a little more sturdy backdrop with weighted & anti-slip legs.",

Value for money - maybe, you get what you pay for. For the odd job its fine but don't expect it to last. Once those paying jobs start coming in, I would upgrade.",
