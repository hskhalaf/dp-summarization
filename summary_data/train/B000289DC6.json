I read many reviews where people had issues screwing the speakers to the stands, and having to bend the brackets. I did not bother. I attached the speakers with the 3M tape that comes in the box, and the hold will suffice (pictures attached). I'm very pleased with the stands. Definitely recommend them.",

That said, the construction was good and yes, they are stylish. Being able to fit the cables down the center of the extendable tube was nice, and there is a notch in the stand base for the cable.

Assembly was easy and although the speakers I bought didn't have a mounting screw, I was able to adapt their wall mounts to hold these speakers with no issue. They have a decent weight and feel sturdy. The speakers I have are very light, but I think these would be stable with some heavier speakers. I like the fact that you can run the wires through the base, pole, and mount. I'm running 14-guage wire and there were no issues with getting it run through the stand.",

      "text": "If you have the Vizio soundbar 5.1 speaker system and just trying to find a compatible stand... you have come to the right place. The Vizio speaker cord ends are uniquely shaped, which makes it impossible to insert into the poles of the stand. Thankfully they fit just fine through these stands. You will need to stretch out the metal brackets at the top but it's easy to do with your hands. If you kept the speaker screws that came with your Vizio then those are perfect, otherwise hopefully you have some spare screws that may fit.The ones that come with the stands won't work. Heavy base is great and they're sturdy stands. I'm very happy.",

I had to bend them to make them work, ALSO if you plan of using it with the Vizio SB3851-C0 you cannot use the screws that came with the speaker stands....luckily I kept the screws that came with my Vizio speakers and they obviously fit.",

The stands are hollow so you can hide the speaker wire. The height is easily adjustable with no tools. The only reason I took off 1 star is because they don't offer many different mounting options. The included mounts work fine for the speakers above, but they might not work for all satellite speakers depending on the size, shape and location of the screw-holes. The stands are metal, with a heavy base, so they should be strong enough to support most satellite speakers.",

And last, the most important feature, and the reason they don't work with my speakers: Speakers must be mounted on the back and not the bottom!!!",

The Vizio speaker wire connector is a bit wider than the space in the stand allows for, but I followed advice in another post and just spread the stand connector a tiny bit. The shorter stand connector was just the right height to reach the screw holes provided on the back of the Vizio speakers.",
