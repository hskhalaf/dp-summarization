So I wiped down parts using rubbing alcohol and a micro towel. Let it dry. Then used 3 light coats and waiting 30 minutes on a hot 80 degree day out in sun. And after 5 coats and 2 clear coats and now 2600 miles on parts after shadow the chrome it is still stuck on there and been in rain and washed and pressure washed I am greatly surprised that it staying on chrome. Now I can black out more parts on motorcycle",

I still installed the pieces and it looks pretty good. I don't regret doing it. Just wish the up close look of it didn't show traces of lint or dirt.",

I dod this on a Krapkuran part as their chrome is not meant to be outside at all. Kuryakyn = Krapkuran, guess it should be Krapkuryakyn.",

If you buy this product be sure to completely take off the wheel before applying and lay the wheel flat before spraying, it is very runny and does not set very well at all. Once it finally sets its a complete mess on your chrome wheels, I am going to go over it with plasti-dip and to cover up the mess this product has created. Once again, you get what you pay for.
