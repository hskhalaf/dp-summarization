      "text": "Ive always had great results with POR15, the can of white engine enamel I got today however did not seem like POR15. Very watery even after repeated stirs scraping the bottom. Tried to use it, but since it wasn't going on like it should (and cured POR15 is near indestructable) I've already slathered it with aircraft stripper. Guessing it was old product, but the can looked new, not like it was sitting on a shelf for years. 5 stars for past experience, but 0 stars for this can. Bad math means I give it a 4 star. POR15 is amazing, might get a new can elsewhere - or just forget about it all together.",

I've spent several weeks cleaning the block to get caked-on oil, grease, and road grime off of it. Finally scrubbing with carb cleaner, then Scrubbing Bubbles, and finishing with isopropyl alcohol. The color is exactly what I wanted, and even though brushed on the paint levels very nicely. Time will tell for durability. Update: over a year later and still looking great and winning trophys! Had two small chips from handling that touched-up perfectly. MG Maroon engine in dark emerald green metalic bike works well.",

      "text": "The color swatch on the advertisement and on the can appears more Red than Chevy Orange however the paint is quite orange. As a matter of fact probably more orange than the VHT version of \"Chevy Orange\". ( Not a great match since the VHT is more Red ). Paint flows out nicely on the block and dries to a durable glossy finish. Getting a similarly acceptable finish on the oil pan was a bit more challenging. A wet finish caused some runs and a dry finish left some brush marks. Overall I think this will work well on the block and seems tough enough to last a while.",

More than enough paint to do two engines. I did clean the engine well, primed it with duplicolor etching primer. Great adhesion and great coverage. POR 15 also offers a great prep chemical but I had already primed the engine prior to my decision to use this product. Technical support said the etching primer would be just fine.",

I was initially concerned that a pint would be too small, but it was more than plenty for me to paint the whole block, heads, and oil pan. I think it looks way better than I could have gotten with a spray can, and if it holds up like the rust sealer stuff they sell, it is going to look good for a long time.",
