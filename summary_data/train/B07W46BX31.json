So it did not live up to two of the claims that NOCO represents this charger with. I'm going to keep it anyway. I also think these are overpriced for what they are. Just my opinion.",

This is why the alternator might maintain current but never fully charges the battery. This is ideal by very slowing bringing the battery to full charge.

After a week of no use, it had drained to 12.4. After a 20 Mike drive the battery displayed 12.6 volts. That result has been consistent.
