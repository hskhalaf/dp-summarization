I tried the glue trick and it helped a little but the zipper lets out a ton of light which I can\u2019t glue obviously.

It is of decent quality but its useless if the Tent only goes partway up the poles. Manufacturing issues with the product.",

      "text": "Excellent tent. I paid under $130 at time of purchase. Great quality and easy to set up. Lots of accessibility, especially if you SCROG. Just make sure you check that the contents are complete. It's big, so have plenty of space. The quickest way to get it started for set up, is look for the bottom, where the Velcro vents flaps are, and square that out. From the bottom, set up the frame inside and work your way up. There's a soda bottle in the corner of the attached picture for size reference. To utilze the space better and have even coverage, I used 2 600w lights, rather than 1 1200w light. Happy growing.",

      "text": "The tent material is good quality and the framework is adequate. The issue is that the package was missing three corner pieces and unfortunately, because I didn't need the grow tent until this weekend I didn't unpack and check the contents. Sure enough, when I laid everything out I was missing the three corner pieces. Sadly though, My return window had expired three days ago, so now I am stuff with a incomplete tent put together with bits of lumber and duct tape. Pretty disappointed.",
