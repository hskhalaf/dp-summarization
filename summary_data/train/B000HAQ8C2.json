The Canon SD40 is small, sleek, and takes excellent pictures when it's sunny out. I'm especially pleased with the super-simple slider that lets me switch between picture-taking, video-capturing, and viewing modes. This camera is a winner!",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD40 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 2.4x Optical Zoom (Twilight Sepia)",
    "description": "Color:Twilight sepiaFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nA joy to use and a joy to posses, the Canon PowerShot SD40 digital camera takes its design cues directly from its predecessor, the SD 30. This new SD40 Digital Elph is compact and luxurious, and is available in Precious Rose, Twilight Sepia, Noble Blue, and Olive Grey color schemes. \n\n7.1 Million Pixels\nThe PowerShot SD40 features a 7.1-million-pixel CCD sensor. This high-resolution imager ensures every picture will have excellent detail, even when printed large or cropped. \n\nDIGIC III Image Processor\nTakes the performance and speed of DIGIC II to even higher levels of processing power including new face-detection function, up to 1600 speed ISO, high-ISO noise reduction, lower power consumption, increased speed for SD media cards, and higher resolution image processing for enhanced LCD viewing. \n\nFace-Priority AF/AE\nIntelligent Face-Priority AF mode reliably detects faces and focuses on them. It detects three faces when shooting in standby, and up to nine when shutter button is pressed halfway. When faces are detected the exposure is also biased for proper facial illumination while maintaining overall scene brightness. \n\n3:2 Guide and Widescreen Mode\nHelpful 3:2 guide masks the LCD screen to reveal the printable area of a standard 4 x 6-inch print. Also, capture still images in a 16:9 aspect ratio to view on widescreen computer monitors and televisions. \n\nCamera Station\nBundled with the SD40, the Camera Station enables several useful functions including battery charging, image downloading to PC, printing, and viewing on a television. The bundle even comes with a wireless remote controller for viewing pictures on a television set. \n\nMy Category \nImproves playback experience by allowing user to put images into seven categories: People, Scenery, Events, Category 1-3, or To Do. With My Category deleting and protecting images has never been easier. \n\nDirect Printing\nFeatures Direct Print button and exclusive printing menu for simplified printing with any PictBridge-enabled printer.",
