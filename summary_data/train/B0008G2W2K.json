Amazon was great and took it back and paid for the shipping because of the lack of sizing in the ad. I think the smaller one is too limiting and the tall boy gets the Dutch oven high enough to keep a large fire from burning your meal or keeping things warm. I would highly recommend this tripod with it nice long and heavy chain.",
