I bought a case of this Salmon, because according to Consumer Report's Health edition, (Jan.2020) , canned salmon, has even greater health benefits, than fresh salmon ? although fresh salmon is good eating also. A little more money buying via Amazon, but considering the weight to lug from retailer to home, especially for Seniors, I'm glad Amazon made the purchase possible",
