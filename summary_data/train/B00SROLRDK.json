But seems to me that the patina made it lose its original razor sharpness putting on the blade a powdery like sticking coating. I now will have to re-sharpen the Scandi grind and perhaps it will look like a lil Cold Steel machete. I wouldn't force a patina again on a carbon knife. I will just wait for it to develop naturally. The difference between the patinated Mora Craftline Robust and the un-patinated Mora Craftline Basic is in the cutting video.",

I'm not into having to oil a blade to prevent rust, that's just one more thing to add to a long list of other things that i have to worry about.

The sheathe may appear to be flimsy however this is not the case as the plastic is quite sturdy and even has a purpose build hole on the bottom so any wetness or liquid in the sheathe can leak out. This level of care towards an uncoated carbon steel blade is very important as it is an extra step they needn't take yet they did. Bravo,",

I didn't feel safe working with the Companion, if that makes sense. Once I bought the Craftline I knew instantly it was a better fit and felt so much better in the hand. The blade shape is very nice (almost like a rounded tanto) and the thickness of the blade instills a good deal of confidence when putting it to tough use. Blade wise, it is very sharp, holds the edge well. Even though the blade is thicker, I was still able to do delicate work with it when needed. Great knife and well worth the money!",

I'm only giving it four stars due to the unground spine.

If you have the means to reprofile the spine to that configuration yourself, it's an easy five star blade.",

    "description": "The Morakniv Craftline Robust Trade Knife features an extra-thick, 3.6 x 0.125-inch carbon steel fixed blade. High carbon steel achieves high hardness, sharpens easily and is exceptionally tough. High carbon steels are preferred in applications that demand durability and frequent regrinding. The material is harder than stainless steel, allowing it to hold a sharper and more durable acute edge. The Morakniv Robust has an impact-resistant, ergonomic TPE rubber handle with coil-formed rounding that provides extra grip and control. A finger guard provides additional safety. Included with the knife is a hard plastic Combi-Sheath, which provides a quick-connect feature for attaching a second knife and sheath. Morakniv has been manufacturing the highest quality knives in Mora, Sweden since 1891. Limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty.",
