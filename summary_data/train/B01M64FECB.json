The issue is it keeps that absorbed scent in the litter box, and fills the whole room, and slowly drifts into other rooms. I got so frustrated with the smell, I dumped all of it into a kitchen bag, trashed it and swapes back to another litter. Stinky, lingering, unending smell is now gone.",

I only really notice it when I'm pouring the litter, it fades pretty quickly after.",

      "text": "This litter is relatively fine, almost like sand in terms of texture and particle size. This stuff works extremely well on the smell front. It clumps well, almost too well, you will go through it quickly because it clumps like mad. The downside to it is that it is like the glitter of the cat litter world - this stuff. Gets. EVERYWHERE. My cat has pretty dense long fur so she tracks just a bit. This stuff goes with her, everywhere. You NEED a litter catching mat with this stuff if you don't want to go broom and vacuum crazy. I'd love to use something else for this reason but haven't found the right litter yet.",

This product is more like regular cat litter, but is finer grain so the rakes in the automatic cleaning tray don't get clogged. The litter overs everything so it can be pushed by the rakes into the litter holding tray and rakes the litter back in an even layer ready for the next use.",
