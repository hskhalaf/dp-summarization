They break in very quickly and are as comfortable as running shoes. The glove leather interior is a nice plus. I took a star off because of its durability. The soles are softer and wear kind of quickly, much faster than I feel a boot at this price range should. However, I know most people don't do the kind of hiking I do so this probably wouldn't be a concern.",

I wanted to keep them because of the cool leather lining, but really the fit was just horrible on my feet, so i returned them right away. I think the Lowa footbed may be very narrow, and its hard to get the right fit without trying out a few. Fortunately Amazon lets you return what doesn't fit right, so that was awesome. no loss, no harm in trying these, and i learned a bit in the process. The LOWA Tibets are a real nice boot and thats what is ended up getting to replace these :-)",

They may be a bit more roomy at 13 than the 11.5 Baffin, i.e. going one size larger for the same comfort may be a good rule of thumb. Definitely, order a couple different sizes and try for best fit.

I have low arches, but I'm not sure if that had any bearing. Shoes just weren't for me. Maybe go 1/2 size bigger and go with 2 socks for better comfort. Again, on paper, these are great boots.",

After wearing these boots for a hiking season the are falling apart. $200 for a hiking season is unacceptable even for the comfort.",
