She did sidetrack a few times at first to chase something, but the response of the leash bungee brought her quickly back next to me without any loss of control of the bike. Would highly recommend this as bike remains stable even if dog pulls off to side.",

    "description": "Color:BlueThe DoggerJogger is the easiest way to jog your dog in the \u201csafety zone\u201d alongside your bike. It is the optimum method for exercising your dog quickly and at its own pace. You maintain control and proper speed while your dog jogs comfortably. The DoggerJogger attaches to your bike in two places: on the bike frame near the rear axle and at the pedal. The breakthrough design allows a two-point connection which maintains the dog\u2019s position without hardware, brackets, bolts or tools! It snaps on your bike in seconds, the soft nylon straps will not damage or ding your paint or frame, and the beautiful nickel-plated hardware will shine brightly for years. When you arrive at your destination, the DoggerJogger snaps off the bike and is small enough to fit in your pocket! Or it becomes a standard leash. Or you can snap it to a post or tree without having to remove it from your dog\u2019s collar. It\u2019s SIMPLE at every stage! Most importantly, it connects to your dog\u2019s collar at the proper angle for safety, and the elastic cord built into the leash gives your dog feedback about his position within the \u201csafety zone.\u201d In the event of an entanglement or mishap, the breakaway feature allows the dog to separate from the leash to avoid injury. Following your lead develops a stronger bond between your dog and its \u201cpack leader,\u201d you! The DoggerJogger is the simple solution to getting out, having fun and being active together!",
