When I removed rack from my air fryer with these mitts, I noticed that they were getting warm and soon too hot to hold. I dropped the rack looked at the mitts and noticed that the contact points had melted onto the rack. Given the poor quality of these silicon mitts, and the inability to use them for their original intent, I'm skeptical about using any other silicon trays this product came with. Use at your own risk.",

There are so many pieces that you can be creative in using one or two in the same cooking event, the silicone mats are very useful- one of those items I didn't know i needed and now I could not do without it. I have also used the plain rack - I put broccoli below and salmon on the rack, and it worked perfectly. The pieces were very well made and super easy to clean. Would highly recommend!",

This product came along just at the right time and is very versatile. It also helps in that I don\u2019t have to clean the tray of my fryer as often cause everything is cooked in the pans. I\u2019m so glad I bought this set!",

It feels like it actually shrinks the size of your Air Fryer because they are just too small. They do fit perfectly in my pressure cooker so I am just going to use them for that. But not for my air fryer. Also, the mits melted when trying to remove the included rack out of my Air Fryer.",
