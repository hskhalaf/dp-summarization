Just follow the instructions about quartering oblong pills. The wafer seemed to be less of a problem to the cat than the pointy chunks we'd been asking her to swallow.

      "text": "This product has an amazing feature. Every pill splitter I've ever seen up to now requires that you very carefully align the pill exactly with the blade so you cut it in half. If you're off a tiny bit (quite likely if your eyesight is less than perfect) you get two unequal pieces. With this product all you have to do is put the pills (all of the same size) inside. You don't have to align them (or put them face up, or pay attention to the scoring marks). The design causes the spitter to \"know\" where the center is. Just follow the instructions. Halved pills can be quartered just as easily. Again, follow the instructions.",

I contacted the seller last week and they never responded. Pity, had the potential to be a good product.",

This only makes a noticeable difference when splitting smaller pills into quarters, but at that point even a slight discrepancy in size creates a proportionally large difference in dosage. Other than that it has been working fine. It cuts through several pills at once easily, though it does often leave a small amount of residual powder.",

The Multiple Pill Splitter is just that, it operates best when multiple pills are loaded and very even down force is applied suddenly. Works great and would recommend you practice applying the very even down force and apply the force strong and quickly. When done in this manner the pills are split very evenly.",
