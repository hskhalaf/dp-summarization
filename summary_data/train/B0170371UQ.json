The downside of it is the knob itself. It's hollow plastic and feels super cheap. There's no heft to this product at all. If you're looking for something to use on a vehicle that doesn't get much use, I'm sure it'll work just fine. For your daily drive, I'd spend a bit more money. This one will get thrown in the tool box as soon as I order a nicer one.",

It takes practice to get good at using it but it very definitely performs its function well.",

Fill in the rest of the space with strips of rubber tube or water hose , enough to fill the gap between wheel and the handle bracket . Using two open ended wrenches tighten the outer but on handle shaft. The second wrench is to hold the inner nut so that when you tighten the knob will not loose its ability to spin.",
