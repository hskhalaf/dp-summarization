At first, I thought some of the bulbs had broken during shipping. Upon closer look, I realized the shards were much larger than the size of the bulbs, so I have no idea where they came from. As we pulled the lights out of the box, glass started falling everywhere onto the floor. This is so dangerous and I have no idea how this product could have passed any type of quality assurance test.",

You weave them through your curtains carefully, then undue each strap for each column and the lights drop. You power up and realize even i on steady burn, the lights flicker. The power supply is so garbage and cheap it can't even maintain a steady output for a consistent, steady, always on light. The other patterns are completely crap. They aren't relaxing and even those flicker. I cut them out of my blinds and will be sending them back so they can throw their garbage product away.",

A word of caution, they tangle easily. All in all, still pleased. I bought these for my husband who likes to hang out on the patio a lot. He says he loves them, so I'm thrilled nonetheless.",

The way to connect them together is super easy and the little screw cap to take off the remote/outlet is genius. Best thing is that my cats loved them so much they would play in them: hang/bat at/chew. One strand did suffer a loss to cat teeth and surprisingly enough the rest of the lights still work.

      "text": "For real? I opened the box and was so overwhelmed by the bundled conglomerate of \"Christmas tree\" lights that I went EEK and put it back in the box. Until I thought, well that's just ridiculous! Then I opened it again and untied the bundle to which a spider web looking mess of light spilled down and my head felt like it would explode at the mere idea of trying to untangle and figure it out that I just put it back in the box again and realized this sort of thing is for people who love tedious challenges and that if I truly want that twinkle light effect? Imma have to just get traditional xmas lights",

The only complaint I had was the plug, it's very heavy, if you bump into it, it'll fall out of the wall (but we won't have an issue because it's plugged behind furniture). They may be too bright for some kids (you don't need any other lighting, they're that good and light up the entire room). Overall great quality and I'm very happy with the purchase. We may even order again for her older sister.",

My only complaint is the cord prior to the start of the lights is pretty short. Given the length of the lights....you end up with a visible black power cord hanging. It's not easy to hide.
