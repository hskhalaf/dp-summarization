Make sure you get some 1-2 inch foam tape if you are using this with a metal bed frame, the two frames make some noise if you move around or have recreational activities. One I applied some foam tape, it's super quiet. I also used some zip ties to hold the 2 frames together. Very good product, highly recommended, you can tell there was thought put in and they cared about making something that wasn't junk.",

It went together very easily (I used thread locker/ felt strips that did not come with the kit) and after getting the mattress back on, the hump was gone! The 1/4\" wooden slats were bowing! Our mattress was actually fine which is great! Going to get a full size one to replace the one in my daughter's room next!",
