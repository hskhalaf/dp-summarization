I, too, bought the bag for an afternoon sewing group pin cushion project. There were 8 ladies who each made 2 pin cushions, and I still came home with almost 1/2 a bag left over! I'm not sure how much it weighs--over 10lbs, I'm guessing--so be prepared to make a LOT of pin cushions if you opt for this bag. Thankfully, I plan on giving pin cushions as Christmas gifts so I'm sure I'll be able to use up the rest of the bag.",

      "text": "Great for pincushions - very happy! I quilt my cotton top & bottom to batting pieces, join right sides together & stitch all around the outside, leaving a little opening to fill with walnut shells. I use a funnel to fill the pincushion & add a little polyester stuffing at the opening to keep tiny walnut granules from working their way through. Then, hand stitch opening closed. This is my second purchase of crushed walnut shells & am very happy with how the pincushions hold up over time, too.",
