It's easy to assemble; you just need to take your time.",

Laid out the parts, pieces numerically. Good game plan. One Philips head screwdrivers and some patience and was put together in less than two hours. No missing parts. Everything fit like it should. A we are happy. Very nice cherry finish. Small but petite which is actually what we needed in an already crowded kitchen. We are very happy with our purchase. Thanks again for our previous reviewers helping make our decision an easy one. Hope my review will help others make their decision to go for it or not.",

The cabinet doors were particular difficult to align and put on but I finally got it right. The finish is fragile, it scratches easily, and rubs off fairly easily. Had to do over again, I think I would look for an assembled side board for a similar price but now that it is done, it's cute and will serve it's purpose as purely decorative in my office.",

After shopping at several furniture stores and online shops, I decided to give this one a try. I had it shipped to my house so I could put it together before delivering to Granny. I put the entire unit together by myself, which shocked my husband! Now, I would not recommend that for everyone, but I consider myself to be skilled with tools and directions. Ideally, two people should attempt this, take your time and it will turn out great. Granny loves this buffet and brags about it to everyone who comes over.",

      "text": "We needed a entry table to accent the vintage 56 inch wide mirror hanging above it. This table works fine and looks fine. I wish that the color were just a little lighter (not black cherry). But I knew that it would probably be very dark and,other than that, it serves the purpose. Assembly revealed a problem: a hole had not been drilled for a cam lock. I had to very carefully drill and ream the hole to fit the cam lock into. Overall, We are satisfied!",
