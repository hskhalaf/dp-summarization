For limited walking around, they'd be fine for me, but I need a pair that my feet can handle all day long. For anyone without this problem, I highly recommend. I wear size 7 1/2 and the size 7 fit perfectly.",

On one setting the shoe was loose and floppy on my foot, but on the next one it was a bit snug and I worried about the elastic stretching as others have shown in pictures and comments. Finally went with the slightly snug setting and that was the right choice. I work in a school and spend a lot of time walking around. As the day progressed the shoes loosened and were perfectly comfortable all day long.",

Usually by the end of the summer I can barely walk due to wearing sandals with no support, but I switch these out with the regular Chacos that I bought and I think that has saved my feet so far this summer. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that they already look like I've been wearing them for years and years.",

I wish I could give 5 stars, BUT the elastic is barely holding on and I've had them less than 2 months and haven't worn them everyday. I will be taking them to a shoe repairman though, because they are worth fixing for sure. Other than that, they are very high quality shoes.",
