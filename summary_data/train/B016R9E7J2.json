Only issues I've had is the PTFE tube going out (which, while initially a pain to get the nozzle off, was extremely easy to replace), and the nozzle getting clogged, and both issues FlashForge helped resolve quickly.

I sent a picture and they identified what was wrong, then sent a video on how to fix it. Now it works wonderful. I gave this 5 stars due to the service and the quality of the print. I would definitely purchase again.",

      "text": "for the price this printer works great. I am able to print somewhat complicated designs with a better success rate than I had with the much more expensive Makerbot Replicator 2. I would definitely buy this printer again. As long as you keep the print bed clean and level almost everything sticks to it. It does not use proprietary 3D filament, so you can use pretty much anything that is on the market. I just wish the manufacturer would sell replacement parts on Amazon instead of their Ebay store.",
