      "text": "I bought this to make a faux fireplace surround. It works great! I even used the box it came in (covered with black cloth) to elevate it a bit to look more like a mantel top. With a piece of black fabric on it, it gives the impression of a fireplace for a lot less than real fireplace surrounds. If I ever decide not to use it for that purpose, it will make a lovely entry table. I placed an electric log fire (no heat) under it and a lace cloth (like a mantel scarf) over it, and presto! A fireplace! Lots of compliments on it too. Looks very cozy. Plenty of surface space for decorative items on the top.",

The price to have it shipped to my door was unbeatable. Even with the minor ding on the table top, I would buy it again in a heartbeat for my apartment as a wall table and laptop desk. I would post pictures but my MacBook is not cooperating.",

I'm sure the wood isn't that great, but it seems pretty sturdy and nice. Very to assemble and came with all the required tools. Took me about 10 minutes to screw in the four legs and drawer. Again, if you're looking for something slim and doesn't take up much space, this is probably it. I would've liked the drawer to be wider, but no biggie. Now I just need a nice and affordable office chair :)",
