You do get a lot of bandages but I'll probably end up having to replace them with a better brand before things pick up in the spring/summer.",

I noticed that it is missing disinfecting wipes, which is something that would be useful when running water isn't available for cleaning a wound. Upon further research, I think most first aid kids actually don't have any, so I can't dock any points here. The plastic tweezer is not very useful, but most kits only have plastic ones because they're cheap. Overall, it's a decent kit, and you can always add a few items to complete it.",
