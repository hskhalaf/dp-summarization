All I wanted was help and no one offered any. Now my mother, who loved this glider can't even enjoy it. It was beautiful and very comfy, but now it looks like it's been on her deck for years, not weeks.",

However, be aware that it was made in China and the assembly instructions read like they were written by a Chinese person not totally fluent in English. So you have to study the parts and figure out how they fit together before you start to assemble it. The faux wood slats are hard plastic, but that's good if you plan to leave the glider outside in the weather. Overall it seems pretty solid. I'm waiting to see if the metal parts eventually show any rust, but so far they don't.",

It's not real wood but looks a lot like real wood and I have the piece of mind that it won't age and develop splinters. I'm 5'3\" and I find it very comfortable. I would highly recommend this bench.",
