Significant time saved on ph testing (avg. 10 seconds for stable reading) & calibration (avg. 1 second for calibration), compared to the $20 pen testers I've used in the past. I would definitely recommend this product. Original review: I've gone through 6 sets of batteries with this device in the past month. If batteries are left in device, they are spent within 24 hrs. Now the return window is closed, so I'm stuck with a defective device. Unfortunate because it reads very quickly and is extremely simple to calibrate.",

This has everything you need right out of the box, and the KCl was a nice touch, so you won't have to constantly re-calibrate the pen after every test. Definitely recommend this product if your unfamiliar with pH testing and don't need commercial grade (pH testing in the \u00b10.001 range).",

The instructions are clear and easy to follow. A second advantage of the smaller tip is that just 5 drops of 3M KCl (also included) in the cap is enough to preserve the sensor bulb. I highly recommend this pH meter.",

The only downside I see is that you need to get new solution after every 10-15 calibrations (which need to be done at least weekly).

Tried to recalibrate it but numbers were off the wall. Then noticed the \"Err\" reading on the screen. Now it's being recommended that i spend another $40-50 on a replacement probe. Weak.",
