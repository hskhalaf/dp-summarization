The lids are magnetic, barely.... they come off easily and the jarring from carrying them downstairs (empty BTW) the lid came off one of them. The grind isn't coarse under the best circumstance, even unscrewing one until it came apart (and the lid wouldn't close far before that. The base tilts the shakers in different directions. It may make it easier to grab, but it looks weird. I'll keep them on the table, once I find a better stand, but I'll use a different set for cooking.",

They were actually a little bigger than I thought they were going to be, which is a good thing.The magnetic lids are very convenient and do a good job of staying tight. The only think I'm not crazy about is the base that they set in. The insets hold the grinders at a slight angle, maybe 15-20 degrees, opposite of one another. It's kind of neat to display but not as functional as if straight up and down. They seem to be decent quality and a solid value for sure.",

It seems to have trouble grinding and isn't able to grind very much up at a time meaning ur setting there grinding for a while to get a little bit of pepper out. If your just wanting some grinders that look nice then these are for you, but if you intend to use them for cooking and what not I would suggest shopping around.",
