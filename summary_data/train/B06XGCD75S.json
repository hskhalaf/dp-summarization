Following the online start up guide made it easy to get going, works well, fast and efficient. It's also great for double sided scanning, and continuous for multiple pages. I have scanned letter size, extra long papers, as well as business cards. Everything has turned out good so far. You can only scan up to a width of 8.5\" which is fine. The size of the scanner makes it nice and portable and easy to move around the desk while sorting papers.",

      "text": "This is a great product! Scans well! Unfortunately, the software is horrendous and the product is dependent on the software. Over the last month or so since I've had the product, I've been in constant communication with tech support. They've been suggesting different versions of their software, sending me different license files (because the activation codes they send me don't work) and suggesting different things which are not available in the software (as if they don't know their own software). The software has been buggy, unresponsive, and just downright awful to use. Don't buy this product unless you feel like dealing with all that.",

      "text": "Upon receipt, we connected the scanner to three separate computers, loaded the software and the scanner appeared to scan correctly, but all the images would either come out all black or all white. Recommendations in the troubleshooting guide was to calibrate the scanner using the included calibration sheet. The scanner was unable to calibrate - it would produce an error code 3021 (which we could not find on the Iriscan website troubleshooting section) and every time we attempted calibration more than 3 times, the scanner would eventually stop responding and then disconnect from the computer. Ultimately we chose to return the scanner as we could not get it to function correctly.",
