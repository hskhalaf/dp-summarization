Both buy this and I have to say it's the only GF flour I've ever had that comes so close to approximating the action of wheat flour. Christmas cookies made of this come out very very close to regular flour cookies. People can't tell the difference. Unlike a lot of GF flour, it doesn't produce crumbly or dense product. Super expensive, I admit, but for baking that really requires it, we use this. For less critical stuff, we get cheaper GF flour that's not as good.",

Also, do not expect this to brown as much as wheat bread, it will look paler. This box contains 4 smaller individually sealed bags, a nice touch to ensure it stays fresh, and makes it convenient to use without having to deal with a large bag. It's a small detail but it's nice to have. Enjoy!",

There are still variables to baking, but the option to apply for financial aid, to use recipes from their website (Also Gluten Free on a Shoestring has many better batter recipes), and to have a ready made and less expensive alternative free me in the kitchen. I've made donuts that act like gluten filled donuts and taste as good. I never found good ones on the shelf to buy.",

Unfortunately, this flour has an inescapable sour taste - very sour like lemon juice sour, or like a mixture of vinegar and lemon Pledge was sprayed on it. This might not be an issue with strongly flavored baked goods, but with sugar cookies it was a deal breaker. Updated - I am downgrading this to 1 star because they contacted me fishing for a nice review, I explained the problem & they have not gotten back to me. Also this flour tastes bad.",
