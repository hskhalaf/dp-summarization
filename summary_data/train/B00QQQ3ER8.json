I love the design.. after hours of searching for unique creations I dont see everyday. I misread the advert, thinking I would be able to wear these. I was excited to finally receive these in the mail since Amazon prime shipping wasn't available! Only to find they dont fit. No buggy, just made like they were a gift for my lady. They look good on her feet. But won't go for every outfit or style woman have!",

I would have given these five stars except for the fact that these shoes get slippery on certain smooth surfaces, like tile, or a wet tree stump, so be careful.",

I'm size ten in cheap shoes and my concern was that my feet where going to be too wide for these boots. But thank goodness size 10 feet perfectly! Not too tight not to loose. These boots are a dream to walk on, they are extremely comfortable. Also dont be afraid to wear them on warm days, I've been wearing them in the southern California summer.",

I was so pleased, I wanted to buy another pair ASAP. But by the time i decided to do that, the price was 40% higher. Guess 'ill wait out the next deal. Highly recommended.",
