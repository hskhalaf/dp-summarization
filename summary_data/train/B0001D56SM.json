If you're looking for a good start-up camera this is the perfect choice. easy to operate, good quality pictures, and an outstanding price. i would definately recommend this camera to that crowd. but if you're more serious about photography and want consistant results from this camera, you won't find it here. about half of the pictures you take will be blurry and only about 10% will probably turn out the way you want. but i can't imagine why those people would buy such a cheap camera if they're that serious. that's why i give it 4 stars.",

      "text": "I own this camera for past 1 year. Its doing good - both at indoors and outdoors. The picture quality is decent with no grains. I usually prefer to take prints than sharing thru computer. The prints are nice in 4 x 6. The macro mode is not so great...but it works. The battery life is excellent. I've taken over 200+ pictures using rechargable batteries and still battery is alive. Pros: 1. Good picture quality for 4 X 6 prints. May be even for higher size. But I've not tried. 2. Excellent Battery Life Cons: 1. Date & Time is not imprinted in the image. Tried DPOF settings. Still not happy.",

Perfect size to fit in a small purse and to take out at night without being cumbersome. All the menu options are easy to use & obvious to understand,for those of us who hate reading direction booklets. The only complaint I have would be the \"movie mode\" in dimmer settings, it was SO DARK! It also doesn't come with ANY extras; no camera case, rechargable battery, etc... All in all, I love it! Seems to be a great price for it too! Yay Target!",

I know they got the letter, because I got a response from the store that I purchased it from and they agreed to pay for the repairs.

    "title": "FujiFilm FinePix A330 3.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom",
    "description": "Open the cover on this Fujifilm FinePix 3.2MP digital camera and you're ready to take photos in only 3-4 seconds. The A330 is speedy between images too needing less than a second to refresh. Features: 3.2-megapixel CCD sensor; a 3x Fujinon zoom lens; movie mode; USB interface; multiple flash modes with red-eye reduction; 1.5\" TFT display screen; TTL center-point fixed autofocus; auto, manual, and pre-programmed exposure control; 10-second self-timer; 6-language menu interface; standard tripod socket; sliding lens cover; 16MB xD memory card; Mac or PC USB connectivity; PictBridge direct-printing; video out cable; and wrist strap.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSpeed is mostly what sets the A330 apart from previous cameras. Slide the camera cover open and you'll be ready to start taking photos in about three seconds. The camera also has a quick refresh between images--less than a second. Images come out of the A330 quickly, too, since it is compatible with the much-faster transfer speeds of USB 2.0 when uploading to computers that are likewise equipped. \n\n Optics and Resolution\nFeaturing a 3.2-megapixel CCD sensor, the A330 can create images up to 2272 x 1704 pixels, which is enough information to create photo-quality prints up to 11 by 15 inches. The camera features a 3x Fujinon zoom lens. Also, the camera has a 1.6x digital zoom feature, but only when shooting in 2MP mode. To get those close-up shots full of detail, the A330's macro mode can focus the camera on subjects just 3.6 inches from the lens. \n\n Movie Mode\nShoot up to one minute of AVI video without sound at resolutions up to 320 x 240 pixels; up to four minutes at lower resolutions. The movies aren't camcorder quality, but they're fun and convenient, and they're perfect as e-mail attachments. The camera includes cables that allow you to view your movies on NTSC (North American) and PAL (other regions) televisions and, of course, you can upload the files to your computer via the camera's USB interface. \n\n More Features\n\n *  Flash mode: Auto, Red-eye Reduction, Forced Flash, Suppressed Flash, Slow Synchro, Red-eye Reduction + Slow Synchro \n *  1.5-inch TFT display screen \n *  TTL center-point fixed autofocus \n *  Auto, manual, and pre-programmed exposure control \n *  Fast processing: 3.3-second bootup time (duration between turning the camera on and when it's ready to start taking pictures) and a frame-to-frame time of 0.62 seconds. \n *  Ten-second self-timer \n *  Six-language menu interface \n *  Standard tripod socket \n *  Sliding lens cover \n\n Storage and Transfer\nImages and video are stored on xD memory cards (16MB included). Files can be downloaded to either a Mac or PC via USB connectivity, which means it can be connected to any USB-based Windows 98/Me/2000/XP and Mac OS 8.6 or later computer without installing any software. This camera can transfer images at a faster USB 2.0 rate to computers installed with a USB 2.0 card. \n\n Printing\nThis camera is compatible with the PictBridge direct-printing standard. That means that it can connect and print directly to a number of printers by different manufacturers without additional software or even a computer. Learn more about PictBridge. \n\n Power and Size\nThe camera is powered by two AA-size batteries (alkaline included, rechargeable NiMH recommended). It measures 4.09 by 2.42 by 1.23 inches and weighs 5.1 ounces without batteries and memory card. \n\n What's in the Box\nCamera, 16MB xD-Picture Card, USB / Video out Cable, Wrist Strap, 2 AA Alkaline Batteries, Picture Cradle Adapter (Cradle Sold Separately), CD-ROM with FinePix Viewer ver. 4.2 and ImageMixer VCD 2 for FinePix, User Manual",
