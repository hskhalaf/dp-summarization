Do you really think that I can just set this up and let my kids play on this? I can\u2019t even get the oil off my hand from opening the package let alone let my kids ruin their clothes. I\u2019m at complete and literal disgust at what I just paid for. 80 dollars for someone\u2019s used tire. I would have been better off buying a new tire for my own car and drilling holes in my own. Please do not buy this product. Absolutely absurd and this should be banned from amazon. WOW. This is sad",

The plastic coating on the lower portion is continuous and goes up high enough to prevent pinches to small hands even when the child fully extends her arms. I bought this for my 4 year old grand daughter. Again, it is heavy. Careful consideration should be given to the limb from which you intend to hang the tire. When you wash off the tire, you can easily find the top three holes intended for hanging.",

I used the selware swing 1200LB swivel hook and it works great. 10/10 would recommend you wash it before you use it to prevent oil stains. Your gonna need three small clips/carabineers to hook the top part of the chain to your swing mount.",

I thought originally I was supposed to get 4 chains, but I\u2019m looking at the product photo, and there are 3 chains. Why 4 holes in the tire and not 3? Can I get an extra chain?",

      "text": "UPS just delivered this item. The tire and accessories seem to be OK, but the packaging is horrible. The box is falling apart and secured with cheap flimsy tape. It didn't even come close to being sturdy enough for a product this size and weight. It's a wonder the whole thing didn't fall apart before arriving. There is no indication that this was packaged by Amazon. The manufacturer must have sent it this way. Also the tire is obviously used. Not that it matters for what it's used for, but should have been indicated in the description. I would never purchase anything from this seller again.",

We also had to redrill the holes to get the thing to balance. All good? Nope. Tire was covered in black grease that got all over our clothes. Very disappointed.",

It's a used truck tire that I could have gotten at a tire store probably for free or close to it. $10 worth of chains and $10 worth of hardware. No wonder it was free shipping. They sold me $20 worth of stuff for $160. If you have a drill and know how to use it, go to the tire shop and the hardware store",
