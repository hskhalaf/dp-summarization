I also like the feature that can digitize a negative or slide so you can print or show it on your computer. There were only a couple things that didn't work for me.... while it worked great for slides and 110 and 35 mm film, I had some taken with a minox camera and it was almost impossible to look at those. Also, the different holders were difficult to load and open and close. But in general it's a great item.",
