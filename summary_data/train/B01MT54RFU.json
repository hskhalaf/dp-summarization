Although the manual says it is designed for single person use - it is possible to have several users. You have to take care that the device is only connected to one person's app at any one time. Once the results are synchronised to one app, it is not possible to send the results again to another person's app.",

Contacted Omron, there first response was to tell me to use it over a shirt or jumper sleeve, but it didn\u2019t help and still returned a error. Second response from Omron was that it would return an error whilst if the user was experiencing ectopic or irregular heart beats. So I revert back to my Qardio BPM when I am experiencing ectopics, which is a shame as otherwise the Omron is very convenient and easy to use. The Qardio does give a reading whilst experiencing ectopics! !!!PLEASE SORT THIS OMRON!!!",

So I opted for this over the m7 IT which was half the price of this, this being new technology. You can only have one user, it is possible to faff with 2 phones, 2 apps and keep registering the device to a different phone but this is not convenient. I am disappointed that the comment in the instructions that says 'this is intended to be a personal device' is not in the marketing literature, as I would have bought the cheaper one that has the ability. Hence the 2 stars.",
