Had no problems with it so far and it gets quite a bit of use. The sound carries to all rooms of our apartment nicely and theres no 'tinniness' to the treble. I highly recommend this system, the price is affordable without comprimising much on the sound quality. Sure there are many high-end docks out there for much higher prices but save those for the 'purists'. Save your money and get this instead, you should be as satisfied with it as we are.",

Remote works ok.. kind of slow at times.. but that's no big deal.. the main reason is sound.. and you crank this little bugger up and it rocks~ takes the place of an entire home stereo system... but I have that too.. and don't use it now",

Look at the image in scale to the iPod. But it has a great sound and will fill a room. I have only used indoors, so I cannot comment on patio/poolside use. The remote is intuitive and nice to have, since it is only an AC powered unit (no battery option here). It charges my iPhone 4 and works with my 120GB iPod. Had one of these stolen from my shelf at work recently, and had to buy another. What else can one say?",

My iPhone 4 sits in the dock without having to remove the case (I have a minimal case, I'm not sure if an Otter would work).

Maybe it's the quality of my MP3s but I am slightly disappointed. Nevertheless, it is a vast improvement over the $50 cheapie portable speakers I was using before and I think the price is right. It works nicely in my kitchen, but I probably would want something more substantial for a much larger room.",

It's better then the iHome, the Memorex, and even the Bose at this price. The Bose is double the price, and I don't think it's worth it when compared to the iGroove.

I have an iPhone 3 GS but I believe it works well with the 4 as well. The quality of sound is great and you can easily hear it from other close by rooms. Also use it in the yard (small system can easily be unplugged and moved around) and it was great for small parties. Highly recommend.",

This latest version takes that success to a whole new level, without costing a penny more. It sounds better than ever and accommodates all of the new iPod and iPhone models, even the iPhone 3G S. The iGroove SXT remains a true stereo sound system that employs dual long-throw 2.5-inch woofers in a ported enclosure and dual 3/4-inch horn-loaded tweeters. Klipsch is the only company in the iPod speaker category to utilize horn technology, a design that delivers lifelike sound as well as produces more output using less energy. The result? Huge stereo sound from a pint-sized package. And unlike before, the iGroove SXT is now bi-amplified, which means each driver is individually amplified, a feature that virtually eliminates distortion and significantly improves sonic performance.
