I do a lot of walking on pretty rubbish feet, and I bought this pair to replace my old Mephistos, which I owned (and used a lot) for nearly ten years. In a search for variety, I would quite often walk into good shoe stores wearing them, and ask to try their best shoes. Invariably, the response was pretty much, \"You're wearing them. Do you want to try a different color?\".",

Update: after 9 months of intermittent wear, these shoes are still really comfortable and good. However, they are starting to look run down. I am not sure if the nubuck will ever look good enough even after refurbishment. If all you get out of the nubuck is 9 months, then these are grossly overpriced. I am wondering if the regular leather version would have been a better idea.",

      "text": "My husband has been wearing Mephisto Boat Shoes for a few years, and this was his first pair of Match Walking Shoe. It fits perfectly, and is very comfortable from the minute you first put on. Wish it came in another Nubuck color, like a tan. The birch is nice, but he'd also like a tan or beige. Plan to take on a 2 week trip to California wine country.",

Perhaps I shouldn't say this but maybe these one will last indefinitely. They are stylish and comfortable at the same time. I have no reservations about recommending this product.",

After wearing these shoes for several days, I am convinced! High quality grained leather, a very comfortably designed footbed and an exception designed method of shoe lace management.. I have now found a great new pair of well fitting, comfortable walking shoes.",

    "description": "Comfort walking shoes. Both feet should be measured, as most people have one foot which is larger than the other. It\u2019s also a good idea to measure your feet at the end of the day as they are usually slightly larger at that time. Please keep in mind length is only one dimension. Feet are three-dimensional, so width and thickness of the feet should also be considered.\n\nThis casual oxford from Mephisto is a perfect Match. The durable leather upper and laid-back style are great for relaxed outings and everyday wear, while the Soft-Air Technology and Caoutchouc rubber sole give you comfort and support where you need it most.\n\nMephisto makes some of the finest walking shoes on earth. Their comfort, support and durability are recognized wherever people are serious about walking. For more than three decades, Mephisto has been on the forefront of walking-shoe innovation. Mephisto's natural products are handmade of leather, latex, cork and rubber.\n\nSee more",
