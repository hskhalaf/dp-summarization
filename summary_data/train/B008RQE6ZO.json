The light is bright and clear and compared to other lights we had with the same lumens, this is definitely half the weight. It is very light, sturdy and quick to recharge. There is a low beam and a high beam and both work well. I like them because we have a large wooded area behind our house and there are many animals from deer to bear and foxes. I like being able to see them before I leave my deck. I am going to buy a second light so that we always have a backup.",

Could be a loose wire, trigger switch, probably fixable. But in reality, I knew I wanted an exact replica of the original and that is what I got. Lightweight, comfortable grip and durable, this light proved to be a winner. Left out in the rain, extreme heat, freezing temperatures, dropped countless times and kept on going. There is a updated version of this spotlight. Not sure what the update is, other than a reverse image of the original. I highly recommend this one.
