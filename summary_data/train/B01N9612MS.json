They are so comfortable, have excellent support for my high arches, and are genuinely waterproof. Many of the hiking boots advertised as waterproof don't stand up to a hill walk in Scotland but these walked me straight into Loch Lomond and kept my feet nice and dry. Would highly recommend!",

I have fairly slender feet and have problems in the past with boots being too big. These are great for me!",

Although I\u2019m a male, size 8, these boots fit me perfectly. They have excellent soles and ankle support, they are light weight ( which is what I wanted more than anything, I wear steel toe capped boots for work all day and hence have a strong dislike for heavy boots in my leisure time! ) Returned from holiday and these boots were amazing, still as good as new after really being put through their paces, can\u2019t really recommend strongly enough.",

Having tried several I ordered these as they are the same make as my walking sandals, which have also proved comfortable. Straight from the box they are a good fit and with some new, anti blister socks they've proved to be just the job! Very happy (finally)",

I measure a 5 but usually go for a six due to the width, but the 6 in this boot was far too small and unfortunately I couldn't get the 7 (I did follow the sizing guide on the website). My local Blacks and Millets stores were so helpful and I was able to exchange these boots for some Merrell boots that fitted better.",
