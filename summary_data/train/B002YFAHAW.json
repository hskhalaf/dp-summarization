The line has kept the water hose from freezing up just fine. I have the heat line taped to the water hose with elec. tape, then wrapped foam pipe wrapping around this. Then duct taped the foam so it would stay sealed and help with a little more insulation. I know this is not what this is designed for, but it does the job just fine.",

I used this thermostatically-controlled heat tape along with swimming noodles (1\" inside diameter hole to fit the hose and heat tape in bought from a dollar store - NOTE: Noodles were slit down one side and fitted over the heat tape and hose, then slit was taped over with electrical tape). Temps dropped to 9 degrees F and our water supply line never froze up. Also we noticed little impact on our electric bill since during warmer weather the thermostat worked as advertised - shut down the heat when the temp of the hose rose above 45 degrees F.",

Ran the heater along the 5/8\" hose and covered with those 6' foam insulation strips for 1\" pipe. The thermostat is in free air, so the heat is on with air temps 35 to 45 degrees. When the tape is on for an extended period with no flow, the water can warm to about 70 degrees... so no fear of melting the hose at this point.",

My water never froze all winter with single digit temps at night.",
