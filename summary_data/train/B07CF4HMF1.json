I do recommend this because it's cheap and easy to spot clean, plus it isn't unusable with the tear, but spend the extra $10-$15 if you want a thicker, higher quality mat.",

The plastic is somewhat thin and after a month or so of use, the wheel of our high chair has already put a little tear in the center of it; but it does the job while also having a decently cute print. If you are looking for something nice and thick, this is not it. But if you just want something cheap that you'll probably throw away after baby gets out of the \"throwing puree everywhere\" stage, then this will definitely work!",
