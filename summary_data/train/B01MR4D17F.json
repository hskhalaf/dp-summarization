It's very heavy which does help with leverage, but you need boots or heavy shoes and get a good stance and stand on one end of the pallet to work best. Also make sure that the handles are placed under the WHOLE width of the pallet or it WILL split it. Took me the first three boards before I got the hand of it. It split one, then semi-cracked the other two before I figured out you need the hands/claws under the whole wood or it'll crack where it isn't under the whole board. Pretty happy with it. 4 stars for learning curve and is weight.",
