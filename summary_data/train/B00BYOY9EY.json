They clean it up to look like new and it works perfectly. I Love it. A quick and hassle free purchase. Thank you!!",

Auto focus is quick, easily navigable settings and the pop up flash make it great for street shots.",

      "text": "Great little camera for traveling and also very light so i can carry it on my hand luggage in the plane. It is even lighter than my vivitar fisheye lens. as far as performance does, it is very good but bear in mind that anything higher than ISO 800 will start to look a bit noisy but then again it's not a 5D and you get what you pay for. I have it mounted on a shoulder strap and with the kit lens (18 - 55) sometimes i forget it's there.",

      "text": "Canon EOS 100D digital slr camera (EF-S 18-55 lens). I've just got his camera, and was surprised to find no memory card in the packet. The list of contents doesn't include a memory card. If it is not included, that should be made clear in the sales description (which it wasn't). The camera is neat and light, seems a good design, with clear controls. It works fine for stills, I've not yet tried the video option. It was highly recommended to me by a professional photographer, to replace my fading Nikon D70. I hope the Canon has lasting power, time will tell.",
