This phone is ugly, clunky, bulky, and it bounces every time (seriously) she drops it. She loves this device as a replacement for her 9 year old flip she refused to surrender until it wheezed it's final breath. It gets five stars for what it is - an ugly, rugged, makes-calls cell phone that is exactly what my wife was after. Silly gal.",
