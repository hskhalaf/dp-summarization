I really like the favorite card slot. I can easily access my debit card using one hand. It has a clear window ID slot. It has two slots for cash or a biz card, etc. it\u2019s great not carrying a bulky, big wallet. It\u2019s very well made too!",

The cutout on bottom of 1st card pocket aids in removing card by pushing it up. Excellent minimalist wallet, it is thinner with all my cards and money than my other wallet empty!

I have owned this wallet for only 8 months and the majority of that time it has been in a backpack, not in my pocket, so it has been exposed to much less friction and stress than most men's wallets. The wallet is coming apart at the seems (see photo). Even at this price only lasting 8 months is unacceptable.",

And it could be slimmer if it was designed to have cards go in on the opposite ends of the wallet, please create one like this. I like the color and feel of the fabric. So basically remove the extra two fabric pieces in the middle so there are 5 card slots on the outside and 1 pocket in the middle. Then flip around one side if the card slots.",

Bought this because my previous wallet, even with no cards or cash inside, was very thick and bulky and was an inconvenience to use. And I don\u2019t have that many cards! Therefore, this fits my needs perfectly. Even with 5 cards (drivers, visa, and 3 gift cards) inside and a few bills (folded in 1/2 to fit inside the money slot) it is still very thin and is pretty comfortable to keep in my front pocket. Huge improvement over my previous wallet. Most definitely a minimalist wallet. I\u2019d recommend!",

How they handle this may improve the review, since it's possible I got an outlier, and not a representative produce.
