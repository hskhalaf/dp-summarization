The cushion covering is sticky and way too thick and the seat itself is uncomfortably slanted, putting too, too much pressure on the knees.

The quality is good, the adjustment range is sufficient for me (5' 8\"). Assembly took about 5 minutes. I'd definitely recommend it.",

Unfortunately the design makes the front casters point forward at an angle, making them difficult to turn directions. Leaning back and putting less weight at the front helps move them. Roller mat recommended for smoother operation. I started using a standing desk so I don't \"kneel\" on this chair as much. My weight is distributed over my feet, legs, knees, hips, and back differently throughout the day. Highly recommend a combo routine of standing and kneeling (and sitting if you must).",

      "text": "Overall it is not too bad chair but highly overpriced. For about $110 you\u2019ll get chip fake leather that\u2019ll start to peel off in about year of occasional use. The construction overall is flimsy by design and screwing bolts tight doesn\u2019t help. As for comfort: Your back tends to be more straight with this chair which is good. You should stand up at least every 20-30 minutes and walk to rest from this chair for your comfort. Otherwise you\u2019ll feel your legs numb and tingling. I would rate this chair 4 stars if it cost was about $40.",

If you crank the chair up, the casters function better, but still not good enough on my hard wood floor. The chair is also too high in that position to be practical for my 30\" tall desk.
