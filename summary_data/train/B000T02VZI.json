      "text": "Bag works well, especially if you get the back pack strap accessory too. I did not use this for cymbals. I bought it to protect my captain america shield, while at a comic con. I have been gathering signatures from various MCU actors and I needed a way to carry it around all day and keep it protected as well. It has plenty of cushioning on the inside. The front pouches had plenty of room for other things so I didn't need to bring a separate bag or my purse. I strongly advise getting the backpack straps with it. It made it much easier to carry around the convention center, which I did for a good 14 hours.",

Great for a player who uses big pies. I throw my 24\u201d K Light Ride, 22 K Light Ride, and 16\u201d K Light Hats in there with no problem. And sometimes I carry an additional 20\u201d cymbal with me in there as well. Love this bag.",

This bag was just the ticket for him and the best part are the dividers that keep each cymbal safe and secure in it\u2019s own pocket. The reinforced bottom is great and the handles are sturdy as can be. Great Product!!",

For how much I paid, I would probably say do some research into other cymbal bags on Amazon that might be a little higher in quality.",
