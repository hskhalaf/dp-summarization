Fortunately I purchased the Square Trade protection plan and because Razor only offers a 90 warranty they are refunding me the purchase price.",

He rides it to school from our property, across a small trail, and over to the school and we haven't had any issues yet. It's been cold, so he doesn't ride on days where it's expected to be below freezing, but he's ridden it on days where it's above 32, locks it up, and rides it home in the afternoon. It keeps it's charge all day and the wheels do well for where he needs to go. Assembly was easy and fast with our Prime membership. I would purchase this product again.",
