I hope that these will withstand the test of time and don't break anytime soon. They also fit nicely in my ears and don't fall out easily! UPDATE: Sadly I am going to have to return these headphones. After a month or so of use there are too many flaws. For some reason the headphone jack doesn't fit correctly and comes out VERY easily. Every time I walk with these in, the jack comes out my phone in my pocket several times. The lack of volume buttons is also very frustrating.",

I have had Sennheiser in ear headphones before from a similar price bracket and they were absolutely brilliant, clear and bassy. These new ones are awful, they genuinely sound like they're not working correctly however, after contacting amazon I have been told they are. There is little to no bass, the mid range dominates and is raspy and the high range is dull and irritating. These really are bad, I have completely wasted my money and hope no one else does.",

The cable is strong and sturdy and you get a choice of earpads to fit on. Unfortunately I couldn't quite find a perfect fit - they are not as comfortable as my previous pair. The main issue I have is that. you CANNOT adjust the volume from the remote on the cable. This is quite annoying when listening to music and it is disappointing that these are supposed to be a higher spec than my previous pair but they have less functionality.",
