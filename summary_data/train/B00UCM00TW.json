However looking at it you would not be able to tell. But what really upscaled the look of this lamp are the crystals. They don't look cheap they have a high gloss beautiful shine that looks real. They are not cheap looking plastic crystals. I love the look. For the price you can't expect metal and real crystals but this is definitely a quality look. I bought it to pair with a high end lamp and they work well together.",

The patterns it projects around it with any clear lightbulb are stunning.

I tried it in my crystal table lamp yesterday and everyone at work was stunned at the ever changing firework display! It was the perfect pairing. Watch the video.",

But unless you touch them, you'd never know it. Plus everyone saying it came missing a crystal or two...it brings a bag with 3 crystal replacements! I'm glad I bet on these. They are awesome.",

Finally I got a 25w Edison bulb (3rd pic) & got the look I wanted. So, if you want the neat reflection, go with an Edison bulb. If you want enough light to read, go with 40w incandescent. I did not try LED bulbs at all.",
