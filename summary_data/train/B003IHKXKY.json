When it slide back the tire rubs on the boat hull. I tightened it to the point where the U bolt starts to deform & I don't want to bend the rim of the wheel. Maybe inner surface of the U bolt needs to be rough to prevent sliding.",

This mount was a lot cheaper than the pre made mount and the tire is closer to the body of the trailer. Build your own mount with this u-bolt . I recommend for the DIY person.",
