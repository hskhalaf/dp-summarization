      "text": "I am 78 years old and my car is 7 years old and I travel a lot. I have not used the ABN portable LED flares yet, but I feel relieved to have them in my car in case I would have a break down. The bright orange flare lights have 9 modes of flashes and can be seen from a long distance so that others drivers realize there is a broken down car and have time to move over. The flares have a magnet on the back to attach to the car or they can be place on the road . They come with batteries installed.",

      "text": "This LED road flare has four more flashing lights (16) compared to other LED road flares that have 12 LED light. In side by side comparisons, the ABN road flare was brighter than the 12 LED road flares. Also, I really light the color (dark orange) and the \"rubbery\" feel to this style of road flare. My other reservation about this product is that there is no flashlight mode. The small outside loop can be used to attach the road flare to a backpack as a safety beacon when walking at night.",

      "text": "Bought these LED safety lights for my teenage son. He is a new driver and we live in a rural community that lacks steet lights on many of our roads. Although he hasn\u2019t had to use them yet, they are great. They are bright, and easy to adjust and switch to different emergency signals. The fact that the lights are magnetic is also wonderful. The magnet is strong and stuck to the car securely. My husband plans to take one on the boat with him on his fishing trip this spring. These are a great investment.",
