The delivery guys brought it inside which save me and my husband the hassle. It Is much bigger than I imagined in a great way. Now the sectional is just fantastic - it grey with light grey stitching - I absolutely adore it and it is very comfortable. It matches well with my neutral decor ! For the price it is well worth it. If you decide to buy I highly recommend through Amazon- I was able to schedule shipping and it arrived on time . Very pleased 'nn",

And it is a bit cheaply made (it squeaks and creeks already and we have had it 2 months), but I guess that is to be expected with the price we paid. I like it otherwise. It fits my husband and I plus my mother-in-law, father-in-law, our 5 & 6 year old and our 1 year old. very nice overall.",

You literally have to use a drill to get the holes started, and even then, the fabric undercover gets tangled within the drill when drilling the holes. The plastic feet feel cheap as well but are functional.
