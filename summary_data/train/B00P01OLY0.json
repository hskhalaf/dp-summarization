We use it for a 50-50 drawing at our club meetings to add a little bit of whimsy. This manual rotating cage replaces our vintage little battery operated lotto numbers cage that bit the dust. For the price it will meet out needs. I will probably coat the numbers with some clear nail polish as I can see where they could start to wear away otherwise.",

It doesn\u2019t have the Letter on the ball so unless you know what letters the number falls under it takes a second tocall it out. The machine moves when you go to turn it so sometimes if you jerk it the balls all roll out of the spot on the board that is connected to the bottom of the wheel. But it worked for what I needed for my kids bday party. And I love that it is compact. A couple size bigger would have been perfect tho.",

It works great because everyone enjoys the clatter of the bingo balls - we set up on camera phone just on the cage. The board that holds the numbers after they have been called is great, as is the fact that the set comes with a few blank balls if one goes missing. One downside- after only a few uses, some of the numbers appear to be running off a bit, but we'll use a Sharpie to resolve that situation if necessary. A great addition to family game night!",

Conveniently comes with some game sheets and 5 extra blank balls in case one of the Bingo balls should go missing. Just a note -- if you were planning to give this to a senior : the balls are rather small and might be hard to handle for those with arthritis. However, for the price, it's a good Bingo game for those who want to play at home with family and friends.",
