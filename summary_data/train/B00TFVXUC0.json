      "text": "This bottle capper works great and is easy to use. I opened some bottles of home brew from my first batch that I put in used, sanitized bottles. The caps sealed well and the beer had good carbonation. These are the first bottles that I capped with this and I had no \"duds\". I tried the capper on an empty bottle initially to see how it worked. Just be sure the cap is reasonably centered on the capper (it has a magnet to hold cap) and apply pressure on handles slowly until they \"give\" a little as the cap is crimped on. The bottles cannot be the twist off cap type. Definitely a good purchase!",
