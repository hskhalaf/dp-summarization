Most of the colored balms seems too light or are off for my complexion (Fenty #330) The nude honey is not flattering on me at all, it's too flat. The others I can make work by mixing with either lipstick or gloss to warm up/deepen the colors. I like the clear, because I don't have to worry about any color not matching my complexion. Otherwise, I like the balms, they're light, not sticky, smell nice and do have a slight stinging sensation that isn't painful.",
