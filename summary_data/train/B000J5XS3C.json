Unfortunately, the mixer is extremely limited. You can't run audio to your headphones while using the USB connection (which doesn't make any sense to me at all). What's worse -- Behringer knows this is a limitation but doesn't make a note of it anywhere in the descriptions of the product. Do yourself a favor and splurge on something a little more powerful than this thing. It has a small footprint, but the limitations are simply not worth it.",

I have used it for live recordings and it turned out well. Is it GREAT? No, but it absolutely works, and for the price its totally worth it!!",

When I opened this one and saw the same connector, I was admittedly confused. It's a definite design flaw. That said, I have no plans of moving this thing around, so it's not a huge deal for me.

      "text": "For what this does you can't go wrong for the price! I have a small recording setup and play guitar (and bass) with friends. This little mixer gets both of those jobs done right. Sure a more expensive mixer might be able to tweek your vocals or instruments more, but all I needed was a way to mix up to 4 inputs at at time and out put to my speakers and laptop for recording. It does all of those jobs well. There is no hum when the unit is on. I have two small grips though..and they are minor...the EQ isn't that great and the volume to the headphones is lower than I like. Maybe I'm going deaf.",

Plenty of inputs, plenty of outputs although i was slightly disappointing not to have xlr outputs and it is a little annoying having them straight up rather than out the back. The mixer has a little background noise but it becomes non noticeable once you start playing something through the speakers. Great little mixer, and i expect that it will last for a long time.",

The 2-bus 2-track & main mix functions allow for flexibility to add & subtract certain sound sources at the push of a button, and it's small enough to fit snugly into my 3-tier desktop workstation. A great deal for under $50!",

The build quality is on par with other Behringer products (read: all but perfect), noise is not an issue (SNR 110dB), the \"British\" (haha) style EQ is clean and the thing just works. I too complain of no power button. A soft-on toggle/rocker would have been a nice addition, given the recommended power-on procedure (Connect power supply to board, then plug supply into the wall) but I suppose it could be easily solved with a remote control outlet.",

And this little cost efficient devil is SOLID. Built well, and uses great. If your looking for pro level spend a bit more, but if you have a small home studio, podcast studio, or some other small enterprise audio this little devil is your saving grace.",
