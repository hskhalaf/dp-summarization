Went through 4 clips in 18 months. Fitbit did replace them at no charge, which was awesome of them. It died after about a year and a half.",

Battery has lasted 2 months at the most and as little as one week. TERRIBLE customer service as they lie about the battery life and make excuses instead of fixing the issue. This is my fourth one and all have done the same very consistently. And they simply don't last. For that reason I am going to find a better option instead of spending $50 on junk. Fitbit, fix the problem or sell them for less than $20. Or no one will buy them anymore.",

I like that the information automatically syncs with and updates on my computer.",
