I haven't tested it out with other games but I could see myself going back and playing the old supersmash with it. Overall it has a great battery life and I'm very happy with the product. It holds up well after use.",

I'd love to see Nintendo offer Circle Pad Pro support for Super Smash Bros., however.",

The only drawback to the device it blocks the stylus and cartridge slots so you will have to remove the device in order to remove the stylus or remove/switch the cartridge, but it's not a big deal breaker.

      "text": "I purchased the Circle Pad Pro not only for the added analog stick support, but also to provide a more comfortable grip for my 3DS (as my hand often hurt after extended gaming sessions). The stick support is exactly what I expected (it works great for Monster Hunter), but the overall grip isn't nearly as ergonomic as I would have liked. I'm happy I bought it, but was definitely expecting something better.",
