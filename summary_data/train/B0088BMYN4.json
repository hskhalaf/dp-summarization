The watch is a little heavy and bulky but I like that look. Every time I where it I receive at least one complement. I have dropped the watch on pavement and only had a couple scratches which shoes its durability. I have yet to get watch clean and polished and it still looks shiny after 4 months of owning it. I highly doubt I'll use all the features like the chronograph but these features distinguish it's worth while displaying it's sporty/ causal design",

Despite the fact the watch is really well made and extremely precise, starting from the placement of hands until keeping the time, the steel strap however feels very cheap, which is a big turn off when buying a watch. You could tell by the retelling noise the bracelet produces when moving the watch. I usually don't experience that in expensive watches such as this one, I'd rather experience it with cheap fake watches as they try to execute under a low budget. I love the watch but I'm very disappointed with the rattling noise in the steel strap makes.",

It weighs so much that I believe it can also be used as a doorstop! Although I would not recommend it...lol. I like the sweeping motion of the second hand. It adds an elegant touch for me. Great watch! Thanks NEthing4U!!",

      "text": "Purchased this watch almost a week ago, and I could not be happier with my decision. Just as a fair warning to anyone thinking about buying this watch, it is a BIG watch. The face alone is about 3/4 inches deep, and 2 inches long and wide. I have fairly small wrists, so it does look a bit oversized, but I knew that about this watch before I purchased it. My local macys had this watch on display so I was able to see it before I bought it. I would recommend the same thing to anyone that is questions if they should buy this or not.",

This watch demands attention, the only thing is that its impossible to see in the dark but I always carry my cell phone so who really cares. You can see the carbon fiber face, the second hand is smooth and the face is actually curved. Great buy, highly recommend and worth the $799.00 retail price ....Thanks amazon for saving me over 60%",

Quartz movement. 300 meters / 1000 feet water resistance. Fixed bezel. Scratch Resistant Mineral crystal. Solid caseback. Fold Over with Single Push Button Release clasp. Screw Down crown. Case size 46.5 mm x 18 mm. Band 22 mm x 9 incheslong. Bulova 96B175 Precisionist Watch.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Precisionist Collection. Featuring Bulova\u2019s proprietary Precisionist accuracy, this advanced chronograph offers 1/1,000-second precision over a twelve-hour time frame, with accuracy to within seconds a year. In stainless steel with curved crystal, multiple-layer black carbon fiber, blue, silver and black dial, chronograph measurement of hours, minutes, seconds, 1/10-seconds, 1/100-seconds and 1/1,000-seconds, yellow continuously sweeping second hand, luminous hour and minute hands, luminous markers, tachymeter, calendar, screw-back case, screw-down crown, double-press fold-over clasp with safety lock, and water resistance to 300 meters.\n\nProviding an extraordinary level of timing accuracy, the Bulova Precisionist Chronograph is the only chronograph to combine stopwatch timing to 1/1,000-second with Bulova\u2019s exclusive Precisionist-class torsional resonator movement, proven in laboratory testing to be one of the world\u2019s most accurate.\n\nEasy and logical to read, each style features four subdials to display the cumulative time at a single glance, with individual measurements on the combined 1/10- and 1/100-second counter, as well as the hour and minute dials, dual-duty floating second hand, and a distinctive 1/1,000-second track with retrograde indicator.\n\n\n\nPrecisionist Technology\n\nAt the heart of the watch is the Bulova Precisionist-class torsional resonator movement, custom-engineered to provide accuracy to within seconds a year using a three-prong quartz crystal that creates a vibration frequency of 262.144 kHz, the highest of any watch in the world and far greater than that of a standard quartz crystal. In laboratory testing, the Precisionist-class movement has been shown to be three times more accurate than standard quartz. This proprietary manufactured movement, including the signature floating second hand, also offers a resistance to gravitational error that makes it superior in performance to any mechanical watch on the market.\n\nSummary of Features\n\nPrecision timing to 1/1,000th of a second12-hour chronograph functionOne of the world\u2019s most accurate movements \u2013 accurate to within seconds a yearPrecisionist-class torsional resonator movement proven in laboratory testing to be three times more accurate than standard quartzStainless steel case and braceletCurved mineral crystalMultiple-layer black carbon fiber, blue and silver dialYellow continuously sweeping second handLuminous hour and minute handsLuminous markersCalendar windowTachymeterScrew-backScrew-down crownWater resistant to 300 metersAbout Bulova\n\nIn 1875, Joseph Bulova, a 23-year-old immigrant, set up shop in New York City and a legendary American watch brand was born. Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder.\n\nA pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men\u2019s (1919) and ladies\u2019 (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory \u2013 located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined \u201cto serve those who served us,\u201d Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world\u2019s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969).\n\nToday, as one of the world\u2019s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.\n\nThe signature Bulova brand provides an extensive selection of watches for every occasion, crafted of the finest materials, including 315L surgical grade stainless steel, diamonds, mother-of-pearl, carbon fiber, top-quality leather and Bulova\u2019s proprietary Duramic nylon/ceramic composite, and powered by Precisionist-class quartz, automatic and quartz movements.
