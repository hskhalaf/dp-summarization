      "text": "I just received this and tried it on, and the neck is indeed very tight, as several other reviewers have said. I knew that going in, but thought it wouldn't be a problem because I have a slender-to-average-size neck. But it is really super-tight, to the point of being uncomfortable, particularly if you bend your neck slightly to look down instead of straight ahead. Otherwise, it is a great suit and seems really well made. But I'm on the fence about keeping this because of the neck problem. Fit information: I'm 6 feet, 160 pounds, and the 12 fits well--snug but comfortable.",

      "text": "Bought this size 8 for my GF who is 5-1, 115lbs, big chest. Fits fine though the material going up the neck was very tight. She fixed it by cutting the entire elastic/faux leather material going up the neck so now the suit ends at the base of her neck. Problem solved. Think this Phantom wet suit overall fits somewhat small as a size 6 for her would have been too small. So far so good for her in this Phantom Aquatics wetsuit snorkeling and boogie boarding in Makena Maui.",

It was her first wetsuit and it took awhile to figure out how to put it on and use properly. One she got it on--and she looks great in it!--she really enjoyed being able to swim with the added support. The water was warm enough that she didn't really need it per se, but she appreciated the extra support and protection. A great wetsuit all in all. This will be getting lots more use.",

My friend swims in endurance races, and the river and streams of western Pennsylvania are fairly chilly in the spring and early summer, when many of them take place. She reports that the suit provided adequate warm, and wasn't binding for swimming. She said she likes it enough that she would have bought it for herself if I hadn't given it to her. Seems to be a solid, well-made product that lives up to its claims.",

      "text": "Lake Superior has many nice swimming areas, but the waters are so cold that you can usually not stay in for more than 20 minutes even in late July without getting very chilled. In some areas, where deep waters lie close offshore, the water never gets much above icy. Wearing a full wetsuit would certainly help keep you warmer, but would look pretty dorky for casual beach swimming. This shorty wetsuit is a perfect compromise, greatly conserving your core body heat (and making that initial plunge somewhat less shocking) while still looking sporty and sexy. This suit looks very well made, and fits our teenage daughter very well. It makes me want one for myself.",

This is more of a Spring suit if you want to go in the ocean, currently I use it at the pool to stay warm and protect myself from the sun. I used to have a rash guard for that but so happy I have this now. Also make sure that you go by the sizing chart from manufacturer, I'm usually a size 4 and a 6 was snug on me. I should have gotten a size up.",
