I could see my dog and my cats scratched and bitten wounds from their attempts to stop the bites, and other issues on their skin, clear up in a couple of days.

Any way after about 2 weeks the spots that were spreading cleared up and the dogs hair grew back in quickly. I don't know what he had but Zymox took care of it.",

I've tried other brands but they do nothing. This keeps him from chewing is paws bald! I try to attack the areas 1-3x a day and then maintain once a day to alleviate his symptoms throughout season. I've been trying to only order from seller AmazonLLC. We've ordered many times via click to buy and have occasionally gotten the 0.5% hydrocortisone, which I find not effective. No worries with Amazon and their great return policy for wrong items.",
