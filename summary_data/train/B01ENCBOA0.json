I have noticed that the area that was thinning is no longer as bad. Hair is growing and I no longer feel like there's a bald spot on top of my head. All I have to say is that this bottle is worth the money. I am including 2 pictures. Before and after so far.",

Most shampoos nowadays are rather gentle in composition, as a majority of people wash their hair every day. As a result the gentle shampoos don't totally clear out the pores, resulting in hampered hair growth. While Biotin is gentle, using it as directed provides total cleansing and the ingredients stimulate hair growth. Try it for yourself. I think you'll be very pleased with the results!",

While I do not believe Vitamins can be absorbed and utilized through the Scalp, I do however like this Shampoo as an \"alternate\". I used it every day for the first 3 weeks, and thought it's okay, but not good enough as my only \"stand-alone\" Shampoo. So, I started alternating it with my Nioxin and together they seemed to work better. I'd buy it a second time. Smells good, foams good, price is good. BUT, only to use it as a secondary shampoo every other day Max. I have NO science to back this up. My hair just seems to like Variety.",

Well, lo and behold, after a month's use the bald spot is almost completely gone. Even my husband noticed and he never notices anything! I will continue using this product. Def recommend this.",
