It has a divider inside that you can freeze to help keep a separate compartment cool, however when the divider froze, it expanded and wouldn't fit into the slot all that well. It's also bulky, but I needed to carry a lot. Overall I am very pleased and recommend it.",

Keeps one bag of ice at least 2 days in full 90 degree heat. It can certainly hold 3 or more large bags of ice alone. One bag is good with all the other items we put in it.",

I had hoped it would work like carry on luggage where you could pull the cooler up stairs using the hard plastic back to slide it up each stair. However, this design has a lip on the back and doesn't allow you to pull it up a stair or over an object smoothly.",
