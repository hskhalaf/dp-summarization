I downloaded the latest synaptics drivers from the Lenovo site. Upon installation, i got the blue screen of death. At the bottom of the screen, it showed an error message with the word \"synaptics\" in there so I know they are related. Restarted and reinstalled. It was successful. After about 10 minutes of use, blue screen again. Twice in 20 minutes seems like an issue, and I'm not prepared to deal with it after spending big bucks on this laptop. Returned for a refund. Will try something else.",

The touch screen is awesome for viewing PDFs (blue prints and such) super quick, battery life isn't bad (about 6hrs). I have been tethering with my cell phone and it kills both batteries pretty quickly. I just ordered a 4g card and plan on activating it through Verizon. I use it with the 1 link and my 24\" monitor and cordless mouse and keyboard and hard wired Ethernet and it is great. Replaced my desktop Only complaint so far is it seems to drop wifi signal randomly. I tried updating the firmware and it still happens.",

The touchpad is a nightmare, scrolling with two fingers will activate right clicking. Always clicking on random stuff when moving the mouse witth the touch pad. the multi function bar/touch screen thing doesn't always work and its a hassle to go through the 3 menu system. The screen has a film layer that makes it look hazy. One of bottom screws cant tighten properly so there is play (not tight). I have bought thinkpads before and they were always solid. This might be one of the nightmares of buying something online unseen.",
