I had to find a similar cabinet online and print some out just to get an idea of how it went together. there are no downloadable or printable directions for this Exact model. 2). The back panel should have been two different sizes but the three panels were all the same size so they didn\u2019t fall in a seam. And I was only given one channel piece to join them together should have been 2",
