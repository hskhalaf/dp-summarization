However, it's way too lightweight to handle tilling through compacted soil and it definitely cannot til through sod. Even with the jobs it can handle it's so light weight that its hard to control and it hops around. We have contemplated finding a way to strap some weight on the top of it which would dramatically improve the functionality.",

Good, solid tines and the outside two can be removed to till about 12\" wide instead of 18\"; that will be great in the summer to break up the walking paths in the gardens. On my first use I managed to find the main cable feed to the house and wrap it 3 times around the shaft of the tines. It barely slowed the motor down!",

They are missing a step or two and not particularly easy to follow. Fortunately it was not hard to figure out on my own and there are only a few pieces to put together.

Have only had a chance to use it once, on ground that had previously been worked last year. Tiller Joe blazed through it with no problems. easily going to max depth. My only concern at this time is the handles seem a bit flimsy for this type of unit, where in use, you could put some real leverage on them, particularly if tilling unworked ground. They are not sturdy and do flex and wobble when turning or lifting the unit. Time will tell it they hold up. The motor and tines seem powerful enough for the purpose.",

I will say this though, there were two of us working in tandem; one was operating the tiller and the other was feeding the cord and making sure the cord stayed out of the way of the tiller; once we got our movements orchestrated it went very well.",

Easy start no hassles with pull cords or chokes or smelly gasoline & it is very light but the tines tore up the wild grass down to the roots. Very eat to clean & what it costs to rent a low level gas tiller you can have the mini hulk for life.",

Afterwards, I constructed 12' x 4' raised beds and filled them with soil and amendments. I used the tiller to mix it up. It does a great job.
