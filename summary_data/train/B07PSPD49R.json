I\u2019m in my 40\u2019s and keep seeing women in my age of life and older with this beautiful shine to their faces. I\u2019ve literally been on a quest to figure out how to get my skin to look like this! One day I was talking to a friend (who has that shine), and she told me her skincare regime. I bought everything she uses and have found that these drops are the secret ingredient to that glow!! I mix a few drops with my moisturizer every morning and night. It really is my favorite of all the new products I started using.",
