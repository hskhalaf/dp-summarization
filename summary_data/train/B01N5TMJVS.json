It's difficult to set the glass on with the rocks in place. If you set the glass first and pour the rocks they bounce everywhere. I didn't like the size of the rocks. I thought they could be bigger. Less to pick up when they spill everywhere. The fuel is expensive. Can't use cheap alternative fuel. Has to be alcohol so there is no soot.",

I also suggest using a funnel to fill so you don't splash the flammable liquid everywhere. Love this and will buy a bigger one at some point",

It really looks beautiful as it gets darker outside. There are no odors or smoke or residue that builds up on the glass. I didn't use all the while little pebbles provided, just enough to cover decoratively.",
