I don't think we could have known how to fix the gear issue without them. Other than that great times!",

We have a young toddler who sits on the front with a mounted bike seat (Peg Perego - perfect fit) and the three of us ride comfortably for 30-60 minute rides. Can't speak for anyone who lives in hilly areas, as we enjoy mostly flat routes, but we give it a thumbs-up and a definite recommendation!",
