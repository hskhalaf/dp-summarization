When it's empty it is really light, my 7 year old has no problem maneuvering it. When it's full, depending on what you've vacuumed up, it's still manageable. All around love this thing!",

It has excellent suction and I can't get it to run down - not after almost 15 minutes of vacuuming. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had the old style wall mount that automatically charged the unit. I subtracted one star because of the need to plug in the charging cord. The mount is fine, but it only holds the vac, and doesn't charge until you plug in the cord. But - surely worth the 4 stars - works great.",

The charging stand is easy to use and small enough to stay out of the way. The vac retains its charge for a reasonable length of use, and is relatively easy to clean. I would buy it again.",

I'd say it worked adequately for a bit less than 2 years, averaging about 10 minutes of use per week - not a total waste of money but now destined for the landfill.

      "text": "For a cordless handvac, this has strong suction, and it holds its charge for a good, long time. Unfortunately, there is no charge indicator to let you know when the battery is low or when it is charging or when it is full -- this is a MAJOR design flaw. The flip-up brush is a great idea, but the bristles are stiff and super short (0.25 inches), which makes it fairly useless for doing what you typically would want a brush to do. If all you are looking for is strong suction, this is a great option, but if you want versatility and user-friendly design, definitely look elsewhere.",
