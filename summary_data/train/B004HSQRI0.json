I'm feeding this to my dragon along with a salad that varies between kale, collar greens, carrots, squash, bok choi, and occasionally apples or strawberries. I'm also feeding him live crickets whenever I can find them on my pet store. (I ordered some online too). So far my dragon seems happy and healthy. I do not recommend feeding these alone as the dry food could constipate the dragon, so make sure you feed some fresh greens too and that the drago stays hydrated. All in all, great buy.",
