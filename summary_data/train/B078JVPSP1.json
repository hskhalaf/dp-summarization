It came on time exactly as I was promised. I would recommend this hover board. The company Tomoloo seems to really value their customers satisfaction. What a nice little treat Tomoloo. Thank you.",

All the ones that I was reading about they would be shipped to you broken, have to pay for shipping, problems with Bluetooth, Etc... Tomoloo never had any bad reviews, or complaints! We got ours and it was completely perfect! If I am ever in search of a new hoverboard I will definitely order from here! I highly recommend! The shipping was super fast, love the price, love the color, love the Bluetooth capability and lights! My daughter cannot stay off of it! She loves her hoverboard!",

She gave in and, though they took longer to master the ride, they now are avid fans as well. It has been a hit for boys and girls and an age span.",

Then one day, it began shutting off unexpectedly, causing the rider to be violently thrown off. We had purchased the extended warranty for an additional $24.99, so I was hopeful the problem could be fixed or the hoverboard could be replaced. WRONG. The techs at the extended warranty company told me this problem was caused by a defective battery, which was not covered by the warranty. A replacement battery sells for $70 on Amazon. So, not only does this product represent a significant safety hazard, it turned out to be a total ripoff, including the worthless extended warranty.",

(3) After searching the internet, appears that the issue is lack of weight on the sensor points. Can be somewhat mitigated by placing feet wide apart. However , rattling still there which was not an issue with prior hover boards. Once up to speed the rattle fades.",

Even though I don\u2019t like the beeping I like how the hoverboard is safe, the wheels have good grip, turning is great, and I just overall love this hoverboard.
