      "text": "I replaced my cheap non-tempered glass screen protector that came with my Switch protective case with this one. This is definitely a million times better since it's glass and covers the entire screen from edge to edge. I had no problem installing the screen protector. It adhered easily to the screen and didn't even leave bubbles. The only qualm I have was that the hinge stickers were a bit too sticky that they left sticky marks on the plastic edge of my Switch. I was able to remove them using a damp cloth though so it's fine now. Overall, I recommend this screen protector.",

The trick is to set the protector down and use the soft card to force air out from the center first towards the edges other wise you can get air bubble trapped in the center of the screen. I took me 2 attempts to get right but i am 100% happy with the end result.",

After all, I looked at a video on hooking it up to the TV and there the fact that I should buy the screen protector \"before\" I put the unit in the holder. The instructions were so clear and once done; I had practically no bubbles. Great Product...even for Seniors!!!",

Also, the instructions don\u2019t show how to hinge the glass. My biggest complaint is that the hinge sticker will leave a glue residue when you peel it off. Just make sure you place the hinge sticker at a place that doesn\u2019t have grooves or indents.",

Not happy, as this doesn't happen with other protectors. Also once I flatten and press the protector on I see these weird distorting lines that I think is a result of the way the protector fell on the screen. I cleaned my screen and perfectly aligned it so I don't know what's up as this has never happened with others.",
