I bent down to pick it up...thinking it was something I'd ordered for my car, when to my amazement, it was this kit. I became so excited that I challenged my son to a quick game. Before I knew it, the entire neighborhood was over enjoying my pool table. There we no complaints about the quality of the kit...and once again, I'm the \"belle\" of the neighborhood.",

      "text": "The set seems like a good value overall but I noticed that the 4 ball is significantly smaller than the others. Not sure if it's a factory defect or if they put the wrong ball in the box but I gues everything else is ok. The problem with the 4 ball being smaller is that you can never get a tight rack.",
