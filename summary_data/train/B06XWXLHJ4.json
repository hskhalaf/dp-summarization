The center fabric that goes under the mattress is actually good fabric! Not the flimsy stuff on other inexpensive bedskirts. It was obviously wrinkled when it came out of the package so I ironed in on low heat even though the label say NO IRON. It was fine. The fabric is thick enough to not be see through. There are pleats (not open corners) on the corners. Over all I am very pleased with the purchase.",

A bit polyester-y but that works to its advantage as far as drape goes and doesn't hurt it since you'll never be touching it. It hangs beautifully and is exactly what I was looking for.",
