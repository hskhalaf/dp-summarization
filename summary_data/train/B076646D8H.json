      "text": "Absolutely do not buy this product. The most recent Windows up date completely bricked reliable usage of this. The audio switches off when switches applications. This is consistent with multiple monitor setups. You constantly have to unplug and re plug. No driver support and poor customer service. Just buy the Scarlet 2i4o. It's on sale and I immediately know the difference. I wanted to like this so bad but the lack of support drives home my decision to return. Focusrite is the way to go. I immediately could tell the quality difference.",

Their customer service is also ridiculously slow and wanted me to try to fix a laundry list of things to get it to work with windows 8.1 - it was overloading my OS's audio buffer and causing my audio to completely cut out, in some cases even FREEZING the entire program I was recording with. I record podcasts and that was unacceptable. Did half the list and decided the thing wasn't worth the money. The Mackie Producer was completely, beautifully, plug and play, and produces incredible sound quality. Seriously, it's also $50 cheaper and has not had an issue with my Windows OS at ALL. A superior product.",

It doesn\u2019t heat up it doesn\u2019t crash and more importantly it works better than you can imagine and we would gladly put it up against some of the other pricey devices available now!",

Its sounds clean and Awesome. I can get somethings done on the go for sure. The latency is incredible. I havent tried it at 192khz or with midi yet on other DAW's. Twist the knobs all the way to learn the limits. Make 1 -3 test tracks to adjust audio. It works great.",

The mackie driver is not the best and the interface is already showing signs of wear/ageing after 8 months. The volume pot on my interface produces a terrible noise/static when turning. The noise does not affect recording, but holy cow is it loud and annoying (and probably not good for my monitors.) *update: The static/noise that results from turning the volume pot has gotten much worse. I'm now shopping for a new audio interface. The Mackie is less than a year old.",

No apparent glare from overloading the mic preamp once the levels are set properly. Also, noise is very low. This suggests that the mic preamps have quite good dynamic range. This product is going to be hard to beat. Its relatively low price makes this an excellent value.",
