The nice detachable control panel helps with those larger items, and it seems to be pretty accurate right out of the box. I'm not going to review the features for you, but for the average ebay-er or home retailer, this works fine for getting your stuff out there. Works with envelopes as well, so you can pretty much do your posting from home if you are sending things out via USPS. I'd buy it again.",

Great scale and I would recommend it to anyone.",

The company has never responded to my emails or online contact requests. Having said that the customer support is non-existent, the scale itself works great. We purchased it as a replacement for an earlier model that just wore out (that one did stay on until turned off!).",
