      "text": "I love this mouse, and over the years I have bought several of them. Good value for the price: a well-built, well-designed product that works flawlessly. I customized the left-side button command as \"back\" and the wheel button as \"forward (browser)\" -- as a result, browsing on the internet with this mouse is a joy -- click, click, click! UPDATE 2-26-12: After years of using the Microsoft 3000 mouse, I recently switched to the Logitech M305 Wireless Mouse ($17-$20), which I quickly concluded is a much better notebook mouse! In my opinion, wireless is the way to go: However, if a wireless mouse is not your thing, I would definitely recommend the Microsoft 3000.",

I would have to hold my fingers in an awkward claw-like grasp and contort my thumb to be able to use the buttons on this thing. Amazon wanted $8.50 to return it.

Unfortunately, these are hard to find in stores (wireless mice seem to be dominant). I recommend this product - I really like the small form-factor and find it much more usable than larger mice.",

The buttons feel flimsy and you can feel the springs pop when you release the buttons. Feels really awkward in your hand. I ended up returning mine. Disappointed, since I like the look of this mouse but did not realize until it arrived it was too small and uncomfortable.",

One criticism I have of this mouse for full-time use is that the rubberized coating on the sides picks up grime and eventually sheds and peels. (I'm talking about years of active use here).",

Personally I prefer the cord over a mouse where you have to snap the USB thingie into it to turn it off. If they made a cordless mouse just like this with an on/off switch, I'd be first in line. * If you use with Vista the screen flickers some. I use it with Vista anyway because I love the mouse.
