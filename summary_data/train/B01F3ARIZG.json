When we opened the product it had everything as described and a nice personal note inside! It was fun, thoughtful, exciting, creative, and interesting all wrapped inside of one box! Once again, after reading the reviews from other customers, I figured this was the most promising and complete box out there. My expectations were exceeded.",

I wish there were more, blank-er labels to write more info in. This kit is not all-inclusive, and you may have to buy more ingredients, but it is super fun and worth the buy.",

But I would suggest having a third vessel ready for the finished product. The directions are good, but not great. Make sure the user has some minor cooking skills because the directions do leave a little to be desired. This is a cute gift and I would recommend it for someone.",

The ingredients were well kept and smelled fresh, despite being dried. The sauces, of course, taste great, and I think this would be a great activity for a parent-child. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because I thought the recipes that came along were few and some required multiple ingredients that didn't come with the kit. So, really, I could only make two of the recipes, and while delicious, I would have enjoyed greater variety or more ingredients within.",
