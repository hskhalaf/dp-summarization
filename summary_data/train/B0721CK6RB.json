I love going hiking and having my iMax Alarm hanging from neck really gives me the confidence to go off trail! The Alarm is so loud that anyone will be able to hear me if I get lost! It's also more discreet and convenient that pepper spray. I am getting my mom and sisters all one. They make great gifts!",

You put it on your key chain, pull the whole thing off of the D- ring part, and then put it back when you need to. Also, the sound is very loud and audible. I am glad that I bought this for her.

It is really annoying. What is even more annoying is I spend over $22 dollars on 2 alarms that could only be functional for two years.

Call the Police\" and \"Help! I'm in danger!\". That'll really stop an attacker if they think the police is being called. Also, the pin is very hard to pull. If you're being attacked, I don't see how you can fight off an attacker & pull the pin at the same time unless it's hanging around your neck in which a lanyard was included.",

You have to manually pull it apart for it to do its job. To me, that's a blind design flaw because a simple hole or loop on the main body would make this a true full featured personal alarm.",
