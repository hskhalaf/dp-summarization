My \"mid-60's\" had left me with a lot less strength in my quads and calves then I had as a runner most of my life. First tries proved pretty funny! I found myself shaking, falling off and almost spinning around. But, with placing it near a counter top in the kitchen and practicing on it several times a day for a few minutes at a time, I've begun to find my balance again and feeling stronger. It's low profile gives you courage since coming off it isn't a long way to fall! I would recommend this product. The price seems very fair for the quality of the board.",
