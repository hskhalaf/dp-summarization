I think that is normal when it got heated up at the first time. no smells after the first use, I have no complaints on that. One thing that bothers me is, even filling up water to the full level, can only last maximum of 6 mins, that is not enough time for me to enjoy the steam. Will get fully satisfied if it can last a bit longer.",

I purchased this steamer because at the time, steamers seemed quite dangerous, I've seen reviews of others cheaper steamers spouting hot water on people's faces YIKES! So I decided to go with this one. A negative is that it's expensive.",
