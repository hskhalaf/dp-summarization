With Genius l-aginine, I saw an complete reduction of lactic acid develop/sore muscles after even my most intense training sessions. The pump I experienced during these workout was second to none, I even stopped taking other pre workouts all together. Taking just 1 serving per day - 30 minutes prior to training, has become my new tradition and superstition. With that being said, this is the best l-aginine I have EVER used. 10/10 recommend trying this supplement",

This product is very pure and effective. I mix one scoop with Genius Pre and get the added nitric oxide benefits and endurance benefits of arginine. I get a great pump and cardiovascular support that greatly benefits my workout. 5 grams per scoop with 30 servings per container.",
