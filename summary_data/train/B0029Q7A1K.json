    "description": "Color:Red/Clear| Style:Micro CaseThis water-resistant, crushproof case is ideal for rugged activities. It will keep your expensive GPS, cell phones and other electronics and documents safe and secure.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nANATOMY OF A PELICAN MICRO CASE\n ULTIMATE EQUIPMENT PROTECTION\n For over 30 years Pelican has built a reputation for manufacturing the toughest cases in the world. As a matter of fact, we invented the category. Over these years we've seen our cases used for some fairly crazy activities...and important ones too.\n\n Pelican Micro Cases are created for your smaller items. Micro Cases look and function in the same way as the larger Pelican Cases, but are designed to protect your cell phone, iPod, camera, and other small items. Many of the cases are water resistant and crushproof, or impact resistant to provide maximum protection for your valuables. These cases will get your gear from point A to point B in the condition it's meant to be in: intact and functional.\n\nSTRONGER BY DESIGN\n Pelican Cases are made with a proprietary combination of homo and co-polymers, using an open cell core and solid wall construction, which is stronger and lighter than a solid core wall. Stainless steel pins are used in hinges and handles.\n\nWATERTIGHT\n The secret is the tongue and groove fit with a polymer O-ring acting as a waterproof seal. Some models come with the Automatic Pressure Equalization Valve which balances interior pressure, keeping water out while making the case easy to open.\n\n LINER FOR EXTRA PROTECTION\n Your valuables should be protected on the inside as well as the outside. Pelican Micro Cases contain a shock absorbent liner to minimize damage to contents in tough situations.\n\nMICRO CASE COMPARISON\nModelExterior Dimensions (Inches)Interior Dimensions (Inches)CertificatesAutomatic Pressure Equalization Valve10105.88 x 4.06 x 2.124.37 x 2.87 x 1.68IP67Yes10156.68 x 3.88 x 1.865.14 x 2.64 x 1.37 Yes10206.82 x 4.75 x 2.125.31 x 3.56 x 1.68IP67Yes10307.50 x 3.87 x 2.436.37 x 2.62 x 2.06IP67Yes10407.50 x 5.06 x 2.126.50 x 3.87 x 1.75IP67Yes10507.50 x 5.06 x 3.126.31 x 3.68 x 2.75IP67Yes10609.37 x 5.56 x 2.628.25 x 4.25 x 2.25IP67YesCertificate IP67 (1 meter submersion for 30 minutes)\n\nMICRO ICASE COMPARISON\nFull Use of Your Electronics: i1010 and i1015 Micro Cases feature a specially designed external jack allows you to listen to music on your device while providing full protection from the elements.\n\niModelExterior Dimensions (Inches)Interior Dimensions (Inches)Compatible Phone/Electronics ModelsSpecial Featuresi10105.88 x 4.06 x 2.124.37 x 2.87 x 1.681st or 2nd generation Apple iPod, Nano, and Shuffle * Lid organizer stores earphones\n *  Active sport double-end tie down strap features safety stripes\n * Easy open latch\n\ni10156.68 x 3.88 x 1.865.14 x 2.64 x 1.37 * Apple: iPhone, iPhone 4, iPod touch\n * Blackberry: Bold/Curve/Storm/Pearl\n * Nokia: 5800/5530/E63/E71/E71x/E75/N97 Mini/N79/N78\n * Motorola: Droid/Cliq\n * T-Mobile: MyTouch 3G, G1\n\n * Built-in cable manager\n * Active sport carabiner secures i1015 to backpack or belt loop\n * Easy open latch",
