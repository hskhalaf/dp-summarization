Love that I still have a ton of product left- this stuff goes really far. Edit: Almost one year later, the paints have been sitting in my craft cabinet since I painted the pumpkins last Fall. I pulled them out this week, gave them a shake, and painted over an ugly pot for the back of my daughter's toilet, as well as stenciled some crates to hide unsightly refill bottles in my laundry area. This paint keeps beautifully and doesn't dry out. I still have a ton left!",

Works well on all types of surfaces- metal, wood, mirrors, rocks, plastic, etc., and plays well with all the other kids in the sandbox such as crackle medium, acrylic paints, watercolor and watercolor pens, accepts glue, and spray on/paint sealers. The colors are beautiful and mixable. I have even mixed them with acrylics and alcohol inks and was very pleased with the results. Keep in mind that when you mix with other paint sources, the integrity of the chalk board effect, may diminish. But if you are like me, these different effects are pleasing to the eye and satisfying results. Enjoy!",
