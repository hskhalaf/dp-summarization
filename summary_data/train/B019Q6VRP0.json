The light can be set to stay clear or it can be set to rotate through a sequence of 5-6 different colors (my personal favorite). The solar charges throughout the day and keeps the light shining bright until the sun comes up when it automatically shuts off. Without a doubt, this was money well spent.

The sun keeps the rechargeable batteries charged & the light turns on when it starts to becomes dark. There are a few different colors that cycle when the led light is working.

It is open on the bottom so it won't fill with water which is great compared to some other lights we've had. It would definitely make a nice gift as well.",

The lights are also over our French doors, and they do not disturb us in the house. I find them to enhance the outdoors, rather than make the light the focal point like our path lighting lights do.",
