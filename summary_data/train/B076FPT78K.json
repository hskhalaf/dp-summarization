Do items turn out exactly like they would in a deep fryer? No. But if you use it for all of your \"frying\" you quickly forget the subtle difference between this and \"real\" deep-fried food. As a bonus, it does do some things a deep fryer cannot, and does others better. For example, it makes shockingly good grilled cheese sandwiches (try doing that in a deep fryer). Additionally it does a wonderful job on certain frozen items such as egg rolls, which turn out better than they do in a traditional deep fryer.",

But still, it would be nice to have the peace of mind.",
