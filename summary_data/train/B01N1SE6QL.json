I'm an 11.5 and find the 12s way top big but the 11s just a little short but doable. I buy the 11, but my toes do touch the end.",

They can be worn outside for a quick trip out to the back yard with the pups, and my husband loves the fold-down feature of the heel, as he tends to like wearing mules. My husband has had some foot issues, and these have helped. All in all, a very successful gift.",

He leaves the backs down so he can \"slip\" into them. They are attractive enough to wear out to the store etc. I noticed that my IT guy wears them for his regular shoes too. He said its all he buys.
