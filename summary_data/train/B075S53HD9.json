I've had this about a week, and the clock is now one minute behind. Not insurmountable, but also not really understandable on a device this expensive. However, I do like having more control over when my day starts; I live in a time zone where several months out of the year it doesn't get light until almost 9 a.m., which I find a little depressing.",

This device accomplishes the task of slowly waking you up out of sleep instead of being startled awake by an alarm clock. This device does much more than that and the price reflect its many functions. I find that I personally just use the lamp to wake up and for this simple task there are simply cheaper options out there. I suggest that you think about how you will actually use a lamp light this and not pay for functions you may never use.",

This one almost immediately had \"touch\" problems where the things you'd press wouldn't always respond, or would suddenly lag behind and send you to some wild new place inside the menu that you weren't ever trying to go to. After some basic troubleshooting over the next month, it eventually stopped responding to any sort of touch from the middle the corner on one side, making it effectively useless. To be honest, even if it worked flawlessly, it's not worth $200. It feels like a cheap toy that someone would use as a gimmick inside a massage parlor.",

After reviewing the manual for a few minutes, I find it fairly easy to use, and like that there are 2 alarm settings. Although on the expensive end of the product spectrum, I think it's worth the investment. The clock read out is small and without my glasses is hard to read, but I guess that's part of the ambiance.",

I'm glad I didn't pay extra for the app. This is worth maybe $100. That being said, I'm super happy to have it because it really does help me wake up.",
