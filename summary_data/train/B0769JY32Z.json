The latches are very light, not what could be considered heavy duty. Would be ok for light use but not for real tools. I was replacing one the same size that was worn out after about 5 years use it is no longer available. Ill not even waste my time transferring my tools over to this box. I would have gladly paid more for a box that was worth purchasing. Very disappointing.",

      "text": "I bought this tool box to better organize my bicycle tools/parts etc, and it works great for that purpose. The drawers and the top part are large enough to hold several larger bike components. Bike parts are now organized in my closet. However, the toolbox is poorly constructed. The metal body is strong enough, but the metal clasps are so small they're almost a joke. The lock doesn't lock the box. The handle seems poorly attached. I wouldn't carry a fully loaded toolbox by that handle.",

      "text": "I can't believe that this tool box got such good ratings. Someone said it was built like a soda can, and he was right. The body of the box is very thin tin. The hinges are very flimsy and made of thin tin. The mechanism that holds the draws shut is loose and each draw is crooked. I paid 90 dollars and believe that is only worth maybe 45 dollars. I kept it but would not buy again or recommend it to anyone. I tried to take pictures to show what I'm talking about but It's lack of quality is hard to see in pictures because it's the gauge of the tin box and parts that's the problem.",

This box is a thinner metal than husky feels a bit cheap handle broke off after two weeks with less weight than my 3 drawer the latches feel cheap as well and will probably break any day. I use this daily as a mobile mechanic. Definitely won't buy this brand again.",
