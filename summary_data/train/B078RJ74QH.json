I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t use this as a body powder or, under arms as well. You must shower daily without exception to avoid sweating the next day, and causing a bigger problem. This must be washed off daily. The only other drawback is it is a bit messy as some will get on the floors, and some remains on your hands if you use to much. Overall though it works, and for me that is all that matters. I have a hand broom; just learn the proper ratio you personally need, and you\u2019ll be fine.",

I not only use it as you would a typical body powder, but is also great in the hair as a like dry shampoo, taking away any oily, dull looking hair- and makes your hair smell great. Customer service is the best!",
