There's no hesitation or lack of trust on this product. I've found it to be perfect to knock out essential exercises in the privacy of your home during any given 20 min span of free time you find. I stand 6' and the height of the arm pads is just fine, the pull up bar is fine too I just bend my knees a little to get full motion.",

A lot of home gym gear claims to be professional quality -- this piece is the real deal. The only thing to be aware of is that the dip handle are pretty large. I wear extra-large gloves, and even in my big hands the dip hands feel large. So people with smaller hands be aware of this. However, it doesn't really impede my dips. In every other respect, I'm super happy with this purchase.",

Reason why I gave it four stars is the backrest does not give support when doing legs lifts, at least for me 5ft 10in. Really have no idea why they didn't make it a little longer. Ive been using the detachable handles/cushions as support for my lower back. I think as I strengthen my core, itll become less a problem..
