That was kind of disappointing,as his favorite color is red. BUT he did say that he loves the chair and it is comfortable. We were excited because this is his first gaming chair, and it was something we could afford. Next time, we will read the reviews and make sure that the color is an actual red though. Oh and the reason he was wanting a gaming chair was because he needed something that gave him more back support, and he said that this chair definitely gives him that.",

It came in so many pieces, and wrapping bubbles that would require half of my day to repack, so I won't even bother trying to get a refund. What a piece of junk. Buyer beware.",

The adjustable armrests are nice (considering my last chair didn't have this feature). The armrests are indented a bit to fit my forearm nicely, which I like. Lumbar pulled is fantastic and has the perfect amount of firmness. The only con is the chair doesn't raise as high as I'd like (depending on the height of the desk being used).",

The chair is a tad oversized for me personally. But I think it good if your 6' or taller. The padding could be better like using memory foam.

      "text": "Great chair but was really sad that mine came with damage to one of the armrests. You can hide the aesthetic easily but the arm rest is forever a little wobbly and I was super disappointed as this was a birthday present. My brother didn't mind too much, but I felt awful about it. Hopefully, I just got a bad one and this isn't how they normally come. On the bright side it did come earlier than anticipated.",

The arm rests don't move, which isn't a problem for me. The pillows it came with are okay. And the thing that raises or lowers the seat doesn't really raise/lower it that much. But overall it is really good for the cost and is extremely comfortable to sit in for hours when doing homework or gaming!",

I should have exchanged it right away here on amazon, but naturally now I am too late. This chair was bought for a Christmas present and while the overall chair is cool, not having the ability to adjust the height or easily change hydrolics (which should have been replaced) is a pain.",
