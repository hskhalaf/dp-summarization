Also, with use, the surface gets uneven. I recommend you draw a grid in pencil and then file using the grinder stone until the grids disappear. This ensures the surface remains flat during all use.",

That's a real disappointment when I come back into Amazon to rate my product, selecting it from my orders list, and see that it now comes with a flattening stone. The bamboo base, rubber feet, and stones are good quality. I bought plastic tubs to house the working stone and soak the non-working stone, turning the latter into the overall storage case when not sharpening. How about sending me the flattening stone for the 5th star?",

It basically means the stone sits at an angle always and the water doesn't stay on one end. Minor annoyance, but still. 2. The higher grit stone seems to work backwards. The 4000 grit (red) is much softer than the 8000 (white) side and seems to do better for a finish polish. I wonder if I got a bad stone or if it's mislabeled.

Plus 2 silicone stone pads and a bamboo block with anti slip pad underneath. I was also sent a comprehensive PDF on knife sharpening with a whetstone. Looking forward to the 10,000 and 12,000 kit!",
