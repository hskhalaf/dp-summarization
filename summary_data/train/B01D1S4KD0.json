      "text": "To be honest, I was just looking for a pan to make tea/chai and there are many available at a lesser price. But I liked this one for the nonstick aspect as whenever I boil milk, it tends to stick to the pan sides and is messy to scrape out while washing. Thus one is a perfect no-hassle. Whatever's leftover after use comes off easily with a single swipe with no extra soaking. No weird smells on heating btw. The pointy tips keep liquids from spilling. Totally worth it!",

I am very pleased with this product! 5-stars.",

Cant wait to purchase more pieces of this set. Everything about this pan, I love. Can't find one single thing about it that is not pleasing.",

The size is perfect for making a cup or two and it washes off with no residues. It has an enameled non stick surface so no worries about coatings peeling off. The outside finish looks quite nice as well. Make sure the base dimension will work with your stove top. It is quite narrow.",

    "description": "Neoflam Eela Milk Pan in Ivory\n\nNeoflam is known for their exceptional cookware, and this single serving saucepan is a shining example. The small size, 1 quart capacity, maximizes utility. You will find yourself reaching for this tiny warmer time and again.\n\nThe milk pan is perfect for: heating leftovers if you have ditched the microwave, latte, chai tea, Greek coffee, Turkish coffee, pour over tea and coffee, oatmeal, chocolate, ganache, cheese sauce, gravy, soup, frozen vegetables, scrambled eggs, ramen, cream, syrup, candy, frothing, clarifying butter, baby food, baby bottles, hot cocoa, ghee, beans, and so much more!\n\nIt is petit enough to be convenient, and sturdy enough for every day use. The cute design is both rustic and modern. It's the miniature saucier you've been dreaming of for years.\n\nUnlike stainless steel or cast iron alternatives, the cast aluminum body does not scorch and heats quickly.

You can easily scrape out the interior with a silicone spatula thanks to the gently sloping walls. The spout generates a nice, even pour when buttering popcorn or drizzling chocolate. Finally, you don't need to create a double boiler every time you want to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nThe Classic Milk Pan You'll Cherish For Years!\n\nFeatures:\n\n * Cast aluminum body is lightweight and highly heat conductive\n * Ecolon ceramic nonstick coating is made from all-natural materials\n * Easy to clean and maintain\n * Bakelite Handle\n * Two pouring spouts\n\nEcolon - The Healthy Choice for Nonstick Cookware\n\nEcolon is Neoflam\u2019s innovative nonstick ceramic coating made from all-natural materials.
