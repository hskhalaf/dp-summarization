There is no comparison to the elegance and beauty of the Cuisinart product. I was worried that the Cuisinart wasn't a \"real\" chafing dish with the water dish. The Cuisinart product performed excellently--it keep the food warm without drying it out. Finally, this is advertised as heavy duty--it is bigger/bulkier than the Cuisinart yet the Cuisinart is \"heavier duty\" than this product. Don't buy this product; buy the Cuisinart buffet server instead.",

Also the lid holder is quite convenient as not having to place lid on table, which dirty\"s the tablecloth.
