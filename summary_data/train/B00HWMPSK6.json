It came as Android version 4.4 but it updated to 5.01. This resolved the problem other users reported when attempting to install Amazon Video, which now works flawlessly after the Android update. I added a Samsung 64 GB class 10 micro SD card, for additional memory capacity, and purchased an Amazon USB 3.0 connector cable making transfers even faster. I also added a Fintie 12.2 Note 360 swivel case purchased through Amazon. Very pleased with the whole setup.",

Note that the USB cable that comes with the unit is crap - comes apart at the USB 3.0 connection. Samsung Support tried to deny warranty on the cable after no more than 3 months of \"adult-only\" use. Took me getting \"insulted\" by them eluding to this being physical damage before they would send me another under warranty. It's not physical damage, it's a poorly designed cable as can easily be seen in the accompanying photo.",

Little surprise that a call placed to the seller and message left received no response. Finally received a response. Returned the tablet and got another one. Less than one year later. Same problem. Slow charge and then no charge. So that was $300 bucks wasted.",

Went to check out the Galaxy Perks it would come with - Samsung have terminated their Perks program so any of those lovely Youtube videos listing the many extras are now seemingly very out of date. Not saying it would have changed my mind, I've been looking at the 12.2 for a while but the added bonuses were a nice extra - we'll see whether that also includes the Dropbox space - if not then the Amazon page should be altered to either eliminate reference to the Perks or advise new customers that there are no more 'Perks'",

I basically replaced all my paper notebooks with this. This will definetly help me be more organized now and have less of a mess in my room and my backpack not to mention that it will be easier now to find my class notes when i want them with just the touch of a screen.",

As a musician this device is now a paperweight and I have to resort back to several binders full of sheet music and pausing to turn pages. Not good.",

I've had the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 for six months now and it's still fast and powerful. The pinpoint stylus is so much better than those bulky rubber nubs that you buy for other touch screens. The only feature I really wish I had is a USB port so I can connect an external harddrive instead of having to transfer files using the Micro SD card.",
