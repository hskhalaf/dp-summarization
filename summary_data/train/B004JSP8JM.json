Our old stylus was fabulous and never had so many problems. Luckily we also brought along a kodak playsport video camera on the trip- if we'd left it up to this camera we'd have no documentation of our honeymoon. Had to return this item with discontent.",

Just make sure that your battery compartment is locked tight, push it down with some pressure and be sure it clicks locked. We are very happy with the underwater camera & the pictures.",

Luckily we packed two cameras, this camera only lasted about an hour. We took it out in the ocean, was under water only about 1 foot and afterwards camera read \"card error\" and we lost all photos on the memory card. Also water had seeped into the battery compartment and under the flash. Currently trying to exchange it because it is past the return time. Not a happy customer, will probably never use or count on this camera again.",
