I returned it to Amazon and replaced it. I've had the replacement less than 30 days. First, the closed legs started to fall down and would not stay closed. Now the legs have started to collapse in on themselves when I have it open. Awful product.",

The joints are not tight so I'll probably in time to come have to reassemble correctly. In the end, you get what you pay for. These will work for days when kids are sick and want to eat in bed.

Just the right height, strong, sturdy, and stable with ample surface to accommodate his iPad...games, books, snacks, whatever. It folds flat to store.. He uses it on the couch, on the floor, and yes, on his bed. His mother put a thin non-skid mat on it in case of small bumps. A good price for an attractive, quality product. Highly recommended.",

The small lip around the edge is enough to keep plates etc. on the tray without adding more bulk or height. The fold out legs stay tucked underneath the tray if or when they are needed. They are held in place by friction so there is not release or latch to fuss with. Great item!",

As a laptop tray when sitting on my couch; almost like a portable desk It is great in all regards. Sturdy and reliable. It's not the best looking piece of furniture in the world, but for the price, I think that is to be expected. I was concerned that the product would not be sturdy enough; these concerns were unfounded. I use it regularly and am delighted with the purchase.",

Also, this tray lacks a mechanism for opening/unfolding the legs while you are holding the tray nor do the legs lock. You have to load things on the tray when it's fully opened/upright ... And then because the legs are loose, by the time you bring it to your destination you have to finagle the legs open again with an extra set of hands to set it down. Maddening!",

I read previous reviews downgrading the laminate top as just wood painted white; it is actually laminate, just not real shiny! I also read a review saying the legs were flimsy; they are just fine, they just don't lock in place, so if you move the tray, you must pick it up and move it, or else, yes, the leg(s) will fold in. As far as I'm concerned, this bed tray is absolutely perfect, and I will be using it for quite some time! THANKS!!!",
