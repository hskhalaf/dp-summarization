      "title": "Works Great!",
      "text": "Needed a calculator for Chemistry class, and this one has worked great. It is simple to use, I like the green color, and it has a cover to protect, which is nice. There is an on and an off switch so make sure you turn it off I guess. Also, the top layer of the calculator is this shiny plastic material that leaves lots of smudges. That's the only thing I don't like. Think of like your smart phone screen. That's what it looks like. So that's my only complaint is the smudges around the keys, which is kind of gross. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5.",

      "text": "Pros: 1) Pleasant design 2) Functions like sin, log, etc work the old fashion way, enter the number, then the function key and you get the result (no need to hit \"=\") 3) Display is relatively big with good contrast 4) Hard plastic keys Cons: 1) The display window is too small compared to the display itself so there is frequently an annoying shadow projected 2) There is no engineering notation, the key is mislabeled \"F-E\" but it switches between floating point and scientific notation 3) Complex math mode works only for the four basic operations (+-x/) 4) Too glossy finish Bottom line, this is a good buy if you are looking for a simple but practical scientific calculator.",
