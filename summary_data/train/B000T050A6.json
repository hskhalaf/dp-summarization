Sitting outside with the fan on setting 2/3 and feel great.. only drawback to the fan is that it does not turn left and right. I had to mount the fan at an angle so that it would face the middle of the room. I would suggest having a friend handy to help install. In total it weighs about 25lbs. Not the easiest on your own but it can be done.",

This leaves very minimal movement of the fan side to side. I had to bolt it over the top of the wall mount to help with this. Out out of the two fans that I ordered, one has a noticeable vibration on low speed. (Hopefully it doesnt affect the motor in the long run.) The wall mount does not come with hardware.",
