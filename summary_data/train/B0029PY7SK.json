As with previous reviews one strip of velcro started coming off after only a few times of wearing. Eventually if totally came off. It's a shame that such a good product has so little quality control. Either the fabric should be thick enough for the velcro used or the velcro should be changed to a lighter strength. Also the stitching involved needs to be addressed. If the stitching was strong enough, the velcro couldn't come off. We continue to use it for our excitable fur baby though as it seems to calm him slightly.",

I tried a lot of remedies, Lavender oil and other oils made to calm, but they worked just a little, but not as much as she needed. So I purchased a thunder shirt for her. This calmed her about 95%. The genuine Thundershirt has a spot near the neck where you can put things like essential oils. Once I put Lavender oil on the spot, she totally calmed down and went to sleep...in the middle of a thunderstorm. Amazing!!!! So if you are looking for the secret recipe to keep your dog calm, it is 1 part Lavender oil and one part Thundershirt...original...not a cheaper copy.",

Usually Hercules is in your lap behind the couch under the table or in his kennel while fire works go off or when there is any loud unexpected sounds. With the vest Hercules was still a little spooked but was able to stay outside with us and even played ball with the other dogs while the fireworks were happening! We also put this on him during thunder storms and he is able to sleep right through them!",

      "text": "Purchased size small for 12lb yorkiepoo to help with general anxiety issues. The thundershirt seems well made and fits well. Zoey has always been a nervous dog and shivers often. We didn't notice an immediate change but after using it a few times it seems to have helped. I can tell she likes the secure feeling it gives her. The only problem is that she doesn't like the sound of the velcro when taking it off. I've learned to remove it slowly. The use of velcro in the design is brilliant so I'm not really complaining. I'm hoping her thundershirt will also be helpful in car rides and visits to the vet.",
