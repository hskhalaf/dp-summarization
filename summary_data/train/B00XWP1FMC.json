My only qualms are when I first wore them the rubber soles seemed so slippery on the roads and pavements that I thought I was going to have a tumble. Luckily after a few days of wearing the soles were fine and I hardly take them off nowadays. They have also stood up to a good pounding on the streets each day walking to work. I think I may be a convert and purchase more Nike trainers.",

I gave them to my dad who takes a size 9 and he said they were a perfect fit. So I ordered a size 11 and they do fit me but are still quite snug so they will take a bit of wearing-in. I have never had a size 11 before in my life. Other than that these are very comfortable trainers.",

I remember trying at least 10 different pairs of various brands and models, including Nike, however none of them fit as well as these. Also,keep in mind that you might want to get these at least half or even one size bigger than your actual foot size,as they are smaller than you'd expect. I'm 44-44.5 Europen, but I bought 46 to fit well,based on my previous purchases of the same model.",
