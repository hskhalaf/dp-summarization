Tried contacting Yamaha support, they sent me to an external service they contract for repair, which said the nearest service center was 1 hour away. No thanks, and after this first experience, I'm not going to buy again. I'll try my luck with a single disc player and see if that can last longer.",

Even worse, there's a long delay from the time you turn it on to the time the controls become responsive. I'm used to turning on a device, opening the tray, popping in CDs, and hitting play. With the Yamaha, there's a notable delay in this procedure. Also, the buttons for basic controls (play/pause, stop, skip) could be larger.",

      "text": "I just returned the item and decided to go with a single disc player. It started doing weird things after about two weeks of use. The optical output would intermittently quit working and then suddenly start up again by itself for no apparent reason. When in program mode it would, for no apparent reason, start in the middle of a track and not advance the track number. The lack of a headphone jack was also an aggravating factor. For the first two weeks it worked it was fine. I have come to the conclusion that I'm better off spending a comparable amount of money on a single disc player and see if the quality might be better.",

This changer is very easy to use (good manual, too), and it plays MP3 CDs, not just audio CDs. Very happy with this product.",

It does everything it advertises, and is so easy to set up and operate. It plays every thing without a hitch. The quality and the sound are unmatched. Listen up, spend a little extra and go Yamaha. You'll never be disappointed. I've gone Yamaha for 30+ years, and Yamaha is definite family member.",
