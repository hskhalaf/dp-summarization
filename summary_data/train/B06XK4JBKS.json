      "text": "Includes Tapu Koko SM31, 2x Guardians Rising booster packs, 1x Steam Siege booster pack, and a Tapu Koko pin. Tapu Koko is a competitively viable card selling on the secondary market for ~$6 at the time I am writing this. Getting two chances to pull Tapu Lele GX (and a pin!!?!), wow, great product. Tapu Koko SM31 is functionally equivalent to Tapu Koko SM30 found in, the art is different, and SM30 has the \"galaxy\" holo pattern over the entire card whereas SM31 only has it over the character image. Just FYI, both collections are great.",

I can sell the wishiwashi for $13 easy online. Pays for the whole package. I already have one, but if I didn't I would just keep it. I know it's luck of the draw with these purchases, but this was great. The mimiku pin set was equally as good.",

      "text": "The current price at half the original MSRP makes this theoretically a good value for three packs, a game-relevant promo, and a pin. Steam Siege is not as exciting as other currently Standard expansions, but at least it's not Evolutions. And the two Guardians Rising packs got me some staples I was looking for for my deck. Tapu Koko is a very desirable, playable promo compared to some other pin collection promos. However, my copy came straight out of the plastic blister horribly warped, and cut so off center that the inner image area almost touches the bottom edge of the card. Especially because of the curve, it's simply unplayable. What a failure of QC on the manufacturer's part.",

I believe non-playable since it does not lay flat. Box looks like in good condition however. When shopping in store I usually choose the one box with the promo that seen better days and still its front slot and not loose in the box but i could not pass on the amazon deal. :) I guess get what i paid.",
