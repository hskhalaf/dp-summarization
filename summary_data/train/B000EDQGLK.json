The legs are stitched in different places and there are strings hanging off everywhere. The hat looks bent and won't stay on woodys head. And, the string came off after a few uses. Very disappointed.

Unfortunately, he doesn't say \"Someone has poisoned the waterhole!\" which is my dad's favorite saying of Woody's.

Andy is on the bottom of the feet ( which is awesome! ) and he loves the sayings. I have a 3 year old Andy running around yelling \"There's a snake in my boot!\".
