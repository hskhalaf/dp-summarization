This wallet solved the problem. It has a billfold, has a slot of drivers license, a draw strap, and an extra slot for the main card.",

      "text": "I received my new minimalist wallet from Serman Brands about a week ago. The only thing that I am wondering about is why I didn't try this a long time ago! Terrific design and just enough spaces for credit/insurance cards + a nice money clip. Leather quality ( I selected Texas Brown leather) seems to be good. I compared it to other minimalist wallets and found this to offer the ability to carry a few more cards while still being svelte. I particularly like the space for my most used CC and the window slot for my DL. Highly recommended.",

The pull tab for your cards is life changing (I can fit 2 cards). The money clip is perfect. The ID holder has a fabric backing that makes it easy to slide your ID in and out. I'll never go back to a regular wallet. p.s. The Serman Brands website has lots more wallet options. I didn't know this until I went their to register my warranty. Check it out before making a decision.",

Opening from the middle of the wallet makes it much more difficult to pull items out of it, or add to them.",

If you don't smooth the money out before closing the wallet they get all wrinkled and folded so that is the only thing I say watch out for. Also!

The money clip holds ample bills without significantly affecting the thickness of the wallet. No folding your money! This is a great product. I tried four before I settled on this. A magnet or some other closure would help but it works just fine.",

I had a business card in my pocket with it and the back of it turned almost completely brown. Then, and this is my fault, the money clip pin just disappeared. No idea where, when, or how. My money was still there, but the pin was just gone. Never found it. If I could ensure the pin were set and not going to get lost, and the color issue hadn\u2019t happened, I\u2019d give it 5 stars. Design is just superb, quality I guess is sub par.",

Fits easily and comfortably in my front pocket (or back pocket). At least I won't feel like George Costanza any more! ;) I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it.",
