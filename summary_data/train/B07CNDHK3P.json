I\u2019d say you want to have some assemblence of framing skills. The holes for the top slats don\u2019t line up. Squaring it took some patience. Al in all it\u2019s a great kit. I love the end results.",

The packaging is sort of flimsy and one piece was broken (see photo); nothing some Gorilla glue and a clamp could not handle. With the help of my teen kids, we stained the night before and put it up the next afternoon.",

It took my husband and a friend (who's a professional handyman) six hours to fully assemble. You need to dig footings (or create some kind of firm foundation). Afterwards, we also sealed the wood to preserve its nice color (another hour). If you're willing and able to put in the time, assembly was fine and all parts were included. It's a really nice addition to our pool area.",

With no hassle, at all, a replacement board was sent via FedEx Air, arrived quickly. If you\u2019re mounting into concrete I\u2019d recommend a hammer drill to create your 3/16 holes. Otherwise easy install, skill level intermediate! We also purchase the shade sail will update review when complete.",
