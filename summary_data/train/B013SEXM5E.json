Camera is good but basically no manual setting is allowed (even in 3rd party apps), night time video shooting is a joke, most footage is unusable. I caN get much better phones @ this price point today.",

Nice that you can expand memory yourself. Being unlocked you can upgrade Android anytime you want. No useless bloatware from service vendors. Can go month to month on service. Can switch to a new carrier very easy even if they use different network technology (ATT vs Verizon). The only weak areas are battery life (charges fast though), camera is average, touch screen is not sensitive enough sometimes. All in all a great phone for the price.",

Samsung lost my business by selling only a 16GB version of the GS5 in the United States and loading it up with bloatware. It was incredibly frustrating to be unable to delete apps I didn't want. I'm happy Motorola keeps pre-loaded apps to a minimum. The sound on the Moto X Pure is so much better, I'm amazed. Videos are beautiful, and it's nice to have a somewhat larger screen. With 64GB plus the microSD option, I don't expect to ever run out of space again.",

The Moto X has a smartlock feature which really makes the finger print scanner unmissed, as you can add a location or bluetooth connections as \"known\" places to not lock the device.

The screen is terrific, performance is snappy, the camera performs well, and the front speakers are easily the best in the business. My only complaint is that the new Lenovo Motorola team is slower to get out software updates. Previous editions of the Moto X got the latest version of Android as soon as Nexus devices. Now it seems like they are going to take a few extra months to roll them out. Otherwise, it's a wonderful device. The size and weight are nice. It doesn't feel like a 5.7\" device in the hand, but it does when you are watching videos.",

I bought it because it of the nice feature set, including being a very large phone. Frankly, if I had to do it over again, I think I would have bought the Droid Maxx 2 or Droid Turbo 2 since this phone may actually be a little too large for me. The only other problem I have noticed is that some Apps like Yahoo Fantasy Sports don't work right, but I blame Yahoo for that.",

It was a great phone, but the inability to replace the battery in a cost effective manner is a deal breaker for me. Sorry Motorola, I will not order another one.",

Snappy processor and no lag. Camera works good and front facing is the best I have seen so far. Build quality is solid and no issues with cheap plastic. Came with a ribbed rubber back and a motorola bump in the middle. It helps when holding the phone with one hand to locate the center with the index finger. Comes with SD slot which was my main goal in changing from the nexus 6. Will probably buy one for the wife soon as well.",
