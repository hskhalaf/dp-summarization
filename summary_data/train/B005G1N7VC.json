The height and weight of the product seem to work well for their intended use. Although the product may be light that is what makes it very easy for them to move it to different locations, along with the heavy duty straps. Also, the material was obviously well thought of and is constructed very well. It has been able to take on heavy contact . I feel that this product would be good for a child up to 100 or so pounds. Anyone larger would need something a little heavier. I would definitely recommend this product.",

We did that every day for three days straight, and then he got plugged in during the game and became the starting corner for the rest of the season.",
