First, several parts were scuffed or paint was scraped off leaving bare wood. Second, the item design has been modified. There are no wooden support shelves for the 2 top drawers.This lack of support allows the drawers to constantly slide off the rails and onto each other. I expect this will only get worse over time. If the changing table was not such a hassle to pack up and return - it would be going back. I would not recommend this changing table, and knowing what I know now, would not have purchased.",

I received a replacement from Amazon with the same change. When I reached out to the manufacturer I got an email saying they changed the model and then no follow up from them beyond that.

You have to undo one entire side that you worked on to get this board to get in, and even then it's extremely difficult and scratches other parts of the table.
