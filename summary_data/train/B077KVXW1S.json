The shoes are solidly made and fit absolutely true to size. The only minor issue is that the laces are too short. Since the uppers are solid leather, I did coat the top with a spray that helps to waterproof. Nice shoe and I recommend it.",

      "text": "The end of Patagonia making shoes sent me on a long hunt for anything that offered similar comfort, durability, relatively conservative looks, at a reasonable price. These shoes finally delivered. I had tried similar Keen shoes in the past but they were mostly fabric and not as heavy or durable. These all-leather uppers gave me the feel I wanted while still looking sleek and narrow. But the laces are a bit of a nightmare and I haven't quite figured out what to do about them. They are such a thick gauge and so short that I can't get them to stay tied, I literally tie them 5-6 times a day. Will need to replace them....",
