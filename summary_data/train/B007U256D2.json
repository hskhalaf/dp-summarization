Both the plastic tray and the silicon cover absorbed freezer smell and transfered it to the ice cubes. Please do not buy unless you intend to trash them ever so often. I have a pretty clean freezer, so it took a while for the smell to complete spoil the trays. Other reviewers were right about them getting smelly. :((",

It is not a perfectly tight seal, you still need to be careful and not tip the trays while carrying them, but far better than juggling the open trays. I am happy with my purchase. Only bought two trays, wish I had gotten two more as they fit in the freezer so nicely and let you utilize space.",

Can stack other freezer items on top of tray without fear of getting dirt or foreign particles in ice. Cons: Ice cubes are a little smaller than traditional tray, but not that much smaller. Bottom Line: Great addition to the freezer. My ice has never been icier. Recommended.",

The problem is that the ice cubes are made in a \"plateau\" surrounded by a channel and a deeper pocket at the handle end. That's a problem because when you fill the tray, water collects in the channel and pocket then freezes solid, creating a weird ice sculpture. So I drilled hole in the \"pocket\" near the handle to drain the water before putting the tray in the freezer, then ordered a second tray. But the designer needs a talking-to :-)",
