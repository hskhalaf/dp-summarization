I would recommend these bottles to anyone with a new baby or anyone in general looking to try a new bottle. The angle is great and was a huge help with gas in my house.",

However I didn't realize there's an extra rubber valve in the base part; so 1 more part to wash or put in the top rack. Also the cap has a ridge to fit around the nipple and hold it in place, I don't know why since the cap should prevent anything from nudging that anyways while it is on. Instead it makes it harder to put on and more likely to put on wrong and squash the nipping.",

Regardless, I would still recommend these. They seem like good quality. I have to comment. I switched the nipples with the slow flow version from this same company and they fit perfectly. Maybe that's why the vent doesn't work perfectly? I don't know",

I will say these have more pieces than the Nuk bottles but still are not hard to clean like the Dr. Brown's. I highly recommend these bottles.",
