So we either take it apart again and drill new holes, risking the integrity of the wood, or we continue to use it while it scrapes away the wood on one side. If this was not an issue, I would give it 5 stars as the instructions were easy, all the parts were nicely labeled, and it did not take too much time for the initial installation.",

We liked how the hinge assembly kept the lid open after we lifted it. However, a few days ago the metal rod piece used to keep the bench lid in place warped and broke out rendering our bench much less useful. I am going to try to obtain replacement parts but I don't know how easy that process will be. The warranty is only 6 months so likely I will have to pay for the new parts out of pocket.",

Putting the bottom in is the last step & putting the holding brackets in is the 2nd to last step. but it should be the second the last step because you can't get the bottom in once you put the holding brackets in.

Not too difficult to put together, took me about 30 minutes. So far it has held two normal sized adults sitting on it at the same time (350 poundsish) with no problem. The lid works well, no rubbing when opening or closing. Be sure to check the dimensions, it is a little small but that's what we were looking to buy.",

Also, the allen wrench is such a tight fit, you hurt your hand using them. My bench also had 2 of the main support pre-drilled holes which were stripped, so I am not sure of the structure. Just overall a very poor experience and I strongly caution you find another with better reviews. Don't let the pretty picture fool you.",
