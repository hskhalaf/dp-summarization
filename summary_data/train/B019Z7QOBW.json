All of the parts feel like good quality except for how the line board secures to the suction cup, it's useless. There is no way to keep the two pieces held together. Also no scraper was included but Amazon made it right with a small refund to cover the cost. All in all I would recomend it.",

The board doesn't plug in anywhere and doesn't even come with a wire, missing the slide hammer, the glue gun doesn't come with a outlet plug in but rather plugs into the car which is so stupid because it's barely long enough to reach out the car. The bar to hold up the board came broken as well. Don't buy it. Spend your money elsewhere.",
