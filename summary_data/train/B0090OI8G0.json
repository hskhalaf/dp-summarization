We have seen several like this and they seem to go for hours. We have it bracket(ed) to the underside of gazebo. Should we have it housed in something to keep out of wind? I will attach pic because we really want to find out why it is only blowing bubbles for 10 mins.the pic is the first 10 mind. Then fewer and fewer bubble. If we plan a dinner party for 3 hours, that is 18 refills on the bubbles alone. I do not think it is correct.",

The fan is underpowered and can't blow many bubbles before the wands move out of the 'blow zone'. The fan looks to be a fan for computers and doesn't really have good output. Fix those two issues and it may be better. I ran this side by side with a gazillion bubbles machine and the gazillion out produced this 3 to 1 operating on same bubble solution..",

You can make your own using Dawn dish soap and distilled water (this works with the machine), or 5Below and Walmart sell 100ml bottles of bubble solution for under $5 in the summertime which is what I used.",

The only thing that I could improve upon with this machine is: it doesn\u2019t really blow bubbles once the liquid is low in the basin. It has to be fairly full to produce bubbles. While this makes sense. It is a slight disappointment when you still have more bubble solution but not enough to make the bubbles still come out. My kids loved this machine as long as I was close by continually filling it up. Lol",
