I understand chairs this high run the risk of spill over but still; it would be nice to lean back just a little; otherwise I recommend it.",

There is a very slight wobble, but not unexpected since it's just a press-fit for the center column and it is a tall chair. No concerns about it falling over and rolls easily on an area rug. The seat does sink a little when sitting, but it stays at the adjusted height with a 200lb weight on it. The cushion is firm and, with the back and foot rests expect to be able to use it for several hours without discomfort.",

One of the bolts to assemble the backrest was a little difficult to get to, so I just left the plastic sleeve off and that made it easier.",

This is not an issue on the chair that has NO backrest pivot adjustment. Other that that issue, the seats are comfy, the hydraulics are holding up ok, but they feel tippy and light and the foot rest will not stay in place no mater how hard I tighten the knob.",

The bones (metal and seat) of the chair are made from quality materials. The covers for the cylinder back support are both made of plastic but shouldn't be subject to any abnormal wear-and-tear. The wheels are good size and roll easily on carpet. All-in-all, quite satisfied.",
