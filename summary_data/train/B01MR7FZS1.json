To all those having issues with a 911 pr probably any Porsche here is my advice: Doe the Porsche readiness driving pattern. Then do then the BMW readiness driving pattern. The BMW has one where you have to go from 60 to 20 with the car in gear, no brake, gas or clutch. I think this is what set the EMT for me.",

Also, the manual is online....all 105 pages of it.... So I guess they think you should have a laptop in the vehicle or printout 105 pages. Good marketing. Not good product. I'll be interested to see if I am contacted by the manufacturer.",

Received the scanner, put the batteries in, and connected it to my truck. Read my SRS code, fixed the wiring on the truck, and used the tool to clear the code. No more problem. Worked great!",
