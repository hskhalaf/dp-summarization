I experienced none of these. I purchased the version with hi red audio, bluetooth, and navigation. Maybe they got a different one. For under 200 this radio has been amazing. Everything works fine. USB, bluetooth, CD, DVDs play great and look great. The features are very nice . The GPS is alright. Needs more options on customizing routes a. Overall it has been worth every penny. Not a single thing these bad reviews are saying happened to me. Just make sure you install it right and have some good speakers.",

The bluetooth echo made the unit nearly impossible to use for hands free communication and then the whole unit went blank and would not turn on. Not my first install on a head unit so I troubleshooted to make sure it wasn't a fuse and that the unit was getting power from the harness, and it is. Something internally is not working. Great features and design for the cost of this unit, but sadly the quality is not there with this one to justify the cost...",

Touch screen went black but backlight is still on. 2. Buttons and dials are not responsive. 3. No radio, no backup camera, and won't even eject CD. 4. Power does not turn off unless unplugged, even if the car is turned off. 5. Neither the reset button or power cycling (via unplugging) brings back the unit. 6. After unplugging and re-plug in power the unit goes back to vegetable state. So it's now a paper weight. Still trying to figure out how to get my CD out. Would not recommend because of the reliability issue.",

      "text": "I have installed it in my 2005 Toyota Sienna minivan for more than 2 months, and I installed BOSS BASS800 under seat subwoofer. I also installed the rear view camera and the steering wheel control kit. They work greatly together. I like the sound quality now, so much better than my original Toyota cassette/cd radio. The Bluetooth and microphone work very well for the handsfree phone call. I tested all the features, such as DVD movie player, CD, MP3, USB memory stick, mini SD, AUX in, Bluetooth music. They all work fine. I installed everything by myself. It is not super difficult but needs some handyman's skill.",

Plus, when I switch to the screen that allows you to adjust detailed volume control, I get a totally different sound without touching anything! The display is way to bright at night, even on the lowest setting. Plus the radio quality is intermittent. I sent it back. I just installed a cheaper unit (w/o DVD) I purchased at my local auto parts store, and it's works like it's supposed to.",
