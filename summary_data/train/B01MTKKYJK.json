As for the drive itself, it works perfectly. Its taken a few small drops and still works good. The case thats included is great and an easy way to keep the drive and cable together. The port on the drive however has already almost failed the cable barely stays in with the plastic cover on the drive, without it the cable still slips out every once and a while. Kind of disappointed by that as I had high hopes for this drive.",
