I used this to take my small, elderly, 9-lb cat to the vet, and the mechanisms that keep the top secure kept popping into the upright (non-secure) position whenever I would use the top handle, and the plastic would bend under the weight of the carrier. I was so afraid that the top would break off and that my cat would fall and escape that I ended up carrying the carrier in front of me like a box. If you're looking for a sturdy, convenient carrier that will keep your pet safe, look elsewhere. Bummer-- I generally love AmazonBasics products.",

For pets that are nervous at the vet's office or hesitant to come out of the crate, lifting them from the top is significantly less stressful than trying to pull them out the front. The 23inch size is most appropriate for medium-large cats and small breed dogs. For dogs, I would not recommend larger than 10lbs, as they tend to have less maneuverability than cats.",

The top layer of her nose was hanging off. It was a three hour trip with no time to get new one. She had surgery and the ride was hard enough on her. The vet said stopping to get new one would have made her stressed out and is not safe for her to do so right now, to pat her nose with clean gauze. I had my son do this all the way home. DO NOT BUY NOT SAFE!",
