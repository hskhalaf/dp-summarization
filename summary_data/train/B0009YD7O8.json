      "text": "My puppy really liked this toy but its not strong enough for constant chewing. After a few days he was able to rip large chunks off which was SUPER dangerous, he ended up throwing them up. Its a great distraction for an hour or so but dont let medium-large or strong chewers keep it all the time. Also note, this thing gets gross really fast if you dont wash the treat goo out of the channels after each use, and many other common treats dont fit inside the hole and it just goes straight through. Dog loves the unpredictable bouncing. Lasted about a month of daily use.",

So I can absolutely say without a shadow of a doubt that Kong is most definitely my favorite brand for dog toys impeccable durability, smart design... plus they cover all of the dog stages: puppy to senior AND all size dogs.

I had to double check this was Kong brand because it was the first Kong toy we bought fell apart this quickly. Disappointing. I wouldn\u2019t say don\u2019t buy Kong toys because we love our other Kong toys, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend this particular one. Should be redesigned with more sturdy rubber.",

      "text": "The shape is great for playing fetch with as it bounces in unpredictable directions. Our six month old puppy loved that. However, if your dog is a chewer it is much less durable than the traditional \"bell\" shaped toy. Our lab puppy completely chewed this apart in less than a day (and she still didn't have all her permanent teeth in at the time). On the aside, she also chewed the medium size traditional \"bell\" shaped black Kong apart in a few hours, but she hasn't been able to take apart the largest red one yet. So if you do have a power chewer I recommend buying larger toys.",
