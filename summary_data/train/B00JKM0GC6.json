Liked it because of the secure fitting of clips and the fold back corner for picture taking. Though this case is flimsy when it comes to drops and oopsies. Though even my 4 year old can handle it and figure out the kickstand fold, dogear corner, and hidden magnets. Good for indoor use, but would recommend something more secure for outdoor and on the go lifestyles.",

      "text": "We purchased this cover to replace one exactly like it when the side bar that keeps the tablet from slipping out broke on our first one. The broken one was no longer usable because the tablet would not stay in place and we lost the broken piece. The side bar on the new case also developed a break in the same place but we managed to repair it with glue. It is very difficult to find a cover that protects the tablet and allows the camera to be used without removing it from the case which is why we were willing to repair the second one.",

I work in a store that sells a variety of similar products and this is about the going price for tablet covers. ($40) + Provides basic protection, especially if you're carrying your tablet, or putting it in a bag with other items. - It's not a great feel for holding your tablet and actually working with it Better for using on a surface.

      "text": "Was a bit skeptical of the \"Universal\" claim, but there is an interior tab and elastic system that works beautifully provided you get the right size case for your tablet. Very secure, easy to set up so the tablet is standing, it's quiet (unlike some tablet cases!) and it's very streamlined. Sure, maybe a few more color options would be nice, but that's not really a big deal. This is a great product for the price. I would say maybe an elastic to wrap around the whole thing would be prudent (you know, like Moleskines have)... because this one didn't come with one and it keeps flapping open. Hence the 4-star rating.",

Sometimes it is hard to find cases for older devices. However this thing has two pull out straps which hold your device against a stationary lip. The lip is just too thin for many devices to be considered universal. Then there is the freakishly large front flap. This thing moots the portability of a seven inch device. You cannot put it in your pocket anymore. I have no use for this case.",

But that means there is a fair amount of wasted space around all edges of the tablet. That makes it feel flimsy and harder to hold. Also because it is a generic one-size-fits-some case, it doesn't work with the camera because is it partially blocked, even when the corner tab is folded down. Do yourself a favor and buy a case specifically designed for whatever tablet you have.",

Also it is not heavy duty, so while it will protect from basic falls, do not expect too much. Still the case is good enough, and looks stylish.",
