I wish there were volume control buttons on the cord - a perk it's hard to live without once you've had it. I gave three stars because the connection of the wire at the plug became exposed in less than a year of use. I figured it was because I stretched the cord as I wrapped it around my mp3 player every day. I bought this second pair and took better care of it and it still happened.",

      "text": "I've had these since December 9th, and my first impression was that it's near perfect. However, as time went on, the flaws became more apparent. First of all, the ear buds are very small. That may sound like a good thing, but putting it on requires delicacy. I've often bend the wires because the ear buds are too small for my hands (and my hands are small already). Secondly, the wires misshape itself. This sounds weird, but the wires do become crookedly and there's nothing you can do to reshape it. Sound quality wise, it fairs little better than the V-Moda.",

The cable doesn't look as sturdy as the Shure brand, but I have had no cable shorts or breaks after 1.5 years. Noise reduction is excellent. The package does not include any wrap-around ear forms. If you are a musician or using for workouts at the gym, I recommend purchasing an accessory kit with wrap-around forms. Wear the cable to the back of your head, not under your chin. Move the cable slide snug to the back of your hairline and the buds will stay fixed in your ears.",

It transmits a loud scraping sound to the earpieces when it rubs on your face or clothing. The other is the response. The only other earphones I have to compare it against are the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 3, (a.k.a. Altec Lansing UHP336). The Zen suffers very badly by comparison. It has an uneven frequency response with a bump in the mid treble range around 3kHz to 5kHz that makes it sound shouty. Another nit is that there is no room in the supplied carrying case for the airplane connection adapter.",

I was fairly happy with the way they sounded after the break in period, the sound was fairly clear, the mid range was decent as was the top end. Downside, these things are fragile. Mine malfunctioned after only moderate use due likely to frayed wiring and the thin cables pass on external noise from rubbing and movement.

      "text": "These are small, light and comfortable. That's the good part. They also sound very tinny and thin. Very little bass. I've put them away and chalked them up as a total loss. I'm using my old phones. They're a bit bigger and heavier, but they sound much better. If you like flat frequency response, look elsewhere. If you're only listening to voice, these might be just fine.",
