      "text": "I love this landing pad. At first glance, it might seem like such a minor accessory, but looks can be deceiving. The landing pad is durable and seems to be well constructed. It can be set up in seconds, and is very easy to take down. The pad has protected my drone, gimbal and camera from sand, dust, dirt, and ground moister. Even flying from low cut grass, I don\u2019t have to worrry about the drone weed-walking. Knicks on the propellers can lead to in-air catastrophic failure. Camera gimbals can be very sensitive do dust or moisture and very expensive to replace. This is a cheap way to take good care of your \u201cinvestment\u201d.",

After using this one time just to keep a DJI Mavic pro platinum props out of the grass I found that when using the RTH feature, for some reason this orange side up makes the drone land literally pinpoint on the H. Every time. Also it folds into a small circle by twisting the outer edges and comes with a carry case that hold the stakes. I highly recommend this. Keeps my gimbals out of the grass!",

The storage pouch keeps it in folded position and fits my flight bag. If you use the included plastic tent stakes make sure they are flush with the top of the pad or the Mavics props can hit them, without landing gear extensions. May get some wire stakes or not use them if it's not windy. Gives the Mavic a good Home Point reference for precision landing. And keeps people from standing where you're gonna be landing.",

If / when you use the tent stakes to hold it down (as you should) Be sure to sink them all the way down. You would not want your drone to either strike one of them with a rotor nor \"trip\" over one when on approach.",
