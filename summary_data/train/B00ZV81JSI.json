They fit a lot snugger - should have probably bought a 1/2 size up but since they were they were an updated model I assumed they would be ok and simply needed to be broken in. They also cut a little in the heel which is not something I experienced with the older versions. Unfortunately for me these were a step back and not an advancement. Not sure I'll stick to Under Armour for running shoes anymore.",

After one day/run wearing them, part of the rubber sole tore off on one of the sneakers and part of the rubber sole was coming apart on the other shoe as well. If Under Armour wants to keep me buying their products I recommend they sacrifice weight for quality. I would rather have a shoe that is several ounces heavier and lasts longer than a week, then a light shoe that tears after a day. I hope this comments helps.",
