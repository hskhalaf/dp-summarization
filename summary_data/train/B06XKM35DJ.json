It enables him to move freely while working and is not bulky, yet still keeps him warm and dry. Completely satisfied!",

He liked all the pockets and found them to be useful, although a couple were too small to really keep much in. The jacket is water repellent and washed nicely upon our return home. It is a nylon outer. so it makes the usual \"swishy\" noise that nylon makes. It was not, however, bulky, which my husband liked. It met the product description and arrived well packaged and in a timely fashion. Recommend.",

I get marking paint all over it, throw it in the wash. All gone, good as new. It isn't all that warm on it's own but i expected that. A thermal long sleeve and a sweatshirt along wity this jacket keep me warm and dry in the harsh Rhode Island winters. Very good product. Would recomend",
