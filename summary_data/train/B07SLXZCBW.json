      "text": "I bought this camera for underwater and beach use. However, the Images produced by this camera are very distorted in the corners and edges. I took this up with Olympus who said this is normal for compact cameras!!! My wife has a Panasonic TZ100 and this does not have distorted corners so what Olympus say is not true. So don't buy this camera if you are looking for high overall image quality. If you want one for underwater the Panasonic FT7 is \u00a3100 cheaper - and it has a viewfinder.",

The Olympus TG-6 exceeded all expectations, with an incredible out of the box macro mode, reasonable zoom, panorama mode, and loads more. Great image quality too. Probably my best buy this year (and we buy lots of stuff from Amazon).",

I used this camera twice, each time just snorkelling so there was not the pressure from being deep (although that should not matter since the camera supposedly is ok down to 12m). All parts were securely closed with no dirt (since it was new!) to block the seals. On its second use the screen misted up on the inside and and then the camera completely failed. Having had an Olympus tough camera before, I have to say this camera felt a lot more flimsy. The seals were miniscule in comparison. Have returned for a refund and will not be purchasing another one!",

It looks great, rugged and practical. However, most importantly it takes great quality photos without needing to get into complex settings if you don't want to. It also really can take a lot of punishment and keep on working. Drops, water, dirt and heavy handed kids have tried and failed to stop it. The battery/memory and HDMI/USB slots are well protected by the locks and seals. I feel I have barely scratched the surface with what the TG-6 can do. Fantastic!",

Google \"TG-6 purple blob\" and you'll find it's been an issue since the TG-3. I can't believe Olympus have continued to make cameras with such a major lens defect for do long. I'm guessing it's to do with internal reflections on the lens. The problem gets worse as the light levels fall. So, in conclusion, for macro, great, for anything else, don't bother.",
