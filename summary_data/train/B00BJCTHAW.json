Love the lock button on left dial, always moving accidentally on the 7000 not now with the 7100, small item but great improvement. 24mp from 15mp looks good, just need more computer power to handle. Otherwise only four hays to get it working the way I use it. The Manual is a great improvement from the last one, I can read it and the front section is a better index.",

      "text": "The image quality is excellent with large file sizes, indeed one can use two SD cards and captures JPEGs and RAW images at the same time if required. The controls are a little more fiddly compared to Pro bodies like the D2, D3 or D4 but this is partly due to the compact size of the body. This is its only major disadvantage to some extent. After using Pro bodies for years this feels very small indeed. Nonetheless it is a good compromise, given the lower cost, and certainly worth considering as a spare body.",

Yes higher res and a tad sharper, nice body with bells and whistles, but I decided to go FX and purchased the D750. Now I see the difference in many aspects , if you're swithering between another DX and FX , well the latter is always going to give you better quality and that's the real upgrade.",

I was planning to add the D7200 as my DX camera (already own a Coolpix900, D750 and Df) but Amazon were out of stock, saw this body as a Warehouse offer. Glad I stuck with this purchase and saved a bit of dosh, the D7100 does everything I need and more - great pictures , every bit as good as the D750 and uses the same sensor as the D4 and Df. Excellent",

My only disappointment with the Nikon D7100 is that it doesn't have a protective clip-on display screen cover like the D90 and D7000. Nevertheless, I wish I could give it more stars than five!",
