Still, my 12 year old daughter really loved this and still plays with it from time to time (even though she's outgrown almost all other stuffed animals). Also, unicorns and rainbows are pretty awesome; I am secure enough in my masculinity to admit this. So, five-of-five stars! Nice plush toy!",

Cons the blue, yellow and pink hair sheds (hopefully it's just a few loose pieces but only time will tell) and there are a few pieces of fabric and thread sticking out that will need to be cut off. Other then those few cons it's a brilliant stuffed toy for kids or adults who like cute things.",

So that\u2019s a little disappointing. But Pusheenacorn is velvety soft, so is the tail. That is stuffed also. Face and stripes at top of head are embroidered on, whiskers are a felt like material, the horn is soft and stuffed, not sure what material the horn is made of, but I think it is polyester. But overall, I am very happy with it.",

You can't use this as a pillow or backrest type of pillow at all. It would look nice as a decoration on a small shelf. It's not the size of a watermelon as someone posted, but more like a canetelope or honey-dew, or a small soccer ball.",
