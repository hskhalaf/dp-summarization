      "text": "Amazon promptly accepted a return on this item. I had high hopes after reading reviews -- now wondering how many of the reviews were legit. The mixer is much noisier than advertised, but the worst part is the design of the mixing accessories and bowl. Neither the paddle nor the whisk could mix two eggs. They just turned in the air while the liquid sat in the bottom of the bowl undisturbed. This makes the mixer useless for most recipes. If you are someone who thinks stirring a box cake mix by hand is too exhausting, this mixer will be okay for you. Otherwise, forget it.",

Like any other person, I washed the bowl and the different attachments by placing them on the top rack in the dishwasher to The hook attachment was put into the dishwasher. But surprisingly, the hook turned out to be a totally different color. It also leaves that dark metal resedue if/when you touch it. Ladies, please be careful, wash the hook with your hands.",

I just used it tonight to make three loaves of banana bread! They turned out great! I love how easy the mixer is to use, clean and store. Its definitely a winner in my book. Happy with my purchase!",

The suction feet are super strong so it's deifinitely not going anywhere when it's turned on. The bowl is nice and deep so when I'm mixing powdery substances (similar to flour) less poufs out.

Also blades do not touch the bottom of the mixing bowl so you have to manually scrape and mix. A BIG DISAPPOiNTMENT!!!!!",

If you're not whipping more than 4 egg whites the whisk doesn't seem to touch near the bottom of the bowl either. But thy was easily fixed by adding some folder paper towels under the bowl to raise it. Other than that, good investment and not at all as expensive or bulky as the Kitchen Aid.",

The lack of clearance also inhibits \"scrapping down\" during mixing. Excessive clearance betweent bottome of bowl and paddle does not completely mix the ingredients on the bottom without raising the head and using a spatula to scrap the bottom of the bowl.

My only problem with it is that I bought it to help me make bread dough, and it really struggles with that. With softer things like cookies, cakes, whipping cream, puddings, etc, it's totally up to the job. With dough, the motor starts to bog down and the whole body starts to flex back and forth from the stress. No hard feelings towards the designers: they made a great mixer for the lighter items on a baking list. For dough, unfortunately, you really need a steel body and a pretty stout motor, which is more expensive.",

Now the claim that the paddle attachment is configured to make it so that you don't have to scrape the sides down is a major exaggeration, but nothing can be perfect right?

I might revise my review when I try to make meringues, we'll see if it holds up to that test, but so far (several cupcake batters later) it does everything I need it to do and saves my arm muscles from aches from creaming butter and sugar by hand!

The only thing is that the fitting that is on the top of each beater attachment does get a bit of rust, if they could make that all stainless steel it would be 5 star. Oh, and the rusty part never gets in your food, it's way in the top of the fitting, so don't let that deter you, or you could use food grade mineral oil on it before you use it for the first time to probably prevent that from happening :)",
