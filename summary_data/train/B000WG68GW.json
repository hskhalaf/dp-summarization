The reason I gave three stars is because he's only had the boots for over a month and the side of the boots have already started to tear on both boots. If this didnt happen I'd give it 5 stars. So if you wear them for work, I wouldn't recommend buying these.",

Love the support of the hightops, love that they keep my feet dry and warm while I'm walking through the pastures. They are HEAVY, but I'm not doing 12 miles of trail so I don't mind. Good grip on uneven, wet terrain. I've worn them while for every recovery chore including checking on our 3 new calves, all born during a horrendous storm. Hope they last awhile!",

Not okay for what I'm paying. I expected a higher quality product. I know they will get trashed from use, but I am paying for a new item. Back in the box they go and off to the delivery carrier.",

They do seem to be quite comfortable when it is warmer (50-60 Fahrenheit) but I'm afraid they'll get ripped up if I walk through prickly brush.",

    "description": "Muck Wetland Rubber Premium Men's Field Boots are ideal for outdoor work and for water fowlers who always get wet. With a comfort range of -20 \u00b0F/-30 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0F/10 \u00b0C, these 100% waterproof boots perform well in all seasons. 5 mm neoprene provides exceptional comfort, flexibility, shock absorption and heat retention. The extended rubber overlays on these men's field boots protect your feet and ankles from outdoor hazards. For added comfort, they feature Airmesh linings that allow your feet to breathe, and EVA contoured, molded midsoles that follow the natural shape of your feet. The self-cleaning MS-1 ribbed outsole wraps around for optimal protection, stability and performance in mud and snow. Comfort toplines are designed to fit close and keep out debris, but can be rolled down in warmer weather.\n\nA must-have for hunters, birdwatchers, or anyone whose works takes them outdoors, the Wetland Boot from MuckBoots is designed specifically for keeping feet dry and comfortable in the field. 100-percent waterproof from the toe to the top of the boot shaft, these unisex boots have durable, natural rubber uppers and a heavy duty, traction outer sole that can handle snow and mud. Superior comfort is achieved with a breathable, \"Airmesh\" lining, a CR flex-foam bootie, instep protector, and insulation that will keep your feet cool to over 70 degrees Fahrenheit and warm to sub-freezing temperatures.\n\nThe story began in 1999 with the sole purpose of building the most comfortable, high performance footwear on the market. The need for a more comfortable boot for use in messy and tough conditions led to the design of The Original Muck Boot Company brand footwear. Every boot in the line is expected to deliver the same 100% waterproof quality and comfort that inspired the original footwear. In just a few years, the line has grown to more than 20 styles, all designed to tackle tough conditions in agriculture, lawn and garden, outdoor sporting, equine, and pet care. Today, the Muck Boot brand defines a standard of comfort and quality that goes beyond the expectations of customers around the country.\n\nSee more",
