He discussed the matter with me and agreed to replace the unit altogether. Very happy that Ring and their Neighborhood Advocate made this right. ORIGINAL COMMENT - I purchased this unit less than two years ago and the plastic doorbell button has cracked. Just got off the phone with support and was told that the button is not replaceable and I\u2019d have to purchase a new unit.",

I knew that my wifi signal was not the strongest, so I got a wifi booster. that only helped a little. the problems I had were when I went to review the video, most of the times the screen was lack. Nothing. Or the video was very choppy. But recently I got a call from Sonny who said he wanted to walk me through a few steps to get my ring doorbell working better. And damned if he didn't So now it is working 95% better.....Thanks Sonny",
