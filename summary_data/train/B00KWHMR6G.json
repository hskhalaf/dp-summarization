      "text": "My netgear R6400v2 started losing internet every few minutes so after replacing the modem with no resolution I decided to replace the router next. I went with this R6700v3 and initially it worked until it suggested a firmware update. Then it started doing the same thing as the router I replaced except instead of just dropping the internet it reboots itself every ten minutes. I looked on the netgear website and both my old router and new router had firmware updates dated 9/30/20, the exact date I started having internet issues. I shouldn't have to search for a fix for something brand new. I'll be returning this router and staying away from netgear from now on.",

There is also a complete lack of QA/QC. Netgear is known for firmware upgrade disasters. Well, this is the inevitable result of such policies. I would suggest either looking for a better brand or avoid their firmware updates.",

It happens to my family every. single. day. Wake up my HTPC? No network. Turn on the XBox One? No network. The only that doesn't do it is my main computer which is on 24/7. I can get rid of this by turning on QoS but that HALVES my download speed from 980Mbps to 488 Mbps. Time to buy another brand. EDIT: Bought the Linksys - Max-Stream AC2200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router (EA8300). Works fine, no issues. Geez.",

It lacks features included with ASUS, such as parental controls and assignment of devices to specific bandwidths.

After dealing with it for a day I decided life was too short - and returned it.",

Nothing else in the signal chain changed except for the router. So what was the point of me holding on to this router considering my old one provides way faster speeds? So I sent this back after only using it for a couple days for a refund and reconnected my Apple AirPort Extreme router",

We connected a PS4 Pro directly to the router via ethernet cable, but the router interrupted the connection every two hours, kicking us out of a game (Final Fantasy XIV -- error 90006). (Bypassing the router and connecting directly to the modem solved the issue. Wifi connection did not seem to be dropped, either.) Tech support recommended port forwarding, but this did not work. Replies to follow-up messages from tech support were not returned. We ended up getting the Nighthawk XR500 Pro Gaming router, which solved the problem. Unfortunately, Netgear support was not able to resolve the issue before the return window on this item closed.",

      "text": "Read multiple reviews on this router. It was easy to setup and easy to connect to, has decent range around my house but, the wifi periodically shuts off and my devices will not connect. on average I am having to reset the router by restarting it so that the wifi is accessible..at least 2-3 times per week. I don't trust it as my primary wifi so I use my service providers wifi which is much weaker. This negates the whole reason for purchasing this one. sorry guys, not really happy with this.",

      "text": "I don't know how, but this router is slow as dirt. My internet speed is 50/10 and its tests out that way through any wired device, however after connecting this device and using any wifi connected PC/Phone/Etc, speeds are significantly slower, in the range of 12/10 to 25/10. This is on the 5G and 2.4 wifi connections. I bash this device however Ive also doubled down on the manufacturer as Ive just returned this one and bought the upgraded model. Hoping for better results with that one.. Good luck with this. I think its junk.",

      "text": "This device worked well for about 1.5 months. After that, it would continually stop on its own and sometimes wouldn't recognize the Intranet connection (which I could verify with a different router). We have had to power cycle about once a day now. I contacted Amazon support and they were kind enough to put me through to Netgear for a replacement. Netgear at that time gave me an RMA number and told me I wold receive a new device in 10 to 14 days and could send back the defective one. It has been 17 days now. I have not received a device. When I check on the RMA status, it says that nothing has been shipped on their side!",
