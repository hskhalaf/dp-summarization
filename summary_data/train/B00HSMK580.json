I thought it is Federal law that products not made in the USA have to provide that information on the box. There is no declaration on the box stating where it is made.

Using another cable, I tested it and can say that while this product boasts access to a 40-mile radius, it pales in comparison to the performance of a ReLeaf product that claims 30-mile radius. Note that ReLeaf is cheaper than this product. Also note that Amazon requires one star to post a review. This is really a no-star, don't-buy product.",
