      "text": "Cetaphil shoppers beware! Cetaphil has a proliferation of products and so choosing the right one requires quite a bit of attention to detail. This product rating is for the Daily Facial Cleanser. It is quite dreadful. The consistency is clear like a gel. The substance can be inadvertently tasted when washing your face and it is unpleasant. What I was shopping for was a daily facial wash for normal-dry skin. The product I should have, and advise you to buy, is the Gentle Cleanser. I believe that has the usual creamy white look and feel that's true to my Cetaphil brand experience. Hope this feedback steers you to the right product.",

(The Gentle Skin Cleanser by Cetaphil is absolutely horrible though. They come in an identical bottle though. The only difference is one says Daily Facial Cleaner, the other says Gentle Skin Cleanser. Don't confuse the two. :). )",

I clean my face twice per day (sometimes more if I have had to apply sunscreen) and this cleanser is easy to use, cleans well and leaves my skin feeling soft. Love the fact that it is not a harsh cleanser and does not have a drying affect to my skin. Would recommend cleansing cloths for removal of makeup.",
