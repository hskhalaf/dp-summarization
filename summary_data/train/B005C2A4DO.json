From the pictures I was concerned about how easily they made it look to slide the iPad out of the case. I didn't want it sliding out that easily. Well, it has done everything I want and it doesn't slide out nearly as easy as they made it look. I definetly recommend this product!",

(2) The mini usb port to charge the keyboard is hidden by the case. You have to remove the keyboard to charge it not always an easy task.

The keyboard is comfortable and makes typing easy. I have noticed two drawbacks; 1) outside covering is peeling off along the edges. Purely cosmetic and does not affect the safety provided by the case or the capabilities of the keyboard. 2) The case is heavy, but provides the safety features I wanted for my iPad. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.",

I use mine 2-3x/week and have only charge it once in a year! Great product! I recommend to anyone.",
