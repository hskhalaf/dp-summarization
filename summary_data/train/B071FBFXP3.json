I bring mine in everyday. The angles are great. Much more effective than simply doing sit-ups on a flat surface. I was surprised by how sore I was after the first use. This ab mat is firm with light cushioning which has held up great. Seems to be made of durable materials. Very Well-made. I have not had any issues with it as of yet. I LOVE IT! GET IT!",

It just needs to be broken in for me personally who is used to the used up ab mats at the gym that have a couple thousand sit ups on them.",

So I\u2019m not really sure what to do use it for. The instructions come with some silly suggestion to use this for head protection in a headstand (yoga style I guess), but that\u2019s not really why someone would buy this. Just doesn\u2019t match your lumbar for support in a crunch or sit up, so it\u2019s on the shelf in my gym without getting much use.",

Two: it sits just a bit higher than the other two and I feel when it gets wore in it will still have a decent bend.
