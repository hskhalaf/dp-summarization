Turn that in, the image gets a lot darker but it turns into a TN panel with no smearing at all. (artificially of course, and lower brightness) but you use that for gaming and the normal for anything else and this thing is FUN. Great purchase. There are so many settings, and there's even software for it. Metal stand, overall a great product. for this price its GREAT",
