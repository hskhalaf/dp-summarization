      "text": "The Samsung BD-C6900 Blu-ray player is total junk. It failed to play at least 3 first run Blu-ray movies and one DVD movie (Batman Dark Knight Rises). When I call Samsung support they say when a movie first comes out they have to figure out how to decode it and then they write a firmware update. That is totally unacceptable because the whole point of the player is to watch movies when they first come out. I'ts also got an app to stream Netflix downloadable movies and it rarely is able to get through a movie without choking and rebuffering. The simple Roku device hardly ever has a problem.",

After you finally connected to internet, it's another PAIN to set up app account, etc. Not to mention the design of their remote makes it even worse. Again, if you only need to play blue-ray, it will be pretty good. Everything else is such a pain! I don't know how their usability team survived, if they have one.",

    "description": "The Samsung BD-C6900 Blu-ray 3D DiscPlayer allows you to see vivid dimensions in picture depth and action that both leaps off the screen, and draws you deep into the experience. Enjoy the superior picture quality and brilliant color of Full HD 1080p in a way you\u2019ve never seen it before.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n3D TECHNOLOGY CHECKLIST\nThis product is 3D-related. To help you get a great 3D experience, use our checklist below to ensure that you have everything you need. If you have any questions or want to learn more about 3D, we invite you to visit 3D 101--our center for everything 3D. To get started with 3D, please ensure that you have:\n\nA DISPLAY\nThe first--and most important--item you'll need is a 3D-ready display--whether it be a 3D HDTV, 3D projector, or 3D computer monitor. These displays usually have a higher processing power than older models as they need to display one image for each eye to create a 3D effect. \n\n\nA SOURCE\nWhile your display is ready for 3D playback, you still need a device to read 3D content (i.e., a movie or a show). This source can be a cable box with a subscription to a 3D channel, a 3D Blu-ray Disc player, or a PlayStation 3. \n\n\nCONTENT\nIn order to watch 3D, you will need to get some 3D content. This 3D content will come from the source mentioned above in the form of a 3D program, movie, or game. Please ensure that your 3D movies are in the Blu-ray 3D format, as this new format will provide the best 3D experience. \n\n\n3D GLASSES\nAll 3D HDTVs on the market require Active Shutter glasses to create the 3D effect. You will need to buy one pair of glasses for each viewer. Also make sure that the Active Shutter glasses you buy are compatible with your display--for example, buy the glasses from the same brand as your 3D HDTV. \n\n\nHDMI CABLE\nTo connect your source (such as a 3D Blu-ray Disc player) to your display, you'll need a hgh-speed HDMI cable. Cables with this designation--with bandwidth speeds up to 10.2 Gbps (gigabits per second)--will be able to carry the 3D signal without any loss of quality. If you want to get more information about 3D, shop our 3D products, watch videos, or interact with other customers, visit 3D 101, our customer center about everything 3D.\n\n\n\n\nBD-C6900 Blu-ray Player FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Samsung BD-C6900 Blu-ray 3D DiscPlayer allows you to see vivid dimensions in picture depth and action that both leaps off the screen, and draws you deep into the experience.

We applied this philosophy to eradicating the time it takes for a movie to actually start after inserting a disc into a Blu-ray or DVD player. Our BD-C6900 was engineered with Ultra Fast Play to eliminate those annoying load times. It gets you into the entertainment right away. So sitting down to watch your favorite drama no longer entails the drama of slow device booting and clumsy tray openings. \n\n\n\n\n\nSLEEK DESIGN\n\nThe BD-C6900 boasts a design that's both modernized and minimized, making it as much a part of your living room as it is your home theater system. With both TOP disc lighting and blue lighting, its logo shines when the player reads discs. Only 1.5\" high, the BD-C6900's slim body hides the disc loading door, but through its cool transparent window on top you can see what disc is playing. Factor in its sleek, chic metal finish and there's no doubt that this player has the high-end looks to match its high-end performance. \n\n\nALLSHARE\n\nNow you can enjoy music, movies and photos from your PC and mobile devices, right on your Samsung TV screen. With the BD-C6900's AllShare, wirelessly sync your PC or Samsung mobile phone with your TV, streaming content and even keeping tabs on who's calling and texting you with real-time monitoring on your screen. Samsung's AllShare makes staying connected easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCREEN FIT\n\nTo maximize your viewing experience, to truly feel the power of on-screen portrayals, you need all the picture you can get. With the Screen Fit feature, the BD-C6900 Blu-ray disc player automatically converts 21:9 aspect ratio movies to 16:9 aspect, eliminating those annoying black bands crowding the scenes. Watch movies the way they were meant to be seen--with just one touch of the Screen Fit button. \n\n\nUPGRADE\n\nBreathe new life into your movie collection with the BD-C6900 and upscale your standard definition DVDs into high resolution DVDs. Your favorite DVDs will feature the same brilliant details and rich, robust colors you've come to enjoy from the high definition content on your HDTV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANYNET+\n\nAnynet+ is an AV Network system to automatically control Samsung Audio/Video (AV) devices. There is no need to use different remote controls for different devices. With the Anynet+ feature, all you need is one remote control for a simple and convenient experience.",
