The web site is fun, too, since it breaks down your most (and least) active times of day, days in each week. Some family members have the version that clips on your belt or pocket, but the wrist band is so much more convenient. The Fitbit Customer Service has been great for me, and I'm picky. I lost one as the wrist band seemed loose and it just fell off without me realizing it until much later in the day. They replaced it, free of charge.",

The battery needs to be recharged every two or three days (the Flex lasted about five). I use steps, fluid and sleep tracking. Stair tracking doesn't appear to be very accurate; I know that up and down count as one, but it doesn't count them all. I've read that the band breaks frequently, so I'm careful with it when I recharge it. Sometimes naps don't record as sleep; adding them isn't very accurate (maybe I'm doing it wrong - shows lots of wake/restless time instead of manually set start and stop times).",

PROS -Display can see the exact amount and the time. -Caller ID when connected to the phone. -Very similar locking system as the Flex. Very durable. -Completely waterproof, too. -Still gives you sleeping ability. -A lot thinner. CONS -Force has very short battery. Also, it requires a weird position to charge the unit. -A little bigger on your wrist.",

In regard to tracking for health related reasons, I feel that with its inconsistency regarding steps, flights of stairs, etc. a person needs to know their heart rate to determine accurate calorie loss. Therefore, I feel the HR might have been the way to go. Also. The way out fastens makes it very easy to catch and have fall off. An actual buckle would be much safer.",

Easier to activate with mobile device vs PC. Even firmware updates can upload to the Charge over Bluetooth! Another note: if you can get all your Fitbit interaction done with mobile and Web; you'll never really need to install the wireless USB dongle.

The fitbit is great for tracking just about everything; the one thing the Charge doesn't do is heart rate, and I've read several reviews that the Charge HR isn't particularly accurate over a certain bpm. Two major things the Fitbit Charge has over the Apple Watch is the battery life (lasts about a week) and sleep tracking. I didn't use the Fitbit app to track my workouts as I have a separate place to do that. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to track their daily movement and sleep analysis.",

They sold a faulty product (check the overwhelming number of bands falling apart in any fitbit comment section), couldn't find a way to fix it, and decided to stiff those who bought it. FITBIT IS A FAILURE -- FIND ANOTHER TRACKER. Addendum: Squeaky wheel and all that.

Had the Flex before which only showed a step count, this is way better and not crazy expebsive. Only issue I have with the Fitbit is that eventualy the rubber and clasp that holds it close become a bit loose (I lost my previous fitbit Flex that way, it just unbuckled and fell off at some point). My current is 6 months and its starting to unclasp. The additional free phone app makes this a great way to challenge and interact with friends. Great motivation to get moving!",

Again, a call to FitBit and they quickly replaced it. She loves it, and despite having had to get it replaced twice, it is awesome when it is working. Would give it six stars if it were not for the replacements. Would have given it one star if FitBit was not so amazing about standing behind the product.",

      "text": "I wear my Fitbit every minute of every day and it has helped me to be more aware of my (lack of) activity. Since purchasing this in December 2014, I have lost 15 pounds just by tracking my activity and logging my food consumption. I log every single thing I eat and the Fitbit app on my phone makes it so convenient to do - and, I can find the nutritional info of any food (store bought, restaurants, etc) on the app or website so I know my calorie intake is as correct as it can get. Very comfortable band, and the battery life is quote long - I charge mine only once per week.",

      "text": "This product is junk. The battery died in less than a week of using it and could not be recharged. Fitbit sent me a refurbished unit as a replacement even though I had this less than a week. The refurbished unit fell apart, the silicone on the wristband came off. Fitbit sent me two other replacements, both batteries died and could not be recharged. I have had the Fitbit one and never had a problem. I ultimately downgraded to the Fitbit flex and haven't had a problem. Also, the price has dropped dramatically on this product which leads me to believe that Fitbit knows there is a problem and is trying to sell them off.",

      "text": "The Fitbit charge has a problem in that the clasp will not stay closed while on your wrist. Just putting your hand into your pocket will unlatch it causing it to fall off (you won't even feel it fall off), This had happened to me on 2 occasions, luckily it was turned in and I was able to retrieve it. For another $5:00 you can get a small belt device to keep it secure on your wrist. This is a major fault and must be corrected. I would suggest that Amazon remove this device until this faulf is corrected.",

    "title": "Fitbit Charge Wireless Activity Wristband, Black, Small",
    "description": "Color:Black| Size:SmallEnergize your day with the Fitbit Charge Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband. This fitness watch monitors sleep and tracks steps taken, distance traveled, floors climbed, and calories consumed and burned. Sync your stats wirelessly to your smartphone or computer from up to 20ft away and view your progress in easy-to-read charts and graphs. See daily stats, time of day, day of the week, and exercise mode on the OLED display, as well as who's calling you with the synced caller ID feature. Get the most out of your R. E. M. cycle with the sleep monitor to see just how long and how well you're sleeping throughout the night. The unremitting battery lasts 7-10 days, while this tough timepiece is splash and rain-proof to keep you crushing your goals, even in inclement weather.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\u2022Tracks 7 days of detailed motion data \u2013 minute by minute. \u2022Tracks daily totals for past 30 days \u2022Stores heart rate data at 1 second intervals during exercise tracking and at 5 second intervals all other times\n\nBUYING GUIDE\nMove it up: Since blood increases further up your arm, wear your tracker higher on your wrist to improve the heart rate signal during workouts. Start by moving the device up to three finger widths above your wrist bone, then experiment with slightly lower placement. Keep it secure: The less your tracker moves during exercise, the more chance you have of maintaining a heart rate signal throughout the activity. Do not wear the band too tightly, as this can restrict blood flow and goes against our wear and care guidelines. Hold steady for ten seconds: High intensity exercises or activities that cause you to keep your wrist bent (like push-ups) or move your arms vigorously (like dance) may interfere with heart rate signals. If you stop seeing a signal during these types of activities, hold your wrist steady for ten seconds during breaks to get your reading.\n\nMANUFACTURER CONTACT INFORMATION\nCustomers contact: support@fitbit.com\n\nSee more",
