      "text": "This model went exceptionally well. The parts were clean with very little flash and fit together well. The instructions are clear and concise with one or two minor exceptions but it was easy enough to figure out. The only real complaint that I have is that the roof is warped and will not sit straight on the body without being altered or glued. However, this will happen from time to time. It's usually not a manufacturing error. Overall, I am very happy with this model. I spent approximately 20 hours on this build and pretty much went for the box front look.",

We took it camping, skiing, and everywhere else we went. Many happy memories. By the way, the directions are good but you must paint the parts first then remove the paint before gluing. Basic but often overlooked.",
