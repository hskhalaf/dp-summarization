I wish the front of the neckline were lower, as it feels too tight around my neck, but I get used to in once in the water. With a lower neckline, it would've gotten a 5 rating.",

I use it in Olympic distance tri's. My weakest event of a tri is the swim part and this suit def helped with the buoyancy. It also slides right on and right off {which was the polar opposite of my Zoot suit, I couldn't get that one off!}. I am so pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend this suit.",
