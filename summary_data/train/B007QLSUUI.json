    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n The Bandai Power Rangers Deluxe Megazord Samurai Gigazord warrior toy faithfully captures the awesome power of the giant transforming samurai robot featured in Power Rangers. This colorful and impressively statured figure offers two transformation modes, allowing kids to play with the toy as a samurai robot or spaceship. Or, they can combine it with other Zord vehicles and figures to create the unique Ultrazord (each sold separately). With its rotating arms, articulating claws, and katana sword, the Samurai Gigazord offers mighty morphin' fun for ages four and up.\n\nMegazord stands over 1 foot tall in samurai mode. View larger.CHANGES FROM SAMURAI ROBOT TO SPACESHIP\n The Samurai Gigazord comes as a sleek samurai robot warrior, but can quickly be transformed into an impressive spaceship. In its robot form, the figure stands approximately 1 foot tall and is enhanced by moveable arms, a spinning blaster wheel, attachable articulating claw accessories, and a katana sword that can be held in either hand or stored on its waist.\n\n When it's time for the samurai robot to fly into battle, the figure transforms into a mammoth spaceship. In just a few easy steps, kids can detach and reconfigure the arms and legs and reposition the claws for a striking spaceship design.\n\nCOMBINE WITH OTHER FIGURES TO CREATE ULTRAZORD\n For enhanced fun, the Samurai Gigazord can be combined with select Power Rangers Zord vehicles and figures to create the ultimate weapon--the Ultrazord (each sold separately). Choose from a variety of items in the ZordBuilder Collection and snap them to the Samurai Megazord's body to create your own unique hero. For guidance, a step-by-step instruction sheet is included demonstrating a variety of figure combinations.\n\n This figure is not as sophisticated as some other transforming robots on the market, and its articulation is limited--only its arms rotate. However, the transformation process is easy to accomplish as kids need only pull, snap, and attach the various appendages and accessories to change the basic configuration. Because of its ease of use and imaginative design, the Samurai Megazord makes for a versatile toy to play with and relive your favorite Power Rangers moments.\n\nABOUT POWER RANGERS\n Appealing to a global audience since 1993, Power Rangers has become an international phenomenon.
