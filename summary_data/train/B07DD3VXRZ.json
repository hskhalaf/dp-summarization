However, once I downloaded the corresponding Boom app for iOS and adjusted the sound profile settings, the sound quality improved considerably. Bluetooth range is also weaker than the Bose, and I prefer the warmth and bass of the bidirectional Bose. Maybe I'm just not the target buyer for Ultimate Ears speakers (don't need 360-degree waterproof floating bluetooth speaker with \"magic\" button and \"partyup\" networking capability). Also: I feel the $40 upcharge for the separate charging dock is a cheap strategy. It should be included with the speaker.",

Bass is just not low enough at 90hz for me. Didn't realize it was that high. Only ruggedness and portability are big here. If you want full sound, you will have to go with something else.
