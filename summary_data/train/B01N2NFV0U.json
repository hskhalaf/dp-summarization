The difference between this built in and others I looked at is that the part you don't see is an aluminum casting which undoubtedly made it less expensive to construct. But you don't need or really want Stainless steel in the areas where they don't use it. Everything I wanted and needed and at a great price. I",

We have not used the infrared feature yet and I am not sure exactly how to use it Con: the manual that came with the grill was very hard to follow and I could not figure out what went where using the manual. It was a trial and error basis. Also the start button on the left side doesn\u2019t work at all. Will contact amazon regarding this. The grill did not fit the space with the included bolts so I had to go to hardware store and buy flatheaded ones but now it fits perfectly.",
