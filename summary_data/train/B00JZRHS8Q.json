As expected, not much low frequency absorption (spacing helps), but really cleans up the vocal range mud. Overdampens the highs, but after room eq, I have a decent 'dead' surround screening room.

    "description": "Pattern Name:12These very durable moving blankets weigh approximately 7.5 pounds each and are constructed with a premium cotton/poly blend for maximum protection and durability. The cotton fiber blend provides a softer touch, and its thickness provides superior padding. The recycled cotton filling between two quilted layers protects your cargo from shocks and bumps during transit, and the black quilted overlay with zigzag stitching gives the moving pads a sleek finish. These heavy-duty moving blankets can be reused many times and will not tear from regular use. Ideal for individuals and professional movers alike, these moving blankets are great as furniture pads or to cover and protect large cargo. A moving pad is a great way to protect items from breaking, scuffing or scratching through any move or while in storage. The woven binding allows these blankets to be washed if they become soiled. Line dry only. Note: Blankets may have a slight odor when first using.",
