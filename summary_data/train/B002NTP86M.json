The foundation is really pleasant to look at. At night the bulbs send shimmering waves of light upwards, almost like a fireplace. I was also really pleased with the vendor. One of the lights didn\u2019t work when the fountain arrived and they worked with me (through the Amazon email system) to figure out the problem, and quickly sent me a replacement lighting harness, which was easy to install.",
