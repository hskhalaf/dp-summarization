If u want more than the 2 usb-c ports you have to upgrade to the 1799 price model.",

He was delivering my package on Avenue B when my address clearly said North 66th St!!! My neighbors would not have given me my package but good thing I was looking out for it all day. Computer is great just not the driver that delivered my package.",
