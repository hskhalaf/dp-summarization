I am mentioning the cooler at the same time due to how cheap Nissan was with their CVTs from 2007-~2012 on their Altima line. Their newer Altimas have the cooler now... Don't get ripped off from Nissan using their fluid or cooler (I believe it's $250 and should have been included to begin with). Anyway, this fluid and the cooler fixed the Transmission whine noise as well as the codes and slipping. Highly recommended. Brought new life to our car that's at 150k.",

I'm very impressed with this product. If your CVT is out of warranty, you can afford to regularly change your fluids with this price.",

In the Odyssey, you cannot drain all of the fluid out the first drain (some left in cooler, lines, solenoids). The recommended total \"flush\" is to fill/drain 3x times (I only did 2x). On the 2x fill I used the Honda OEM ATF, since the cost is reasonable for my budget. I cannot tell a difference in shifting/drive-quality between Honda OEM ATF and this.",

While least expensive in comparison to other fluids, all these synthetic fluids are primarily designed for unprecedented profit. Toyota simply relabels Aisin fluid and doubles the price.

This Castrol ATF is not only m-v compatible but also a great bang for the buck. Three gallons is enough fluids to drain and flush the transmission three times and still have enough fluid left over to change out the power steering fluid. After each and every drain and flush the car noticeably had less \"shift shock\" the common 1st to 2nd gear annoyance with Mazda3s, until it was finally a nonissue.",

I\u2019ll be sticking with the Idemitsu from now on! Good luck. Btw I have also tried the Valvoline and although it stinks to high heaven, it also worked better for me then the Castrol.
