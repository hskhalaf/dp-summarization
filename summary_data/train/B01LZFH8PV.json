I did bump the ends to give it some curl. It's not as flat as a flat iron would be but it allowed me to get close to her scalp without burning her. And the fullness is lovely. It cuts flat ironing time in half! I use it during the week to freshen my look in less than 10 minutes. Great purchase, fast shipping, would recommend for touch-ups, pre-teens doing their own hair, and parents of little girls.",

I can section off my hair and run this brush through my hair and have sleek and smooth in about 15 minutes! And it always looks so shiny after I straighten, plus it lasts for a long time. I section my hair, spray it with heat protector, run a regular brush through it then run the straightening brush through it. ( It works much faster if you brush the snarls out first). I recommend this product to anyone with crazy hair that wants smooth hair quickly!",

My hair has some wave to it, but after I shower at night, I brush my hair out and let it air dry (and it looks ratty, stringy, poofy, and just a hot mess). Then I straighten it once it's all dry and boom in less than 10 minutes my hair is done. No tangles and no pulling (like a regular hair straightener does).

If I knew that it would peel I wouldn't have purchased this product.",
