I have to say that, even after reading all the reviews, I am beyond amazed at the quality and feel. I've received and used it today for the first time, couldn't wait! I'm in love with it. My family has used pressure cookers for generations in Brazil, and I continue to use them in the US, and by far...this is the best one I have ever seen and owned. Love the fact that it comes with a glass lid and can be used as a regular pot. Awesomeness!",

It\u2019s a bit hard for me to figure out at first, but once I\u2019m comfortable handling the cooking, everything is just amazing. I was able to cook a beef bone broth for the family in less than 1hr (which normally calls for 24-48hr slow cooking and adding water). And I used it to cook a whole chicken in less than 20min. It\u2019s an amazing addition and I\u2019d wish I have known how to use sooner. It\u2019s acuslly easier to use than the fancy instant pot. And cleanup was fast.",

I find that the pressure valve on this doesn't always pop up, sometimes you can tell it's up to pressure but the valve isn't up, jiggle the pot a little and it pops up. This pot is small, I didn't need a full size, it's narrow and tall. Seems to be sturdy, thick bottom, no burned, stuck on food. Nice basket to keep my potatoes and vegetables out of the broth. Rubber gasket is sturdy also. I am satisfied with this purchase.",

It cooks and vents like the electric ones. The only difference is this one is taller and smaller in diameter. It fits a medium burner on your stove. I would not pressure can in this unit.

    "description": "EAT BETTER\nCOOK HEALTHY\nSAVE ENERGY AND TIME\n\n\nCook delicious and healthy meals in minutes instead of hours, saving valuable time and energy with the Culina One-Touch Pressure Cooker. The 6 Quart size is perfect for creating quick family sized meals. Seal in vitamins, preserve vibrant vegetable colors and create dishes filled with nutrients and flavor. Added accessories make this an exceptionally versatile pressure cooker. \n\nThe One-Touch locking mechanism is easy to operate with one hand. Push one button and the cover is secured in place, regardless of position. Adjust the pressure valve from low to high then let the pot do all the work. Fill the kitchen with aromas of delectable soups, pot roasts, ribs - you name it. Even use for canning. Full instructions (and a tasty recipe to start you off) are included. \n\nNew technology makes pressure cookers easier and safer than ever. With six safety features to ensure the cover will never come off unintentionally, nor will it open if the pressure hasn\u2019t been fully released. Adjust the pressure valve for slow or quick release of steam, without holding down the valve by hand.
