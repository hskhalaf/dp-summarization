The stamps are clean (no oil residue to contend with), the leave a clear impression that is easy to read with only one exception. The letter W does not work well and just looks like a blur. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the one poor quality letter stamp and because there is no mark on the handle marking which way is up. Otherwise a great set at a good price that I am glad I purchased.",

I wish the letters were a little deeper so you could stand without the circle digging into the leather, and they didn\u2019t make it circular where the letter is.

Makes it hard to work on a curved surface and less prominent Bit small On metal, you get 1 shot; if you double tap it just leaves 2 different hard to read marks.
