Fair warning, if you have never used a manual treadmill before you may want to try out walking on an incline first. This is NO joke. Not only are you on a slight incline but it's obviously a little hard to walk on than an automatic one. It is a great workout though, I would recommend to anyone.",

You do need to get a feel for it at first, but that only took like 10 seconds. Anyone still experiencing \"stopping\" just needs to adjust the belt and add lubricant. A small bottle should really be included, but that was cheap and arrived just a day later, so again no complaints. I did not find it overly fast at any point, and running, walking, or slowly strolling are all possible.",

Nothing can be done cheaply to make the belt glide more smoothly. Keep it lubed with silicone spray (sold separately), and know that it takes some effort with each step to get it moving, and that it offers no resistance to keep you from going off the back.",

My husband is over 6' tall and he said he was not comfortable on this. The treadmill is on an incline, so this is for walking only and you have to hold on to the rails. Works for me because my knees are a wreck from years of long distance cycling. However, I still want a low impact cardio workout to go along with my yoga. You are in total control of the speed.",
