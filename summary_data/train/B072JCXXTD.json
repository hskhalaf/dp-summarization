However, it was so much cheaper than I am used to paying of an oximeter that I would probably buy again, unless it quits on me soon.",

Why have one if it\u2019s not useful? The Contec brand came up favorably and this model was of the same type so I got it. Indeed it reads very consistently as I try it with different members of my family. If you\u2019re going to get an oximeter, I recommend getting this one. I didn\u2019t care much about the price but this one also comes in at a lower price than the less accurate ones.",

I\u2019ve tried this many times and in the course of about 90 seconds I got readings that were 48, 117 and 70. That\u2019s just one example of the crazy readings.
