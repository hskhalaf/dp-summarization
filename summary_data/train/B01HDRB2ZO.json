It also has better games like Raw data and Onward which are both just mind blowing. You really feel like you are there on many of the games. Its the best piece of tech I have ever owned and so glad I made the jump. If you want to get into VR gaming , this is by far the best head set right now.",

Most of what's available are actual demos or glorified demos that can be completed in 1 or 2 hours. My opinion is to wait, in comparison you can buy the next gen ps4 PRO and the PSVR for the same price, which on release has more real polished games than the Vive has had in 6 months.",
