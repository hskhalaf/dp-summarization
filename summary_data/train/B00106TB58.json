      "text": "Started using this seed for our parakeets, thinking it was a better brand - after two months or so of using it, one of our parakeets started with extremely fast overgrowth of his beak - had to take him to get it trimmed twice. The vet suggested it may be a liver issue caused by an extremely fatty seed mix. Thankfully we feed them lots of fruits and veggies - if they ate seed only, it could have been much worse. We switched to a very high quality well known brand and the beak growth stopped. Firmly convinced this seed brand was responsible. I do not recommend it!!",

I am not sure why they do not like that piece, but they enjoy everything else, and birds are bound to be picky about something!
