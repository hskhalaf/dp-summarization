I used to put it in cold water so I tried room temperature water instead and it still wouldn't dissolve. It's a clumpy undrinkable mess! I sent an email to Ancient Nutrition who now owns Dr Axe Collagen to ask if there had been changes or had I just gotten a bad batch. The company has never responded to my inquiries. Time to look for a new collagen powder.",

I highly recommend this product. Thank you Dr. Axe for this awesome product, please don't stop making it",

Ancient Nutrition's collagen as a little scoop can go into my 'Budwig Protocol' of Nancy's probiotic cottage cheese, 1 Tbps of Flax seed oil and berries. No taste or consistency change so extra-healthy. This is one supplement I'd recommend to everyone who works out, needs extra collagen to their injuries or just wants that collagen level that came with being younger!",
