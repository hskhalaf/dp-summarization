All I did was grill a couple of hamburger patties. I have NEVER seen so much smoke and spatter from a grill! We live in a downstairs apartment with smoke alarms in each room. I was so nervous that the alarms were going to activate, they didn\u2019t because we fanned the area and opened all the doors and windows. I am so disappointed in this grill.",

I have a favorite steak seasoning but must limit its use to the outdoor grill since the high temperature produced by this grill will quickly fill the room with smoke.

    "description": "The Indoor Electric Grill is perfect for grilling steaks, seafood, vegetables and more. The grill design directs excess oils and fats away from food and into the drip pan for healthier dining. The drip pan is dishwasher safe.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nIdeal for grilling steaks, chicken, fish, burgers, and vegetables indoors, this 1300-watt countertop appliance has a big, family-size grill surface of 12-1/2 by 9-1/4 inches coated with nonstick for low-fat cooking and easy cleaning. A variable heat control provides precise cooking temperatures, and the grill's handles and stylish, dark-gray plastic base stay cool during operation for safety. Another safety feature prevents the heat control, which provides power to the appliance, from being inserted unless the metal drip tray and cooking grid are in place and prevents the grid from being removed during operation. The appliance disassembles easily for cleaning, and the drip tray is dishwasher-safe. Overall, the unit measures 20-3/4 inches wide, 6-1/8 inches high, and 14 inches deep. --Fred Brack",
