The price was low, but the quality is high, packaged nicely as well. It comes with everything needed except for a wet screen cleaner moist towelette. The kit and screen are very nice and it went on very easily. No air bubbles and was easy to line up. (I would advise lining up on the bottom edge to avoid any air bubbles on the top edge.) Would 100% recommend and can't see how you could get a better kit for the price.",

I have applied many screen protectors and I am pretty familiar with how to do it and have it look perfect. I am guessing the fit of this isn't great which is why it looks like crap. I may just remove the second one and buy something else that may possibly fit better....hopefully.",

My problem was that the protector is the exact same size of the screen and so if you're off by any amount, you have corners that have air pockets. Now that I've had to readjust it over and over, it looks bad. There is absolutely no wiggle room like you do on a phone. The product is great but the application is a pain. I'm going to have to use the second one in the pack to see if that ones goes on any better.",
