I plugged my iPhone charger in and it just completely falls out. Piece of crap. Will be sending back immediately",

The flatness of it, makes it virtually invisible. I now have my own corner of the room where I can put my feet up and read, work on my laptop, or just chill.

If you bend your plug (significantly--like maybe 1/4\" inward) you can get it to stay in and make an electrical connection, but not all plugs are easy to bend (nor do I want to bend my expensive adapter plugs).
