I settled on the P6800 after extensive reviews of all available options (Must be Unlock) but no one wanted to ship it to me in Kuwait (military assignment). Thanks to this merchant, I now have an awesome tablet that does everything I want. It's fast, very bright (I have SGS2 and thought the screen was wonderful until I got this)light-weight. Thanks to Kindle and Samsung Galaxy tab 7.7, I have all my books in one place. I am not getting the SGS3 because the tab does everything that I would have wanted from the S3.",

      "text": "I bought the Samsung Galaxy 6810, the WiFi only version, about a month ago. My first impression was that it was small and I thought 'why on Earth didn't I buy a 10\" tablet?\" but a few days of using it convinced me that this size is perfect for holding and carrying around, and comfortable in reading while holding with a single hand. The screen is superb, which is expected being the only tablet with a Super Amoled Plus screen, the colors are vivid, and beautiful. Once I received it I installed Ice Cream Sandwich, and it works fine apart from occasional device restarts and program force closures but I guess that will be solved in future updates.",

I wanted the unlocked version to be able to buy a prepaid sim while traveling in Europe. Here is the states I almost always have a WiFi connection so a sim is not important. On those rare times that I do not have WiFi and need connectivity, I plan to just turn my t-mobile galaxy S2 into a hotspot and tether it to the the tablet. I will let you know how this works when I receive the tablet.",
