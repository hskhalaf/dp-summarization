We have worn them running at the park and in the water. They are great shoes and worth the price! My kids are very active and she prefers these over her Keens. They are well made and I believe they will be very durable! I want a pair for myself now! ETA: They have lasted exceptionally well through our active Summer! She has started the school year wanting to wear them too! Easy to clean! Held up well an entire year and she's asking for another pair!",

That being said, she absolutely loves them They aren't as long as we need, so her toes do overhang a bit. That's disappointing, but not Teva's fault. Since the Easter Bunny brought them, I can't exchange/return. She doesn't care. She's worn nothing since! I feel even with the sizing issue that we'll get our money's worth.",

My kid was pumped about getting these and was devastated that he couldn't keep them (he's two, so it was a big deal to him). Hoping I can find him another pair in the right size, but will probably not be from Amazon.",

The only thing, a mistake in my part; I didn't account for how much she would grow over the summer. I bought these just over a month ago and got them a size up from what she was then, should have done a size and a half (I just hope they last till August).",

I got an 8 because these don't come in half sizes and they are almost too small. Definitely bump up to the next size if your child is in between sizes. Also, it appears the boyish colors are sized for a boys foot. So if you buy a boyish color for a girl it may actually be a little big because it's a boy's size 8 not a girls size 8.",
