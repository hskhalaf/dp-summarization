      "title": "Great Docking Station for MacBook Pro",
      "text": "Exactly what I was looking for to use with my 2017 MacBook Pro. I use this at work everyday to connect power (USB-C), an external USB keyboard, a USB wireless phone dongle, and an external HDMI monitor to my Mac. I have had no issues with any of the peripherals' power, connectivity, or signal transfer. A lot less expensive than Apple's version and it gives me a needed second USB port. Charging is fast and doesn't seem to be inhibited at all running through this dongle versus my USB-C power adapter being plugged directly into the MacBook. Color match is close to Apple's Space Gray, but not an exact match. This doesn't bother me, but may be important to some.",

Pros: Simple to use, responsive, feels high quality, and turns your phone into a desktop.",

The compact design fits unobtrusively in my backpack, and thus-far has survived numerous daily cycles of plugging, unplugging, and moving without a sign of wear. I regularly use the HDMI and the USB3 ports, but haven't had occasion to use the USB-C port yet, although as I understand it is just for charging, not data. I have purchased less expensive versions of this device from other manufacturers, but the cheap ones tends to break after a few uses or the cables separate at the ends. This device is very light weight, but it is also very sturdy.",

We truly appreciate the school providing the device, but it's small and slightly inconvenient to work from during extended sessions. The laptop screen is small and with this I'm able to add a 24\" external display, wireless keyboard and mouse and keep charging the Chromebook with the pass thru charging. The adapter is also small enough that it doesn't take up any unnecessary space on his desk. Extremely happy with the build quality, feels substantial without being heavy. This is a great purchase if you need to connect external devices and are limited by connectivity options.",

We've purchased several types and brands of USB-C hubs, including Apple's official adapters. Of the 5 Trianium USB-C hubs we've purchased, 3 have had issues. 1 has completely failed within the first year of use and 2 have USB-A port issues when using a wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse combo. I've resorted to moving the Logitech USB receiver to a separate USB-C -> USB-A adapter, which isn't ideal. Hope this helps others who may be configuring a similar setup.",

      "text": "I like how sturdy this adapter is. Right off the bat, you feel quality with the aluminum body. Nice USB 3 ports. I like the setup as well. to have 2 USB ports as well as a USB c port to charge and pass through data is great. Also, a full HDMI port is awesome. I haven't really gotten to test the speed of this laptop considering I don't have a USB C laptop. But, I can say this product has a lot of potential. Overall, Great product.",

Not sure if the USB-C port is supposed to only be used for a phone or what the issue is. Edit (03/01/2019): Product has completely stopped working.
