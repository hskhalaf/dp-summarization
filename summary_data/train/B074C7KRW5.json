My phone barely fits into the holder and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s in there very securely either...not really sure that I trust this product for the long term. So far, it\u2019s just been ok, but I\u2019ll definitely be replacing it with something else.",

Having the option to switch between warm and cool lighting profiles is a nice touch to the product. Adjusting the limbs are easy too, and stay in place without that weird springiness you get from other adjustable lamps. I don't use the phone attachment portion, but I tested it once, and it was capable of holding an iPhone 7 up with no issue. The clamp for it is firm and has not slipped or lost its grip since being put into place.",

It has not been moved, or jostled. The portion with buttons still lights up but the light itself does not work. Super disappointed.",
