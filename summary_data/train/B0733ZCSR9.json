To meet my specific support needs, I removed some of the foam shreds to make room to put a softer pillow between the inner shape and the outer velour covering. I was also able to add a little fiber-fill at the top to make it a bit higher. Now it is customized perfection! Very happy!",

I think the biggest size would have been more cozier, but I did not want it to stand out too much or take up too much space. I do not think these products are particularly attractive, but useful. \ud83c\udf3b",

It's comfortable and solid enough to support my back and neck when I inevitably fall asleep with a book in my hand. My daughter loves the one I bought her as well. Definitely glad I made this purchase.",

I never realized how great this was but now I take it to friends' houses for movie nights and have recommended it to many friends. If you do a lot of movies, reading in bed, etc., this is a must have and will really improve your day to day activities!",
