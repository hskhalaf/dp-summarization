My only wish is that the reed diffuser and candle had a stronger perfume, but that might not suit everyone. Personal bonus: I once rode a bicycle for miles through a eucalyptus forest in Portugal, so this scent always reminds me of that.",

Also doesn\u2019t produce as much foam. I need to pour quite a bit be able to get enough foam on my shower sponge. Pluses are that my skin isn\u2019t dry after using it and the scent stay on the skin for some time and doesn\u2019t wash off right away.",

Bought a lot of the retail product for my home use. When the club was making a transition, I was able to purchase at close out prices. Glad to find it on Amazon.",
