These goggles are not a complete cure. But they make a profound difference. I love them and can't imagine ever skiing without them again. They improve my vision enough to give me greater confidence and enjoyment. I can't wait to get a pair of good-looking women's sunglasses with the Prizim lenses.",

I purchased the fire iridium lenses, which seem best suited for a clear and sunny day. The visibility was lacking on a recent snow day so I ordered the Rose prizm replacement lens for an upcoming trip. All in all, a great pair of goggles. They do represent some logistics issues as not all goggle cases can accommodate their size. I would recommend them if you have a larger face and you're looking for the ultimate in unobstructed visibility.",
