      "text": "This Remington blower is great machine. The air velocity isn't quite as strong as the Ryobi blower I replaced, but the volume of air it moves is substantially more. This is like hurricane in your hand. This machine is also one of the few that can be used as a vacuum. That is important to me. I dinged it a star for two reasons. First, it is a bit heavy. Second, it is more difficult to start than the Ryobi was. The Ryobi always started on the fourth pull, but the Remington takes about a dozen to wake up.",

I especially like that it uses gas and not a power cord and have found a lot of ways to use it since I can go anywhere with it, even on the roof. I would definitely recommend this product and even recently purchased a Remington \"weed eater\" because of such a positive experience with the leaf blower. Remington has a You Tube channel that has great information on their products.",

I did however like how easy this starts and runs. But that's about the only good thing.",

The weight is a little heavier that I like but, hey, at least it runs, unlike my two poulan\u2019s. I would recommend this blower for leaf blowing and lighter around the house chores such as blowing out gutters.",

All other makes that I looked at do not offer this feature. I am well satisfied with this unit and believe it is a great value for anyone!!!!!!!!",

That being said, this Remington product is only useful as a relatively decent blower. The vacuum part is completely ineffective - clogs immediately with any volume of leaves, bag is flimsy, and it fills up fast. Additional problems: the air filter cover falls off every time it's used and the air tubes that fasten together leak at the seam. Recommend buying these types of products from a store that accepts returns.",

Thankfully I saved my old tube and attached with set screws or unit wiould be unusable for me. For 10cts to manufacture tube longer it would receive a 5plus star rating, but I'm 6ft 1\" and can only give it an honest 3 stars. After my conversion it does a FABULOUS job.",

I bought this unit to use in my offhand as I run a backpack blower as well (yes I use two blowers, its effective and I have a lot of leaves to blow). It is practically useless if they leaves you are blowing are not PERFECTLY dry and crispy. I will finish out Fall with it, but will give it away next year and purchase a different unit.",

At this price point I am guessing they are all very similar. I did not require a vacuum feature. Trigger lock is a nice feature. Is it as good as a Stihl BG86; no but it is also 90 bucks less.",
