    "description": "Color:Warm White\n\nSolight Design's SolarPuff is a solar-powered self-inflating lantern that is durable, flexible, waterproof and can float. Made from a hybrid PET sailcloth, it is the lightest solar lantern on the market and emits a delightful dispersion of light. Available in both white and color-changing options.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nEasy to Use The folding design of the origami balloon inspired the design for the SolarPuff. Just pull up and it pops open to a cube.\n\nMerlin SolarPuff - the Color-Changing Option The Merlin series optimizes the magic of six colors in one unit. Red, green, blue, yellow, white and pink LEDs create a spectacular array of beautiful hues. Simply press the button to change color - display one steady color or set it to automatically change the colors for you.\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Renewable solar energy means zero carbon footprint and long-term clean energy to mitigate environmental degradation. Charging in the sun for 8 hours will give enough light for 8-12 hours.\n\nLight, Portable, Waterproof Weighs only 2.6 ounces, packs flat to 0.25-inches thin, and can float in water and be submerged to 6 feet below water surface.\n\nSocial, Efficient, Economical Enables community gatherings in rural areas and provides safety after disaster; low cost makes light affordable for everyone.\n\n\n\n\nBeautifully Architected, Sustainable Home Lighting Products Our company mission is to provide lights to those who need them most. There are over 1.6 billion people who have no access to electricity and clean sustainable lighting, something most of us take for granted.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nSolar, Flatpack, Light\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nAfter realizing my son's asthma was caused by pollution, I looked for a sustainable form of energy harnessing. Solar cells were most efficient, so I created a prototype for a solar inflatable light. When the Haiti earthquake happened, I turned my studio at Columbia University into an innovation studio for developing solutions to help Haiti, and then the application of the solar inflatable light became the SolarPuff and the SolarHelix. -Alice Min Soo Chun, CEO Solight Design\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nTo aid our mission, 3% of our net sales goes to supplying lights throughout the world through our NGO partners, who work in developing regions to deliver lights to people in need.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nThe best part is hearing from our customers how our light has changed their lives.",
