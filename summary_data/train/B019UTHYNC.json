They looked great, we got them several months in advance and were very excited. I detached the detachable daypack for the plane ride there, and we sent the bag as baggage on the plane... When I tried re-attaching the day-pack upon arrival, I heard a crack and the zipper had broken on our FIRST DAY. This was extremely upsetting and disappointing, especially after all the great reviews and comments about this product.",

The top \"Flap\" doesnt fold all the way down so it leaves you with about 1' or so that your hand is really moving things around in order to search. Material is awesome and of course it looks great.

I've never used the daypack attached to the main pack so can't comment on that. Main pack does fit on airline and train overheads based on my testing but caution is advised on when flying on smaller, single isle aircraft...I don't think it will fit overhead on most of those planes.

I wish there was a bit more organization on the small day pack. it's pretty much just one pocket. Maybe another stash pocket on the outside?",

It makes carrying it a bit awkward, doesn\u2019t feel as comfortable as my friend\u2019s bag. I didn\u2019t notice it until I started packing for the trip and now I don\u2019t know what to do. I need the bag for the trip and I leave tomorrow. For as expensive as the bag is I\u2019m disappointed. I\u2019m hoping something can be worked out when I get back.

My only wish is that the day pack had more zippered compartments inside or outside; I like to organize a bit more than throw everything in a crap sack.",

Feel free to add an extra sweater and a pair of waterproof boots; this pack is designed to handle loads up to 50 pounds. The LightWire frame suspension transfers the load from harness to hipbelt. A mesh backpanel improves ventilation and the mesh on the harness and hipbelt reduces chafing under load. The entire suspension stows away under a zippered panel creating a sleek silhouette for transport. Inside there\u2019s a mesh pocket for small items. Dual compression straps keep cargo from shifting during transit. Outside you\u2019ll find a zippered front panel slash pocket to keep you organized and sewn attachment points to lash on extra gear. The main Farpoint 55 pack comes with a detachable Farpoint daypack to carry the essential for a hike in the hills or an excursion downtown. No matter where you go, the Farpoint is backed by Osprey's All Mighty Guarantee.",
