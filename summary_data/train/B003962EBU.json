My daughter called me on a Friday @ 5pm and said the grandson (who has Aspergers) dropped his camera (which he plays with everyday) and was hysterical. I looked up cameras on Amazon, found this one and ordered it. He received it ON SATURDAY MORNING! HOLY CATS! Hysteria resolved. He e-mails me photos every week (I live in Maine - he is in NJ). And he has even posted three movies on YouTube that he made with this camera - and for his age, they aren't bad. I love you Amazon and Panasonic. Good Job!",

The touchscreen feature sometimes doesn't quite work as expected, but with patience it gets the job done. The 14.1 MP resolution results in great pictures, but the functions are still a little complicated for me... There are many different combinations that can be used which becomes a little too much. I highly recomend this camera. However, if you have issues with a touchscreen, this camera might not be the one for you, as the touchscreen on it sometimes doesn't respond. I am really pleased with my purchase.",

I returned the first one, but decided to keep second one (I did not want to continue arguing with Panasonic on their product low quality.

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP3 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Screen LCD (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe flat body and compact size of the DMC-FP3 allow it to fit nicely into a small handbag. Built of high-quality aluminum, the DMC-FP3 also brings a wide range of colors to the series. The new lens cover both protects the lens from scratches or dusts and serves as the camera's power switch, making it fast and easy to slip the camera out of a pocket or a bag and turn on the power. The delicate hairline finish on the lens cover of the DMC-FP3 elegantly accents the design. You'll want to take this sleek, stylish camera with you everywhere you go, like a fashion accessory. \n\nLumix DMX-FP3 Highlights \n\nTouch Screen Operation\nThe newly adopted static sensor type 3.0-inch touch-screen LCD on the DMC-FP3 gives you an easy, intuitive control thanks to a hybrid operation combined with the 4 major operation buttons. Touch operation is free and smooth either in recording or playing back images. \n\nOnce you compose the flame, all you have to do is touch the area you wish to focus on before pressing the shutter button halfway. \n\nYou can drag the image across the screen with a finger to browse the collection of photos as you flip over the pages of the book. Sonic Speed AF\nThe Sonic Speed AF system in the DMC-FP3 has a maximum speed of approx. 0.33 second for auto focusing*. It includes numerous re-engineering enhancements, including a higher-speed actuator, optimized algorithms and parallel software processing. The result is fast and accurate AF performance. You can quickly get moving subjects in focus, such as when you're shooting sports scenes.\n* Using the 1-area AF, at the wide-end. \n\nHD Movie Recording\nThe DMC-FP3 can record motion images in high-definition (1,280 x 720 pixels at 30 fps in Motion JPEG format). The pixel mixed readout method enables bright motion-image recording even in low-light settings. The DMC-FP3 can also record full-size motion images in WVGA (848 x 480 pixels at 30 fps) or standard motion images in VGA (640 x 480 pixels at 30 fps) and QVGA (320 x 240 pixels at 30 fps). \n\n\n4x Optical Zoom / Up to 8.4x Extra Optical Zoom\nThe DMC-FP3 is equipped with a 4x optical zoom lens (35mm camera equivalent: 35-140mm). The Extra Optical Zoom function*1 uses the center part of the CCD to extend this 4x zoom ratio to powerful 8.4x zoom (35mm camera equivalent: 295mm) at a resolution of 3-megapixel or less. Adding the Extra Optical Zoom to the 4x digital zoom*2 extends the total zooming power to a maximum of 33.8x.\n*1 At a resolution of 3-megapixel or less. In the DMC-FP3, image resolution is kept at its maximum size to the optical tele-end even if the Extra Optical Zoom is ON.\n*2 As digital magnification increases, resolution significantly decreases. Venus Engine IV\nThe image-processing engine, Venus Engine IV, uses advanced signal processing to give you beautiful images even when the sensitivity is high. Multi-task signal processing is employed for all images to enable high-speed, high-performance shooting. Venus Engine IV also effectively raises the precision of various functions, such as MEGA O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) and Intelligent ISO Control. Along with its extremely high performance, Venus Engine IV reduces power consumption thanks to a number of energy efficiency improvements. Extended Battery Life\nThe energy-saving Venus Engine IV image-processing engine and the efficient, rechargeable lithium-ion battery which has been slimmed down to fit into thinner camera bodies work together to extend the shooting time of the DMC-FP3. This lets users take approx. 300 shots on a single battery charge*.\n* Based on the CIPA standard.",
