This machine runs non-stop...even when it\u2019s off. It will still blow cold air and operates though it is not \u201con\u201d. It cannot be left plugged in or on continuous run. It cannot be left in its own water pool (within the machine).",

      "text": "This product is overrated and over priced. It is not convenient to pour water since you have to flip the tank and unscrew the cap to refill water. No handle to grip the tank. You have to hold the tank with both hands. You have to wait until the water completely run out before refilling. If you lift up the tank while water in it, there is a spill. Other similar products allow you to pour water from the top without any spill. Bad design by having one push button for all functions, light, no light with low mist, light, no light with high mist. If you miscount the push, it turns off and you have to start over again.",

      "text": "I felt like this product deserves a positive review. I bought one around 2018 for my nursery - it was great, easy to clean, but the beeping between stages was SO loud. Such a pain. Recently, both me and my baby are sick, and I decided to buy a second one. The company has clearly lowered the volume which I super appreciate. I put the quieter one in the nursery. I do wish they would consider changing the light color. Blue is not a good \u201cmiddle of the night\u201d color because it\u2019s too bright. A warm amber would be much less distracting.",

Just to clarify for anyone who has not yet purchased the unit - you can turn off the night light feature and the only blue light is a power indicator light. I like to sleep in a dark room and can't believe that tiny light could be a problem unless you sleep with the humidifier a few inches away from your face.",

However, when setting up for Winter 2017 operation just a week ago, it simply would not operate and 14 days past its two year warranty. It was clean and ready to put in use again, but sadly it had other plans. I would like to purchase another, since the tank, caps, and brush are in good condition, but not sure since the motor appears to be the weak link and the problem.",

      "text": "Absolutely silent and works really well! With the winter upon us, I was getting tired of choosing which of my two sick boys got to use the \"Vicks\" brand humidifier we already had. I was skeptical of the previous reviews saying this thing was super quiet because the other one we have sounds like a Yeti blowing his nose. But seriously, this UltraSonic Cool Mist Humidifier is SILENT. And it looks great. I haven't had to clean it yet, but it does come with a handy-dandy cleaning brush to get to the harder to reach parts of the humidifier. Really, REALLY pleased with this, and I may pick up another one and donate the old one we have.",
