There is no scent, and you can totally tell when you need a second washing (can't get away with not removing your makeup first) because you don't get that thick, frothy foam after 30 seconds. The only gripe I have with the product is the residue that is always hanging off the little plastic spout, and hardens after time. I guess it foams up a little bit at the mouth of the spout, and dries up, causing crusting, and it's annoying to have to scrape it off or the cleanser won't come out.",

I am a mixed oil skin, it is very gentle to use and does not irritate the skin. You only need to squeeze once to wash your face. It is also prone to foaming. After using it for a while, I found that my acne was really less than before.",

Now even with some liquid adhering to the inside of the bottle and the pump - it still was extremely short on liquid volume as stated on the plastic bottle. So - Amazon, better check this supplier / manufacturer as this is not up to your standards.",
