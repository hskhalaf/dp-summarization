But as I said if you\u2019re looking for a simple card that can load almost every hame with decent frames on decent settings, with easy to install drivers then this isn\u2019t a bad shout ( although I will get a 2070S or 2080 eventually)",

The noises seem fun(irony on) because depends on what you have on the screen. If it's a game very colourful it becomes noisier and noisier... This is very annoying because of the unexpected noise and because of how loud it is. I'm very disappointed and I wouldn't buy it nor suggest it to anyone. I have tried to re-install all drivers, run tests and nothing the noise won't go.",
