Looks beautiful in the living room. Don't forget to tap the barometer, and remember the lowest FLOATING bulb is the current temperature. Enjoy!",

The glass globes have pointed tips and float inside a glass tube. I don't know how it could be shipped and not have potential breakage. Anyway, our's was broken, and we had to return it. A shame!",
