Hint: You probably need to let it charge for a full day and then do the reset instructions a few times. charge some more and then reset some move. I love the MyLand that comes with this device. That's why I kept trying to get it to charge and power on. After using for a few weeks, the MyLand feature disappeared from the App!!! BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Customer service is very friendly and is currently helping me with this. If they are not able to get the MyLand back on my app. (it only disappears when I pair Striiv Play) I'm returning and going back to use the ole' stand by FitBit!",

On the other hand, I did buy the bigger Striiv and it works and sync great. The small Wireless one I would not buy again but, may purchase the bigger non-wireless model again to replace the gift for fathers day.",

Battery life is about two or three days but it's just a matter of remembering to plug it in. It's now fun if your friends gets one too for the competitions.",

I end up with a stair count for the day, but I cant see it increment as I am doing stairs. Striiv is aware of the issue, and believe they have logged it.

I am flabbergasted by what appears to be short vision of the creators of this device to not have an option to sync this device for Android products as well. I am an Apple products fan, yet you can't sleep on the advances Samsung is making of which utilizes Android technology. The end result was I returned this product and purchased a Fitbit Flex.

I would have given it 4 stars except for this I wish did not have to do this again,:-(.... but will repurchase. PS from those who purchase and it does not work straight away plug it in for a couple of hours and it should then start",

If someone does not mind charging it every day this a great product.",
