The coloring product is a paste and you activate it with some drops that are the consistency of water. The product does not mix effectively and it\u2019s difficult to work with. I used it on my very blonde brows per the instructions and you could not tell I even dyed them after the product was wiped off. Thinking it was operator error, I did it a couple more times after the next couple of days...same results. The remainder of the box went into the trash can.",

The dark brown color looks very natural with my medium blonde hair color and was plenty dark enough for my purposes; to have natural looking darker eyelashes, not to use as a substitute for mascara. I definitely poked myself in the eye with this product and I didn't go blind, so that's the biggest plus, honestly.",
