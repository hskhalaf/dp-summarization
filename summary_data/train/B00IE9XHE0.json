What sold this camera to me was the price and having a viewfinder this is a must on bright sunny days. There are two minor issues the battery won't last as long as a S.L.R camera and the SD memory card is difficult to remove. I recommend a small pair of tweezers for this job. Lastly I'll be taking this Sony camera out with me a lot more than my bulky but very good S.L.R camera.",

      "text": "This is an absolutely fantastic camera, especially if you're starting out or looking for a good budget camera. The noise reduction at high ISO is really well done and I can get good shots at 3200 ISO with very little noise. It is capable of shooting at 11 frames per second and has a buffer of 20 images RAW (which I would recommend you to shoot in), so you don't need to get the absolute best SD card (I personally use a SanDisk Extreme Pro). The camera is excellent for macro photography, wildlife photography and astrophotography (what I use it for). The Sony a6000 is overall, a very nice camera. Highly recommended product.",

For the price, you get snappy auto focus, 1080p image quality more than suitable for 2019 and enough data with XAVC to colour grade to a high standard. Battery life is poor but not completely hopeless, and the lack of S log is a shame but understandable given it's release date. In short, slap a fast 50mm lens on the front, keep the picture profile flat and stick to the crop sensor's dynamic range limitations, and you have yourself a VERY cinematic image indeed.",

Other than the central area, the sharpness is pretty awful at most focal lengths, though it is just about usable from maybe 24-35mm. I don't understand why Sony does these good APS-C bodies, but cannot provide a single half decent standard zoom.",

I bougbt it to replace a NEX-6 which to be honest had much better build quality and finish than the a6000, but once you get past the rather plasricy build the a6000 is a far better camera in almost all respects. In particular the EVF is MUCH better despite having lower resolution - it is far easier to use in bright light, especially for glasses wezrers like me. The camera specs (and menus!) are a vast improvement over the NEX apart from the odd missing feature like the lack of an electronic level fur example. Bizarre, but not enough to lose a star.",

Plus we wanted the mode selection dial rather than accessing those via the screen. The digital view finder is very handy too when shooting in bright outside conditions.
