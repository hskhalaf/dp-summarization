      "text": "Pros: - After trying different in-ears from different brands (e.g. Sony, Beats, Phillips, etc.) with the price of let's say less than even $100, I came back to my first choice, Creative EP-630. Its very clear in high-range and mid-range, but it's bass is mediocre. if you need a strong bass it might not be the best option, but I believe it's one of the most balanced in-ear in the market. Cons: - If you listen to music non-stop with high volume it might not last more than 6 months. - It falls off easy for some people.Definitely not a good idea for sports purposes.",

THANK GOD I found out what company makes these!! My original pair from 2008 are still working fine and they've been run through the ringer. So I found these and got the white ones to match the PSVR. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH!! These really are incredible for the price.",

The Sony's are double the price, but they do have a richer sound, so that equals out. The sound from these is just fine, although if you are an audiophile, you might not be impressed. Probably the most important thing is to try out all 3 of the different size ends (the Sony's come with 4) and find the best fit.",

To sustain my headphones durability life, I super glued the areas where it can come loose. Pros: Very affordable. Sounds great! Very easy to disguinish between a standard mp3 format vs high bit rate format. Cons: Low volume can hear the distoration in high quality songs. P.S. I consider myself an audiophile.",

The buds that came with the ipod used to drive me crazy by constantly slipping out of my ears while I exercised. These not only sound much better than the original equipment buds, but don't slip out of my ears thanks to the silicone ear pieces. They have the perfect amount of noise isolation, enough to keep the music sounding good, but still able to pick up on traffic noise in the background for safety. I have been wrapping them around the ipod and they unwind nicely each time without kinking. I am so glad I bought these.",
