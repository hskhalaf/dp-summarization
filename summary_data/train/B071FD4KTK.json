      "text": "I love this concept putting a selfie and tripod into one stick. I use tripod all the time but ocaasionally like taking pic with my boy and this one works perfectly. The rod is made very strong unlike other typical ones that are very flimsy and easily bend. Each tripod leg has a rubber grip so keeps the stand in place. Also I able to use my battery pack case and still attach the phone to the selfie stick. It does come with a Bluetooth shutter button makes it even more convenient and it slides nicely on to the stick. If you like selfies this is definately the one to get.",

I tested the Bluetooth out, and it is connected and working fine; however, if you purchase this for tripod than it's not working really well. I bought this because I need to film some cooking videos using the tripod. But it's not working out, legs are not sturdy. There are no lock or unlock button to hold the legs together, so my iphone 7s Plus is falling/flipping down when I have it in 180 degree.",

Pros: compact size, easy to use remote, attached tripod, doesn't use batteries for the remote (I, however, prefer batteries which can be changed when charging power isn't always available) Cons: the part that holds the phone is not tight, and the camera is tilted when attached. It is easy to compensate when holding the stick, but when using the tripod, the picture will not be straight, have to charge remote using a plug (not always convenient), short stick length I also bought this for my adult daughter who likes it. I like it, but I don't love it.",

The tripod feature supports the phone well enough when the stick is fully extended and when the tripod is on a firm surface. The length of the stick makes it appropriate for holding the phone at the proper height when sitting on the ground. Had no trouble pairing the remote control to the phone through Blue Tooth. Have not fully tested the life of the battery yet however was able to use the remote for ten minutes without problems. The phone holder is like a spring-loaded clamp. Maximum opening available to hold phone horizontally is 3 inches.",

My phone almost got cracked (thanks to a glass screen protector) when I was using it as a tripod and it fell, but most of the selfie sticks don't even work as tripods and you don't wanna carry heavy tripods around anyways. So it works great if you make sure it's stable. You might want to leave your bag or something in front of it so that it could catch the phone in case it falls too. I'm so happy with the product and I couldn't have taken such great pictures without this!!! You just have to make sure you don't over use it until or partner gets sick of taking pictures! Haha",
