I have a half acre and when i used this in my back yard my leaves were gone in 30 minutes. when i rake it takes hours. it has saved me a ton of work. i wish it was a little quieter. it is loud and after 20 minutes it's annoying. The weight of it is good but a half pound less would be perfect. For the money i'm very happy and i love the green color.",

I just cleared 6 inches of leaves off of my back deck in about 10 minutes. They were also snowed on 3 days ago, so they weren't exactly dry. Time to go do a bit of the yard... Also, the people saying it comes unplugged easily; you're clearly doing it wrong. See pic. 10/10 would recommend!",

I have several large eucalyptus trees planted behind my home (HOA won't cut them down) and there's a constant supply of bark, leaves, branches, seeds and pollen that fall throughout the year.
