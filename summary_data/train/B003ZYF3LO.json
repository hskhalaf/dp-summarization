You are probably not looking for this camera because it is \"out-dated\" as far as markets go but I am still using it and there has not been a single problem since I purchased it. I have used it in different countries as well. Okay, so this is not so much a product review but my appreciation of the Nikon brand. I would recommend a Nikon camera any day simply because mine has gone so many years without a single problem.",

I haven't been able to figure out yet but it may be stemming from a former setup to maintain battery life longer.",

Besides having a much higher resolution, some of the new features on the 3100 make it much more usable for the types of photography I normally do. I also like the HD movie feature with the 3100. When using a HDMI cable to view movies on my HDTV it really shows the quality of the 3100. I highly recommend this product to those who enjoy higher end digital photography.",

And provides much better depth of field with the standard lens then I thought. We took it on vacation with us and came back with better pictures than we have ever had. I'm just a beginner to the DSLRs. This camera appears to have all of the features that I need to begin taking better pictures and to learn how to use some of the more advanced features. I'm glad I didn't spend more money on a camera with features that I probably wouldn't appreciate, at least not at my current level of expertise.",

Controls are will laid out, options are plentiful, and the in-camera editing has some very useful little features. If you're disappointed with this camera there is something wrong with you.",

The camera can do that, just get to the menu for it. Otherwise, this camera has been great. We're finally not missing those pivotal moments with this camera - those smaller cameras typically take 2-4 seconds to decide if they're going to take a pic or not. And it does tack pretty good movie quality scenes as well.",

Jello cam--also known as rolling shutter--is when a video image wobbles and bends like jello when the camera is moved. To a certain extent it's a problem with all CMOS cameras, but this Nikon seems to be particularly jello-y. Locked-down footage looks great. Stills look great.
