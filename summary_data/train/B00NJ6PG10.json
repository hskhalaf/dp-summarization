One drawback, when the wire moves across clothing it generates noise in the earbud. the workaround I came up with is to drop the wire in between my body and first layer of clothing. It doesn't move the same way against asking, and doesn't make noise. This does mean a portion of shirt (or all) needs to remain untucked for the wire to get to my iPod/iphone.",

That said, the headphone covers do as promised. These things will not fall out of your ears. All in-ear headphones i have had will eventually fall out or get slightly dislodged. These don't.

Also I'm not a huge fan of the new style of buds with the noise cancelling piece.

I bought these for that feature because I work in a busy office, but I found them to be no more noise isolating than other yurbuds I've had in the past. Generally this is a feature rather than a bug, because they allow you to listen at a normal volume while still being aware of your surroundings, but it wasn't what I wanted here. It even says that it allows ambient sound on the package.",

Headphones there are not grip in the inside of the ear, there are move, but does not mean they get out of the ear. Very good sound, you hear ambient noise but is not lost quality. They have magnets on helmets. It is very comfortable take them off and together behind your head without falling or remain tangled cables. Negative: The controls Iphone handle the volume is was very low, if you're wearing a jacket have to unbutton his jacket to up volume. Running cables move much, is good idea, one small clip.",
