      "text": "I am so relieved these headphones are so very good - primarily, because I felt so very guilty ever since I pushed the acquisition key! Cheap they are not - gulp - but they are quite simply the best headphones I have ever owned. And by quite a distance as well. Others have provided excellent analysis re the technicalities of this item, so I will not bore anyone to death with my own views on the same. All I will say, is if you are in the market for some seriously good headphones, you could do much worse than these beauties - at any price!",

Fast forward to now and I wanted to be able to enjoy watching TV without waking the neighbours or generally causing noise pollution. Suffice to say, wireless headphones have come on a LONG way. These wireless headphones deliver sound that is comparable to my hardwired \u00a3300 pair of Beyerdynamic MMX300s. Summary? They are pricy, but once you hear them, you'll be in love.",

      "text": "For the hard of hearing these headphones are a wonderful discovery. I can now view a video/film and actually hear the dialogue So much better and clearer than hearing aids or regular headphones. They seem have the same audio correction algorithms as a hearing aid, but a much more powerful diaphragm to create the sound The only reason for giving 4 stars rather than 5 is that they leak audio to the extent that my wife could hear the dialog. They are closed back headphones and should not do this. Its a design fault. Fortunately the problem can be corrected by carefully using narrow black sticky tape to cover the gap on each of the headphones",

He cannot turn the volume loud enough for them to be of any use as there is a constant echo. If he listens at the volume which does not produce an echo then this is not loud enough for the rest of the family. There is a delay in getting the audio to the headphones, which is frustrating and produces an echo. Defeats the whole object of them supposedly being the greatest benefit to those with assisted hearing. Waste of time and money.",
