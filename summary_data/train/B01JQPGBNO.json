We love that it came with a weather bag to keep the bag dry if he was ever caught in a rain storm. There are a lot of places to store all the extra parts which is great. The only thing that my husband said is that fitting a 250 drone into the interior spot is a squeeze. He has opted to keep his on the exterior for now.",
