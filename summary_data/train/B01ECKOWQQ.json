I dial it in to what I think the middle should be, then mark from both ends. The actual middle is between my two marks. Great product.",

    "description": "Style:25' Measuring TapeThe QUICKDRAW PRO Tape Measure is the FASTEST, most ACCURATE measuring device in the construction industry today. The patented graphite marking system comes preloaded and ready to mark. The internal steel wheel easily and accurately applies a graphite mark/line right where you want it. DON\u2019T WASTE ANYMORE TIME LOOKING FOR OR SHARPENING A PENCIL! \n\nBETTER, FASTER, STRONGER The New QUICKDRAW PRO Tape Measure is the next evolution of the original QUICKDRAW DIY (w/black casing). Every feature has been upgraded to meet the demands of the professional contractor, and to help the weekend warrior build like a PRO. \n\nLOSE YOUR PENCIL QUICKDRAW PRO makes 2000+ marks (1/4\u201d) per load. Reloading takes only 10 seconds. Refills are available on Amazon. \n\nMAKE NO MISTAKE By acting exactly like a gun sight, the new (patent pending) wedge indicator gives you extreme accuracy. From the front, it\u2019s a wedge shape, but look down from above and the wedge become a single red line that tells you precisely where you\u2019re putting your mark. The Tru-VIEW WEDGE ensures dead nuts accuracy every time. \n\nDRAW CIRCLES AROUND THE COMPETITION Want to cut an 8\u201d hole? No Problem. Simply lock your tape blade at 4\u201d, hold the corner of the tape hook on your center point and draw your circle (see the QUICKDRAW PRO video for example). Making a radius is so simple now, what used to take minutes now only takes seconds with QUICKDRAW PRO. \n\nLOCK IT UP TIGHT The new heavy duty brake-lock is made of a composite rubber that grips the blade from top and bottom to securely lock the tape blade, resulting in the most accurate marks, lines and radius\u2019 in the industry. \n\nCLIP N\u2019 GO Our belt clip is made of heavy gauge spring steel with an industrial chrome finish. It\u2019s almost indestructible. Now you can feel secure knowing that your tape measure is always by your side. \n\nWEATHER THE STORM QUICKDRAW PRO dominates all industry durability tests. A hurricane would struggle to damage this tape. \u201cWhat about the rain?\u201d you ask - QUICKDRAW is your best friend when working with damp, or even dripping wet lumber. You will get an extra dark line on wet lumber and almost all other wet materials.",
