The bottom line is that the lamp is okay I suppose, but the remote is absolute trash. UPDATE #1: Customer Service contacted me and four days later I received a replacement remote. The new remote works just as expected so far! Will update this review again in case anything changes but I'm very happy with the customer service and the new remote so far. Original Review: Bought this lamp three weeks ago. About two weeks after use, the remote started to fail and barely responds anymore at this point. Pretty disappointed by how fast this product falls apart.",

This might seem fantastic; however, one light is in the living room and on light is in a bedroom. Every time I use the remote to turn on the light both come on. When I use a remote to turn off a light both go off. This has rendered the remote controls useless. I do not recommend purchasing 2 lamps unless you want them to both be off or on at the same time. Excellent purchase if you only want one.",

It has be turned all the way up first in order to dim it (and vice versa) and can take a few tries to get a response. It's definitely not due to fat-fingering; I'm a pianist with pretty slim fingers. Fortunately, the remote has actual buttons has individual buttons for on, off, brighten and dim, and the remote itself even has a magnet to attach to a fridge/whiteboard.",

Tried everything I can think of to get rid of it like adding ferrite magnets core around the power cable for the lamp. But that didn't fix the problem. Have moved the lamp to other outlets in the room. But the only way to fix the interference is move the lamp to a different circuit which would remove it from the room that I actually need the lamp. I think the reason is the A/C adapter has no ground plug.. but not entirely sure. All i know is I purchased a different lamp and it doesn't cause this issue!",

Using LED\u2019s that produce a warm white light, it\u2019s brightness is unparalleled in producing 3,000 lumens strong lighting (the same as a 150W incandescent light bulb) but at an energy saving rate of only 30W of power. Using an astounding 85% less energy this is the best modern floor lamp for living room, bedroom, or office.",
      "CONVENIENT REMOTE & TILTABLE DESIGN - The upright floor lamp comes with a 360\u00b0 omnidirectional (point anywhere) remote control to set your lighting anywhere from up to 60 feet. The remote can be easily placed on metal surfaces (fridge, whiteboard, and lamp) for convenient access. The head light is tiltable to a 90\u00b0degree angle to illuminate specific areas that you choose. Don\u2019t settle for the floor lamps that are rigid in design, get the one suited for your needs in both the home and office.",

With a stepless dimming design, holding down on the touch sensor will adjust the lighting gradually to suit your needs. Once you\u2019ve set a comfortable brightness level, the built in memory function will keep that for you even when turned off.",
      "SAFETY A PRIORITY - The UL-certified adapter on the dimmable floor Lamp converts the voltage output from 120V to a mere 24V to avoid electroshock. The trip-proof power cord has a two piece detachable design to prevent accidents and with a heavy lamp base will stay grounded.",
