I think this is probably good if you are not comfortable using a utility but a utility knife is just as, if not more effective. Also the area that accommodates the corrugated plastic is not very wide so either you would have to buy another blade for thicker plastic or buy another tool. Overall if you have a utility knife and are comfortable using it. You do not need this.",
