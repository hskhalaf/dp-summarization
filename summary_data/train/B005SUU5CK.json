The main reason I'm writing this is in case somebody else has a problem of finding the key or figuring out how to open the case at first. The keys are inside of the case but in order to open it you have to slide the keyhole mechanism(located on each side) to the side to unlock each latch. I was not aware that these could move so I could not figure it out at first. Pretty solid case though.",

The Musician\u2019s Friend/Guitar Center brand cases that are often on sale for as low as $49 are just about the same build quality. One nice advantage over third party is that it is a perfect fit for on a Stratocaster. There is zero wiggle room on the inside for your guitar to be damaged, but there is almost no padding underneath the fuzzy fabric. I dont think that\u2019s a problem, but a layer of padding would give you more peace of mind.",

I did not order a replacement as even without the hardware damage, the case appeared marginally sturdy. For storing in a closet I would say this is a fine case, but if you are a road warrior with your guitar, I would look into a better case.",

Interior of the case is adequate, I would prefer it to have a little more \"fluff\" to the plush part but it's fine. It's some sort of formed plastic molding with a 1/4-1/2 inch of plush fibers. The case itself hugs a bass well enough and the outside of the case is very attractive. Perfectly fine case just be mindful that with certain models the top may apply some unwanted pressure to the bridge or knobs.",

It supports the neck nice with 12 inches of cutout from body to headstock. I liked the inside of case. I am putting a few photos.
