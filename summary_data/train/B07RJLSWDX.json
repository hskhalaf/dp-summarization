      "text": "I get new surfboards fairly often (about 3-4 a year) and traction pads at the store can be quite expensive. This is my first time trying a cheaper no-name brand from Amazon and I must admit, I am quite surprised. The quality of the pad is pretty good. Just the right amount of grip without being too rough but not slippery either. The only downside to this pad is that it's a little thinner than I would like. Some people might like that but I prefer having a little more cushion for the pushin'. Other than that, I would likely buy another one again. I want to see how it holds up for a whole season and then reevaluate.",
