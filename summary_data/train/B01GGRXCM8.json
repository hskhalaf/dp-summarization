It was really one of the few that can actually be made into a rectangle shape and still be stable and sturdy. We have ours on wood floors so I don\u2019t know if this is the same for carpet but on our floors, the sides do not wobble. The bottom of each panel has this little plastic disc to help make it \u201cstick\u201d. It\u2019s really easy to put together too. Did lots of research...so glad we got this one.

One Star off bc after 3 months, the suction cups no longer stick to the hardwood making it easy for baby to push the slates away. She can only push them a few inches, and they won\u2019t disconnect. But she loves putting everything into her mouth so all the crumbs that seep under the fence is exposed. If your baby is learning to stand, be careful of the lack of suction as a little jerk could make little one stumble or bump chin on the fence. Other than that, easy to clean and an overall great buy",

Maybe she is just strong? Or maybe you need to put some water under the suction? IDK.. overall I think I would have kept it if not for the clashing colors.",

It's versatile, we used it as a fence for her corner while she was a crawler, as it's intended I guess, but soon we baby-proofed the living room with it, covering the fireplace with one side, and covering the entrance with another.
