The possibilities are endless, and even if you've played the vanilla game to completion there's a huge community behind it that have created countless fantastic mods and multiplayer servers which extend your game time more or less forever. I would recommend buying the official game codes like this one instead of the cheap accounts you see on Ebay as those ones are actually accounts that have been stolen from other people and resold (which explains their confusingly low price)",
