      "text": "These shoes, while they have amazing arch and heel support, are otherwise poorly made. The rubber pulls away easily, the stitching started coming loose after a few weeks, and the leather separated from the sole, all within four months. Since it was summer, I didn\u2019t wear them as often as other seasons. I bought these shoes after reading recommendations from users and an article highlighting the excellent support for high arches. Unfortunately, I spent more money on these shoes than I ever have, yet they lasted far less time. I\u2019m so disappointed and frustrated. I wish the arch and heel support was inside a better quality, better manufactured shoe. I included pictures showing some of the issues described.",

I also wear Vionic for my over pronation issues too and these shoes have made all the difference for my poor feet. My son generally wears an 11 in athletic shoes so I ordered a 11.5 and a 12 since I read on the Vionic web site that you should order one size up on these. After trying both pairs he decided a whole size up (the 12) was the best fit. Vionic was right, order a whole size up. He wore them to work and he said, \"So much better!\"",

These just don't feel as supportive as I expected for a well known orthopedic brand, and although I have only worn them a few times, I have the impression that they will wear out quickly.

I was desperate since I was heading on a week long trip to Yosemite including miles of hiking. I wear a 9.5 regular women's shoe and ordered Men's 8 D. They fit beautifully and made the hiking doable. In fact, after a week of hiking and wearing these shoes, along with Plantar Fasciitis Compression Foot Sleeve MD (Set of 2) Pain Reducing Sock, I am experiencing the first consistent foot pain relief I've had in over a year! I'm a HUGE fan of these shoes!",

They also feel and appear to be made well but, since we've only had them a few weeks I can't rate how they'll last. However, we walk 2 miles 3-4 days a week and so far so good.",
