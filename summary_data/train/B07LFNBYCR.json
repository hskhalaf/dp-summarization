      "text": "I absolutely LOVE this Mickey Mouse luggage set! Such a great price for 4 pieces and the details and color is adorable. My 8 yr old son is so excited to pack his things in his new suitcase for our trip to WDW. However, I am knocking off one star from this rating because the rope straps on the drawstring bag were somewhat torn and frayed and on top of that they are way too thick and oversized for the bag. But everything else was awesome!",

      "text": "While the price was great on this package group, I struggled to really find a way to use all the items included. The backpack was almost the same size as the suitcase! and the other smaller items seemed to lack purpose for our family's needs. I was looking for a most stable, stronger designed suitcase for the grandson, something he could grow with for 5-7 years, this just seemed too young and not in that field. The quality was good, but the design was the part that did not fit with what I was looking for.",

The suitcase has wheels which makes it easy for my 7 year old to be in charge of it (she loves rolling it around!). There is also a backpack, duffle bag, and a sling bag. The sling bag would be great to keep bathing suits when going to the beach/pool. The backpack can carry snacks and go-to items when out and about on your trip. The great thing about this set is the backpack, duffle bag, and sling bag all fit nicely into the rolling suitcase for easier storage in-between trips.",

The rolling luggage is kid sized, but actually very roomy and has pockets for smaller items and accessories. The duffle, gym sack, and backpack are all nice and very useful. The Mickey motif is cute because it isnt a totally juvenile Mickey print. An adult could easily use the print as a Mickey fan. This set will get a lot of use here for vacations, day trips and overnight stays with relatives. Happy with it and with the variety of sizes of bags.",

All the zippers, pockets and pouches work great. No loose seams or threads and it is very well made. This set of luggage may seem to be for kids but adults can use them too. Really cute Mickey Mouse head on the fabric and I especially like this because it can be for a little kid or for an older kid. A nice unisex luggage that has more room than you think. Really a very nice set of luggage for kids. Very pleased with the set and so are my grandsons!",

The carry-on is a great size, plenty of room and keeps everything they need for their trip. The retractable handle is smooth, as are the rollers. The little backpack fits perfectly and the other small bags work perfectly for on the go activities. In love with the subtle Mickey Mouse design, the girls are head of heels for this set. Would highly recommend to anyone. Would make such a cute gift!",

Easy to wipe free of dust with a damp cloth. The spinner wheels move freely and are tough. The zippers worked smoothly and secure well. They have sufficient space and good tie downs to keep clothes from getting jostled about. The handles are a good design that are comfortable to grip and pull.",

The design great- clearly Mickey but without being ridiculously flashy and colorful. These work well for adults too!",
