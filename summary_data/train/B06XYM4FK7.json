Top quality zippered case with soft cloth bag to prevent scratches. Oh, and then there is the actual product. Fabulous, aviator style, lightweight frames and clear, distortion-free lenses. I am a pilot. Most sunglasses marketed to pilots are $150-250 and more. These are every bit as good with polarized UV blocking lenses. A deal at $58. A steal at $17!!!!",

I'm very appreciative, and will buy them again.",

They're comfortable to wear, not too loose, not too tight, never need to push them up the bridge of my nose (I forget I'm wearing them half the time). Plus they're very well made and only half the price of comparable shades! They even come with a nice hard case, a cloth case, and a cloth wipe, all of great quality. In the four pairs I've owned, I haven't had a single complaint with these sunglasses. I highly recommend LUENX!",

His are in perfect condition.",

I bought the green lens, but now I'm debating between the mirrored or the yellow-gold lens. Thanks, LUENX!!!",
