      "text": "Used this while competing in a Spartan Ultrabeast. The pack is relatively comfortable. I did use tape to secure all of the loose straps. The chest straps don't stay centered well, require constant adjusting to reduce judder when running. This item is very similar in style, color, etc to a Camelbak pack....but at a fraction of the cost. The only real kinda negative is the depth of the front pockets. When i drop my phone into the front zipper pockets, its tough to fish it out. Overall though, for the price, i don't regret the buy and am happy with the purchase. For reference, I've owned this pack for more than 6 months.",

If I didnt have water bottles in the front, I might not have noticed as soon, but the extra weight bounced around a bit. I contacted to ask if it was possible to replace the strap, and I was offered a whole new pack :) Cant beat that! Thanks again Lanzon Direct and Lucille!",
