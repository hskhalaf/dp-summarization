There is a nice longish cord with an easy to turn on button to show the constellations at night. This globe is nicer than i expected...so much so that i ordered a second one. I am very pleased with the globes. sincerely, L R V.",

I was looking for such a globe, according to which the child will easily understand the information. The size and graphic style was important in this case. And this globe fits to my requirements. A wonderful addition is the night mode (works from the socket), when you turn on the backlight. I had no problems with packaging or quality of the product, everything works fine. My son was delighted when he saw his gift and with pleasure began to study our planet. So seems I made a right choice.",

I got a fantastic mini lesson from my favorite little kid on the sun that while not all together accurate was charming and a great base for further learning.
