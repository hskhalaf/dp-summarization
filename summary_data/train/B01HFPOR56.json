      "text": "Excellent all around cross-training shoe. Has a little heel drop, but doesn\u2019t feel as pitched forward as a normal runner. Does not have much squish to it, making it better than average for weight lifting. Fits slightly narrow in mid foot/toe box, but not so much that you need to order a size up, unless you are already on the borderline of wide sizes. Length is as expected for a size 11. Tongue is sewn in without padding, which I actually like, it turns out. Easier to lace evenly. Good color (slate blue). Other than these, I also wear the Reebok ROS Workout TR, which is better for weight lifting, but not as good for cardio.",

I bought these because I'm getting into working out (mostly strength training) at a gym but didn't want to drop 100$ or more on shoes for something i might not stick with. Overall they work great and have the right attributes for strength training shoes. The trainers at the gym checked them out and i got a confident thumbs up for the shoes. At this price they're a great choice for entry level gym goers.",

If these where weight lifting shoes and not \"cross trainers\" I would not be as suprised but cross training involves more then just lifting. I do not recommend.",
