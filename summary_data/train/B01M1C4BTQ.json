I noticed the review about the odor which had me worried though when I got my package there was no noticeable scent from the pads at it had me expect. Definitely going to be buying more in the future. The only bad thing was the size, they're a bit small, though not by much and my dogs are also small so it's not too much of an issue.",

They seem to contain or neutralize odors fairly well, and absorb pretty well. Urine takes a little while to dry and absorb though. I have only been using them about a day, so I this may change - but overall, I'd say they're pretty good! Especially if the price stays right ($16.99 for 100 is really not bad).",
