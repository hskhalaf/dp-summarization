There's a handle on the back and another hold on the bottom that lets me lift and pour the thing relatively easy for how big it is.

This makes for a great hinge but also make the final pour very difficult. Size is great, lids are air tight, they sit and stack well, and keep my pellets nice and dry!",

      "text": "Great container for my puppy's food. Seems to be pretty air-tight as he never sniffs at it when the lid is closed. I open the lid to scoop out his food and it easily fits his 20lb natures domain puppy food bag. The first container that I received didn't close properly so I issued a return and was sent a replacement which arrived in 2 days so very happy with customer service! Highly recommend.",

      "text": "Great Pet Food Container but I use it to transport rattlesnakes into the wild. The narrow and high walls make it difficult for them to jump just right out again. I drilled air holes into the lid that snaps nice and tight on. The hight also makes it hard for them to try to escape by pushing the lid. So far non did if I got it in the container in the first place. To dump them out is easy and safe too by opening just half of the lid. Very useful and much cheaper on Amazon than in the local petstore. Probably buy another one.",

It's also nice to have a really good idea of when the hound is going to run out of chow so you can prevent that crisis (it's all about life's little victories!).",
