We use it with a 1-quart cast iron dutch oven, which is perfect for two people and can be seen in the picture below where the tripod is in full-glory. The dutch oven in the picture is this and does NOT come with the tripod: Legs can get VERY hot while in use, but use a stick or your pot lid lifter to remove the tripod from the fire when finished and it cools quickly. We highly recommend this item!",

Also, I put some grill mats and had some pre-cooked pizza at about 6K ft altitude. Everything came out delicious. Make sure to position it correctly (see youtube videos) before adding the chains. Tip: I placed the cast iron on the fire to warm it up before adding food to it.",

It does not allow you to really adjust the high you dutch oven is over the fire as the legs are to short. 2). It can be a little unstable which is a bit unnerving when pulling hot beef stew off the fire. I'm sure over a campfire that is on the ground this is not an issue. But if you have to go around a fire ring with any height, you will be using the S hook at it's highest level and still be.to close and hot. Hope this is helpful.",

Unfortunately, it's all false advertising, and in a very blatant sense. It's 43 inches tall, not heavy duty (very flimsy), and would never come close to fitting a large Dutch oven. The most you could do with this would be to melt butter, and even then, you'd better have a tiny fire. It pretty much epitomizes capitalism; cheap and laden with broken promises. Anyone seriously planning on cooking over a fire would be far, far better served getting something much taller and sturdier.",
