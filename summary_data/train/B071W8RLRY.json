Also, this waist trainer is comfortable and I had to wear it 24/7 for 6 weeks and then 12/7 for another 12 weeks. Sleeping in it was fine but sometimes too hot so I would shed it if it became to hot",

I wear the trainer all day long every day because I use it to help with a small belly button hernia, so I wish it didn\u2019t bulge so badly.",

I contacted the company directly, instead of going through Amazon and they were kind enough to send out a new shaper in the correct size at no cost. Very impressive customer service! I'm very VERY satisfied! I'll make sure to update when my GF tries the new shaper. :)",

It has 3 rows of clasps and a zipper closure. I suggest not going by your clothing size and actually measuring your waist which is an inch above your belly button. I ordered a size too small and they mailed me a new one. This waist trainer is perfect if your trying to get back into your original size after having a baby.",
