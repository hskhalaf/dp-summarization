I have mixed feeling about the light up birdies. They are a great concept but they flash, as in they don't stay lit continuously. This makes it hard to see in the dark. Also, I have used them in daylight and they switch on while playing. So far, I like the rackets but I would prefer the birdies stayed on continuously.",
