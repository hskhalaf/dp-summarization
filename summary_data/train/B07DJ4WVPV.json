The skirt is very full and more elegant than the little girl in the picture appears. The shimmer factor is high and it's very well made. I'm used to toddler costumes where they wear them once and they fall apart. This is on par, if not higher quality, than buying from The Disney Store.",

There is still a little room to grow in the bodice, and the skirt hangs about 2 - 3 inches from the floor. The top tulle layer of this dress is a bit longer than the inside layer and could be easily cut if needed for shorter children. Highly recommend.",

The pin-on butterflies could be nicer in my opinion and I told her parents to watch that the pins with which the butterflies attach to the dress are all closed properly so that she won\u2019t get pricked.

Shoes are a little big for her size 10 feet, but it gives her growing room. Have not used the butterflies that came with it.",
