      "text": "This is my 84 year old mom's 3rd Timex Marathon and her last. Each generation has lasted less and less time. They band does not take a licking, but the watch keeps on ticking. This one lasted 7 months before the band broke. The prior ones lasted for 2 years, then 1 year, now 7 months. The watch parts are great. But the band is trash. Of course the band is pretty specific to the model and a new band is more than a new watch. If my 84 year old mom can wear it out in 7 months - during covid quarantine, I can't imagine it would last an active person long at all.",

She had a bit of a difficult time setting the minutes (not very intuitive to figure out) but we Googled a manual and she was able to figure it out. Size is good for her small wrist. She likes the silicon band. Displays everything she needs.",

Display is clear in daylight and the indiglo night light is bright enough without being offensively so. Setting the time and date took me a few minutes and a google search but wasn't complicated.

We've never tried to actually scrub it clean, though, so I don't know how well it would clean up.",

So download the user guide and set everything the way you want it before using the watch! Other than that seems decent enough. Certainly suits my purpose and seems like a solid watch. If my kids wore watches I would consider this one.",

Timex warranty policy requires the owner to pay to ship the watch to them, plus $7 to cover the cost of repair and 'shipping' (which costs no more than $4), which means I'm paying around $11 to repair a $15 watch. So it's NOT a 'free repair' within a year. Buyer beware - the Timex 'warranty' means you pay 75% of a new watch cost to get your used one back!",
