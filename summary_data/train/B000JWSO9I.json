I was sad to find these so late in the teething game- it would have saved me a lot of wasted money on inferior products.

The nipple area is larger than a pacifier, so he can't really use it as such. the nipple is very flexible and soft. Great quality.",

So I'm not quite sure if this is going to do its purpose but it does look really cute which is why I gave it a good rating. Looks exactly like a raspberry but for how it's advertised I feel it should taste like a raspberry and it does not so don't expect that. I didn't expect it but I was wondering if it was going to or not. Lol.",

Now he's hooked on it. Def get when you see your child starting the teething process.",

We would freeze water into it so she could get the cold and the bumps. Only problem with that is water would leak out of it. The lack of a star isn't because of our using it off instructions. The handle isn't on there extremely well and you would have to be careful that it doesn't get ripped off if your kid is into biting and pulling.",
