They are a bit hard to get off after you put them on but I guess that's not a bad thing - if they're hard for an adult to get off, a toddler has no chance - which is a good thing!

I close the door because otherwise he is nonstop all over the house and man he tires me up lol so he started to learn how to open the door and I figured I needed this. It\u2019s probably one of the easiest to open/close/use baby proof thing in the house and still my little one can\u2019t get it. Love it!",

To take off, the best thing I have found is line up the cover so the line is horizontal across the knob facing you and then apply a little pressure down to make them pop off. So far my kids haven't figured this out yet.",
