      "text": "I initially gave 4 stars since they are a bit pricy for me, thought it is very comfortable. But after wearing them for over a month, I have to raise it to 5 stars. :) There seems to be an air-inflated insole beneath the soft fluffy insole on the surface, which makes it very comfortable. I didn't expect the soft feeling to last very long since the fluffy hair usually would be pressed to flat and then lost the softness in the very beginning. But this air insole do just the trick and make them still soft after one month pressing. Very impressive by the quality.",

Even though they were a half size larger, one foot still touched the toe, but on the other foot, his heel kept slipping out of the shoe. Also, even though I ordered a wide size, they were still too narrow for his feet. We returned these slippers and ended up finding some really nice slippers at the mall that fit much better and were half the price.",

These slippers helped him so much through his healing. Thank you for making such a large size for a large problem.",

I can wear them throughout the day with no sweatiness or sore feet -- it's got some arch support, thank goodness.",
