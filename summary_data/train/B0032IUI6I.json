After realizing this I cancelled the return process. I am happy with this purchase.",

The plug that attaches the head to the rest of the unit is melted, as well as the plastic covering the knob. The entire wiring system is shot. I'm lucky this didn't catch fire and burn the place down. I have another one of these units that I'll keep an eye on in case the same thing happens. Will never purchase heat lamps from this company again.",

At first I was not sure if the timer and the power were connected but I found that the la,p will not get hot unless you also set the timer. Overall, for the price, I am happy with this because it looks pretty good, is not too bulky and feels great once heated.",
