It really needs a bottom opening to be able to get everything that oozes out under it clean, OR a better design that allows venting out the back of the machine rather than around the waffle. To clean this item requires a full disassembly. I decided that it was not worth it, and this item is going in the garbage. I consider it money paid for a lesson learned. Unless you love taking things apart and reassembling, I would not suggest you purchase this item. If you like to tinker, however, this is the product for you!",

It made the sandwiches fine but cleanup is not as advertised. The cheese ran off the side of the plate and into the inside of the unit. I had to take the unit apart ( it is not sealed like my old one). We then tried to make waffles. It made great waffles but we had some mix that ran down inside again. I've spent more time cleaning than I have eating. Trashed it and went to Walmart and bought another brand that works.",

They don't hold a lot of heat to help keep temperature steady when you pour cold batter on them. Low stars because of impossibility of cleanup. The removable plates leave lots of gaps for waffle batter to drip into. It's not possible to completely clean this without removing several screws that weren't intended to be removed. You have to take it completely apart exposing interior wiring to remove chunks of batter that dripped inside, then cooked there from the reflected heat inside.",

I personally don't like gadgets when I have a perfectly good stove but I now prefer using this. I've made fluffy omelets, over easy-hard scramble eggs, and tons of sandwiches. This is way easier to just plug in, throw everything on and let it cook without flipping it and the cheese always melts in the middle without burning the outside. It's really cut down on my cleaning time since me fiance\u0301 doesn't have to get out 2-3 pans to make breakfast/lunch. I really recommend this thing for the younger cooks and the messy cooks.",
