This is a great summer Balaclava but it in no way will it work for COVID-19. Sure if you want to wear something for the sake of wearing something it works. If you want to use it for COVID-19 it is a fail. You will need wear it backwards so you can double the hood section up to cover your mouth. That works but doing so is a bit uncomfortable. A neck gaiter folded in half works better and is a lot more comfortable.",

Instead I said I had common sense enough to wear appropriate clothing when out in the cold. He then walked off in a cloud of shivering, self-imposed ignorance and I rode my bike home...very warm and comfortable thank you!",

Yes, you can get cheap Balaclavas at a store for $5-$6, but without fail, they tear, lose elasticity, and fall apart after a couple months due to the garbage quality of their materials. No such issue with a product like this. You pay $10 more for the product to last 10x as long. Well worth it to me, I would buy it again.",

I wear mine under another hat but I have also worn alone. It is easy to adjust to fit anyones head. I strongly recommend buying if you live in a cold windy area. Or if you enjoy winter sports. It is a great price for such a nice head mask.",

I would highly recommend this product especially at this price point you can't beat it. 100% satisfied. Jim from Chicago.",

I'm just thankful to hear the end of the complaining about his painful nose from the cold",

After a while of skiing, though, the cold air was starting to get through and when I was going down the mountain, I could feel the cold wind. Overall it worked very well and I am very pleased with the product.",

If there was a way to have something a bit thicker or possibly quick drying around the nose/mouth area....would improve the quality of this against the elements.
