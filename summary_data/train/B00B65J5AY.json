Unfortunately as soon as I connected my phone to the system via auxiliary cord there was a loud high pitched sound that came out of the speakers consistantly. I then connected my music via bluetooth and lost about 30% of the volume....even worse the speakers and tweeters emitted crackling and popping noises while playing my music. Save your money and spend it on something else that is of higher quality. I have owned a boss atv audio system before and loved it....lasted about 5 years. I think Boss needs to reasses the quality of their products.",

The second flaw is the right side speaker has failed to work. It has been blown out, for an unknown reason. There is no sound except from the bass that flows throughout the tube from the other side. Although could be from too much water in the past 2 1/2 months since I have purchased this product. Otherwise, this product performs excellent!",

Nice rich sound for a cheaper option, clear highs and mids, with nice base, I feel like it could be louder, it is louder than my Polaris 850 V-Twin, it may be just right for some, I like it loud! The unit I received did not come with all the hardware, and is obviously a used unit, nothing I can't deal with. The plugin doesn't work, but the Bluetooth does, which is fine I don't want to use the plug anyway. I feel like I got a decent deal, would've liked the mounting hardware, but like I said nothing I can't work around.",
