Ported ones always have bloomy mid-bass for the BIG BOOM effect, but this sealed compact 12\" subwoofer (yes it's both compact and 12\") is much more controlled and has much more noticeable sub-bass. My previous $120 subwoofers cannot deliver the sub-bass, and of course not the clarity of this one. You haven't heard sub-bass until you've tried a subwoofer like this one.",

I use this in a 30x20 room in my basement and it is more than adequate to push base through the entire room if needed. Can't recommend this sub enough. Anyone saying this sub is not loud or lacks base obviously do not have their DSP set up correctly - there are only a few of those reviews but wanted to reiterate that this sub is VERY powerful.",

Overall, I love this subwoofer and I would recommend it to a friend or family member. The problem in my set up is the midrange speakers in the center channel. I have Orb Audio MOD2s as left, center, and right channel speakers. This subwoofer does NOT mate well with these Orb Audio speakers. There's not enough midrange frequency output. It's not the fault of this SVS subwoofer, so I give it a clear 5 stars. RECOMMENDED!!!",

The sound is solid, tight and more than powerful enough for the rather small room I have my system in. The volume can be turned up quite loud without sounding \"Booming\". I think some of this is due to the fact that the sub is not ported. This affects the resonance at higher volumes, but it has enough power to overcome the lack of a port.",

      "text": "I bought this subwoofer for it's size and power. As most home system woofers get pretty bulky from 12\" on up this one is an exception. The box is as small as you're gonna get on a 12\" and it sounds great. I keep it a little past half way and it adds the perfect amount of bass for my music listening and movie watching. I'd recommend it to anyone trying to add a sleek woofer to their living room set up.",

I can only that this is by far the best subwoofer I have heard. It works beautifully with both movies and music. It does better with music so if you are like me that listens to music all the time then this is the one. I replaced a Boston Acoustics subwoofer which still worked well but this SVS outperforms it in every which way.",

It's a better value than most of the alternatives as long as you ignore reliability and repairs, but next go around I'm going to stick with a manufacturer that responds to inquiries for defective products.",
