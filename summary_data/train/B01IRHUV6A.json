Again, it's a hangar not a metal pole, so it should crack. Maybe that can be something the manufacturers think of next when modifying the hangars design.

They make the closet look 10x better than any plastic hangers I've ever had and are a fraction of the price I've seen at stores (Target Joy Hangers are $9 for a 10 pack).

Would definitely recommend!",
