It's small enough to conceal behind a dash or glovebox and can easily be controlled with a separate level control. If you're using this as a primary amp, you may need more power, but as a smaller component amp for highs or midrange, it's perfect...",

The stereo on it's own was lacking in power, and my stock speakers were blown. I installed this amp (BOSS Riot - R3002) in my truck to push power to a pair of Boss Elite 6.5\" speakers and a pair of Boss Elite 5 3/4\" speakers. I'm pleased with the combination - it sounds so much better than before. The amp speaker combination can stand on it's own. Later, I will be adding the Boss Riot 1200 watt amp ( R6002) with a pair of Boss Phantom 10\" subwoofers in a custom box, for more bass in my setup.",

I used this to help boost the sound from a cheap Dual head unit and it works great. Make sure you run your RCA cables AWAY FROM ANY POWER WIRES, and use the best insulated cables you can find. Cheap out on your cables or improperly route them and you're gonna have a bad time. Buy this amp to boost your stock radio or a cheap head unit!",
