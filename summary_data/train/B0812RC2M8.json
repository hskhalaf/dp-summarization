The pad has magnets throughout so that the camera is protected and the angles can be changed based on what you're doing. I can lean this in my lap, on my desk, or even while cooking without issues. The charging port, on/off button, and sound buttons are easily accessible.",

It is easy to accidentally open the camera cover while in reality you are trying to adjust volume up-down buttons. This product is priced at premium and as such falls short of the expectations. One good thing is raised lip across the screen edges and definitely this will protect iPad in event of accidental fall. Cutouts are good, accurate. I am worried about small plastic clip but only time will tell how long it will last. Not the best from speck.",

The rest of the case features are classic Speck excellence, so if you can put up with the camera cover, it's worth the purchase.",
