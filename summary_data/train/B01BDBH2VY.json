These Fuel Optics are by far better goggles, the vision is superb, they don't fog and the magnetic lens is an excellent idea. I highly recommend them. I liked them so much that I bough another pair for my grandson. The only suggestion I have for the manufacturer is to add a quick release buckle on the strap so that you can remove them quickly, especially when you have a GoPro camera attached to the ski helmet..",

The goggles have a wide range of vision and NEVER fogged on me. I would highly recommend these goggles to the beginner as well as the advanced skiier / snowboarder.",

Light weight, comfortable but the most amazing thing is how clear they are and the glare reduction. Bright and sunny here in Vermont today with fresh snow from the recent big storm so glare is pretty high, but put these goggles on and it just disappears and everything is so much clearer. Both my wife and son tried them on and the same reaction, \"WOW, that's amazing.\" Will give them a good test tomorrow on a mountain hike so will follow up on this review.",

Checked some reviews and bought the Fuel Optics. Price was right. The goggles were fantastic. I wore them for 1 day of blizzard conditions and 1 day of sunny conditions. I was very impressed. Worked great in both conditions. I did have some very slight foggy going up the lift, but I was huffing and puffing after some serious skiing. Never completely fogged up and always were clear by the time we reached the top. These goggles should last me the next 30 years.",

The lens is optically correct and has no distortion. I really dig the gold tint as well. Unfortunately, just after I bought these, they were stolen...by my wife. So I happily ordered a second pair for myself. Don't waste your money on expensive goggles just for the name recognition. These are legit and totally worth it. Amazing value/quality.",

They only fogged up on me once because i took a beginner snowboarder class and most of the class was standing around and some gliding with the board. So they fogged up cause there was no air flowing through the goggles. Once i hit greens and blues there was no fogging at all cause there was air flowing through them. I\u2019ll use them again on my next trip. Also there is a thin plastic film inside the goggles. Pull that off. I didnt see it and had to pull it off while on the mountain.",

I'm a female with a pretty average sized face (or at least I like to think so) and I thought they were slightly too big on my face, but they ended up working just fine. They were great for the conditions I was in- there was mostly sunny skies so the lenses were great. They did tend to fog up a bit on the inside, but after I put them up on my helmet while I was on the lift to air out, the fog was gone and I didn't see much more fog the rest of the time.",
