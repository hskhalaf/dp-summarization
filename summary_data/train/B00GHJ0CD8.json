My husband usually wears a large in sweaters but after reading reviews about how large this sweater runs I bought him the medium for an ugly sweater day at work. It fit him very well. Noticed on the package it says Medium fits chest size 38-40, Large fits a 42-44, and a X-large fits a 46-48. So when going by this size chart the Medium should be his size because he does wear a 40 in a jacket.",
