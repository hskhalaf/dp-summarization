It is what it is. However, I do not like the digital zoom mechanism at all, because you can never figure out beforehand how the actual zoom pictures will turn out. But its a camera that doesn't cost 10 bills either, so if something breaks, and can't be repaired (not my experience at all), a replacement would be cheap enough!",

Well, the S1000 is even better - the zoom is phenomenall - the details and the colors - when compared side by side with my 3800 are even better. I shopped for best price and free shipping but of course always end up at Amazon.com for the best deal. I am still on a learning curve as it is quite different from the 3800 but the manual that came with it is fairly easy to read. I highly recommend this model and Fuji!",

When I've played around manually with the shutter speed and f-stop (as well as trying the natural light setting) I haven't had that great of results.

(The Owner's Manual is on a CD.)Consequently I've returned the camera for refund.",

    "description": "Fuji Finepix S1000FD Digital Camera\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Perfect for advanced amateur photographers who want an affordable, step-up digital camera, the 10-megapixel FinePix S1000fd builds on the legacy of the FinePix S700 with the addition of a Fujinon 12x optical zoom lens (33mm-396mm equivalent) for greater range and flexibility, Fujifilm\u2019s proprietary Face Detection Technology with Automatic Red Eye Removal, and a brand new Panoramic Shooting mode. \n\nFinepix S1000fd Highlights \n\nFace Detection with Automatic Red Eye Removal Face Detection operates by identifying and prioritizing up to 6 faces in a framed scene, and then adjusting the focus and exposure accordingly to ensure the sharpness and clarity of human subjects in the picture, regardless of background. After a shot is captured each detected face is instantly checked for red eye; if it is found, it is corrected automatically, saving the time-consuming process of fixing it later. \n\n\n\n1) Face in sharp focus, 2) Optimized brightness \n\nPanorama Shooting mode For catching beautiful scenery or very large groups, the new Panorama Shooting mode makes it easy to create impressive panoramic photos. This mode captures and combines a maximum of three consecutive shots at 3 megapixel resolution each, which are saved to the memory card as a panoramic picture. The new Panorama Shooting Mode makes it easy to create impressive panoramic photos \n\n2.7-inch, high-resolution LCD Rounding out the FinePix S1000fd\u2019s powerful feature set is a large, 2.7-inch high-resolution (230k pixel) LCD plus electronic viewfinder (EVF) and ISO levels of up to ISO 1600 at full resolution and ISO 3200 at 3-megapixel resolution. \n\nPicture Stabilization mode in action Picture Stabilization mode A selectable mode, Picture Stabilization uses the heightened sensitivity of the FinePix S1000fd and high-speed shutter settings to reduce blur caused by hand-shake or subject movement. It allows the camera to automatically choose the correct light sensitivity and optimal shutter speed to produce clear, blur-free images. \n\nFull manual photographic control Photo enthusiasts and advanced photographers have total control with manual adjustment options for various camera settings including resolution, ISO, aperture, shutter speed and more. \n\n5x zoom vs. 12x zoom 12x optical zoom FinePix S1000fd's 12x optical zoom lens expands your shooting reach, covering a remarkable focal range of 33-396mm*, bringing you close enough to capture subtle expressions. And the single built-in lens means you're always ready to shoot, with no need for bulky extra lenses or time-consuming lens changes. \n\nHigh-speed shooting Capture the action with the High Speed Shooting mode: 7.5 fps at 2MP for 15 shots; 3.3 fps at 5MP for 6 shots; and 1.4 fps at 10MP for 3 shots. \n\nMovie recording VGA quality at 30 frames per second with sound. \n\n14 Pre-programmed Scene Modes The FinePix S1000fd features 14 pre-programmed scene modes that offer a one-touch setting for almost any situation, including: Portrait, Landscape, Sport, Night, Fireworks, Sunset, Snow, Beach, Museum, Party, Flower, Text. \n\nxD/SD/SDHC-compatible slot The FinePix S1000fd features an xD/SD-compatible slot, which accepts not only Fujifilm\u2019s traditional xD-Picture Cards but also Secure Digital (SD) and SD-High Capacity/SDHC cards too. \n\nOperates on 4 AA batteries The ultimate in convenience and accessibility, using AA batteries means that, in a pinch, more batteries are just moments away.",
