I made replacement wheels (see photo) which added a little weight, not much, and really worked better. They are metal Garage Door Rollers strapped to the rake with screw clamps. The other flaw is the extension handle connections which are hard to separate to put the rake away, the only solutions to this that I can see would add too much weight.",

This gave my arms and shoulders enough rest to start again. Else my arms, hands and shoulders were getting very tired with the continuous movement.",

The roller has a slit in it meant to slide over the bottom edge of the rake and into a cutout area of the body. After sliding on, the roller is meant to turn. One of mine turns, the other doesn't its jammed. Either the hole in the roller is too small or the metal between the cutout and the edge of the rake is too large. When I use the rake this wheel constantly falls off, and I'm sure at some point it'll be lost in the snow 'till spring. Not happy.....",

Very awkward if all extensions are used, we found that it worked better if we left one extension pole off. We lose some reach but it was hard to use with all the extensions connected. Other than that, it pulled the snow off the roof. It will fill the gutters with snow but that cannot be prevented since you are pulling the snow across the gutters (unless you somehow cover them).",

So now I'm left with the option of disassembling and returning or disassembling and enlarging that space for the unit to properly function. As for the snow clearing ability, I can speak to that yet though I'm not sure this is the device for the job.",

      "text": "2-9-17 Used it for the first time. Removed about 8 inches of snow, about 6 feet up the roof. I like the light weight and the length even though I didn't use all the extensions. I think because of the light weight I will have to be gentle with it when using it. The poles feel like they could bend easily if I whip it when moving it to another section of roof. I would recommend this product because of the light weight and easy to maneuver from section to section with the caution of taking your time.",

Only used one winter but seems to be sturdy and looks like it will last a while with normal use. (Also attached window squeege to long handle to reach very high windows. )",
