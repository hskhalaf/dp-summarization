I purposely waited a reasonable length of time before submitting a review to assess function and durability after being exposed to the elements (mild California climate). Within 90 days the finish had begun to peel and visible corrosion appeared. Even with use of a quality lubricant the moving parts move either erradicately or lock up altogether. The old adage \"you get what you pay for\" comes to mind, but in this case it's more like \"if it looks too good (or priced) to be true, it probably is\". Either way the end result was very disappointing. Do not recommend for use outdoors.",

Its a super delicate piece and could have easily broken during shipping. I emailed the company and they sent a new one out right away, free of charge.
