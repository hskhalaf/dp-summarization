All in all, this thing is an alarm clock with an enormous display compared to others that is very bright and colorful. It doubles as a picture frame/mp3 player.

Other than that, for $50, it has all the features I needed (alarm, clock, radio, picture frame), and I read you can play movies with it too.",

The entire 7\" screen emits light far greater than the typical LCD display. It is obnoxious how bright it keeps the bedroom.

But then, at the price I paid for it, $ 89.99, it's about what one should expect. The only critique I have is the user interface. There are far too many buttons and mutations how to use them. It is hard to understand why Philips did not take advantage of the graphic display and use a context-driven/graphics-guided user interface. The additional hardware cost would have been zero. With that, I would have given the product a full five stars (reflecting the attractive price).",

Unfortunately I'm still using my old alarm clock and I don't know what to do with this product! It really was a BAD purchase... And there are some details that make the product even worse: it plays mp3 files, but you can't use them as the alarm sound! Who projected this device????",

I was surprised and disappointed they went so far with a great design and then dropped the ball on something so simple.",

For those of us that have bought it, we should all email Philips and demand a software upgrade (note if you go to their product support website, there is an upgrade for an old bug, but not a general upgrade for deficiencies in design).",

This electronic frame can only hold 3 photo's at best, otherwise a dedicated photo chip or memory stick is required, more cost. Also this electronic frame when connected to Mac OS10.04 was not recognized and could not load pictures directly to frame, only by memory stick and a limit of three pics. You had to delete the existing three pre-loaded on the frame and then replace. The frame controls where not very efficient. The whole process was frustrating and I boxed the product for return the same day received.",

    "description": "Start the day right with the Philips AJL308 Clock Radio, where you can wake up to the 7-inch color showing off your favorite photo, song, or video. In addition to clock, radio and calendar functions, you can even use pre-loaded relaxation music that will help you fall asleep. Built-in USB and SD card slots let you store all of your photos, music and video clips. You can enjoy music or radio channels with FM digital auto tuning and presets. Set dual alarm times and wake up gently with the increasing alarm volume.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer \n\nWAKE UP TO YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEO\nOffering the ultimate in flexibility, the Philips AJL308 Clock Radio awakens you to your choice of nature sounds, radio, your own music or a traditional alarm buzzer. You can also display your favorite photo as the background image on the 7-inch color LCD screen, watch photo slideshows set to music and view video clips. Start your day off right by waking up to a treasured photo, your favorite tune or the sounds of nature. It's perfect for the bedside, but also fits attractively on your office desk. No matter what your alarm clock needs, the Philips AJL308 Clock Radio has it all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWake to your own music, radio, an alarm buzzer or even sounds from nature START THE DAY YOUR WAY\nWake Up How You Want \n\nStart your day right by waking up how you want. The Philips AJL308 Clock Radio lets you choose your wake up call. \n\nHate being jolted awake? Normal alarm sounds with a preset volume are either too low to wake you up or are so uncomfortably loud that you are awakened abruptly. The Gentle Wake feature starts with a subtle, low alarm that gradually increases to a reasonably high level in order to gently rouse you from sleep. You can use the Gentle Wake feature with your own music, FM radio or the buzzer alarm and make rude awakenings a thing of the past. \n\nDo you prefer to wake up to music or news? Digital FM radio offers you additional audio options with the ability to store up to 20 different radio stations. Simply tune into the station that you want to preset and press and hold the preset button--that's all it takes. You can quickly access your favorite radio station without having to manually tune in each time. \n\nThe AJL308 comes with an SD/MMC memory card slot so you can play your own music through the clock radio speakers. All you need to do to play MP3 or WAV files is insert an SD/MMC card with your music on it into the slot on the AJL308. The Music menu appears and you're off and running. \n\nDual Alarm Time \n\nThe AJL308 has two alarm settings available. Set one alarm time to wake you up and the other to wake up your partner. \n\nPre-loaded Relaxation Music Lets You Fall Asleep Peacefully \n\nRelax or fall asleep to peaceful sounds. The AJL308 is pre-loaded with a number of relaxation music pieces. Choose from rain showers, ocean waves, spa music and more, and enjoy in relaxed comfort. \nEasily read date, time and radio information \nand view photos and video \n\n7-inch Display for Time, Date and Radio Info Viewing \n\nThe Philips AJL308 Clock Radio has a large 7-inch viewing area to enable easy readability of the content on the screen, even from a distance. It is ideal for the elderly or the visually restricted. You can also display your favorite photo as the background image. \n\nWake Up to Photos of Your Loved Ones \n\nThe AJL308 comes with an easy-to-use feature that allows you to display your favorite photo as the clock\u2019s background image. When you wake up in the morning, you see not only the time, but the photo of your family, friends, pets, vacation memories--whatever you want--by your bedside. It's a nice way to start a new day. \n\nEnjoy Digital Music or Broadcast Radio While Viewing Photos \n\nEnjoy viewing your photos while listening to your favorite digital music or FM radio station. Simply select \"Photo with music\" from the menu, then sit back and enjoy them both at the same time. The AJL308 comes with USB and SD/MMC memory card slots so you can play your favorite MP3 and WMA music files through the clock radio and view your favorite digital images on the LCD at the same time. \n\nView Special Photos in Slideshows by Your Bedside \n\nStore your favorite photos on an SD/MMC card and play them in slideshows on your AJL308 Clock Radio. Thanks to complete file transferability, you can easily enjoy the convenience and fun of showing digital photos or video clips via the SD/MMC card slot. Just insert your memory card into the appropriate slot on your clock radio, set the display options (sequence, effects and transitions) and view your own personal slideshow on your clock radio\u2019s screen. Now you can relive your favorite moments with family and friends any time you want. \n\nDeep Stereo Sound \n\nEquipped with a Bass Reflex Speaker System, the AJL308 delivers a deep bass experience from a compact loudspeaker box system for an enhanced listening experience that blows away the average clock radio.",
