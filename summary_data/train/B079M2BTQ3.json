If they are not going to sell something like they show in the photo, So then, do not mislead people, don't give false information about a product If it is not as they describe it...

We moved to a city that doesn't provide large trash cans to throw regular kitchen bags into after filling so we're back to the huge heavy duty black bags (practically lawn/leaf bags). Anyway, this can is tall enough to hold the black bags perfectly but without taking up a lot of space. It is VERY tall so be aware of the measurements. The top of the can (sold separately but totally worth it) is great too because it closes itself after throwing trash in. This is would make a great garage/outdoor can as well. I highly recommend this product!",
