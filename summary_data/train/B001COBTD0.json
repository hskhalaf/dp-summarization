The simple latch mechanism for holding the knobs has been around for a long time. I did not expect the quality of a $100 lock to be so poor that the things are falling off. Update 10/1/2018: I landed up buying the door handle version of the same lock (instead of knobs.)  The handle comes pre-attached and has not fallen off yet.",
