Very large sounds like that drumbeat on the GOT theme seem to overwhelm the amp and results in annoying jarring dropouts.

We have a Samsung TV and home theater Blueray player so are able to use Samsung's AnyConnect feature to send the audio from the player back to the TV, then using the TV's settings direct the sound to 'External Speakers' which is where the Sennheiser base unit connects via its digital optical cable.",

Unit has no Digital COAX input which on many devices is the only type of digital output available. My Bluray player was like that. I solved that by ordering this: Digital Coaxial to Optical Converter, Bi-Directional Coax Digital Audio Converter.

Pros: -Nice sleek design. -Buttons easily accessible on the headset. -Comfortable Cons: -uses AAA batteries( and even I don't think this is a huge issue) -can only charge one headset at a time unless you buy another receiver. -Max of two headsets per receiver.

My only complaint is I purchased another pair so two of us could watch the same movie late a night without waking the rest of the family. However, the second pair simply will not stay synced with the source material. No problem with the first set paired. Support, video tutorials, troubleshooting articles could not solve the issue.",

The range would be fine for watching TV, but I was hoping they would work well for walking around the house listening to music. I have a fairly small house all on one level, and when I get too far from the base, the sound starts to break up.",
