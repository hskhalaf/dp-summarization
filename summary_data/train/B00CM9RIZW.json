Only downsides for me; As many others have said the feed chute is quite small so be prepared to pre slice items and exhibit a bit of patience. This type of juicer does not like mushy fruits and veggies. If your apple/cucumber etc. is anything less than crisp and ripe it will create mush in the cylinder that you hopefully have enough firm fruits and veggies to help clear. Great juices can be made and it handles leafy greens and wheatgrass like a CHAMP. Overall a great Juicer.",

I love how quiet it is because I can still juice while my youngest naps. Customer service is also amazing. It's a great way to introduce vegetables to a picky eater's palate. My juice is almost entirely veggies, but for my kids I make a juice blend from 8 carrots, 2 green apples, half a lemon, and some ginger and it's very well received. I plan on eventually adding cucumber, then spinach or kale once I feel like they will be willing to drink it. :)",

I highly recommend this juicer, I honestly couldn't be more pleased.",

I used to avoid juicing bc i dreaded the tedious cleanup but this machine really makes it simple. The only screen to scrub is quite small and the stiff brush tool that comes with it makes it easy. The juice stays fresh longer than with the high speed juicers too. So glad i switched from the centrifugal breville juicer to this slow juicer!",

The pulp of cucumbers, apples, pineapples,etc. never go through the screen and end cap to be deposited in the pulp container. Two weeks ago, I called Omega customer service and the only solution that I was given was 'wash the screen in the dishwasher and leave the end cap at the most open position', recommendations that obviously didn't add any improvement on the juicer behavior. If the J8007 cannot juice apples, pineapples or cucumbers Omega/Amazon should prior warn customers. Please buy a juicer which could be used for juicing.",

Extract greens acceptably (I mean, an ordinary juice maker would never extract anything from kale).Extremely pleased with the product. Nothing has been broken, not a single accessory. However, due almost everything is plastic, it somewhat decolored and the clear plastics are cloudy. Doesn't seem clean anymore (and I do wash it every single time after each use).

This makes very good quality juice, with one of the easiest clean-ups i have seen. However the produce has to be chopped up incredibly small, and it is very time-consuming to make the actual juice. It doesn't pull the produce down the chute like a Greenstar for example. The pulp however is incredibly dry, and the juice very pure. Get a Vertical wide-mouth juicer if you want to save more time with chopping, otherwise this is a great juicer especially at this price range",

I hemmed, hawed and waited about 6 months before pulling the trigger on the J8007S. Now that I have it? I should have gotten it much earlier. Trust your gut on this one.

I have juiced wheatgrass, sunflower sprouts, broccoli, celery, cucumbers, grapes, apples and strawberries. Some of the pulp does have a bit of juice left in it but for the price, I feel it does a good job and would purchase again.",

      "text": "I make about 4 days worth of juice with this at a time, between 7-8 cups. Takes maybe an hour from start to finish, cleaning/washing the veggies, cutting, assembling the juicer, juicing then clean-up. Not bad to get some super healthy drink for half a week. Gets a lot of juice out of everything, and came with an adjustable dial on one of the components for how much pressure it squeezes with. It will leak maybe a teaspoon onto the counter if you either put too much fibrous stuff through it or put the dial to max, but under normal conditions doesn't leak at all.",

It's very straightforward to use and creates very little mess compared with other juicers (centrifugal type) I've tried. The noise level is decent, and it's not difficult to clean and maintain. I was a bit unsure about spending this much on a juicer, but the performance and features have proven to be well worth the price. Highly recommend this be on your short list if you're looking for a capable, but simple to use slow juicer.",

No juicer does everything perfectly, but I've been using it almost every day for 2 months and overall am very happy with it. There are a lot of parts to wash so that must be accounted for in how much time it will take to do the juicing.",

Only complaint is it's a bit loud and you have to put small pieces in, instead of big chunks, so it takes a bit of time to get the amount you want.",

This one is so much quieter not so good with softer fruits best to juice a harder fruit or veggie and go back and forth between the softer fruits! Also if you are juicing celery I try to save till the end because the stringy part of celery gets all twisted up on the end! You need to cut of the produce a little smaller too because the tube is smaller than my other juicer but there is so much more that I want to use it for I haven't tried fruit sorbets yet or nut butters or nut milks!",

The Omega Juicer extracts a significant amount more liquid and the pulp is incredibly dry in comparison. It is quiet and so easy to clean. So glad I invested into a better juicer. I have yet to experiment with the other attachments that you can make with it, but they are all a bonus to me since I mainly wanted it for vegetable juices. I would recommend this product.",

Still worth it though and great customer service! Again, this juicier is fabulous!!!!",
