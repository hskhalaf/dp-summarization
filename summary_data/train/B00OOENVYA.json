Every time I turn it on or off, or try to attach the USB charging cable, it moves slightly. If this light came with a rigid clamp type mount, it would get 5 stars from me. The little tail light is also nice, but has the same problem (for me).",

The only downside of this product is that the front light button lights up bright blue when the light is on. If you're riding in pitch black, this blue light is bright enough to be distracting. I placed a layer of black duct tape over it to fix the issue. I'd buy it again nonetheless.",

Excellent value for money (I've spent twice as much on headlights that only last 20mins on full). Came beautifully packaged for transport, and arrived safely. Bonus rear light is small but bright and I've added it to my rear flashing light collection. I would definitely recommend this item as a commuter light given it's excellent battery life.",

I knew this before buying, so I ain't mad at it, but it leaves a bit to be desired. I prefer a bracket that clamps to the frame that the light can clip in/out of. The lights work great though! At least for the first day. They're doing exactly what I need them to do - help avoid collisions with cars. Let's hope they hold up a while.",

If you're riding on a path you will annoy other riders and walkers if you have this pointed at eye level. This isn't a complaint (it's super easy to adjust the angle on the fly with rubber connecting strap), it's just another way of saying that this light will get people's attention. You could spend much much more on a light for commuting if you like, but you don't need to. I've only had the light for about 6 weeks, I'll update if there's any problem with longevity.",
