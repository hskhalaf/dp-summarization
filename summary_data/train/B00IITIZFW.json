He's been using it ever since and hasn't had any more issues with dry skin in his beard. Also, I love the smell of it :)",

I keep the bottle in my shower and use it about every other day. Not quite one pump is plenty to create lather and wash the beard. The company checked in with me (via e-mail) to ensure I was happy with the product. Highly recommend this beard wash!",

    "title": "Medicine Man's Itchy Beard Wash 4,7 FL OZ",
    "description": "Medicine Man's Anti-Itch Beard Wash 4.7 fl oz is an earthy, healing, 100% natural and organic, beard shampoo crafted by OneDTQ Beard Care, Brooklyn, New York. Great beard washes, beard shampoos and beard soaps are designed to remove sebum and dead skin, cleanse and soften the beard, promote healthy beard growth, and condition and moisturize the beard. The very best of these products, like all of OneDTQ products, are all natural and organic with no chemicals, fillers or gums. It is well known that chemicals should be avoided because they can cause serious health problems with prolonged use. Fillers and gums should be avoided in beard care products since they block pores and inhibit hair growth. \n\nMedicine Man\u2019s Anti-itch Beard Wash was created with all of this in mind and with old world natural healing knowledge to help guys with itchy beards in two different ways. The first is to help you get through the early itchy stages of growing a beard. The second is to help those with chronic beard itch, beard dandruff or redness of facial skin beneath the beard. Either way, this oil rich beard wash will help keep whiskers free from itchiness and dandruff and the skin free of irritation and red patches. It will energize the skin under the facial hair and clear the path for your beard to grow. \n\nBPA FREE\n\nPARABEN FREE\n\nSULFATE FREE\n\nTRICLOSAN FREE\n\nMedicine Man\u2019s Anti-Itch Beard Wash is an original formula developed in our Brooklyn workshop, the ingredients carefully selected and balanced to deliver a great smelling, lavender and rosemary infused, natural anti-itch solution for your facial hair. The smell is earthy and soothing and this beard wash lathers up big and white. One or two pumps of this beard wash is enough to create a big lather for almost any length beard. Medicine Man\u2019s Anti-itch Beard Wash contains no animal products and was not tested on animals.",
