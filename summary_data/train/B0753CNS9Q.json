Pretty hardware, ample space for my use: to take my phone, cards, cash, comb, mirror, and lipstick with me when I don't want to take a full-sized purse. (My phone is a Galaxy S7 Edge, but there's room for a much larger phone.) There's room if I want to fit in other items. The adjustable strap is long enough to carry as a crossbody; also comes with a separate wrist strap.",

I made it as long as it would go and bridged it with the wrist strap. I ended up adding a long loop of ribbon to it so it would be long enough. 2) The cheap plastic hooks have both broken. I will make up some type of solution. For the record, I find cheap parts annoying.",
