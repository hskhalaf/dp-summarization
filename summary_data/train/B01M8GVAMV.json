I use it for spatulas, large mixing spoons, hand-held strainers, etc., anything that has a hole in the handle. This gets rid of the drawers full of undefined messes. It allows me to quickly find the utensil I need. Oddly enough, loaded up it looks really attractive. I had two pots that were constantly in the way. The small shelf on top was just the perfect depth for these tall, slim pasta pots. This rack is a real problem solver. I can highly recommend this rack.",

After a conversation with the company this item was replaced. Their immediate attention to the issue and positive attitude was very refreshing. They stood behind their product, and replaced the defective item. There was no additional charges to me for shipping and handling either. I am impressed with the prompt response and service.

Overall, however, the unit seems to be a good one and will save us some space in our kitchen.",

Would definately recommend this product to everyone, a must have for anyone who loves their kitchen organized. It goes great with my new Rachael Ray pan set also. LOVE IT! LOVE IT!
