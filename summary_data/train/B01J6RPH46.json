We got two of these Fire tablets for a fraction of a full price cheapest Apple tablet. If your whole life is intrinsically linked together in every way via Apple then you probably won\u2019t like these, but we like them for that very opposite reason! Very user friendly and very pleased with them and highly recommend.",

I've matched this one up with an old Perixx bluetooth keyboard (which just so happens to match the width) plus a cheap Syntaks cover and so far, I have used the set-up like a laptop with a touchscreen (see photo)- I can't seem to do without the physical keyboard (it's not brilliant using the on-screen one, particularly in landscape). The ONLY issue I have is the restrictive operating system, but there are well-documented ways around this, so no big deal, especially at the Black Friday price. No regrets so far and I've pretty much stopped using my Windows 10 laptop which is quite frankly a pain!",

However yesterday at about 8 weeks old it decides to start rebooting every minute or two. Support suggested a factory reset (so bye bye data) which I eventually managed to make happen today when the reboots slackened off to every 5 min and so didn't cancel the reset. That seemed to cure it, well for a short time, it is now dead as doornail! Shut itself down while on about half charge refuses to turn back on either stand alone or plugged in. Not what I expect from a tablet less than 2 months old.",

Accessing and searching the Internet takes ages. You pretty much need to shut down and restart the device each time you pick it up to release enough RAM to be able to do anything with it. It does have a nice screen, but what's the point if the device runs like a three-legged tortoise? Frustrating, to say the least.",

      "text": "Have used my iPad mini daily for over 4 years and although it\u2019s still great, the battery life was becoming terrible. So treated myself to a Kindle Fire 10 HD and so far I\u2019m delighted with it - obviously a much improved battery seeing as it\u2019s brand new - but a really speedy & responsive performance. I only tend to use tablets for streaming, so have installed Netflix, Prime Video, Sky Go & iPlayer and apart from shopping & reading I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ll use it for much more but the picture/sound quality is great. For what I want it for, it\u2019s absolutely ideal and at a really good price.",

Battery runs low quicker than advertised but I could be running something in the background that I don\u2019t know about as yet.
