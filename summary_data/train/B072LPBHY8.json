We took the bird off, though, and she loves to dance around to the music it plays (I am seriously tired of that music!!). The rest of it packed away easily in a bag (after a good cleaning) waiting for the next grandchild. Hopefully the bird survives as well.",

It's colorful, there are hanging toys and things for a baby to occupy himself with, you can change the positions of the toys, change the music... seems quite practical to me. Seems like it should be easy to clean, too. Little more expensive than other baby gyms, but it also has more functions than cheaper ones. So, overall, it' seems like a good deal.",

It comes with toys but you can easily change them out or add more. It plays music/sounds when the baby moves the toys or arches. It is also set up for tummy time so you can hook toys on for that and it has a crunchy leaf attached. In our opinion it's the best baby item we've had so far.",
