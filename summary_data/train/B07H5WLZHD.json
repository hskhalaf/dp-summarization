      "text": "These pills are very effective. They will suppress your appetite, almost to a fault. They have a warning on the side to begin taking one capsule until your tolerance increases. I have experience with Hydroxycut's products so I knew what to expect and was able to begin with the suggested dosage. Their effectiveness for me actually made me have to remember when to eat! These pills also decreased my desire (ability?) to eat so be careful. Very effective & I'd recommend them to someone trying to lose weight. **Side Note** - Another side effect was a significant increase in libido! Have fun!",
