Cons: The sound is not as good as the dynamic surround sound of the PS Gold, and there is no chat volume control like on the PS Gold = if your friends Mic volume is low, you will not be able to hear them very well without asking them to adjust their Mic volume.",

The speakers are really good. So far, I've been playing firestorm (Battle Royale) on Battlefield 5 with these headphones. So far, I played 5 games and won every game. These headphones are built for battle royale. Thanks turtle beach, for making these headphones. You always succeed in satisfying me.",

The cord is plastic rather than more flexible nylon and the jack would be better if it were a 90 degree jack rather than a straight jack.",

When I go to use them, I try to be as careful as possible because I feel like they're going to break with the slightest wrong movement. Other than that, sound quality is not that bad for the price again. As for the comfortability of the headset is concerned if you have a big head, it might feel a little awkward because it seems like there made for kids up to maybe older teens. I hope that helps anyone when it comes to making a decision to purchase the headsets.",

These plug directly into, and are powered by, the xbox-one controller, so your batteries will run dry slightly faster. I would like a little more low-end in the sound quality, but i can be rather picky with that sort of thing. Over-all, the sound it great for gaming. For the price, i think youd be hard pressed to find anything better.",

From what I have gathered from my friends and online reviews, Turtle Beach has nice high-end products but it was a mistake to buy their low-end headphones. I will sadly have to buy another set of headphones, from a different company, as these are no longer functioning anywhere near sufficiency.",
