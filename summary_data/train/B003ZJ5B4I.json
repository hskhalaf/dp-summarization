That later happened to the 8 as well, and now the thing seems to have given up entirely, not responding to any keystrokes. Add driver software updates that started requiring you to log into websites to configure the keyboard (seriously, I just want to type, not sign up for your free toaster) and I\u2019m of the opinion that another make of keyboard would probably serve me best.",

I have yet to have any issues with this, except that sometimes I have to reset the macros because they disappear. All the keys work, and none are pressing on other ones like some other reviews that I've read about it. I would recommend this keyboard to anyone. 5/5 stars EDIT: 7/5/15 Nearly 3 years later and keyboard still working like a charm! My only issue is that Razer software seems to be a pain sometimes. But other than that, the keyboard itself is perfect!",

It also lights up a very pretty (almost royal) blue. It's withstood tons of hours of gaming so far and is still in perfect shape.

Function keys work without hassle or pop up user interfaces (volume, playback, etc.) Lighted keys a plus for those who occasionally work in the dark. Space bar is nicely balanced so that pressing it to the far sides do not cause the key to fail. Cons: As expected, louder than your traditional membrane based keyboard. Made me feel awkward using in the presence of others at first, but I am getting used to it. Bottom line: Great usable mechanical keyboard at an affordable price compared to other mechanical keyboards on the market.",

Unless you've memorized the location of functions such as #,@, $, >, ?, and so on, you will have a hard time typing them with this keyboard because they are painted in dark gray on a black key. In good light conditions you may manage, but if you are mostly using the keyboard in dim or dark conditions, it's a royal pain. And since this lit keyboard would seem to be made for dark typing conditions, it makes the design flaw that much more mystifying.",

I have several keys that grow dimmer when used and 2 keys (T and L) that have never back lit at all.

The only concern I would have is that the USB cable is a tad short, but it makes up for it in thickness. The keyboard is mechanical, and I love to hear the click every time I press a key down. The keyboard also has macro keys which you can set to do lots of actions with a program you download off razer's website.",

The backlighting is quite nice and the keys really do feel great. I had put the review at 3 stars, but have upped it to 4 after experiencing Razer's no-nonsense prompt support. Also, do not use this keyboard with a KVM. You may experience anything from dropped keypresses to repeats, to the device itself not registering on switch.",

The photo is of a DIFFERENT KEYBOARD than what is delivered. They are charging full price for 2014 edition refurbs, and trying to bill them as brand new 2010 Ultimates.\n\nThe 2010 Razer BlackWidow Ultimate had German-made Cherry MX blues.\nWhen I got this one in the mail, I could immediately tell that this was NOT a 2010 version (as I was attempting to replace my old one) as soon as I tried the keys. I popped a keycap off, and saw that they were \"Razer Green\" switches: AKA Chinese knockoffs.\n\nThe typeface of the keycaps is also the 2014 version, not the 2010 version (you can tell by the ampersand).\n\nEven worse, when I plugged it in the back-light was harsh electric blue; NOT the cyan/light blue of a 2010 version. What the seller did was took a 2014 edition and replaced the green lighting with blue, and it looks awful.\n\nThe cover of the keyboard was also the matte finish of the 2014 versions, instead of the glossy of the 2010 (and there were a couple scratches when I took it out of the packaging to boot).\n\nIn summary, the seller is simply taking old 2014 versions, refurbishing them, and trying to sell them as the old 2010 versions which used a far superior key switch, and even worse is trying to charge full price for them!Read more 7 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse poison5.0 out of 5 stars I have been very happy with the keyboard after using it for over a ...Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2016Verified Purchase I purchased this computer to use on my desktop computer. I have been very happy with the keyboard after using it for over a year. I love the feel of the mechanical keys as I am typing. I think the feedback is outstanding and comfortable when typing as opposed to some of the newer keyboards and laptops. Even though it takes more pressure on the keys, I believe that the feel and feedback actually improves my typing speed. The keyboard is black with a very sleek finish that looks very nice on my desk. I also really like the backlit keys. The Razer software allows you to customize some shortcuts/combos and map them to the five additional keys on the left side of the keyboard. Additionally, this unit has a USB input and audio/microphone inputs that run through the main cable to the back of the computer. Overall, this is a great keyboard for gaming or casual use. It is nice looking, easy to use, and easy to install. Definitely recommend.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Torrence Meister3.0 out of 5 stars Quality uncertainReviewed in the United States on April 14, 2019Verified Purchase I\u2019ve now had two of this keyboard. First one did well until some mischief with a beverage. It\u2019s replacement developed a bounce issue with the backslash early on, one press would generate normally 2-4 \\ keystrokes. That later happened to the 8 as well, and now the thing seems to have given up entirely, not responding to any keystrokes. Add driver software updates that started requiring you to log into websites to configure the keyboard (seriously, I just want to type, not sign up for your free toaster) and I\u2019m of the opinion that another make of keyboard would probably serve me best.Read more Helpful Comment Report abuse Live to read4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent and Impressive!Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2011Verified Purchase Let me begin by saying there is a truly fantastic and extensive review of this keyboard on the overclockerz website. I am in full agreement with every statement in that review and recommend it to anyone trying to decide whether to buy one of these keyboards.\n\nOn to my personal experiences now... I'm old enough to have begun on Alps mechanical keyboards, and hadn't realized how much I missed the tactile feedback they provide! I am a fan of this keyboard.\n\nPros:\n- Build quality is outstanding, far superior to many Razer products. This is a heavy, solid product. The phrase \"built like a tank\" comes to mind.\n- Tactile (and audible) feedback is also outstanding. They may initially take some getting used to if this is your first mechanical keyboard, but it felt like \"coming home\" to me. As another reviewer has commented, the (modified) Cherry Blue keys are ideal for normal typing. I also find them perfectly well suited to gaming, although I can only speak to World of Warcraft. I would like to see how Blues compare with (more expensive) Browns, but that is only based on theory. These keys work fine, and I really like them.\n- The key contours and angles fit my hands perfectly and are very comfortable. Each key has been deliberately positioned, and I found the fit excellent. I prefer an ergonomic keyboard, but have no complaints about this straight board.\n- Backlighting: As far as I know the Black Widow Ultimate is the only mechanical keyboard offering this feature. It's certainly the only one at this price point. The adjustable brightness levels should let anyone find a setting they like. The ability to use an individual light under each mechanical key (instead of the more diffuse lighting method used with a membrane keyboard) really improves the appearance over every lighted board I've owned in the past.\n- Five additional \"macro\" keys on the left add useful functionality. Because the keyboard can be programmed with profiles that trigger depending what application is active, I can use these for gaming when playing games, and for the common \"office favorite\" functions found on many keyboards when I'm not playing. I have them set to open a Web browser, my e-mail client, a text editor, etc.\n- The typical media control functions seen on many gaming keyboards are available using some \"F\" keys with an alternate function key (similar to a laptop keyboard). This helps keep an uncluttered appearance.\n\nCons:\n- Ports are on the right side of the keyboard, which interferes with my cabled mouse. I don't know why Razer didn't locate them along the side facing away from the operator, as they have done with other keyboards? I have given up using the USB extension for now, (and see next item).\n- The headphone extension cables are braided together so closely that they only reach back panel ports on the tower. Since these ports are filled by speaker plugs on my system, I still have to plug my headphones directly into the front panel ports on the tower. I have therefore given up using the headphone extensions as well. Depending on your configuration, this may not be a problem, of course.\n- No N-key rollover. If you're not hard-core enough to know about or want this function, you won't miss it, although I feel a keyboard billed as \"Ultimate\" and \"gaming\" should have included it.\n- No wrist rest. This is a thick board, and I did not find it comfortable to type on until I purchased a third-party solution at the local office supply store.\n\nSubjective aspects, aka \"your mileage may vary.\"\n- Appearance is visually interesting, and as a touch typist I have found no issue with the non-standard font on the typefaces.\n- Yes, the shiny surfaces attract dust and fingerprints. However: The same microfiber cloth I use to clean the monitor wipes off the keyboard just as well. Problem solved for me. Incidentally, hang on to the transparent plastic cover it was packed with and use it for a dust/impact shield when not typing.\n- Software is not provided in the package and must be downloaded from the Razer website. Personally I think getting the latest drivers this way is better than loading potentially obsolete drivers from a pre-packaged CD. In my case it turned out that at least one download (drivers or firmware, don't recall) had been updated just one day before my board was delivered!\n- Another reviewer pointed out that the \"F\" keys are offset a bit to the right of their normal locations. Even though I am a touch typist, I found I adjusted quickly.\n\nIn summary: Although perhaps not the \"Ultimate\" gaming keyboard possible, and even though there is room for improvement in some of the feature it provides (at least in my opinion), this is an terrific keyboard that I highly recommend. It perfectly does everything I need it to, plus adds a number of very nice to have features, and looks good while doing so. It is a great addition to the rest of my blue-lit gaming rig, and I could find no equivalent at this price point.\n\nPerhaps the ultimate endorsement is that my spouse informed me within two days of its arrival that I had to buy another for her. She had never used a mechanical keyboard before, but became an instant convert!Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States TOP INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS \nPhilip3.0 out of 5 stars Nice keyboard - but has some issuesReviewed in Canada on November 28, 2012Verified Purchase I upgraded to the BlackWidow Ultimate from a Saitek Cyborg V5. The BlackWidow is dramatically better. It has the same typing area, but takes much less space on the desk.\n\nThe glossy black with blue looks very nice and matches well with my DeathAdder. You can also vary the intensity of the backlighting from within Synapse. The default is extremely bright, so I toned it down to match my preferences. This is a very nice option to have.\n\nThe integration with Razer's Synapse software is also very nice. When first plugging the BlackWidow into my computer, Synapse downloaded the drivers automatically, then updated the keyboard's firmware and popped up the customization menu.\n\nThe tactile sensation typing with the keys is amazing and a joy to work with. It works very well in gaming (mostly Guild Wars 2 for me) as well as for word processing.\n\nIt's still a bit flashy - so I'd probably go with something more subdued in my office at work.\n\nUPDATE: After a couple weeks of use there's a few minor problems that have crept up. The keyboard sometimes detects the Windows key as pressed when it's not - which can be startling when you type \"L\" in a document and get bounced to the unlock screen. Tapping the Windows key a few times fixes the bug. Likewise, sometimes in the password field at the unlock screen the keyboard will send a constant stream of text - unplugging and plugging it back in fixes the issue.\n\nBoth these issues are fairly minor, but I expected more from a premium product.Read more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

The mechanical keys have a fantastic feel and almost everyone I know who used it can type faster on it. The back lighting is awesome for using in a low light situation and looks beautiful. The braided cable is rugged and durable as well the gold connections are a nice touch. I don't relay use the microphone and headphone jacks but the are well build and function very well and the weight of this keyboard keeps me from moving it around accidentally. The only thing I would have changed is making the secondary functions as well as the function key backlit as well.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote. Please try again Report abuse Jean-Philippe5.0 out of 5 stars This is a great productReviewed in Canada on August 16, 2012Verified Purchase I wasn't sure if this keyboard really worth the price it costs. I really wanted a good mechanical keyboard and I was not sure if I should buy a DAS keyboard or a Razer keyboard. I read some bad review on the Razer keyboard concerning the assembly quality but the fact the it has more features than the DAS keyboard made me buy it. I end up to be really happy with my purchase. The key press feelling is great and it is more easy to type than my old g110. The USB, microphone, speaker ports work all great.\n\nI don't really agree with the bad reviews I read on that keyboard since it feels really durable and works flawlessly.Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote. Please try again Report abuse Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Grenier5.0 out of 5 stars Everything that I wanted!Reviewed in Canada on January 5, 2013Verified Purchase Everything about this keyboard is like advertised.\n\nThe three brightness level for the LED are suitable for every situation. The fourth option, pulsating, is not very useful, but a nice addition nevertheless.\n\nThe keys are responsive and emit the distinctive \"click\" that you would want from a mechanical keyboard.\n\nThe multimedia key are kind of lacking, me coming from a Logitech S 510, with only function keys to control volume and music(play/pause, stop, previous, next track).\n\nThe software that Razer \"forces\" you to install and use, Synapse 2.0, is not as bad as people make it to be. Again, coming from Logitech, I have no issue using Synapse instead of Setpoint and I find them very similar in use.\n\nThe only issue I would have (that doesn't deserve to take away a star) is the headphone, microphone and usb port placement. For a right-handed like me, the headphone jack is right where my hand should be when using the mouse and I would never plug a usb key in the slot because it would stick out and restrict my movement.\nFor me, its not a big deal, since my computer case have plenty of usb port and front side headphone port, but I can see this being a problem to some other buyer.Read more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

He was right! You can macro on the fly, which is perfect for Starcraft 2. The keys are very responsive and very slick. I love how there are 5 different light modes on it, changing them on the fly. Setting game profiles is really easy and switching between them without opening a program is perfect! I can go from WoW to SC2 to CS:S in seconds with the profile.\n\nIf your looking to buy a keyboard, i would recommend this one. I dont think i'll get another one until this one breaks which wont be for a long time. Razer is known for their quality products.Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.
