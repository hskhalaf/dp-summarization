I have an in office, widow air conditioner. Its noisy, but with the touch of a single button, 90% of the noise disappears. SOund and amplification is top-notch. Buttons are intuitive and can be operated with a simple touch. I can answer, and disconnect from my phone with a simple touch. It also talks to me. Lifting the microphone arm, tells me muted. Lowering it, says call connected, and it even gives a verbal readout of hours remaining on the battery. Impressive!!!!! Wish I'd found these years earlier.",

As soon as he put the headset down, I asked him how that was possible - and then immediately bought the Jabra Evolve 75 headset. You feel a bit like a telemarketer from 1988, but they are really effective at cancelling out background noise for calls. I've searched for something like this for years and am very pleased with them.",

I even tested at home by leaving a voicemail with my partner talking loudly about 3 feet from the microphone, and my voice was the only part that was picked up on the recording. Amazing!",

The only issue is that the battery runs down overnight, even when they had hours left on them and they were turned off, so best to always keep them plugged in. I woke up one morning to teach from them and they had no battery despite having only used them for a couple of hours the previous day and 12 hours left (so it said).",

The battery seems to drain quickly enough that a full battery charge does not last for the 8 hours per day I use it during work, so I tend to avoid using it too much although I want to. If you intend to use the headset for this long each day, you will need to charge it each day to avoid having to plug it in again during your work day.",

      "text": "I gave my wife my 65 and bought this one for myself. I need the boom mic due to work. The noise cancellation works great when I\u2019m actively listening to something, otherwise it does not cancel background noise. The Bluetooth range is much farther than the 65. My chief complaint is that my iPhone will not automatically default to the headset when connected.",

During the summer, I have my teenage girls and two Yorkshire Terriers making all kinds of noise. It was pretty embarrassing when I was on conference calls or web meetings as I constantly had to mute the barking dogs or loud teenagers. Once I got this headset, multiple colleagues asked if I had rented an office as they couldn't hear anything. Great product!",
