Now, the jar is not ideal since it requires that you dip your fingers into it. And, even clean fingers aren't perfect. So, a pump dispenser would be the absolute ideal for this product.

It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a greasy or tacky feel. I love how it leaves my skin feeling really soft and hydrated. It also has a very light, clean scent and doesn't linger around, which is nice. Overall, this is bomb! It feels great and works great for me. Highly recommended.",

It is a gel moisturizer that is thick in the container but goes on smoothly and gently onto the skin. It has a little tacky feeling when first applying, but that goes away as it is absorbed into the skin. Great absorption and gentle on skin. I really like how refreshing it makes my face feel. Can be applied any time of day for a quick boost of moisture.",

Only thing I dislike is the jar container. Wish it came with pump!",
