The sound quality etc. is completely sufficient but the biggest issue is the tuning pegs are only held in with friction and as such the instrument becomes out of tune very easily and is difficult to put back into tune. If I had realized this would be an ongoing issue I would have paid a couple of hundred dollars instead so that there would be some higher quality tuning pegs.",

The black paint looks great, it has some silvery specs on it to make it look like outerspace a little bit! And the case is amazing, albeit there is no where to place a shoulder rest if you have one.
