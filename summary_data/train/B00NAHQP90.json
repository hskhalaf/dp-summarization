As for ease of assembly, after some internet searching I found a PDF as no manual was included. The hex bolts used to tighten the rack are tedious as you must hold one side while tightening the other. So. 3/5. Good for the next while until I move and have more space for bigger and better.",

      "text": "Standing @ 5'10\" I knew that the rack was going to be on the short side but I couldn't fit a 'full' sized rack in the basement. Rack works and does what it is supposed to do and is quite sturdy. even w/o weights on the rear pegs to stabilize it has handled 280lbs well and without shifting during re-racking. My only 'complaint' is that the knurling looks like its for show and is quite smooth. Knurling seems to have been painted over and consequently filled in but it wasn't anything that a little athletic tape couldn't fix. =)",

Nice to have an impact wrench to put this together - took maybe 20 minutes. Be careful though: you can pinch the metal at the top of the uprights which prevents putting on the plastic end caps. Oops - oh well, whatever...",
