I keep an extra USB C cable lying around if I need some juice at work...etc, but it is rarely an issue. Other than that, the hardware and the functionality is great. I'm very happy with the (nearly) stock Android, and not the crap that Samsung, HTC, LG and others put on their phones. The hardware is great for me, very light weight, excellent screen, fast operating system.",

      "text": "My Moto Z is 9 months old and currently I get about 2 hours on a full charge. I can't be sure though, because the phone randomly shuts itself off and won't turn on until plugged in. The phone then shows 49%, 37%, etc., so the battery is never actually completely draining. I've tried all of Motorola's troubleshooting (battery conditioning, battery calibration, settings changes, operation in safe mode, and factory reset) with no success. Now, Motorola is denying my warranty claim because Amazon is not an authorized Motorola dealer and the device number is not on my invoice. It's a great phone, but the need to keep it plugged in makes it the world's smallest desktop.",

The phones Bluetooth constantly disconnects which ya know, you kinda need to listen to music or have an adapator piece. The screen will go black but audio is still playings, but you can't see anything until it's ready. Moto G4 was my previous phone before the Z and that phone had it's share of problems.

I like the convenience of the fingerprint authentication, which the Pure didn't have, and it seems be decently fast.

Don't buy this crap please, never. The last Motorola phone I buy, I'm very upset !!! U$ 500 in the trash !!",

The unlocked version currently ships with Android 6.0 on the July 2016 patch set. They have promised N but no dates given... and the phone is not Daydream compatible without it. The camera is mediocre at best, slow focus and awful portrait pics with essentially nothing in focus. Lenovo has clearly destroyed Moto with the purchase so I would stay away",

I contact Motorola in US and they told me Amazon sell me this phone from Hong Kong. The webpage said item was ship and sold by Amazon. Now I have a $500 beautiful paperweight thanks to Amazon. Just 10 months old. Great phone, but bad battery, bad service from motorola and Amazon. Very frustrating. Thanks for reading and hope you don't make my mistake. If you think your product is not from US start a return immediately or you will regret.",

Out of all the Motos I've tried, this one is the best. My only issue is not having a headphone jack but that's minor compared to how amazing this phone is. My favorite phone I've ever owned. Trumped the Samsung j7 I previously had.",
