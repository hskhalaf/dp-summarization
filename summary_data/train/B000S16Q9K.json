I took off the top to see if a bulb had gone out, and saw that that's just how the light box is made. There's a row of tiny led lights across the top that are oriented to face down the length of the box, but they're only strong enough to really light the top half. The Gagne Porta-trace I purchased, while not bright enough for what I wanted, at least had multiple rows of leds, creating an evenly lit surface. This is just useless. I will have to keep looking I guess.",

I can easily see what I'm doing, and it only cost me $40. What I'm not sure is how to replace the light once it runs out. I have had this for over a year, and it hasn't gone out yet.

Ive traveled with it with no problems as well even though its rather on the big side. It has served its purpose well.",
