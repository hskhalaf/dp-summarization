After I took him to have a surgery, I cleaned up and sprayed this all over. He came back a few days later from the shelter and vet, and didn't try to spray at all. I could smell the scent which is A LOT more pleasant than urine. I noticed some other cats spraying outside my front door and plants, and since I didn't know exactly where, I sprayed this all over, and haven't smelled urine outside since. I recommend! The ingredients seem to be efficient and safe for animals and people.",

We tried a couple of the other \"flavors\" that are supposed to block odor, but she still kept going on the floor about once every two or three days. Finally, we tried the strategy that now works: the special area gets wiped down and dried off, then utterly saturated with this (fantastic-smelling) spray every single day. On top of that, we're keeping the litter fresh and clean, every day. It's working! And the room smells like Christmas! \ud83d\udc3a",

Putting a piece of furniture over the spot and washing the floor with ammonia did the trick. Also, using only very hot water to wash the litter box - no smelly chemicals - brought my little lady back to her box.",
