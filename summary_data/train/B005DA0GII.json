I know this cause I tested it with my hot curling iron and it made a small dent in the plastic after holding it on there for a few seconds. I imagine if I left it in there for any length of time, I'd come back to find a fire hazard. I'm gonna maybe invest in a silicone wrap for it so it can be used the way I intended so I don't have hot hair tools hanging out on the counter when I'm done with them.",

I purchased another Polder Style Station with two large slots with the hopes my blow dryer will fit. I will keep you posted. F.Y.I.
