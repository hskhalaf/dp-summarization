This smaller unit doesn't take up much more space than a spaghetti-pot. If there were to be an improvement, it would be with the recipes. When you get a crockpot or other small appliances, you generally get a fair number of recipes designed for the machine. I was able to google quite a few though so expect to need that.",

The plastic isn't dishwasher safe, and I'm sure it won't hold up forever. The paddle touches the sides but I still scrape the sides down to help reduce stress on the paddle and gears.",
