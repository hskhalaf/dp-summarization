It gave a much much more coverage for my children. The shape of this umbrella works so well for strollers, as opposed to the round circular umbrella we had purchased last year. With the round umbrella, we had to buy TWO to cover each child since the diameter was so small. But this umbrella works beautifully. Don't hesitate to buy it. It's amazing.",

      "text": "Disappointed in product. When I opened to clamp to attach to the arm of my Adirondak, it came apart and a screw fell off--it wasn't meant to open that wide. When I put it together and was able to force it to fit, the umbrella weight made it leans towards the heaviest direction, so it didn't stand straight up. The quality of the umbrella is fine and would probably work well if clamped to stroller or golf cart like most people do, but not ideal for my needs--personal shade for my Adirondak chair.",

The opening to clip it to something is super small, it\u2019s probably 1 inch. So definitely not worth it. And the shade is really small too. It doesn\u2019t shade much sun",

But if you want to be able to move it around easily throughout the day, it is just incredibly difficult to use. You have to press down buttons on two different hinges and figure out which one goes the right way to accomplish the movement you want. I took it on vacation to the beach and regretted it. I prefer an umbrella with a totally flexible arm that you can just bend whichever way you want.",

I have little spatial skills so it takes me like 5 minutes of adjustment to actually be at the correct angle but once it's on I haven't had any issues with it coming off.",

But if it does fit, and unless there's a breeze, it provides effective protection from the sun. I especially like the shape and how it can be rotated to block rays coming from different angles during the day. However, It gets only 3 stars because the clamp components are plastic and there is more \"play\" in its grip than I like -- plus, I don't see how plastic threading can hold up under repeated use without stripping or distorting.",
