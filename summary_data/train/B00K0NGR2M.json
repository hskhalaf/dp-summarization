I found the complaints about the chain curious. The chain is durable. Most chains that small won't pull a truck anyway. It can be improved by simply replacing the cheap wire links at each end. They will pull open with a toy truck. Replace those for a buck. Use one like the one that holds thru the wallet eye. Then ad a carabiner to hook to your belt and done. Maybe 4 bucks at the most.",

I believe the high point of the wallet is the length. It fits completely in a standard back side pocket with nothing hanging out. Also, the craftsmanship is 100% and you will not be dissatisfied.

The chain's whole purpose is to not loose one's wallet in a theft/fall situation, but with its stock clasp, a simple yank and it's gone.) I can't speak for the longevity of the chain itself, only that it appears to be made of a decently strong metal. So, be prepared to replace clasp hook when arrives - also, product needed to air out for a day or two as it smelled of a chemical - maybe the dye?",
