But after printing I couldn't understand the problem until pulling up the paper details and looking at the small print. Very disappointed!!!!!",

      "text": "I'm in grad school working on a graphic design degree, and one of my professors recommended this paper. It is awesome. I haven't used it with a non-Epson printer, but even with my low-end model, it is bright, crisp, and vibrant. Generally, Epson printer + Epson paper = perfection, but this paper in particular is my favorite. And $20 for a 100-pack is a phenomenal price.",

Staples, however, is a lot less fussy and much easier to load into my old Canon MP560. Appreciate someone pointing out the non-archival fact, something else to consider.",

For that application this paper works very well as people are not anticipating museum quality prints on the cover but they do look quite nice. Much better and more personal than store-bought cards.",
