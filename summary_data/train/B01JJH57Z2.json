There is one major drawback. You cannot place it on a counter with a cabinet above it. The unit is so big it will hit the cabinet and can't be opened. If you are going to buy this, make sure you have an island or a large space with nothing above it. If this isn't an issue you won't regret buying this!",

I've long been looking for a waffle iron that makes deep restaurant-style waffles, and finally I've found it. Clean up is a snap, just wipe out with a a cloth once it has cooled down a bit. Be aware the this appliance is large and heavy, but that's the trade-off for the job it does. I couldn't be more pleased.",

The price is hard to swallow but the quality of construction, simple controls, well thought out design works really well for me. Granted, the size and weight will get you an initial stare from your spouse, but after eating crisp golden Belgium waffles, everything will be good. If you have a small kitchen/counter-top, you'll need to account for this. Cooking time is ~2 minutes at medium setting. We often have family dinner waffles every few weeks, and this unit can churn them out fast.",
