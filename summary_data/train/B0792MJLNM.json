The need for dual memory cards and lots of post rendering make it less \"consumer friendly\" but pros will likely not blink. Great battery life and even the nice hard case and handle that come wih it make the GoPro Fusion a class act that's a steal at current selling prices.",

You have to download \u201cfusion studio\u201d which is a barley stable program. Crashes 1/3 of the time you use it. Anyway you have to render the two files together with that program and depending on your computer, can take forever. The fusion is a great camera though. Awesome quality video, easy to use as any GoPro is. Water resistant and what not. Just can\u2019t pop off quick edits, basically need a day to get the footage into an editable form.
