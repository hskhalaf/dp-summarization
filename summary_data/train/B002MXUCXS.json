The hinge holds well and doesn't have any play in it or flaws. I was worried that a folding ramp might snap under the weight of the hundreds of pounds my bike is. Was perfect. Would recommend for dirtbikes and even heavier ones like cruisers. May need one that holds more weight if you have something like a Street glide or Road King. Check the weight before attempting. The packaging was wrapped well and not sloppy. Great product.",

Heavy-duty serrated cross bars provide excellent traction in any weather condition, and the tapered bottom edge making the loading process as safe and smooth as possible. This ramp is held in place by a set of rubber-coated fingers that grip the tailgate without scratching and an included adjustable safety strap.\n\nWe recommend always working with at least two people when using single-runner ramps for loading.
