Bit the bullet and went to the audiologist at Sam's Club who did a more through exam. Paid 3.4k (1.7k each). Have worn them for two weeks with good results. ) Recommend that everyone see a Doctor and 2 audiologist's to prevent being ripped off.",

The only weakness I've noticed is that the ear pieces tend to disintegrate rather quickly; but the unit did come with replacement units. I haven't checked the price for new ones, yet. Also, the $4K units can be controlled from the phone, with ranges in bass and treble....these units don't have that. Follow up; 2 years, and a box of batteries later, I contacted customer service about needing new soft ear pieces; they said they'd send them no cost. Customer service makes me bump this up to a 5 star rating!",

Another thing to note was that, LifeEar was gracious enough to extend our 30 days trial into 60 days because we could only test it after the 30th day from purchase. This customer service alone is worthy of the 5-star review. Thanks LifeEar!",

I hope the device does not need frequent, expensive repairs like the other brand I have been using.
