My only concern is that I possibly should have gone for the 4D. But this is definitely working out great for me. Thanks Turbo.",

      "FOR HELPFUL, BLISSFUL PAIN RELIEF - Whether you\u2019re fighting lower back pain, aching knees, or arthritic joints, stepping on The Turbo vibration plate will give you immediate and noticeable relief. Much like rubbing a bumped shin or shaking an injured finger, the exercise machine stimulates your nerves, blocking out pain, relieving built-up tension and soothing your joints as your brain focuses on motion, not pain.",
      "ALLEVIATE CHRONIC PAIN:- If you live with chronic pain, most likely you\u2019ve learned to bury it beneath a regular regimen of painkillers. But what if you could fix the underlying issue? The Turbo delivers efficient and gentle Whole Body Vibration (WBV), to help relieve chronic pain, heal old damage, and accelerate recovery from acute injuries.",
      "REGAIN STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY & RANGE OF MOTION: Regain muscle tone, strengthen bone density, boost your metabolism and more with the LifePro Turbo. Gentle, therapeutic vibrations wake up muscles throughout your body, improving circulation and triggering myofascial release. This, in turn, enhances your body\u2019s built-in ability to regenerate cells and repair itself - increasing motion, flexibility and comfort from the very first session.",
      "DOUBLE THE MOTORS, TRIPLE THE MOTION: An upgraded version of our standard Waver model, we built our Turbo with 2 robust motors for a 3D range of motion, specifically to provide even greater pain relief with its pulsating motion. Depending on the pain you\u2019re experiencing, or your recovery goals, you can choose to use 1, 2 or both in tandem.",
      "LIFETIME GUARANTEE & GUIDANCE: When you purchase one of our whole body vibration machine it comes with a complete system of support, including built-in LIVE support from our \u2018guiding angels\u2019 and free access to a comprehensive library of training videos and tools. Additionally, every platform bearing our name undergoes rigorous scrutiny to make sure it delivers on power and efficacy and a built-in lifetime warranty so you\u2019re never left hanging."
