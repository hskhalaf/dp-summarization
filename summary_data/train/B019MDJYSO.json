Most men won\u2019t touch them because they are \u201cpink girly tools\u201d This is a GREAT gift for any woman who likes doing projects herself!",

The tools were all in their place (except for a couple of the knife blades that came out of their container...not a biggie). Good variety of all tools, and decent quality too. No, not made for heavy duty work perhaps, but good for around-the-house things my wife enjoys doing. It's definitely a \"girly\" looking set. I'd even use them if I needed to. Now, she can have her own special set to keep in a drawer in the kitchen. Good set...good price.",
