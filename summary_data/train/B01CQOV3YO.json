Ita adorable and THE MAIN REASON I am make such a hasty review....I recall many of the reviews I read stating that your device did not affect the volume so I was really disappointed in the output of this speaker.... UNTIL I decided to turn up the volume on my iphone 6. WHOAAAA! Amazing sound. I was able to wander around 40 feet before loosing bluetooth coverage. So far I am very pleased. If there are issues down the road I will update but just wanted to inform reviewers about the volume info",

First off, the packaging it comes with is very nice and it comes with a micro USB charging cable, an AUX cord, and a waterproof protective sleeve for the speaker! As for the sound quality, beyond superb. The built-in sub-woofer gives amazing bass for how much and how big the speaker is. The battery life is very long and it doesn't take too long to charge. Another thing I really like about this speaker is the fact that the volume control is touch-controlled rather than just buttons. Overall, amazing bluetooth speaker for the price and if anyone is reading this right now, BUY IT!!!",

There was instruction in the manual that if it won't turn off, to use the reset button, so this is apparently a known issue. Unfortunately it didn't fix the issue.

      "text": "For $27, this speaker offers great value. The quality of the speaker honestly surprised me - fit, finish, and feel suggest a much higher price point. The only weak point is the sound quality, which is good but not great. Music can sound a bit flat if you are looking for a solely auditory experience. However, for a speaker that you can take anywhere and casually listen to, it hits the mark. High points include: - bluetooth connectivity, which has been very robust for me - speaker phone functionality, which has had very good sound quality on both ends - good battery life - versatility with SD card and bluetooth",

They stated that it was still under warranty (which I didn't even know I had) and they would send out a new replacement. 2 days later I receive my replacement and am very happy again.

Hijacking from one iPad to another, like to software couldn\u2019t lock on a Bluetooth signal and stay. When it started searching and disconnecting at all hours, even when turned off, we have to remove it from the property. Even stashed in the trunk of vehicle, it would try to connect (the sound signals of connection search) until the battery died. The unit has been since disposed. We are cautiously monitoring the second unit for this zombie like behavior. Unfortunate since we liked the sound and used both often for home and travel.",

Honestly I don't know what is the battery life of this since I have not used it till it was totally drained. One feature that saves the battery is that is auto shuts off when you are not using it. The controls are really nice, you have the volume control with a circular touch control and the forward and back automatically controls web apps like spotify.

The new unit, I have works perfectly! I have a few of these speakers, but this seems to work the best with bluetooth, but also is the loudest! I will update again in 60 days. **** During the 60 days that this speaker worked, it was pretty good, louder than the other ones in its class, and It was on sale when I bought it... Anyway 60 days later, it's a paper weight, will look up warranty, and update.",

I wanted this Bluetooth speaker to be as good as the reviews, but its not. Poor connectivity, Loses connection, Poor Bluetooth range. It did connect very easy but lost connection in about 5 minute of play time. As I moved around in my room it was very poor quality. Five feet from my PC it was horrible. But it does look cool, but just did not work for me. I really wanted to work great but it didn't. I know DCSS makes good products but IMO tis is not one. Im returning it.",

      "text": "Bought this to replace similar item I bought last year [Meidong QQChocolate Bluetooth Speaker]. First impression is I'm going to like this a lot better. The other one in under a year started having an annoying problem with you push one button and get a different function, i.e. push vol up/down and get a track change. This unit appears to have MUCH better controls. First test sound quality was very good, no complaints. I'm giving it 5 stars on battery life and bluetooth as a guess until I actually find out. Overall better looking unit as well.",

      "text": "Let me put it this way, while watching a horror flick at night on my porch in the country, this speaker actually made me reach for my pistol. I'm amazed at how well the stereo is from such a small unit, it's almost like surround sound. Bass is excellent, volume is sufficient to make your neighbor either tell you that your taste in music is awful or \"crank that *stuff* up!\" Very pleased with this purchase.",
