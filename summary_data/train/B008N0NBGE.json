The one major negative is that the control buttons are a bright piercing blue and I'm literally blinded every time I look at them. According to the manufacture there is no way to turn off or turn down the blue lights. They are so bright that they light up the wall on the opposite side of my kitchen. The control panel is just weird in general- the buttons don't completely make sense. Had I known about the blue lights before hand I would not have purchased this hood. Even for the price.",

My husband has left 4 voicemails and 2 emails to the manufacturer directly without reply. This occurred for a period of two weeks. This product would have received 3 stars. However, customer service is just as important as the product. Hence, the one star review.",

Reading through the comments, my guess is I would have had difficulty with customer service regardless. Changing my 5 start initial review to 1 for early fail and no warranty to stand behind. Original Review: Fantastic over oven hood. Very powerful and looks great. Even on the lowest speeds I have found this to have tremendous ability to work well and it's relatively quiet too.",

Update: no effort from the manufacturer to remedy the issue with the low light mode not working.

I'm not sure if there are quieter range hoods or just that my place is a bit on the small size, so it may seem a little louder than others to me but I have not listened to many anyway.

I've come to the conclusion that an online order like this is not appropriate for a major remodel that goes on for months. It is much better to buy locally when you are remodeling, so you can get service and support. I am learning local suppliers will match online prices if you ask.",

I love the controls and I find it outs out plenty of light. I love the numerous speeds and it runs very quiet compared to others I have owned in the past.

This unit handles all the heat, steam and smells with ease, and advertises the menu to the entire neighborhood.
