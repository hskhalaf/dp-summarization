It is solid, very easy to put together and very well made. If I had seen it in person before ordering it, I would have expected to pay twice as much. Also, my mom is paralyzed on one side and so puts most of her weight on one side only when rising from the toilet. This is STILL SAFE. Highly recommended.",

There is a shower chair in the tub so the bottom and side rails make it impossible for him to get in and out. He loves the support getting off & on his ADA height toilet. It's just to big for his bathroom and may create more hazard than help. Definitely not good for small spaces.",

It hurt her hips, knees, and arms and shoulders to try and pull herself up and ease herself down again. I ordered this for her, put it together in my garage where I had more room, delivered to her small apartment, and installed around her toilet in seconds. The rest is history. She has enjoyed the effortless trips to the bathroom ever since, and now the family doesn't have to worry about her falling or injuring herself. Wonderful product! Would highly recommend!",

Since I could not install any other type of safety rail on my existing toilet because of the low slung toilet design, I had to use some sort of free standing hand rail system. I solved my problem with this product by installing U shaped brackets over the rear ends of the horizontal bases which I screwed into the floor. Now it does not tip no matter where you grip the hand rails.",

If any of the holes are not punched through quite enough, a phillips screwdriver and a hammer will work. A great solid product for the price. All the other toilet aids I've seen require taking the toilet seat off to install, and with old rusted hardware attached, that can be difficult.",

It filled the bill, and I will (almost) miss it now that I'm on the road to recovery. I am glad I purchased this, especially after seeing the commode/raised seat equipment the hospital would have sent me home with.",
