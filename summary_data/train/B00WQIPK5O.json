The quality overall is on par with the generic WalMart boots that look like boots, but don't perform like boots and are not comfortable.

I have a pair of Caterpillar boots I've had for 4 years, tread is still good.

For us old people who have a hard time getting our foot up to a level to tie a shoe, that makes getting these boots on tightly a little difficult. 2) I have a history of buying cheap boots. A usual reason why my boots fail is because I end up kicking something and that force separates the toe (leather upper portion) from the sole. I bought these boots because they have some extra stitching through the sole in this toe region.",

So far i put them through mud, puddles, dirt, sand, gravel, and horse poop. Time will tell how well they hold up.",

These are soft on the feet yet seem fairly supportive on the ankle and have just enough arch support. I wear an 11 with mid-wide foot and these fit perfectly and true to size.",

I ordered them at my shoe size and I'd say the fit is spot on length wise, and feel a little wide. But I think I could probably have tightened the laces enough to offset that, so it may go away after I've worn them a few times.",
