It is thin enough so it can be sprayed but will not be the mist spray like chemical sunscreen types. Looks like sunscreens based on zinc oxide as the only active ingredient would clog and not work well in spray type. Octinoxate, one of the chemical ingredient in this sunscreen, however is toxic for coral and is one of the main sea pollutants. Wish it could be better but this is what we settled for now.",

Forget even trying to go in the water with this on since all it does is show up super white and gets sort of clumpy looking. I was hoping it would be more like the Aveeno sunscreen I usually buy, but I can definitely say I\u2019ll be sticking with Aveeno from now on. Now I\u2019m not sure what to do since this order came wih two bottles..",

One of the others should have been reapplied after an hour as we already saw redness. .. I resorted to this one and have loved it since. The bug spray also worked well. It was nice that it had the smell of essential oils which was so much nicer than the other stuff.",

Also love that it is physical sunscreen (as opposed to chemical), so I feel like this is a safe option for babies/toddlers. The bottle is also double-capped for travel purposes - if the outer cap comes off during travel, there is still the inner cap to protect the spray bottle from leaking sunscreen all over. Brilliant!",

The pump action is nowhere near as convenient as the bad spray kind, so what's the point? I'm not going to use the rest of the product. I ended up grabbing some Alba Emollient from Whole Foods instead; EWG rate it a 2, it has no smell, and is easy to apply.",
