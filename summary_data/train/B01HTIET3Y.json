It was so easy to assemble, that my 9 year old son actually put the whole thing together using the directions provided with no help from me!! My younger daughters love playing in the tent together with plenty of room for cozy pillows and blankets too. I strung lights on our teepee to add a little bit of sparkle while the girls played in the evening.The tent is surprisingly sturdy and I would highly recommend this teepee to anyone because the quality is excellent!",

It is a very good size, can fit a few children or one baby and one adult. The white color is beautiful, and can be decorated however you like. There is a cut out on one side to serve as a window, and there is a slot on the inside that could hold books. It was very easy to assemble, took only about 5-10 minutes. My 10 month old daughter absolutely LOVES it! Would highly recommend!",

It is extremely difficult putting the sticks together that are joined midway with a plastic tube. The wood stick is wider than the plastic tubing, if you will, and so much force is needed to push each wood stick (8 times) through the plastic. After all the work of putting the wood sticks together and erecting the tent, it would not stay open and it was not level. Why does this tent have a carry case? It doesn't make sense that it is portable if you cannot take apart the wood sticks from the plastic tubes once you first build it!",

I sat it in for one board book before I was dizzy and felt nauseous. It looks cute but I would not recommend if you are looking for something substantial to hold up to regular use. Our toddler has pulled it down/fallen down twice in the 20 minutes it was used.",

My daughter loves to bring her toys inside and play. We also, love reading books inside of the tent. I love that the material is 100% cotton. The tent comes with a carrying bag, as well. It was fairly easy to assemble and didn't take too long to do so. We will be using this for years to come and are very pleased with it!!!",

It\u2019s huge! As you can see from my 6\u2019 3\u201d Husband sitting comfortably inside . I even crawled in there and we can all lay down and read. It came with a carrying case so you can take it outside the photo shoot\u2019s and such it also came with a detachable bottom. We chose to leave it off so we could have the pink fuzzy rug but you can put it back on To keep spills from little ones of your carpet lol",

The pieces were not super easy to push together. But over all its a nice white teepee! Super cute!",

That didn\u2019t make sense. Instructions could have been better. Like I put it together, like the pictures showed that came with it, but when I was trying to put the lites on it, I had to take back down the teepee to insert lites in the hole for the poles first, you can\u2019t do it after you inserted the poles- to tight. But after all that - it looks great.",
