The bluetooth pairing works great, it is easy to adjust the volume, great sound, and the battery life seems excellent so far. Just the other day I got caught in the rain while running and thus unintentionally tested that rain had no negative impact on these! Attached is a video showing onboxing and initial pairing.",

Seemed to happen most when working out, possibly a moisture issue as normal function returned after a day or two. Now, two months into use, they refuse to connect to my phone or other Bluetooth devices at all. I've contacted Otium about a replacement. Will update when I hear back.",

No one ever complains they can't hear me if I can on a call with them. I have them on all day every day listening to music, streaming videos, or talking on the phone. The charge lasts for days! I loved them so much, I ended up ordering 3 more pairs (in total 2 black ones, 1 blue one, and 1 pink one). I ordered the extra 3 pairs so each of my kids could have one. No complaints from any of my 3 kids either! Good value for price!",

They fit snugly in your ear and I used them while running with no problems. They are attached to one another which I like, since I can hang them around my neck when I need to take them off briefly.

I love music and play music so I'm particular about sound quality. For the price, you can't beat these. They don't have a ton of low end but they have enough to suit me. They also do a great job of fitting in my ears and not falling off. The earpiece is a soft gel that doesn't irritate.",
