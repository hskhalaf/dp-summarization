A smaller size and my toes would be scrunched together. I normally wear an 8.5 W and a 9 in tennis shoes. I got the 9W and found them to be uncomfortable. There is no padding in the sole, and while the leather looks high quality the sole and heel do not look build to last. They are definitely cute but not worth the pain in my case.",

I walked a mile in them with no discomfort, which is often hard for me to do in a shoe with any sort of heel, as I've broken both my feet of the years, which makes heels somewhat uncomfortable after a while usually. I would highly recommend these booties (I've already purchased another pair in the black suede)!",

It appears rich brown and soft leather, but it is quite dull and stiff, looks cheap and plasticky. I will get them in black.",

      "text": "I wanted to really like these boots, but I had to return them. I saw several reviews that stated that these boots were 1/2 size too small. Mine seemed 1/2 size too big! 95% of my shoes are size 6, medium width (maybe a little on the narrow side). The width was good, but the length and the overall fit seemed a little too big. I'm afraid that the side of my ankle bone will end up rubbing too much against the inside of the shoes to be comfortable for more than just an hour of walking. I wanted to try 1/2 size smaller, but slate color doesn't come in the size I want.",

Also it breaks the boredom of wearing black and brown. The zipper helps the bootie to slip right on and off easily, and I appreciate that. It's so very comfortable, but I must say that I'm cautious in wearing it for long periods or in the bad weather, because the color is light and I feel a little protective. This is no doubt one of my favorites.",

There's no grip to it at all. If you live in a snowy/icy climate, that can be problematic. I'm probably going to have to look into putting something on the bottom, as I'm pregnant and don't want to risk slipping on ice.",

As some other people stated they do run narrow but that didn't bother me as I have narrow feet. If you are looking for the perfect bootie to wear with skinny jeans, boy friend jeans rolled up, skirts, shorts, etc....don't hesitate to buy these....you won't be disappointed!!",

I am really disappointed in this purchase, especially given the price of the product. Would return these shoes if I could :(",

Going up a half size would make them too long. Alas... I returned them today.",

I didn't try to stand up in them, though, because I was afraid of putting any more pressure on my feet, so it's possible even the length is too small. The construction seemed solid; the leather was soft and beautiful, so I might try the \"wide\" size. I was really hoping they'd work.",
