I would have to turn it on and off 30-40 times to get it to work and that worked only occationaly. The little retractable vacuum sealer thingy would have been cool if IT WORKED. Totally unreliable and junky piece of equipment. Will never, ever, ever, ever buy a FoodSaver again. Returning said hunk today. What a pain... But I still love you Amazon!",

This one? No problem. I have used the marinator unit and the marinate feature - it vacuums, releases, vacuums, releases - for about 10 minutes, opening the pores of the meat for the marinate to set in. This is one sweet kitchen appliance. And no, I don't work for Foodsaver!",

I was worried that I wouldn't use it enough to justify the expense. But now I'm convinced it will be used on a regular basis. I'm glad I spent the extra money for the fully-automatic model.",

It is easy to use, very well built and does an excellent job vacuum sealing, allowing for you to make the exact bag size you need and cutting the material. It is getting a lot of use and especially the hand-held vacuum sealer. I wish we would have purchased a FoodSaver sooner. Now that we are in our mid-sixties and very active, we eat less and with this machine, we also waste less!",
