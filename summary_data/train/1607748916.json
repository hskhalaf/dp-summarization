The problem is that much of the book is how to pick a dog, how to introduce a dog to the family, etc. Lots of stuff like feeding, etc vet, etc. So the portion of the book that's useful to me is relatively small. Even the training focuses heavily on house training. Still valuable and his videos are terrific. I had just hoped that the leash, jumping.etc. things addressed in the videos would be in more depth in the book.",

So this book is very useful in how to achieve the treat portion of that but I would recommend looking into other concepts as well taking from them only the pieces that make sense for you and your dog.",

Only a few basic tricks were mentioned, and I thought there were not enough specifics for dealing with problem behaviors. That said, I think Zak George is a great dog trainer, and this book will almost certainly come in handy as I raise my new puppy.",
