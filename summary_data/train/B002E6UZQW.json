It took a bit of fiddling to the get the pins set in a configuration that would work for my rifle -- but this is, again, due to the design of the rifle. One feature of this lock that makes it work for me is that it was possible to find a combination of pin locations that will prevent the trigger from being pulled when the lock is in place. In short, this lock was just what I needed.",

The tumbler is individually keyed so you don't have to worry about someone else buying a lock and being able to access yours. The edges are rubber-coated so it won't scratch your finish, and the whole thing is designed so it is virtually impossible to open if you don't know what you're doing! Although it's a bit more expensive than other gun locks on the market, you won't be sorry you bought this one!",

Pleased and will highly purchase another for my other firearms.",
