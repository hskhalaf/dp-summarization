      "text": "Arrived last week, and was excited to get mowing. Very easy assembly with just the handle bar adjustments and nothing more. Easily adjusts cut height, and does an excellent job cutting overall; I have only used the bagging accessory so far. However, during the first time using it, the hook connecting the starter cable to the handle bar, that you must keep compressed to keep the mower running, snapped in half. Mower won't remain running as the cable just slips out, unattached. Bad part quality? Definitely. Can be easily fixed with tape. Looks a bit janky, especially being brand new. This part really should be a much stronger material as it's crucial to the mower remaining operable.",

So light, in fact, that it's difficult to pull backwards without \"floating\" up on the rear guard flap and cutting unevenly. The latches that hold the folding-points on the handles seem fragile, but have worked fine through three mows in heavy grass. The little plastic restraints, that should keep the cords running up the handles out of the way, are already broken/breaking (but these are easily fixed with a couple of cable ties). As claimed, it cuts VERY close to the edges of the deck, doing a nice job against the sides of landscaping timbers.",

      "text": "I felt like I was going way out on a limb making this purchase. Never had an electric lawn mower before so I basically relied on the comments provided by others. This purchase was a total win. the mower was super easy to assemble, it's so light weight and more than able to mow my lawn which had gotten pretty tall by the time it arrived. Downside is wrangling the cord, but I am more than willing to trade that for being able to store the mower in the basement (no garage) and no more smelly gas fumes,",

It's perfect for a small backyard renovation project. The mulching was superb. It functioned very well. Cons: The cons happened due to my limited experience in lawn care. Make sure you have long cable s that can handle 13 Amp equipment. Be careful using the orange locking clamps for handle bars - if they're tighten too much, they break off. Get used to starting it up: squeeze the throttle / trigger bar first and while it's engaged push the red start button. Once the squeeze bar is released, the electric motor deactivates.",
