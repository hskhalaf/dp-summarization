I first tried Therapy Stainless Steel cleaner and was so impressed with the results from that product that I could hardly wait to try the granite cleaner, I knew I would not be disappointed. Also, I have cultured marble counter tops in my bathroom and this granite cleaner performs amazing on those as well. I would highly recommend these products to anyone looking for a product that thoroughly cleans granite and stainless better than anything else on the market!",

We were doing the same with our metal fridge, and came across the other Therapy product (stainless steel cleaner). It worked great, nice shine, removed streaks etc...and the granite cleaner is more of that same quality. A tad pricier than some of the other more mainstream brands, but worth it in my book...plus it comes with a microfiber towel, so there's your extra few bucks (plus nontoxic chemicals) I also feel a little better having the kids around the kitchen with non toxic cleaners.",

I also noticed that stuff will leave a ring on the surface now but it buffs out with the cloth that is supplied. The seller contacts you right away and does offer a refund if you are not satisfied.
