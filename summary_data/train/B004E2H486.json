The biggest knock is for its height they should have designed a bit more cross bracing and probably used a few metal plates for brackets on the baseboards. even if that increased the cost by around 10-15 bucks it would substantially make this a better cat tree. I could see this not lasting past a year if heavily used before it became worn out and just wobbled constantly. I spent about 10 bucks at walmart to buy some metal brackets and wood to reinforce it.",

Additionally, my little sister likes to hide underneath the levels? I guess it's good for more than just the cat.",

Ikea should hire these guys to write their instructions sheets. You have to lay out the parts and watch what each part is labeled. It helps to have a small tape measure or a yard stick. Some of the rope covered poles are only different by a few inches but it's important. I had it together in less than 20 min. To be fair I have used tools all my life but if you take your time and read the diagram all will go smoothly! Thanks guys from me and my cat! Frank",

As time goes by I will revamp this review, but in the short term seems like a good investment. However one of my cats prefers the box it came in; I kept it by the tree to amuse him. \ud83e\udd14",

The fluffy animals are just stapled to the underside of the frame so you cannot change them out once they get too torn up. This is just an ok product. Not great and definitely not worth $115.",

      "text": "Overall we (me & the cat) are very happy. I think that its a bit expensive for particle board, sisal & carpet remnants but I did my research and this is the best option I could find. I agree with other reviewers in that it is a tad flimsy and the cubes are quite small, but I've seen cats fit in to smaller spaces. The dangling mice were ripped off easily and I was disappointed by that. Otherwise, it was easy to put together ( a huge plus for me), the color is nice, the carpet is very soft and plush, and it took a while, but my kitty now loves to sleep in the highest basket.",

Some drawbacks: The wood is particle board so it probably wont last for many years. Also, after assembling, the tower is relatively wobbly. I put mine against a wall and its totally fine. But if you plan on leaving it in the center of a room (it would look weird IMO) it may be a little too flimsy. Overall, it was worth the price and it looks very nice in the living room.",

My only complaint, and the reason for 4 vs 5 stars, is that it's particle board and plastic. I wish it was made of a more sturdy wood(real wood), rather than particle board. I'd have gladly paid an extra $100 for real wood in place of the particle board pieces.",

The only issue is he pulled the mice off (that dangle) pretty quickly (within a few weeks). I kinda figured that would happen. Its well made, still looks pretty new (and he plays on it all the time). I even moved a month ago and had to disassemble and re-assemble it (which was relatively easy). Still in great condition. OH! I LOVE the color of the blue carpeting used on it. I highly recommend this purchase to any cat lover :)",

Though the cats don't care about this when they're taking a nap, it gets annoying when they're playing around on it. Because it's so thin, their nails can't really get a good grip, meaning that when they're racing around the house and jump on the tree they tend to just slide right off again.
