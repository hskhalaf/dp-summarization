Laces are a little long, but you can always wrap around if needed. I also purchased a better blade guard as the ones that come with the skates are very cheap protection. Can't wait to get out on the ice with them! I will update if they do not perform well.",

They seemed too short, like they were for a smaller size skate. Also, one of the front blade plates did not fit flush against the boot at the front near the toe, and there was a gap. The blade plates were not positioned in the same spot on each sole either. They seemed to be put together in the factory in a sloppy, non-precise manner. I don't know if either of these issues could cause any performance problems but I just didn't feel secure and safe using them.",

      "text": "Fits perfectly with thick socks! Didn't give me blisters or ankle pain. My only issue is that the blades didn't come sharpened, and other reviews say they do so I went onto the ice assuming it'll be sharp enough. I'm going to need to get the sharpened asap before my next ice skating trip, but other than that, this is well worth the price.",
