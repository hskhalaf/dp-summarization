The throw could be a bit better, as I have to set it fairly far back to get any kind of a reasonable size image out of it (rather annoying when doing conference booths- you basically need to set it up at the front of the booth to throw the image on the rear of the booth if you want it big enough to be readable).",

I am using it for a Powerpoint presentation that includes illustrations and photos, no video. I am using it with a Surface Pro and HDMI I'm very pleased with the product. It may not work for a major sized conference facility but for a medium sized room with florescent lighting (I give presentations in various places and this one was in a Morton building) it worked very well. I had no problem with the lumens and the resolution/crispness was superior to my old Epson. I highly recommend it for business use for up to medium sized rooms.",

It fits in their laptop bag, making it very easy to get through airport security. Very good product. We will likely buy a second and third if the unit stands up well.

It has a USB port to power wireless adapters like chrome cast. I suggest to buy a tripod. It comes with a beatiful bag, which is a nice touch. Well the only downside I can complain is the audio.
