The speaker just isn't powerful enough to be useful.",

The quality of the wayze picture and zoom and the ability to rotate the view on the Wayze is better than the Honeywell. However the Honeywell integrates beautifully with my alarm systems app and alerts me when it detects sound or movement. I\u2019ll probably end up purchasing a few more Honeywells to put around just for the convenience of integration with my alarm app . It gives peace of mind to be able to look in and listen but the rotating the view would be nice but you get what you pay for",
