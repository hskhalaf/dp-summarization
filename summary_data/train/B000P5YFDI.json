That cheap brittle foam was damaged in shipping. Granted, the case did its job, and the expensive bass was fine, but I have seen much nicer cases that are made out of higher quality materials. Better foam, balsa wood reinforcing, etc. This is a solid 4-star case if you want to protect your bass, but don't expect the best quality or materials.",

REVISED: Gator took 27 days to get back to me, but they finally did and replaced my case. It was a long time to wait and I almost bought a new case. Anyway, they honored the warranty so I'm bumping my review up to 4 stars.",

The body holding area fits well though, and it seems to keep the guitar snug in place. The zippers and padding all feels good quality. I imagine this case will live the lifetime of the guitar it's storing. It's a great less-expensive alternative to a hard case if you don't plan on beating it up too badly.",
