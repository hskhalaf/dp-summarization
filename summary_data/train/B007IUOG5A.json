I love that you have to push the buttons on both the top and bottom at the same time to open. We ran cable covers out the bottom hole so our little one can't pull on the cords at all. Bot is a little bulky, but that's to be expected as it needs to provide room for the cord's depth when plugged in. We will be buying more of these soon.",

The profile on this is semi deep, so if you're backing furniture up to it, be aware that your furniture will be sticking out from the wall a little bit. But it is not an issue with me. I also paired it with a separate purchase of an adhesive cord cover to keep the baby monitor cord from dangling. Easy enough for an adult to get in to, but in my opinion, impossible for a baby/toddler to get into. Highly recommend",

Needed to jostle the button tab on one panel (at top and bottom), to the receiving hole on the other panel (at top and bottom), to get it to \"snap\" close. It's not hard, but worrying that with continual jostling over time that the plastic halves on the hinges will break. The plastic is fairly thin, compared with a similar product. Didn't like the finicky opening/closing, and ended up returning this. Got the Wappa Baby outlet cover box, which seems more durable (definitely easier to open and close, and liked the additional \"locking\" wheel feature).",

I love that this cover attaches to the plate cover- keeps it secure and impossible for my child to rip it off the wall. Also comes with two plate cover styles so you can use it no matter which style you have. I was able to push the extra cord from one lamp up into the box. Awesome. My other lamp I used some electrical cord cover which worked great as well. These covers ARE rather large. But I chose this particular style so I could accommodate larger plugs such as USB and extension cords.",

Place the new outlet plate cover on top and screw it in instead. The doors hinge close easily and open with little adult effort by pressing the top and bottom tabs in. The cords can be directed up or down depending how you install the box. Easy solution to child safety concerns.",

      "text": "Purchased to keep the ferrets from getting to the plug. I plugged in two power strips, the width of the two cords barely fit to allow the doors to close, but they were able to close. It has kept the ferrets out and is very unobtrusive in appearance. My walls are white so it blends nicely. The composite is a thin plastic so it would not withstand a great deal of force. It is large enough for the plugs and it is easy to open and close. I do not have children so can not speak to the safety from that perspective. I would purchase it again.",
