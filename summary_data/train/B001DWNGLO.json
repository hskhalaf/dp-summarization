We bought it in October, went on an international trip and by the last leg, the pull handle was stuck in the upright position and the bag had ripped on the side with another handle. By the time the bag was pulled off the plane on the last leg, the pull handle had snapped off completely. On our other identical bag, the handle next to the pull handle broke when a taxi driver lifted it out of his vehicle. The pull handle on that bag was sticking from the moment we began using it. DO NOT BUY! You cannot get a refund, only a replacement. I would never buy this brand again.",

Pros if it: -good size for quality - well made - came with lock -has great depth space (deep) for more room - looks nice - can hold quite a bit - suit case is light Cons: -the lock is the cheapest quality and not worth even putting on your case. my 2 year old could probably get past it if he wanted to! - it's not super high quality pretty fast, it'll wear out of you use it all the time.

I heard they immediately shipped out the replacement and I did receive my two piece replacement within two days and in great condition.

When I went to pack our stuff, I had to sit on suitcase while my son zipped it because it didn't expand like I thought it would. Maybe I just had too high of an expectation.

I didn't want to be too flashy, but wanted the bags to be easier to identify in the baggage area. The handles slide up & down easily. The zippers work great.

      "text": "I am not a traveler so I can't really compare this to other suit cases I may have used in the past. I seldom have a need for one. I needed a nice one, though, to see my son graduate the Air Force basic training and I had to fly there. This suitcase held up well, wasn't a real burden to pull, held everything I needed and more. The only thing is that it looks like a million other suit cases so you need to put a ribbon on or some other form of identification to find it quickly when it comes out on the baggage rack.",

If I travelled a lot, I would spend more to hopefully get more durability. Also, it came with keys but no lock. There doesn't seem to be a way to contact the seller about this omission.",

If this becomes too much of a bother, a small adjustment with a grinder will make this a five star item. The smaller bag fits nicely over the roller extending handle and stays put well.

Still a decent choice if you don't want to spend too much. This size is larger than carry on. Has a dark navy blue face and black sides and back, so doesnt stand out on the carousel, but identifiable IF the airport people don't load it face down. Overall nice appearance.",

Haven't needed to use the smaller bag yet, but it may have some use in the future. I wish that the two outside pockets were instead one larger pocket so that a magazine or larger booklet would fit, and likewise two of the mesh pockets on inside were one, but that's no big deal.",
