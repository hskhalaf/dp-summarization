I compared this one to some of those really expensive ones (400.00- 600.00). Let me tell you, this mixer is as good , if not better than those over priced one. It's heavy duty. Will tackle even the toughest mixing conditions. I love it! I've made bread, cookies, cakes and whipped up all kinds of goodies. It works great. Would definitely recommend this mixer.",

For me this machine is better than Kithchen Aid, more powerfull, but the only disadvantage is that it has fewer accessories. The accessories it brings are metal and look strong and durable. Due to its high capacity it can be difficult to prepare small quantities, but I do not regret buying it, it is very sturdy and the quality in the finishes are impeccable.",

It blended my soft dough in just a few minutes. Love the white color as my counter tops and backsplash is white. Very importantly it is all metal, no plastic parts to break. I think that is what die cast means. So, for half the price of the leading brand, and with a stronger motor, I believe it is a bargain! It holds a lot of dough or batter!

And the price \u2014 at $163 \u2014 was so good. ------------ Today the price is almost $100 higher, but the machine is still wonderful. Best mixer I have ever had.

I am not a baker, nor do I use this every single day so if you're looking for something heavy-duty I can't realistically comment on this, but for someone using this a few times each week it will do the job credibly.

The second time I made sure the butter was very soft. Again, the paddle does not reach the butter. I had to keep using a spatula to stir it by hand.
