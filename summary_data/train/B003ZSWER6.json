I wanted something to fit underneath that would serve specifically to reduce noise, but also not be a pain when I opened and closed the doors. It works wonderfully! It reduces the noise level from outside, and vice versa. The talking and tv in the living room is muted, and I have been told my phone conversations are quieter! So perfect for what I needed!

You have to realign/adjust the guard practically every single time you close the door or it won't shut. Also, for some doors that aren't as wide, you have to fold the cloth nearly in half before Velcro-ing it down. As a result, the cloth is just hanging there loosely and doesn't look good at all. With a little more effort, these could be really nice, but they didn't meet my expectations.",

Assembly and fitting is easy enough, you just cut the excess off each closed-cell foam tube, close the fabric case, and shove it under the door. This is not going to soundproof anything, but it does cut down on the noise compared to the 2\" gap that used to be under my bedroom door. Just remember - measure twice and cut once! It won't work nearly as well if you cut too much foam off.",

But, whoever manufactures this brand (I had one from another manufacturer that was made well) makes the openings in the pocket into which the styrofoam is to be inserted too small for the two styrofoam tunes to slide in to. SO-- upshot: THIS manufacturer can't do the job. And it will waste your money if you pay for postage for this thing, and it will waste your time bcs you'll have to return it.",

I didn't think a sweep would work and was afraid it would make the door difficult to open and close, so I got the draft guard. It works perfectly. Several reviews mentioned the difficulty of wrapping the excess fabric, but the produce I received had a velcro tab that easily tucks and hold the excess fabric. It's not ugly and it does the job without a lot of drilling or hammering holes into the door. It stays put when the door is opened and closed.",

It lasted a long time - I'll be surprised if this one lasts one season.",
