Also, cam locks are bit tough to move around especially if you want to make a quick shot and your camera is fixed with these locks. Other than these two issues, this is a highly durable, high quality strap.",

The under arm strap is a nice feature to have but it can feel awkward to some people. What is great though is it easily detaches so if you don't like it then it can be easily removed.

It attaches with a hook on one side instead of a quick releases like the other side. Now after only using this nearly $80 strap only 3 times, I can't find the under arm part. Why was this ever designed in such a way the moment you release it, the thing can fall off? It's an obvious design flaw. If they got rid of the hood and used a real release, it would be perfect, but now I have an $80 harness that's worse than a paperweight because it can't even hold down paper.",

It doesn't feel secure and it takes up the tripod mount. I found some solutions myself. After these minor changes i love the product but as I said it could be better.",
