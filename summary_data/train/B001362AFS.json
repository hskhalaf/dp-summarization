      "title": "GREAT! BUT - Read this if your kitty struggles coming down",
      "text": "I would love to give this product 5 stars because we enjoy it immensely but it did require an important hack. We wall mounted the unit into drywall (no stud) with average anchors and wood screws which provided plenty of stability. However kitties just couldn't navigate the narrow steps - especially coming down. Our solution was to drill one new hole on each shelf and shift shelves approx 3 more inches past their already offset position. This is exactly what was needed! See video of kitty coming down climber with no fear. Good luck!",

I watched the video on how to put it together, had no trouble putting it together. I removed the metal grooves that are meant to attach to a door and used one of the shelves to provide support. It works beautifully and the cat loves it. This cat tree is attractive and versatile and I would recommend it for anyone with a cat that is always looking for a new adventure.",

I will agree with other reviewers that it can be disconcerting (and noisy) unless you strap the middle of this against the door with something. My husband suggested duct tape.

This is easy to install and move to different doors, and it is sturdy. I did tuck a folded towel behind the ladder and the door to keep it from rattling against the wood of the door, though. That works well. The ladder does wiggle when the cat climbs on it, but that doesn't seem to bother my cat at all.",

The design is a bit lacking--the post should be in one piece for more stability. And I almost cried from frustration while putting this thing together. It definitely needs two people to assemble. Tip: Put it on a door you don't need to open frequently or walk by. It's more stable with the door closed, and cats like to use it to ambush those who walk by unsuspecting attack. :)",
