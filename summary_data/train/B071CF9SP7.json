The inside has a couple of pockets, a space for a power bank (which you can access through a port from outside the backpack) and a nicely padded laptop compartment. There are a couple of well-divided pockets on the outside, and two pockets on the sides large enough to fit a pretty thick water bottle. There's also a little pocket on the back that rests against your back when you're wearing it. I use that to store valuables when I have to stand on the train.",

Pros: Tons of pockets Waterproof, though I haven't been in heavy rain Lightweight Cute Cons: Once, in the first few days of having this bag, I went to zip it while it was overfull and the zipper split. I unzipped it and adjusted the contents and the zipper has been fine ever since.",

This MarsBro Laptop Backpack is great! It looks small at first glance, but it actually fits my computer (13in), mouse, charging cord, business cards, pens, etc with plenty of room to spare! It is light-weight and doesn't hurt my shoulder as previous bag did, even when full with stuff! The color is great. I got the purple and it's subtle enough to still look business, but stands out enough against traditional backpacks. I highly recommend!",

I just zipped the bag closed and ran my power cord through the zipper when I was using it so I could have fast charging. It's not the end of the world, but part of why I picked this backpack was because of the charging port. Backpack seems durable, I have used for a few weekends of traveling so far. It is very comfortable and the pocket on the straps has been great for keeping bus/train cards within easy and quick reach.",

Love the pockets to fit water bottle on the sides. My recommendation for an upgrade on this backpack is to create more space like depth and include the straps that help tighten the backpack for bulging out too much.

Only Con: The shoulder straps are a little close together so it rubbed against my neck when I was riding my bike. Computer size: 15.6 inch, the strap (inside to secure the laptop) will cover it and reach the Velcro on the inside but it has to be stretched to do so. I am sure after some use it will stretch permanently.",

I probably looked at 50 bags priced $50-150 before settling on this one, and I have to say I think it's better than those other bags. You also can't beat the price. I'm looking forward to taking it to Europe later this month.",

Needed something a little on the smaller side to fit a few work documents, Surface Pro, water bottle, umbrella, miscellaneous cords and other small things. It looks more professional than a lot of backpacks, and the color is awesome. That said, I'm not thrilled with the build quality. I've been using it for just under 2 months, usually 4-5 days per week, and some of the seams have started ripping already. Now I'm left with the decision... Buy another and just consider them \"disposable\" or find something else that might last better but probably won't be as close to what I'm looking for.",
