I'm not a big fan of the clear plastic used to cover the ID slot and would much rather have a mesh, but this is just my opinion. My other issue is that I've been using this wallet every day now for a few weeks and the card slots in the wallet are not loosening at all and are still pretty tight, which leads to the minor fight to get my cards out at the register. Honestly not a big deal, overall it's a great wallet and I'm going to keep using it, but that's why I knocked off one star.",

I love the outside slot for my main credit card and the finger slot for my license. It can hold plenty of cards and cash depending on how fat you want to let it get. I have five cards and my drivers license, and around then bills and there's room for more. Once you stuff more than that in there it tends to lose its low profile.",

It's a good-looking wallet that has sort of a 3D carbon fiber appearance without being over-the-top. I don't know why, but compared to my last wallet, this one tends to lie flat versus popping open when sitting on my desk. In my pocket, it's definitely a lower profile look. Five months into using it, it looks brand new with the stitching holding perfectly. The price on Amazon was right so I'd definitely recommend. I didn't receive a discount or product for writing the review. I just wanted to share a good find.",

Fits everything I need except pictures. Wasn't able to keep the kids pics in here but that's fine. My only con is I wish it was better quality of leather, but its surely just a personal preference. I will keep this wallet for awhile unless i happen to find one similar with better leather quality.",
