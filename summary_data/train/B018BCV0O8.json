      "text": "And keep in mind, the proper inflation values for playing kickball are usually a LOT lower than what you'd thing! Don't over-inflate this thing, otherwise it WILL deform VERY easily when you play kickball. The ball should still be pretty soft when you're playing with it-- that allows the rubber to flex and stretch when kicked, rather than the rubber already being stretched when stressed out on a kick.",

Kids, adults, actual kickball games, four-square etc. However, I have a boxer dog who LOVES to \"play ball\", and I got it with her in mind. It looked tough. It felt tough. It wasn't strong enough to compete with her teeth & jaws. She punctured it within an hour, though she had lots of fun. It isn't totally destroyed yet, but I doubt it will last past this week.",

It is unfortunate that you received a defective kickball\". They went on to say that it was \"not their fault\". They would not send a replacement out without charging me more money. DO NOT WASTE YOURS. The seller will not stand behind the product, even when they admit that their product was defective.",
