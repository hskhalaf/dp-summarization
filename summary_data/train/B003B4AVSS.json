Everything else is pretty much automatic. To connect other computers, you can either push the button on the base unit when Windows requests the passphrase, or you can just plug the USB dongle into the new computer. It's easy to change the default network name and passphrase if you wish. I've intalled several of these, and they just work. The one at my mother-in-law's house has been working nonstop for about a year and a half now, with no issues whatsoever.",

It took absolutely no knowledge of routers. Directions are simple and there isn't much to do. However, reception in the next room is not much better with this router than with the Roadrunner modem. Maybe there's something strange about the construction of our house, who knows. But some devices are doing a little better with the Cisco router, some a little worse. But from what I am seeing, this does not have particularly good range.",

Setup required one phone call to tech support, during which it was determined that I had not completely re-set my cable modem (it has a backup battery, so simply disconnecting the power cord wasn't enough - I had to remove the backup battery, too). Once that was done, connectivity was instananeous, and setting up the 2 other computers (a Mac and a PC) in the house literally took 5 minutes in total. Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced, and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus, this makes for a great product. Highly recommended - well worth the $$.",

Setup is very good, easy, probably because I started from a Windows 7 PC. Have not tried the Windows XP PC yet. After the installation, I am very surprised that the CISCO's range is worse than my Netgear. It is not even as good as a LinkSys, a 6 year old device. Range is the only reason I upgraded.

Called Cisco support and they could not have been nicer helping me open a port for the Slingbox. Everything has worked flawlessly since I have owned it, including wireless printing. I highly recommend this model, if only for their great product support!",

It is hard to find the instructions (most references say it isn't supported yet - but they are old... it is supported). Trust me it works GREAT!",
