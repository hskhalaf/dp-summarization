When my husband and I both tried to lay one it one could lay and they other got rolled off and that was the reason we bought this was to lay beside each other to watch movies. We HATE THIS! There is no way to fit it in any box to mail it back or we would have already sent it back!!!!!",

It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Thankfully I had read other reviews and information about the filler and had taken it out of the vacuum sealed packaging before Christmas so that when I put it in the cover, it did not take long before it had a nice shape. The cover is very soft and it was easy to put together. This product arrived by the expected delivery date. I would definitely recommend this product and the seller",

It is not easy to change the shape of it like a normal nean bad when you need to readjust. In fact for me (a normal sized 5 1/2 foot tall woman) I would say re-shaping and adjusting is almost impossible without opening it up and making a huge mess.",

We have had them for 18 months now and they still look new, despite the strenuous use they have been put through. These really are awesome bean bags! They are very comfortable and the kids love them. It took three days for them to fluff to full size and when they did, they seemed so much bigger than the measurement. They do measure at 4 feet, so I guess it is an optical illusion. We would definitely buy these again.",

Also, even after laying on it all day and measuring the longest part it's still a few inches short of 6 feet, which is annoying because I'm exactly 6 feet tall.

It is perhaps the best piece of furniture I've ever had to just let yourself flop down on. The memory foam can absorb quite a bit of energy. One word of advice: this thing will take a looooooong time to fully inflate. Even when I would periodically (i.e. a few times a day) shake and fluff the beanbag, it still took nearly a week to grow to its full size. Memory foam is like that. Most of the \"flat\" pictures I see in these reviews look my my chair about 3 days before it finished regrowing.",

They explained that only occasionally some sacks get shipped with less foam than needed, and they sent me extra foam. It worked like a charm! It does take some time and manual manipulation to fluff all of the foam up initially. We love our cozy sack!

But that would be like going to a Michelin Star restaurant and dinging them because they gave you too much food. I'm thinking of pulling some of the stuffing out of this thing to make it a little more floppy. Right now it's somewhat globular in shape (actually more or less like the picture shows it).

Okay, so the biggest thing with this is that you MUST sit in it properly. If you look at the cover in the photos, you can see the seams of the cover are on the SIDES of the person sitting.

I am a 34 year old, strong male and it even gets heavy for me to pick it up sometimes to fluff the thing out - so if you are a smaller female or much older than I am - you will very much appreciate a smaller version.",
