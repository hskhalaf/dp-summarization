Made of very heavy Iron/steel a little tough to open and close at first, gets easier after a few tries. I can see using this vice for many years and for many jobs. Only reason I gave 4 and not 5 is because 5 stars means perfection to me and few things reach that. Good working tool that fits into my tool box. Jaws are 2-3/4' wide, opens to 2-1/2', base clamp opens to slightly wider then 1 3/4' so would mount to standard 2' lumber.",

Im not a professional here, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I know general quality and have been happy. Overall, i recommend it!",

It has quite a large sliding mechanism, and the jaws open much wider than prior vises that I have had. I did have to clean it with WD40 to get the slightly sticky packing grease off, but after a fresh coat of lubrication oil, it works smoothly.",
