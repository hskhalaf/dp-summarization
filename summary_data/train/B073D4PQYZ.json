Rather than create necklaces and bracelets with the straight pieces, they cracked them to activate and scattered them around the room and had fun using the rings and finger flashlights. All were perfect for a one evening event. They are not made to last long (even the finger flashlights) but really great for a sleepover. Super fun.",

      "text": "The rubber led rings in this pack are the only reason I\u2019m giving two stars. They were awesome. The led finger lights were terrible. 1/3 of them didn\u2019t work and another 1/3 the rubber bands snapped when they kids were putting them on their fingers. The glow sticks were disappointing as well, very little brightness. They lasted long enough, but they didn\u2019t glow bright at all.",
