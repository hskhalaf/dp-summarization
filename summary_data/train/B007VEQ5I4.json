I read other reviews where people had problems but I decided to chance it and buy one since I liked the features of this. We have been using this for four months now without issues.

I couldn't find one of those but this one had even higher wattage (800-1200 watts). It uses regular resistance coils wrapped around a cone rather than a sealed beam element in a heat resistant glass envelope. After a few weeks of use, it started to trip the safety switch when set on high wattage. Not as sharply focused as the sealed element predecessor so user sets it higher to compensate. Using it closer at 800 watts so it doesn't trip the safety switch. Oscillates and remote control are good features that work well. Probably wouldn't buy again because of performance issues listed above.",

It works fine in low heat setting. due to small dish head, heat at low power barely puts anything out. so far it oscillates fine, with loud irritating noise. Not worth to oscillate. LISTEN to the People. in high heat, after about 5-10 minutes, it pops. will not turn on until it cools down. also, the remote sucks.",

It started turning off and lighting up the caution light. I called up their support # and you will need to ship this thing (or at least the upper part) out to california with a 2-3 weeks turnaround. So in other words expect this heater to fail quickly (and often - as some of the other reviews have mentioned). If you want it fixed, do expect to pay shipping and a quite long turnaround time as well.",

Edit: This heater does not emit nearly as much heat as the Presto. Pretty disappointing. Edit2: After about an hour or two of use, it shut off automatically with the \"Caution\" light on. Impressive. 1.5 stars.",
