      "text": "I love this toaster oven!! So far I have used it for cookies, pizza, biscuits, and cinnamon rolls!! No problems at all. I especially love it since I am now able to bake biscuits in the middle of our Texas summer without making the house hot!! And since the oven door opens upwards, I will have one less thing to clean. Plus the removable spill tray on the bottom of the toaster oven is a snap to remove and wash! This toaster oven is the best one I have ever owned. It is worth the money.",

We use it mostly for toast, but it does a good job as an oven for small items. The way the oven door opens makes it easier to items in and out. The only negative observation I would make is that the little oven tray that comes with it is made of such thin metal that it buckles with the heat of the oven.",

It's not satisfactory for pizza if you need over 350F to cook, so pizza is basically out of the question unless you are re-warming. The only way it will reach 450F is in broil mode. Keep that in mind when you purchase and you wont be disappointed. As other reviewers said, the aluminum pan warps drastically when hot so do like I did and get a stainless pan at the same time.",

Even the mode of opening is exceptional, up and out-of-the-way, avoiding the sweeping of the countertop that occurs with other ovens. The only drawback is the limit of the timer )30 minutes), that requires manual timing for longer times, a minor problem if one is paying attention anyway.

It toasts, but better yet it bakes 12\" pizzas, cookies, chicken tenders, pizza rolls, egg rolls and much more without heating up the house. Our old toaster and Pizzaz rotisserie pizza cooker are going to Good Will. My only wish is for an inside light, but even without it it's a winner. Finally, I really like the flip up door. I also bought one for work and my coworkers love it too.",

Also, UNLIKE most toaster ovens, it even makes great toast!!! My only complaint is that it did not lie flat on my granite counter...it \"rocked\" a little and required me to remove one back \"leg\" and put a spacer in it...no big deal and an easy permanent fix.",
