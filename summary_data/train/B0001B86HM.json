I ordered this hair dryer because my previous dryer broke. What a waste! Temp choices are either cool to scalding. There is no way to adjust (raise or lower) the hood's height and it does not lock in place (moves up and down, does not sit in one position you have to hold it in place while it is on your head). If you don't mind having the hood constantly hit you in the head or holding the hood in place while your fingers burn, then congratulations...this is the dryer for you.",

The cons: it sounds like a vacuum cleaner in the room but under the dryer itself the sound is not as loud. I need to sit on a pillow even at the lowest height to get the correct hood height for myself. I'm 5'4\" so maybe a taller person would not have this problem. Overall I think it is a good value.",

I spent a relaxing hour under the dryer (on the low setting) and emerged with a head full of curls. It took a little work finding the right countertop/chair combination so that the hood would be the correct height, but that's a fine tradeoff for a dryer that can be stowed on an out-of-the-way closet shelf.
