It was simple to complete assembly of the elliptical but then you have to go through a whole rigmarole to create multiple account with NordicTrack and iFit. I spent over an hour on the phone listening to advertisements on hold from the phone numbers included to finally get my machine activated. Hold your Bluetooth button for 30 seconds to skip the hassle. I will not buy another product that incorporated iFit. The website and service department seem focused on selling more products/memberships rather than helping.",

We have it now, and the resistance seems like it's always turned up. I run half marathons, cycle, and lift regularly, so an elliptical isn't usually this hard, and I haven't even dated to raise the resistance. Update: You're also required to sign up for this iFit membership. (Which we didn't want) After I cancelled it, they continued to charge me saying that it hadn't been cancelled.. You'll be much happier of you avoid NordicTrak altogether!",
