After drilling 100 1/8 inch pilot holes with a single Amoolo bit (separately reviewed), 60 3/16 holes and 20 1/4 inch holes, each with only one non-Irwin drill bit, I tried the Irwin bits. Using the same speed and lubrication as my prior 180 holes, one Irwin bit drilled 4 holes, and one managed 3 before they were ruined. I can't return them as they are not in \"new or like new\" condition. I now have a $92 drill organizer. I am sick about this purchase. I can't stress this enough: DON'T BUY THESE BITS. THEY ARE JUNK.",

Pros: Cut like butter, maybe too well on mild steel In the drill press these work amazing, nice clean cuts. Cons: Without a hex/flatted shank these bite and dig quickly so in a battery powered hand chuck drill the bit ends up catching and the drill keeps spinning around because it can't hold the bit still. These are so sharp and durable though you can step back and nibble it away with some care.",

I saw a review earlier that said you could drill through normal drill bits with these, so I thought why not give them a try. I put the 3/16\" cobalt bit in my drill press and drilled down into an old craftsman high speed steel bit. It worked, no apparent damage to the cobalt. I am not sure why I didn't invest in a good set of drill bits 20 years ago.",

      "text": "These are the best drill bits I have ever owned. I'm no professional, but I do my share of repairs and DIY projects and I will never buy any other type of bit. Last winter a couple of bolts where sheared off on my snowblower (not the shear pins) and left the threaded portion of the hardened steel bolt inside without the heads. After trying an easy out (which never works for me) I decided to drill them out and these bits (which were far from new at the time) did the job. \"Big deal\" you might think, but I challenge you to drill through a grade 8 hardened steel bolt with anything else!",
