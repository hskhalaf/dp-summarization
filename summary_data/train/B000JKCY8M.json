Simple Green, Green Monster, Formula 88, Zep Grill Cleaner, Easy Off Regular Grill cleaner and others; by far this is the best one of all. I am the type of person who prefers cleaning the grill immediately after grilling. Other products worked fine, but this one does not require me to use any elbow grease. It loosens the debris off the grates easily and comes off easily. I like easy practical cleaning without the need to spend much time scrubbing. Try it, you will not regret it.",

I tried all natural first, letting dawn & vinegar & baking soda sit over night and it just didn't touch the embarrassing mess in my oven. This stuff, after sitting for just 15 minutes, wiped it all right off. My major complaint with this product is how difficult it is to get all the cleaner residue off when you're done. Every time I'd rinse & wipe it clean and then use the oven, a white residue would reappear. Scary to think what is getting into my baked foods :(",

It still seemed to clean okay with some scrubbing (use thick gloves!). I won't ever buy this again; it was recommended on a landlord's move out cleaning list, but I'll opt for a bit more scrubbing with a normal strength product.",

It's no match for a grill/oven that actually gets used. And don't you dare get this on your skin because it will never come off again. It leaves an oily residue that's impossible to wash off!

I made a mistake...the fume got all over my kitchen and it is very toxic. I can't literally breath while using it. It does clean faster than the blue one. Does it worth get all the fume in your face? Certainly not. I still rather get the fume free and let it sit for longer time on the over/grill.",
