The bowls on either end are fabulous, and means that I don't need to pack additional bowls. All in all, a compact travel idea, a nicely sealed container when the bowls are in use, due to the separate lid, and when not travelling, acts as an additional food storage canister. Love it!",

This will hold something like 10 cups (not verified). Since having it, however, I really like it! It's great for long distance trips! It's compact, with the top and bottom blue dishes fitting perfectly over the food container. The handle is easy to remove and put back on, and it's easy to clean. I'd like to see them come out with a container that is \"split\" where water can be stored in top part and food in the bottom part!",

The outer bowls smelled of plastic, and our dog wouldn't eat or drink from them. The idea is good, the size is good, the materials are poor. Waste of money.",

This is great, I can tote this around in my car and always have 2 or 3 meals ready for my pup!",
