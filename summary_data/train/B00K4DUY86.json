It has been in there for two months. Every time I start the truck it reboots (because of my inverter, not the motherboard) but it keeps on running! (luckily I had a spare ssd to cut the boot time) I use this as a rolling Plex Media Server in Ubuntu. Two clients (one iPad and one android tablet) have streamed large media without a hiccup. Not sure how hot it gets since AMD and Linux temperature sensor software/drivers don't play nicely. Frankly, I'm scared to look!",
