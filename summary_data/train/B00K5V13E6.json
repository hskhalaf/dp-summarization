      "text": "Such a step change from the a230 I had previously. Only complaint is it is so capable I'm always learning and it's cost me to get a book on exploiting it more effectively. Picture quality is superb, the WiFi makes picture transfer so much easier. Not worth spending the extra on the a99 but you do have to decide between mirror and mirrorless; I'm old school so the 77 over the 7 for me.",

The view finder is very bright and clear in all light conditions. The new focusing, tracking etc, is excellent. I've just updated the firmware which adds XAVC S video (4K) which operates within a MPEG-4 wrapper. This enables shooting movies in 50p/25p (PAL mode) and 60p/30p/24p (NTSC mode) in XAVC S format that supports high bit rates There seems to be growing support for this home video format.",

    "description": "Sony a77 ii APS-C Interchangeable Lens Camera Body (24.3 MP APS-C Exmor CMOS Sensor, BIONZ X Engine, 3 inch LCD) - Black. The camera shake icon that looks like a hand keeps flashing and will not go away: If the SteadyShot feature is turned on it is possible for the camera to use slower shutter speeds than when it is off. The actual shutter speed at which the icon begins flashing, however, depends on the focal length of the lens. At short focal lengths (wide angle) the icon flashes when a relatively slow shutter speed is selected. When shooting with a long focal length (telephoto) the icon begins flashing at faster shutter speeds. You can still take a picture even though the icon is displayed. However, since there is a chance of image blur, make sure you are holding the camera as still as possible or consider mounting the camera to a tripod. The icon appears most often when shooting in areas that do not have sufficient lighting. Therefore, selecting a higher ISO setting or using a flash may cause the camera to choose a faster shutter speed and prevent the icon from flashing. NOTES: The icon only flashes in the modes that automatically set the shutter speed. It does not appear when using the Shutter Priority (S) or Manual (M) mode.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nEyepiece cup\nRechargeable Battery NP-FM500H\nBody cap\nBattery charger BC-VM10A\nMicro USB cable\nShoulder strap\nPower cord\nAccessory shoe cap",
