I am reviewing the small kitchen cart which was horrible. The cutting board was warped, the metal legs weren\u2019t straight, and one of the wheels didn\u2019t even touch the floor. A disaster honestly - so jankety! I had already had the cart for too long to return it by the time I put it together. Won\u2019t buy again. And this whole averaging star ratings for different products is BS. Amazon needs to stop this.",

The racks are not too high, which I like as I'm not too tall! They are sturdy and are holding up to daily use beautifully, were super easy to put together - didn't even require tools - and can be easily be taken apart and moved.

It is sturdy enough for storing all of my pots and pans, and the hooks are used for smaller fry pans and cooking utencils. It comes with extra stoppers for adjusting the racks. I purchased extra hooks so that the entire back row can hold all of my most-used items. I keep dry ingredients such as pasta and grains on the top rack in clear containers/jars. I have enough counter space to not have to use the cutting board, so that is where I keep my instant pot and rice cooker.",

What was great about this cart is that you can adjust the shelves to suit your needs. So I measured the height of the InstaPot and adjusted the shelves so it could get off my counter and fit on the bottom shelf of this cart. It was very easy to put together and another great thing is that the top is a real butcher block. Others I looked at were just a laminate. It also has wheels with two locking wheels so I can move it when I need to open my cupboard doors.",

      "text": "Very disappointed in the quality of this cart. It LOOKS great, but it's wobbly and the top does not fit squarely into the four upright poles. Also, threads on one of the two-piece legs aren't machines properly - probably the cause of the problems described above. Also, the slide-out shelf does not move freely. An identical looking cart purchased at Target about 5 years ago is far far superior in every way. Decided to take a chance on this one because of Prime membership and fast delivery. Wish I hadn't.",
