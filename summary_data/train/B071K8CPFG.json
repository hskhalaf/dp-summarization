My brother hung it over the top hinge and it worked perfectly!",

I got frustrated having to watch the door the entire time to make sure he didn\u2019t smash his fingers, so I bought these. They fit snug on the door, so I don\u2019t have to worry about them falling off. I put them up high enough where he can\u2019t reach them, and they have solved our problem. They are the easiest to take on and off, so when you do actually want to close the door you can remove it and slip it over the door handle.",

Provide a good one inch gap between the door and the jamb to protect those tiny fingers. You can locate then anywhere on the door edge and I would recommend mounting them above the toddler's reach. The Guards pull right off if you need to actually close a door and they are small enough not to take up much space on a shelf. They are so simple effective and easy to use that I highly recommend them.",

    "description": "As parents we know that baby and child proofing is important in ensuring the safety and well-being of our little ones. Small children, toddlers and crawling babies love to explore and their curiosity often lead them to objects, places, and rooms where they can get hurt. The doors in our homes are one of those objects that children often navigate to. A door that is allowed to close freely can cause painful finger pinch injuries and the force and weight of a door accidentally slamming shut can result in considerable damage to your child's small and delicate hands. - Avoiding painful finger pinch and jamming injuries - Stopping the door from slamming shut - Preventing children and pets from accidentally getting locked in room. Features: - Made from safe, non-toxic and environmentally friendly EVA foam - Soft and flexible C shape fits easily around any door - High quality and durable so it won't lose its form over time and slip off door - Conveniently store hanging around door knob or door handle when not in use - White color and simple design will blend into any d\u00e9cor style. To Install: OPTION 1: Place the Finger Pinch Guard around the outer edge of the door that's high enough up to be out of reach for children OPTION 2: Place the Finger Pinch Guard around the top of the door at least 6 inches from the outer edge. It is time to stop those slamming doors, accidental lock-ins, and painful finger injuries. Our customers love the door guard because it is a simple, effective, and high quality product that is easy to use. Lock in this limited time special price by buying yours TODAY!",

Similarly, pets can roam freely without getting stuck in a room because of a door closing behind them.",
      "Provides a soft cushion between the door and door frame. This prevents the door from slamming shut due to a breeze coming from an open window or a draft caused by an air conditioner.",
      "Simply place the Finger Pinch Guard on the outer edge of the door and that\u2019s high enough up to be out of reach for children. Alternatively, you can place the Finger Pinch Guard on the top of the door at least 6 inches from the outer edge. When not in use simply hang around the door know or door handle."
