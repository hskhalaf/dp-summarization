Its a little heavy for them to handle so someone sets it up for them when the occasion arises and its needed. One thing we discovered is that their screen door is about 3/16\" interferring with the top of this ramp. Since the screen door is a wood frame, we need to take it off the hinges and shave the bottom edge of the door down. Otherwise, this is a take out of the box and use. The no-skid surface is great too.",

Not enough angle especially on longer ramps. I'm not talking about step height or width but depth. It's basic geometry.",

Although the dimensions of the large ramp could be cumbersome, this is mitigated by creating a 'fold-up' design in which the actual dimensions are halved, allow for greater portability and usability. The is very sturdy comprised of excellent materials and manufacturing, The soldering points are neat and precise. There is no superfluous or messy solder. The edges of the ramp are smooth , the black tread is very neat, tight and safe These ramps are must-have items for those with mobility challenges.",

It is lightweight and with the handle it can easily be moved with one hand from location to location in the house to accommodate the different levels of our home. These are mostly door thresholds and elevation changes of around 5 inches. The best part was how much more comfortable she was as she was pushed along the ramp compared to how she felt in the past when we had to lift her in the wheelchair over these obstructions.",

The two welded support structures do not connect at the correct angle.

The distance of the teeter totter depends on your threshold height. The lower the threshold the more teeter.",
