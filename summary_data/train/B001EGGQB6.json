It has a rubber part to seal the tube you drink from so it will not leak in a bag. There is a little metal hook thing that is used to lock the lid in better to make sure it does not leak.

If hanging it around while hiking/moving, remember to lock! If the top is opened by mistake, spills are quick & huge. The top seals the spout but not the area around it.

Apparently the top contains a wring you can turn in order to count the number of times you've had a full 24 oz. of water, but the wring is pretty challenging to manipulate (for me at least).",

The lid flips up with a push of a button. The lid stays out of the way when drinking from the spout. When the bottle is being transported the locking mechanism is easy to apply. On the side is a tracker to help you remember how many times you have filled up the bottle. This is hard to slide over, however this feature isn't really important to us. If you are debating this buy don't hesitate. Very happy with this purchase and would buy again!",

I can drink one handed and keep the bottle closed in between - with no fumbling with slides or screw tops. I did notice, however, that after about a year the lid loses some of its tension and doesn't \"pop\" all the way open when the release button on the cap is pressed - but that is after a YEAR of consistent use.",

There is a little ring around the top to count how much water you drink--at first I didn't use it but lately trying to drink more water it has been helpful. Great bottle, easy to open with one hand. I use it at the gym, while driving, for work, everything. Bought it for around $11 here on Amazon--it's similarly priced in stores. Well worth it!",

After four months of use and a busy soccer season, only one became unusable after the metal clasp came off the lid. All of them have developed a faded and scratched look to them. We did put them to use and they were thrown in bags and on soccer fields. All in all a good water bottle.",
