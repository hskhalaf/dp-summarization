Since I bought the international version, I used in Peru, Southamerica, and now that I will get to send it back to the US where I bought it, the seller won't accept it or return any money nor offer a solution like changing it for another cellphone of the same price. Worst experience ever, I should have bought through E-BAY, they always guarantee customer satisfaction!",
