The glass is very thin. I am ordering a second one because it does make great cold brew. I will just not store it all put together anymore. I have edited my original review. The Kungroo company reached out to me. They are sending me a replacement for my broken cold brew maker. They have a 60 day replacement/refund policy. I explained what happened to my carafe. I was out of the 60 day refund so they offered to send me a replacement. I really appreciate this.",

Only drawback is shape which makes it hard to clean which lead to my breaking it since I was trying to get to the bottom and it slipped and tapped the edge of our sink/marble counter and now it is broken. Not a cool investment for this little time of use. Buy it again, no just based on how fragile it is. I've downgraded it since apparently the company reaches out to some customers who had bad experience but not all. Hmmm.",

Also you could run the coffee through a filter once you\u2019re done to remove any grime or remaining coffee grounds. Just FYI",
