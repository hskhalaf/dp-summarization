I specifically decided of these straps instead of one of the many similar ones available from other companies because it was declared to be \"durable cotton\". It also looked in the picture to be thick soft woven cotton that would be comfortable to use. When they arrived I was very disappointed to see \"polyester cotton\" on the packaging. The straps are thin and flimsy feeling. They work well enough that I will keep them because I don't want to deal with returning them. I don't appreciate the deception on the product description and I do not plan to order any other Reehut products.",

It's a basic strap but it works great. I think we could have easily gotten away with getting the 8ft strap instead, but having the extra 2ft of strap isn't bothersome. I also like the color, though that doesn't affect the functionality of the strap. Besides stretching your legs, the strap is also useful for stretching your arms (which is what I use it for).",
