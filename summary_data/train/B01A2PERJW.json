I have used other disposable warmers and while nice they often get so hot at the start they can almost burn your skin then they cool down an provide just minimal heat at the end. This unit starts immediately, is warm in just a few seconds, and is comfortable in your hand or pocket. A nice addition to your toolset for surviving the winters.",

I enjoy being active outside in cold weather, but I had been unable to find any gloves or mittens to keep my hands warm enough without impeding functionality. Carrying one of these and shifting occasionally between hands is more than enough. Often merely carrying it in my pocket raises body temperature enough to permit functionality with lighter weight gloves. I liked the first one so well that I bought a second one as backup and to share with my wife when she needs it.",

This warmer on the other hand got warmer quicker, have not even needed to use the higher setting, and stayed warm even with cold hands. I liked the little case (bag) that came with it.
