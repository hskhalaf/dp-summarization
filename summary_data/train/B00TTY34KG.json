I\u2019ve only used it once so far, but that\u2019s enough to get a gauge on its performance. I selected a simple cookie recipe with few ingredients and followed the directions, pouring ingredients into the bowl until the correct weight registered on the scale. I had to giggle the first couple of times the big checkbox popped up, letting me know that I\u2019d poured in just the right amount of sugar or cocoa (because I\u2019m a geek). I do plan to try adding some of my own recipes in the future.",

As a food scale the device works as expected, we just wished there was some kind of display on the scale versus having to be dependent on a smart phone or tablet to see measurements. We were surprised at how well the scale works in conjunction with the recipes provided in the app. We really enjoyed making pizza dough from scratch. We also have enjoyed trying the different recipes and wish there were more! Drop recently started allowing people to submit their own recipes so we are hoping more recipes will continue to flow.",

Second, the recipe app doesn't allow for adjustment of ingredients on the fly. I need to adjust for ingredients at the beginning if I don't have enough of something.

Easy to clean, the weight is right on it and not overly sensitive and this is a good upgrade to our old kitchen scale.",

      "text": "I've had this for a couple years. Biggest issue is you need to use their app. Which means you need to have your phone with you every time you want to measure something. Also, you are required to make an account. Which is all fine and dandy until you need measure something and for some reason the app needs you to re-login and you don't remember what your credentials were. Dear Drop, make the app work WITHOUT LOGGING IN! Being able to measure multiple items, like in a cake mix, might be a nice perk, but I've never actually used it for that. I just need a kitchen scale to weight things quickly, something this doesn't do.",

The scale is very easy to clean I mean I love it! We made hot chocolate kit mason jar mixes for Christmas gifts with it and they came out perfect each time because the measurements were so precise. The scale was sensitive enough to get a measurement precisely down. I like using one container for some recipes as it is better than having to clean multiple measuring cups! The only thing I would say is keep adding more recipes to the app because I love experimenting!",

I also use a lot to just weigh things with my iPhone and look forward to the release of an iPhone app so I don't always have to get my iPad out to make something. I also like that they have added recipes beyond just baked good and that there are a lot of gluten free and savory options!",
