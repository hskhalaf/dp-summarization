I got it b/c I liked my nexus 7, and thought this would be just like it, only bigger. sooo wrong. battery dead in 4-5 hours, takes 12 hrs or more to recharge. even discharges rapidly in sleep mode. loaded only one game, volume off, Bluetooth off, screen at minimum brightness--there is no hope for it. continues to discharge even if you try to play plugged into wall socket. so if you think you're going to spend a lazy day on the couch with this puppy, think again. colors beautiful, display crisp, navigation good, etc, but...battery is garbage. so glad amazon let me return it. buy a Samsung 4.",

If you are looking for overall quality at a good price, this is this tablet. The ppi on this thing is simple amazing for reading, video, or gaming. All this and cost less than the competition? I would give it six star if I can. Better than the competitions (as of today): *resolution 2560 x 1600 pixels *300 ppi *1080 HD camcorder *9000 mAh battery *No need for commercial lock screen *Pure Android with most recent OS update *Price **PRICE** **PRICE**",

I compared this to a Samsung tablet before buying as I have a Samsung phone, and what really drew me to the Nexus is it doesn't have all the Samsung useless software on it. My next phone may be a Nexus for that reason. I also get all the updates as soon as they are available because a 3rd party doesn't have to shoehorn them into their proprietary Android version.",

But this one is quick, has a GREAT resolution, is very intuitive, and has the best speakers that I've heard on any tablet. DEFINITELY got my money's worth. Sometimes the tablet struggles to connect to WiFi when we're out at new places, but that's rare. My only complaint is that Chrome doesn't have Ad Block for their tablet browser, but other than that, I'm very happy with this.",

The various apps for that work great and the tablet is a perfect size to serve as a digital comic platform. In addition this has largely replaced my laptop as the main portable movie/tv viewing device. It works amazingly well for that as well. As a casual user I 100% recommend this. Not entirely sure I'd actually recommend it as a primary computer though. I'm sure it would work fine, but it wouldn't be my first choice. It's not quite powerful enough for that.",

With a few simple tweaks navigation and typing with a large tablet is actually easier then my Nexus 7's.

      "text": "I was one of the first to get a Nexus 7 and loved it, but because of the small screen size, sometimes it was a little hard to read. Old eyes, y'know... So I decided to get a Nexus 10 and there have been some major improvements. Boots and loads programs much faster, battery life is greatly improved and the screen is nice and bright with the larger size making for easy reading. So now the spouse - whose eyes are better - has got the 7 and I'm very happy with my new tablet. There is simply no need to spend more money for Brand A just for the logo on the back.",

I got the shipping box, opened it up and found that the product box was beat up, seal was broken and taped up with packing tape. Don't take a chance, I saw a similar comment to this and thought it must have been a fluke. Not the case. FRAUD!!!!!",
