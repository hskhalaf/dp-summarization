Perhaps on an adult cat who has more room for the padding, it would be okay; but for the kitten, it severely hampers her movements because there's just too much bulk around her little shoulders. It's also very difficult to put on because it snaps under the belly instead of over the back, so she bites and scratches and fights while you're trying to fasten it. And then, once you get all that done, the exposed velcro sticks to the carpet when she falls over and makes her even madder because she can't get up. Not a very good design.",

I haven't tried to do that, but am very happy with this harness and leash for my cat.",

So now I have to cut off a huge flap of velcro from the neck, but the waist is fine. Just a heads up. Still seems like a sturdy harness, that will be hard to escape from of she gets spooked while outside.",

This harness is well made and fits comfortably on my cat. He hasn't escaped from it, but from reading some of the reviews cats are natural Houdini's. I have one tip for this.... Always make sure your cat is in front of you, not behind. When the cat or dog are behind the harness, they can pull on their body and slip out backwards from the harness. This the best one I've found yet.",

I have two cats, and initially purchased one harness...then decided to get another. One cat loves the harness, sits still while I get him geared up for outside time. The other hasn\u2019t had as much experience being outside so she did try to escape the harness after being spooked by a passing car. Thankfully, these harnesses are actually escape proof, so she wasn\u2019t able to wiggle free and run away in her panic.",

The velcro is wide and my cat is not getting out of this harness. I love the camo print, looks tough ! If you need to secure your cat while out of your home this will do the trick. Just don't tighten around the neck too tightly. Kitties need comfort because they are not used to being harnessed and leashed. Now getting them to comply going for a walk (not a drag) is all up too you.....",

The harness held up well (escape proof)! Unfortunately, my cat has a different opinion about the harness. He mostly takes 3 steps and lies down for 10 minutes, then walks for 3 more steps, and lies down again. When I adjust the harness to be very loose fitting on him (it would roll over to the side when he walked) he is happier but still he didn't do much more in terms of walking. Guess he's just opinionated about wearing it!",
