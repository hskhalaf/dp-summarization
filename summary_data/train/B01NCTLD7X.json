Sometimes I shower twice a day, and with other soaps I can feel the effects- especially in the winter, but not with this soap. The lavender is perfectly blended, and smells perfect and relaxing. I have dry, sensitive skin, and i needed a product free of chlorides, salts, and sulfates. I would defiantly recommend and I am reordering when I am out!! thanks again!!",
