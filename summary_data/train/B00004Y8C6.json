Manufacturing tolerances appear to be better than in the notorious Master Lock #3, so a picker can get predictable behavior. It has no security pins (just standard), which is to be expected for less-expensive locks. Security pins are generally serrated or spools, and they are designed to make life difficult for pickers. This probably makes no difference for practical applications, since thieves are lazy. They don't bother to learn lockpicking (fortunately), and I have never heard of a lock being picked by a thief.",

I could probably pull off the plastic or break it in half if I bend the key and base. The blue plastic surrounding the lock, is made aof an extremely thin and cheap material, that if dropped may shatter. The locking mechanism once locked isn't stable.
