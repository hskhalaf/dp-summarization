I need to keep one by my fridge and it's a very tight spot to store it in. This is the biggest stool I can use there simply because of how flat it folds down. (I've bought a couple in stores and had to return them because they didn't fit.) Though I am rather insulted by the price, I ended up getting them for closets throughout the house because I like them. So far none have broken, so hopefully it stays that way!",

When you're standing on this, your weight is using about 1/3 of the surface area of the step. Also, it's 16\" high. Unless you are 8 feet tall, you're going to have to put 100% of your body weight on one foot while you are lifting yourself up t get the other foot up. That puts even more stress on the plastic. If you weigh any more than 75lbs, it absolutely will break after a few uses. It's probably safe to use a stool to sit on.",

      "text": "My unit easily folds up just by lifting the middle of the top step up. Unfortunately, quick and easy folding seems likely to be part of why it feels unstable and likely to easily fail. I weight about 240lbs, so only about 80% of the max 300lbs rating. Moving around while standing on top of it, it feels a bit like taking a chance, but it works. I did worry slightly about it collapsing if if were bumped from the side or the weight on the top wasn't well distributed. If the pieces \"snapped\" into place, it would probably make me more confident about its design.",

Folds back up with a slight pull of the handle. Great for reaching top shelf of my closet. Easy to reach top shelves of all my cabinets. Even over fridge. So I would say a great little stool.",
