      "text": "I purchased this crock pot less than 4 months ago. The first couple of times I cooked with it & it worked great, but then it began cooking the food too quickly even on the low setting. Now unfortunately it's not getting my meals cooked on time at all. Whether I use the low or high setting even after 7 hours of cooking time food is not done. It's such a beautiful pot & I wanted so much to love it, but in this case looks by itself is not good enough. My family deserves better! Not sure what to do with it now:(",

If you want to cook chicken, it fits 6 or 7 chicken breasts or 12 thighs. Cooks perfectly! Be careful...it gets *very hot* on the outside! (The red metal)",

The ceramic dish got much hotter around the edges, so my food got brown and crunchy around the edges while the middle was just warm. The metal cooker part is super hot. The whole setup is so big, and so heavy, that it just didn't justify the space it takes. I returned it and ordered an insulated carrier for a 9x13 pan instead.",
