      "text": "Awesome Kit. You get alot for your money here. Nice materials. I used this for the first time today and now I realize why I could never retain my enemas with my other bucket. I have another basic bucket and basic hose but the liquid/coffee went too fast inside because it did not have the hose clamp that traps the liquid. It poured way too fast and I would immediately have to evacuate. My kit came with everything pictured with a nice detailed instruction book. That was a nice feature. So far so good. Glad I invested in this since the other one made me not want to do the coffee enema.",

The noozle goes in and out very effortlessly, almost without sensation, and the clap and 'twist flow adjuster' allow you to control water flow very accurately, and to slow it down to a trickle. Only downside is that its hard to monitor water levels in the bucket because the bucket needs to be elevated for the gravity feed to work, hence, you cannot glance in it without getting up.
