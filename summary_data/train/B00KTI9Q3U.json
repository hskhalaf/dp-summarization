    "description": "Size:180 Count (Pack of 1)| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingDo you know what is in your calcium supplement? Truth is, most common types of calcium supplements are calcium carbonate derived from limestone rock. They lack Vitamin K2 which is essential to direct calcium to the bones, where you need it most, not where you don't. Bone Strength Take Care is different. It\u2019s the #1-selling natural plant based calcium. New Chapter Calcium includes Vitamin K2 and fermented Vitamin D3 for a 3-in-1 complete formula that is essential for bone health, heart health and joint mobility.",
