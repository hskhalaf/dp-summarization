I'm really curious why they package the drivers on a CD though, for a PC that has no way of connecting to a CD drive unless you buy/have an external one. Since the drivers for the wifi adapter are on that very disc, you need to either have a second computer (with a disc drive) and usb drive handy, or a wired internet connection to download them yourself.",

I tried both Linux distributions and Windows, and in both cases the CPU would randomly hiccup. It's almost like it couldn't handle the load, you start doing something and you get micro-stutters / freezes. I was really surprised it was happening in Linux as well but if I went for another small PC like this I would likely go for an i5 minimum.",
