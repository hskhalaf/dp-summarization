This issue happened on my Razer Naga Trinity, as well, both within six months of purchase. If Razer doesn't address this issue in future models, I will never purchase one of these again.

Tracking is not what I have come to expect from Razer - I regularly have problems where the mouse will only move left and right or get stuck and not move Pros - I love the customize-able grip",

You would think with spending this kind of money on an item, it would be built to last. My last mouse a Microsoft 1000 laser mouse still works after years of use, and thank goodness I still had it while I ordered a new gaming mouse. I will never spend a dime on Razer products ever again. Overpriced and not worth it.",

Only thing I wish was different is I wish the two small buttons by the mouse wheel where to the left of the left mouse click like it is on the regular naga. It's a lil awkward trying to push those buttons without readjusting my hand since I use those for teamspeak so I have to push them often.",

Also the gaming mouse wont respawn at times and have to restart computer. Nice feel i got very used to the palm grip due to my small hands they also have claw grips for huge or large hands and classic grip for medium hand. Very easy to change the battery and grips. Overall great feel macros really easy to set hot keys are easy to use learned them in about 8 mins scrolling is very comfortable. Great for both wired and wireless gaming also awesome looking charging station.",
