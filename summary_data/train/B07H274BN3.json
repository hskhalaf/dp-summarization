I bought this unit solely because it had Birdseye satellite imagery....but found out that it is so cumbersome and limited in capability it's practically useless. The images are limited to 5 sq/miles; have to be downloaded via wifi; trying to download multiple images to cover an area that is not your \"current location\" is absolutely a pain; downloading a 5 sq/mile image took 20 minutes over wifi and the image is only 82MB!!!! More than likely I will be sending this back for a refund.",

Typing is a little tedious but thats with any device using directional arrows and enter keys to type, the trick i found best is write down what you want for each track saved then type it later in the apps like Basecamp which is an awesome mapping tool. Seller had this unit out the door the same day to me in time for my project with no delays!!!",
