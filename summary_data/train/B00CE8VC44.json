I came home to a small puddle behind the door. I've never had this problem before, and the puddle was right behind one of the clips, so it's easy to figure out what was the problem.",

They would have to be forced on the door, ruining the surface of the metal door and the paint on it.",

Not so positives: The clips are not very adjustable. Two of them are two big, and just sit on the floor under the door, while one of them fits fine and actually grips the bottom. The loose ones do not bend tighter, which is the problem. It's a door that doesn't open, so in our case, it doesn't matter, but it would if it were a door that opened.
