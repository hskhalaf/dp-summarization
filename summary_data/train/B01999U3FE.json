      "text": "I have used many styles shapes materials and sizes of bodysurfing handboards over the years. Mostly in SoCal and Hawaii (Oahu). Slyde is by far the best in all aspects - performance feel efficiency strap comfort durability adjustability. Customer service via email AND phone was outstanding when I contacted Slyde about product info, and part replacement when I lost a strap part (not their fault) bodysurfing a large break at Waimea. Slyde website is great with product info, as well tutorials advice on fins and wetsuits, and how-to videos. I\u2019ve been using the Slyde BULA with DaFins (great fins for bodysurfing). Planning to buy Slyde Phish handboard when they are back in stock.",

The deep concave really sticks you to the face of the wave and prevents sliding out when you are going mach 10 on a grinder. Board is perfect size for swimming with also. I also own the wedge and the hexflex. All the boards are sick and together are one sick quiver for any and all conditions. My kids love the boards too and have almost stolen the others from me.
