The other issue with the inflexibility is the HDMI connector seems to bend a bit since HDMI ports are on the TV. Hope the connector will hold up. Have 4 of them so is not an issue just with one cable. All are like it.",

High speed cables have become a necessity to satisfactorily pass picture/sound information between source and end product. And you don't need to spend a fortune to achieve satisfaction. I paired the purchase of these cables (sold as a pair) with the Eteckcity 4K HDMI Switcher. I can say unequivocally that I was very satisfied with my cable purchase. The length and build quality was exactly what I expected (and received). If you are in the market for high-speed HDMI cables, look no further than NTW. You (and your wallet) will be glad you did.",
