The sound quality is excellent, with clean highs and deep base. Pretty good for a set of headphone! They're amazingly comfortable with their around-ear design too. Also, and I didn't think I'd love this feature as much as I do, the \"LifeMix\" feature is amazing! Finally I can sit at my desk next to my wife watching YouTube/Netflix and also hear her if she asks me a question! The included charging dock is also great! All in all a great set of headphones!",

The amount of money that this thing cost is ridiculous considering the poor quality.",

The one major issue is the ANC is not even close to as good as Bose or the Sony mx3 but the sound quality is much better than either the 35's or the MX3s. Watching tv and movies is really incredible as the Dolby shines through. The real clincher is the bluetooth switching -- this is where all the other brands struggle and this is where the switching buttons make the difference. If either Sony or Bose offered this then I would recommend the MX3 over these but they don't so I won't!",

Too heavy and always sliding off everytime you look down. Ambient sound mode is too tinny and overly fake. Priceponit makes it not worth it. Compared to a Bose quiet comfort and it lost hands down. If it was $200 I probably wouldn't have returned them. Hopefully future generations are improved.",

I really like the life mix. It allows you to hear whats going on around you while listening to something through the headphones. I find I occasionally hit the touch controls by accident. Can be annoying. I would say the most annoying feature is the dock though. Several times I've placed the headphones in the dock only to discover they're not charged the next day. This is super frustrating. Overall, unless life mix is the killer feature for you, I wouldn't recommend.",

The lifemix is great, I can use the headphones and still able to carry on a conversation or hear if my son starts crying from his bedroom. Just can\u2019t walk around with the lifemix as it amplifies every noise of moving (clothes rubbing, headphones shifting etc) but I just tap over to noise cancelling or adjust the Lifemix down some.
