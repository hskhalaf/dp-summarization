Then I thought about Bingo and it was perfect! My 92 Year old grandma played and so did my three-year-old granddaughter. I'm not knocking technology but it was good to play something tactile that we remember while introducing it to the youngsters. We had plenty of game cards with bold letters and numbers we could decipher easily. The markers were a breeze to distribute and the basket worked properly. Perfect game for a perfect event at a perfect price. I'm so glad I purchased it.",
