The battery life is pretty good lasting over 10 hours with no problems. The charge time is pretty quick taking under 1 hour to fully charge from 0. Bluetooth is usually really solid, but had some occasional issues that was solved by getting closer to the source. I don't use the mic much but the mic sound quality isn't very good, given the increased distance compared to the QC20. Overall, very satisfied. Real life saver on airplanes, buses, and next to heavy snorers (add in some white noise and the snoring goes away).",

I am a man of average build, and I find it really hard to use the controls because of the short wires. I also agree with other reviewers that you should be able to plug in an audio cord so that you could use these with airline entertainment systems etc.",
