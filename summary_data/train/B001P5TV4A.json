      "text": "Our old phone system was gradually failing. The Uniden system seemed to fit our needs very well and the price was right. It installed easily and after some initial fumbling with the controls (different placement vs our previous Uniden phone system) it is doing everything expected from it. The one issue was the istructions included with the unit. The directions for set up of the answering machine were not complete or were for another Uniden phone. It was necessary to download the correct instructions from the Uniden website before we could correctly set up voice mail and remote access.",

The new 6.0 doesn't have a speed dial and programming phone numbers in it is totally different from my old 5.8!! It would've been nice if it programed the same way my 5.8 did!

    "description": "The DECT1580-3 cordless phone by Uniden is packed with time-saving features that help you better manage your calls. It features a large display screen and orange backlit keys which make it a snap to dial the correct number or access features, even in low-light conditions. The phonebook feature stores up to 70 names with an alphabetical search, unique ringers you can assign to specific calling parties and an option to transfer either a single listing or the entire phonebook. The bilingual menus in both English and Spanish guide you through every step so you can take full advantage of the 10 full hours of talk time per battery charge. Never miss a call with the digital answering system that has up to 14-minutes of recording time. The DECT1580-3 includes two extra handsets and chargers/cradles. About DECT Technology: Advanced DECT 6.0 technology, or Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications, operates on the newly released 1.9 GHz frequency band that was recently allocated to support cordless telephony. Uniden DECT 6.0 incorporates unique \"listen before transmit\" technology that avoids interference with many household products, such as baby monitors, microwaves and WiFi (which operate on frequencies like 2.4 GHz). As a result, DECT phones offer consumers enhanced voice clarity and crystal clear digital sound quality. DECT 6.0 technology also offers higher security and voice protection, as well as a longer battery and battery standby life than existing 2.4 GHZ or 5.8 GHz phones.",
