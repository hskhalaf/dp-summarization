I've included some pictures where they're cracked, have holes in the blocks, or have had their sides shaved down to where it's a weird angled block(not the square it's supposed to be). I'll probably go with traditional wood blocks and dish out a bit more for better quality. Oh well :/",

These were all good - I think I found one that was bad. Out of 100, that's pretty good I'd say.

I inspected all of the blocks for chips, splinters etc, before handing them over and I am happy to report that they are all fine. I think these will hold up for years to come.
