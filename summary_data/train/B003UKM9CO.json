Head replacement is simple and the change in vibration every 30 seconds to indicate time to change location in your mouth of cleaning is a nice touch. It's not a big deal but I wish it lasted longer on a charge. It lasts about 4 to 5 days on a charge which is about the same as my old toothbrush. I was hoping it might last longer.",

The Achilles heel of this product is its off/on button that is enclosed in rubber. Eventually that rubber cracks with just the pressure of a thumb turning it on or off. Mine cracked just under the button, probably because the rubber flexes more there. Once the crack is there the electronics inside are going to get wet. Then I got a RED flashing light for the first time! Time to replace it, same price here as Walmart.com ($41.97, on 2-23-17)",

After I got used to it, though, it's been great and I don't see myself spending another $250 on a fancier toothbrush. A great feature of this is that the replacement brush heads are way cheaper than other electronic toothbrushes.",
