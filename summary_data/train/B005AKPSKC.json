      "text": "Nice looking machine and very light. First thing I wanted to get rid of was the all red back lit keyboard. You can't so you better like red. Next was the slow 2,2 mghz cpu that you can't turbo. I updated the bios (easy) but no provision to over clock or turbo. Speakers are very weak. Had to crank the volume up to 90% to hear at normal volume. Works well with headphones, however I don't wear them that often. Over all I wasn't impressed considering that my 5 year old Alienware Laptop is as good if not better. Returned to Amazon the next day .",

Have only had a week but will probably send back. It just will not acquire a wifi signal and when gets a signal it will not stay connected. Very disappointed. From the description I thought it would be faster. Glad I am not trying to use it for games.",
