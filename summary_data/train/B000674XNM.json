      "text": "This is a great product if you are a fan of contouring. This powder doesn't settle in fine lines or leave a high glow. It creates the nice, almost white circles below the eyes without adding the weight that comes with foundation that can crease. It's ultra fine powder and pigment leaves a natural look that reflects light and hides wrinkles, leaving a nice contoured area above the cheek. I have switched from using highlighter and light foundation/concealer under my eyes to just using this powder. I love the effect! Well worth the price and will last a long time because the product goes a long way.",
