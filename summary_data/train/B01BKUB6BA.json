Garmin has been great about returning and replacing them, I'll give them credit. And other Garmin equipment I have is wonderful. But WTF? This watch is made for swimming! It has swimming apps from the factory. How could ordinary swimming hurt it, over and over? One Garmin guy said maybe it was sweat, or maybe chlorine. HTF could sweat or chlorine affect a watch made for swimming? WORTHLESS!",

A battery that doesn't last at least 24 hours makes the sleep tracking almost useless unless you charge the watch twice a day. I'm a big fan of Garmin watches, having owned many in the past and currently own a Fenix 5X myself. This Vivoactive HR watch however completely misses the mark.",

The screen on my vivoactive HR cracked last week rendering the touchscreen inoperable. I filed a warranty claim with Garmin and they're of the disposition that this is cosmetic damage, not functional damage. Touch screen doesn't work mind you. They'd like $120 to send me a refurbished unit. I think 50-60% of the purchase price on the first warranty claim is a con. For what they're asking, I could damn near buy a whole new unit. So why have a warranty on something when you're going to charge your customers damn near the purchase price to replace it?",

      "text": "This was a fine watch for my husband, but after only 15 months, the plastic connector between the band and the watch broke on one side. Not possible to fix in any way that we can tell, so we will have to purchase another watch. Very disappointed -- considering what this watch is designed for, one would think that they could create a connection that won't fail and render the watch useless. My forerunner 35 has a much more stable attachment for the watch band (I've had that watch for longer than the vivoactive).",

So if you want to do some heavy lifting with your data it just is not possible with the Garmin wrist products. If i could only get a CSV from Garmin I could turn this into a Ten star review",

Well after seeking to get it to reboot using the \"set to default\" button under system. Everything froze. Can't get it to turn on, even though fully charge. Not worth serving as a paper weight.

When the app is used, the built-in HR monitor must be turned off to get the HR reading from the chest strap.",

However, my biggest problem with this watch is something in the strap material causes a rash on my wrist if I continue to wear it after swimming even after I have cleaned & dried the strap!!!",

Its waterproofness is great, and it doesn't bother at night (misses recording naps).
