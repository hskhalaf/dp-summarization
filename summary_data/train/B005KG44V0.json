I wanted to get one asap so went to Target and bought the top of the line NetGear router (more than $100 more expensive). This was a disaster. Took over 5 hours with tech support (who were great) to finally get it working. After 2 days it stopped working again. It is simply too complicated. Stick with this one as it is very reliable, relatively easy to set up. The Tech support staff recommended this although I would have bought it anyway. The company continues to modernize this model, now on version 3 and offers very strong support. Highly recommended!",

Yes, the N900 is more expensive but it blows the others away. You get what you pay for.",
