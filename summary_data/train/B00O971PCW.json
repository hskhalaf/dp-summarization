I hate unnecessary logos and designs. This jacket is perfect. The large fits as it should. It looks good. This jacket can be used at work or any outdoor activities without looking out of place. I took a chance on this brand and price range (less than I normally spend). I am so glad I did. I just ordered a smaller one for my son after he approved mine.",
