      "text": "FINALLY!!! A liquid eye liner that dosen't fade! I've used both Kat's & Stilla's liquid eyeliner pens & both had their issues. Kat's pen dried up way to fast (after 1 month of 5-6 days a week usage). Stilla's faded by midday (working a service industry gig). Both faded/transfered in corner of my eye & wing. Tarte's Kitten hasn't failed me. Goes on smooth w/o tugging. Colour is blacker than the night, and it didn't fade in the inner eye corner or on the wing. Also the price is unbeatable..... Total score! \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udda4",
