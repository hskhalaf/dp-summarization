Holding it against the wall in a way where the holes are actually in the right spots relative to each other is impossible, because every individual part can flex into a weird position. It's simply two many parts, too loosely screwed together. We returned this and are ordering something else.",

      "text": "I love this pot rack and plan to buy a second one to install side-by-side my first one. It has a TON more space on it than I expected. I can easily fit every pot and half my pans. Having two shelves really makes this better than most of the pot racks I've owned in the past. It felt a little pricier than I'd hoped, but considering the fact that it's solid as a rock and will last a lifetime, I can't really complain. Definitely recommend!",

I cannot get into the low cabinets in my kitchen so this pot and pan rack is a Godsend. It's attractive and well-made. My friend who helped me put it up (it is a 2-person job) says that he thinks he will buy one.",

One of the wall screws sheared off in a stud. Pre drill like they recomend and you will be fine. I would prefer if the wall screws were black but not a deal breaker.",
