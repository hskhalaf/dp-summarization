Instantly put it together and throwing discs within 15 mins. It took longer to find a level spot than putting it together. Also something that I was pleasantly surprised about was the quality of the chains, they are heavy duty, just like on a course quality chains. So all in all this is a great basket for the money.",

When I don't feel like driving to my local course I set this up in the backyard for some field work. Mine seems to have a manufacturing defect where the threaded ends where bent slightly so the basket is slightly tipped. It didn't significantly affect usability so I didn't feel like going to the effort of seeking a replacement. For the money this is a great value and the color selection was a big factor in choosing this over the MVP version which is essentially the same exact product.",

Assembly is very quick and easy, which makes this great for moving around to different spots like we enjoy doing at local parks. One thing that is a con is that it is fairly heavy because of how awkward the shape is so I will probably be looking into a travel case for carrying it around from spot to spot eventually. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the game of disc golf.",
