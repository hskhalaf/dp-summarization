The base and topper are great, and I\u2019ve not had any issues when I use OTHER brands of nail polish. Even when I mix hydrocol with my regular polishes to create gel, it comes out perfectly. The problem is with their gel colors. The rest of the items included are great, and useful and make this set worth it overall. Just don\u2019t depend on their colors.",

The light is nice quality and definitely cures each layer in 30 seconds but I ran it in again to be safe cause this is my first time using it and wanted to be sure",
