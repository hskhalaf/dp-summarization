Obviously to fully enjoy these you need an Amazon Prim subscription (WELL worth the money and includes the Prime films/tv shows, free Prime next-day delivery etc) \u00a379.99 for the year I think it is now, a Netflix subscription (I think that is about \u00a36 a month??) and wi-fi to connect to. Everyone should absolutely have one of these....more than one if you can afford it ;)",

The display quality is also great on this kindle fire HD. For a small 7\" gadget it is amazing and runs very smoothly. I use this kindle throughout the week and will continue to do so until any technical faults, then I will definitely buy another. These are a lot cheaper than for example an iPad, yet almost do the same thing as one. I recommend this product to everyone.",

Nice design and I like the power and volume button at the back rather than on top. Mayday,very good idea and even I haven't used it yet,sure it helping people getting better faster support. I can watch Netflix and prime ,download some films when on holiday, Although,the films could be newer and the episode could be cheaper. I love reading my books,listening to my audible.

      "text": "I really liked my original Fire, so th 64gb HDX looked like a good purchase. It's one I really regret though as the screen is terrible - specifically it's got horrible blue bands round the edge due to the use of blue LEDs for backlight. In addition I had to return my first one as it had bright spots as well. Both had the blue bands. The issue is more noticeable on a light background,so shows when you read books and look at the web. It's not really noticeable when watching films or playing games. I like Fire OS so I've given two stars rather than one, but really, at price this is a shockingly bad product.",

Battery life has proven to be ok as most tablets android can equal or best this. There are exclusive help features, which is nice, but the restrictions on software are a pain, missing basic things like other browser availability and due to its desire to sell, sell sell, even basic flexible music and video (flexible)",

Marvellous, I thought, I can now hook up the kindle and have a much more compact unit. Except....you can't..... as the kindle isn't comparable ... There is NO tech reason for this and is something Amzon have engineered (as first gen models were able to do this). Otherwise it's adequate for the tasks required of it.

Sound is perfect and the mirror function was one of the decisive factors. I haven't tried yet but I am dying to display movies on my smart tv. Honestly, I don't use it beyond pure sheer entertainment or as a background companion when cleaning the house. However, it's brilliant and I love it!",

The only down from the Kindle 2 which I was using before is that the battery doesn't last as long, but that's obviously a consequence of it having all the other functions and facilities. With the Kindle 2 the battery would last for weeks, but it was only an e-reader. The internet access was experimental and thus very poor. The Fire has so many other functions including video, music, email, facebook, internet, etc. and I have been reading books and comics on it. Some limitations due to the tablet format, but on the whole a wonderful device.",

So far the kindle has fully lived up to my expectations I have read a few books already and found the pages much clearer than the kobo. I am also finding the tablet extremely useful as I can use it for all internet related activity rather than using my laptop. Lovely clear screen and excellent sound thoroughly recommend. Only downside is that the charge only lasts about a day as it works like a smartphone whereas the kobo would last all week but then it could only be used for reading.",

He's had this over a year now, he uses it daily, it has travelled abroad, is used in the bathroom (for music) and is often a near permanent fixture in his hand. He uses it for games, internet, music, films and Reading! The last was something beyond my hopes and expectations, but something that I am very happy about. I would definitely recommend a kindle fire.",

The only downside I can think of is that I will now be spending more money on books to read on my Kindle. Oh well.",

Haven't been disappointed with my decision. It's a great tablet and very useful for a quick web search or to look at mail (better than waiting ages for my laptop to boot up!). The only thing I have noticed is the lack of playback of some videos that require flash content - I've not worked out if it's possible to download something to address this. Otherwise a great device.",

The time taken to boot up is only about 45 seconds, probably because I haven't loaded it with apps but even so.

Device was very simple tablet, limited apps, dreadful screen, but the Wi-Fi was quick to load up and books downloaded quickly and it was light to hold. Amazon need too many personal details to set up Facebook, etc. There are much better, and cheaper, tablets out there. Very disappointed in Amazon.",

      "text": "During the 4 years I had this it worked well, but if the life span of this product is so short and kindle said to me that they only can guarantee a year without something going wrong, then I recommend buy a cheaper one. I could have brought 10 cheaper kindles for the price I paid. So go for cheaper models or buy another brand.",
