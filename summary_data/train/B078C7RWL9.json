I found the scent of the wipes kind of off-putting. They weren\u2019t as large or as moist as documented either. Nevertheless I suppose they will suffice if a person does not have access to water. I will see about adding some essential oils to help mask the smell. I gave the product 4-stars because the wipes provided a sufficient cleaning.",

They are nice and thick and I love that I can warm them before use (Mom always complained how \"cold\" the wipes were). They are larger, too, so they go farther than the baby wipes. They do cool quickly, and while the scent is okay, I don't love it. Those are the only reasons I don't give them 5 stars; they are definitely better than baby wipes, and I will be ordering them again!",
