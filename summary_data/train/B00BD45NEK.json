The extended hole that houses the kids handle bars point directly to the top of the rear tire of the adult bike. Any slightly uneven spot in the road. such as speed ramps, protruding sidewalks, etc. causes the kids hitched bike to drop a little and that is enough for the little extended portion of the handle bar hole to hit the rear tire of the adult bike in a very dangerous way. I am going to advocate a recall",

      "text": "Overall, this product served its purpose for my family's vacation which involved bike riding. Unfortunately, there is a major design flaw in that every time the primary (parent's) bicycle makes a turn, the attached component does not easily pivot, which causes the primary bicycle's seat to spin left and right with each turn. I have fiddled with lubricating the joints, and loosening the clasp, to no avail. Functionally, you can still pull your child around, but I would classify this as a significant nuisance since your seat will continuously rotate throughout your bike ride. As a result, I don't see myself getting much use out of this and would not recommend anyone making this purchase.",

While it's a little heavy, it's still very manageable. If the rider on the trailer is jerking around, you feel it quite a bit in the front, so that takes a little getting used to. My kids love that they can give me a \"power boost\" and help out with the ride. Truly one of our favorite family purchases.",

It's not heavy and maneuvers easily when towing with a standard road bike.

She even helps pedal which my husband says he can tell and it helps when she does :) I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking into purchasing.

Its also pretty easy to attach and detach from the bike. The only complaint is with its maneuverability. For the most part, its fine, but it does not like to make sharp turns. The hinge on the bike to trailer connection does not angle enough for sharp turns. Perhaps this is a safety feature? The result is that it will often turn my bike's seat post to an angle when I am making a sharp turn with the trailer attached.",
