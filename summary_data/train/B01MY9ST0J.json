We mailed a small 4X6 photo album from the dollar store to our 20 month old granddaughter to use as a sticker book and we mail a little note card with several stickers to her each week. She loves these little memories we're making together! So, we go through lots of stickers. This pkg is a fantastic bargain! I was concerned that the scents would be too strong but they're not at all. Each individual pkg has it's own scent . This grandma will definitely be buying more!",

I got them in April of this year, and they're still smelling great on my student's binders. (after 6 months!) I absolutely can't recommend them enough. I've tried other scented stickers, and these are miles ahead of all the others.",
