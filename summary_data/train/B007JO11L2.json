      "text": "instantly warm. i dont do a lot of layers, dont need them here, so this is an adequate fit. i really dont like the bright white logos on the cuffs, very tacky, will black them out with perm marker. hence 4 stars recovering from illness and i am 6ft tall and have a 49in waist and chest. this fits spot on with an undershirt and a polo - i bought the 3x size jacket. although not tested, this will have some water resistance. adjustable cuffs with velcro and some nice wind resistance. stylish and functional, good deep pockets, nice pocket on the chest too. very happy with this purchase and confident you will be too.",

I ordered this in men's small and found the torso/tummy area a little too roomy for my taste, also the sleeves are a slight bit long for me. So I reluctantly returned it. It would be great to wear on a casual evening out and I really liked its quality, however I chose a New Balance brand softshell jacket over this as it fit slightly better and felt warmer.",
