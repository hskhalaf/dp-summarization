They arrive without water so you have to add that to activate the gel. Follow the directions and you'll be set to go.

Someone turned off my power of my condo at the main breaker I was 300 miles away and could not do anything. When I got home and turned the power back on I checked my Freezer and everything was still frozen and in my refrigerator everything was still cool. I just had to throw a few things out but I attribute this to these Freeze Packs they are awesome. In my cooler they keep everything cool for the day and are still mostly frozen I throw them back into the freezer and they are back to 100% the next day.",

When yo I first get them you have to add water to them and then mix the mixture in the bag and then you have to squeeze out all the air. It can be a little tricky but well worth it.",

Especially if you have access to a freezer every couple days, there would be no need for ice at all. You do need to put a towel or something between them and anything you don't want frozen (fruit, sandwich meat, etc) but that's a great problem to have!",

I didn\u2019t read the directions, overfilled the first pouch with too much water, and had to pour some out. I got to see the space age gel first hand! Long story short, these were still colder than 32 at the end of the trip. There was still bagged ice in the cooler when we packed out. I attribute it to these things. They kept the cooler way colder than ever. Amazing product!",
