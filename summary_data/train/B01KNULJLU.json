Took puppy rappelling with me, I crisscross straps in the back and I turned pack around so puppy legs were agains me to make sure she was snug enough that there wasn't away for her to climb out. Love it, (but don't like that it doesn't have a latch to secure her in the pack). I had a different pack before she grew out of it, it had the safety factor of the latch. Everywhere I go, everyone ask where I got it. We personally like it. Just have to be careful she doesn't fall out. That's when I turn it around.",

You can wear it on the front or the back and it\u2019s super easy to adjust. I got the large size for my 11 pound rat terrier mix because she\u2019s pretty long! It fits her great. She seems so content in it and she was looking around at the scenery while on our adventure! We went a few miles even and she seemed comfortable and the straps were conftorable in me too. I\u2019m going to get so much use out of this and I totally recommend this product!",

So at first she was a bit iffy but now she's used to it..and might I add she looks friggen adorable in it .. shes a bit old, so she gets anxious when she's left home alone for hrs, and after a while she gets tired.. so this is perfect for when we go out for long hrs, for our long walks and she's also able to go food shopping with us.. definitely looking forward to creating more memories! We've gotten lots of compliments from people!",

She likes being up close to me and she does not swing when I bent into the handle bars. Best part is my knees do not strike the bottom of it every time I petal. And she is completely restrained and safe. And she loved it!!! Win win for both.",
