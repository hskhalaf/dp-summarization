Fortunately I have only had to use this twice, but both times I was shocked at how easy it worked! The handle is also very sturdy. I do wish it came with a container for it to sit on, but hopefully it won't be too hard to find one. I will be ordering more for each bathroom in the house.",

So you\u2019re working harder for 75% less compressed air. In addition, the aluminum handle may offer some benefit but overall feels flimsy. The hollowness feels like it could give if you really plunged hard. I\u2019d be more concerned with what caused the extra muscle power, however. Maybe no more Taco Bell.",

I did not rate the plunger very high for clean up, but the a characteristic of all plungers. The handle is metal and that cleans off much better than wood.",
