My boyfriend has a 5200 that's way older than my E310 and I couldn't believe how quiet it is. How is my unit newer and louder?! He can also make smoothies, nut cheeses, and nut butters without having to use liquid or as much liquid as me. New products should be improvements on older products.

The container shape is still narrow, even though its shorter, so some of the problems that others have had with the short fat containers are avoided. I'm still figuring out how to use the pulse button, or why its even there. I highly recommend this blender, and unlike other reviewers here I was not provided with a free product.

The base is very large and it would be better if it was smaller if able to without decreasing the power. If you are blending anything longer than a few minutes you can begin to smell the motor burning which is not a reassuring thing.",

I sent it back immediately and now am not sure if I would purchase a Vitamix again.",
