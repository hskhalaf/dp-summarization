The bad: 1) the waffle plates are not removable, for cleaning and, so far, with only one use, that's not a problem; the plates did easily wipe clean, 2) the unit takes about 5 minutes, to preheat, to operating temperature, 3) the provided electrical cord is short and needs an extension, unless you can get it within about 2 feet of a wall socket, 4) the outside of the waffle-making area gets very hot and 5) the unit takes almost a half hour, to cool, after being used.",

The cooking spray runs out the sides as they are turned, so that adds to the mess to clean up. But, the temp control seems to work just fine. We use 3 for regular waffles and 4 for chaffles.

My kids appreciate the fact that it can cook 2 waffles at a time (although they can still eat waffles faster than I can cook them - I'm unsure that there's a waffle iron out there than can match their appetites). Waffles do not stick to the grates, and the surface is easy to clean. I highly recommend this waffle iron.",

It seems like the best option on the market as of early 2020, even though there are much more expensive brands, like All Clad. One tiny quibble... the included recipe book has very time-consuming recipes and the results, though delicious, aren't appreciably better than some easy commercial mixes.",
