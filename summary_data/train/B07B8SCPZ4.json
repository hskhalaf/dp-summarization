The space was less than 100 sq. ft. This little unit takes all the humidity out of the space that has a cinderblock wall that seems to always be damp. As if that wasn't enough, it smells fresh and clean even though we just painted it with Drylock which stinks everything up. The size is PERFECT, it performs AMAZING, it is QUIET, EFFICIENT and WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY! Don't hesitate to purchase this product. I am AMAZED and you will be too!! DON'T HESITATE!!! BUY IT!!!",

Normally you would not need to remove the cannister when using the hose but since I had it installed on an unlevel surface, the cannister filled up and shut down the unit. I have since found that when I leveled out the unit that it drained through the hose and not into the cannister. Also, the provided hose is subject to kinking which prevents water flow.",

      "text": "Makes a difference! Easy to find a place for it and handy to being able to dump. we did receive a good length of tubing for being able to have drainage if we wanted. The place we have it does not allow for that. The pull out box at bottom of unit is easy to pull out and I use the water for my plants. Anyone looking for a small unit to assist with moisture levels this is it.",

      "text": "I bought this product to dehumidify a small space. Everything worked well at first, and I emptied the reservoir several times over three days' use. However, on the fourth day, I emptied the reservoir in the evening, and left it running, trusting to the auto cutoff to work. When I checked it the next morning, the unit was off and the reservoir was full. \"Working as intended,\" I thought. I emptied the reservoir, put it back in, and pressed the \"on\" button. No response. Tried a different outlet. No response. Do not recommend. It's a complete waste of money. Will not buy this brand again.",

I\u2019m shocked at how well it\u2019s worked. It\u2019s small, light weight, and very quiet. I only run it at night and could probably go 3-4 days before needed to empty it. I dump it every day, though since it\u2019s so easy.",
