This was the first time I really ever had very rough, hard heels and 'old' looking feet; so bad, I didn't even want to have a pedicure or wear sandals. Anyway, these foot peels were super easy to use and boy are they effective. It was the fourth day that my feet began to peel - very strange! Totally painless. The new skin coming through was very soft, like new. I would totally recommend. My sister and mother have requested their boxes.",

A word of advice, do NOT try to expedite the peeling by pulling and plucking at the skin. If the loose pieces of skin are uncomfortable and/or annoying, use nail clippers to snip them close to the part of skin still attached to your foot. Do not use force to remove any bits that haven\u2019t fallen off.",

      "text": "I have awful feet with very thick calloused skin on my heels and balls on my feet. IV can't even put.on pantyhose without the skin on my heels snagging and running the nylon. Good thing I prefer hunting boots to high heels. These worked well and in about 5 days my feet were peeling nicely. It definitely helped and made a noticeable improvement. I've used twice so far and will use them again. It doesn't peel in huge sheets like some people want you to believe, but some large pieces of shin come off. They are cheaper than the other popular brand, and work as well.",

My feet took a while to start peeling (like a full seven days), but I didn\u2019t follow directions (I have no way to \u2018soak\u2019 my feet other than in a shower). Once they started to peel, I wore socks to keep the dead skin from showing up everywhere on our walk-to-wall carpeting. I can\u2019t wait to use the second set included in this! My feet look and feel great! FYI, it is virtually impossible not to help peel off the dead skin yourself. Try to resist this as much as possible, although I think it will be futile....",
