The biggest plus for me is the timer on the remote. Now I can fall asleep to candle light. Excellent!",

I cannot afford Luminara, but I do have one I bought on clearance and I love it. I bought these because I needed a candle to put in an outside lantern that wouldn't melt and would operate on a timer. These candles fill the bill and more. I was actually amazed at how realistic they are. The flame moves and dances just like a real candle. I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. I hope they last a long time.",

I have the largest candle under a glass dome with blue bird eggs surrounding the candle on a terra cotta base. Very attractive, and this can, of course, be changed for holidays or whatever strikes your fancy. There is a remote control, and very easy to use. Recommended. prisrob 02-27-18",

The candle cut outs are shallow so the flame is visible from any angle in the room, not the case with most of the others out there. These are the best designed flameless candles all around. You will be very happy with these candles, they are truly a 5 star purchase.",

Compared to Luminar they are 1/3 the price, work as well and the mechanism that the little flame moves on is silver rather than Luminar white. They are smooth plastic rather than wax coated I believe. Neither look real up close, and I especially like that the top of the candle edge dips down as if having melted when the Luminar do not. Oddly enough, I have 3 brands and the remotes are interchangeable.",

The brightness adjuster made the candle light flick and the off button makes the candle light still. So sad the remote does not work because that\u2019s the sole reason I got these candles. will not be purchasing from this seller again",

They are NOT wax, which to me, is a great benefit because they won't melt during shipping if you live in a hot climate, and you can use them indoors or outdoors. The timer gets about 15 minutes off on just one candle, but all of the rest have worked flawlessly.",
