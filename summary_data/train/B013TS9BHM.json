This oil does a much better job in removing makeup than any other product I have used. I was getting around 1-2 acne every week or so before I started using this product. I have not had any more breakout since the day I started using the oil. I really cannot believe it. The 4 cysts I had at the time I started the oil are also healing and going away. I am going to update my progress in a few month, but definitely going to order another bottle when this one runs out.",
