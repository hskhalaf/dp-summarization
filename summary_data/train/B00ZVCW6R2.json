I run a lot so it's crucial I have the best shoes which some believe will cost a lot i.e. $200. From just trying them on when they arrived I knew they were awesome. I tried them out at first on the treadmill and then took them out on the road for the full test. Feels so good running in these as they fit perfectly. I will definitely be buying again when the time comes.",

They are super lightweight, super soft uppers so that you feel like you're wearing a pair of socks only. And the sole is very soft and absorbs impact, so that even after walking around all day in these shoes, my feet feel fine. They also fit my narrow foot whereas most shoes are too wide. Perfect shoe for me. They look great too in my opinion.",
