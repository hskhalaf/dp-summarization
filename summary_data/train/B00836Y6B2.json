The cellphone has some features locked to work just with AT&T and not unlocked as i Buy it. I dont return it because i live outside the states and is not that easy to me to return it. The other thing is that they dont give me a solution, that should be a software issue. They call me one month ago, when i wrote a negative review and ask me to delete it that they were going to work on it. After I delete the feedback i haven't received any information about my problem or whats happening.",

About the hardware: It is an amazing device, in this range of prices you would not find anything better. I am using it in Costa Rica with Kolbi operator and it works like a charm! 100% recomended!",

The instruction booklet looked like the printer att had used ran out of ink. you cannot read either book. It has online instructions to compensate for that. I am satisfied with the phone itself, just not the way it was shipped. We are a rural area here and it works better to use USPS. Steve Stinson",
