He destroyed it quickly and I was very disappointed. After reading other reviews with similar issues, I decided to order one more. This one was just like the original and much more durable! I'm not sure why this company sent 2 different types of material for the same frisbee...I'm just glad I finally got a good one.",

Since it's a soft flexible rubber material, it's heavier than any other we've used, it seems to fly better into the wind, which helps keep it in the air longer. Very easy to clean - another plus.",
