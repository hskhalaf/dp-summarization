I would recommend this to everyone.",

I was taught to apply this serum in downward strokes. Upward strokes make your pores stand up just the way upward strokes make your hairs stand up. Use a teeny tiny bit, just half a pump is plenty. It took 3 weeks to work for me but I finally look like a normal person. You can get free samples at Sephora so you can try it out.",

As soon as I applied it, I noticed a major different in my complexion, in that it appeared to be practically poreless! Unbelievable.
