Honestly, our dog loves the food and his stools have never been more solid, however $70+ for a measly 18lb bag of food is a huge slap in the face as a customer. I can understand a slight price increase for it being organic, but jumping from a 25lb bag ($50) to a 18lb bag ($70+) is just ridiculous. We will be looking for other options in the near future if the price does not come down on this brand.",

And the niche dog food brands that say they are \"human grade\"? Well, that really doesn't mean much if it's not organic, because so much of our conventional human food is awash in chemicals and antibiotics. So we finally switched to the Organix line of dry and canned food (which we supplement with cooked grass-fed beef and our own chickens). Yes, it's really expensive, but we feel much better about feeding our dogs organically. It's just so much healthier for them.",
