It basically looked like Mike Tyson had this ladder in the ring up to round 8. This ladder may have been in better shape when it got delivered to my house if it was shot out of a scud missile launcher. And then ran over by a M1 Abrams. Other than that it was a good experience. I Refused to sign for it and sent it back where it will probably end up in a scrap yard. Even then the scrapyard may even refuse it and just send it to a landfill.",

A little heavy, but fiberglass ladders will be. I felt safer on this ladder rather than the regular aluminum ladder we have.",
