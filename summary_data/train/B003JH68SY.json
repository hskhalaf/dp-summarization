In addition, the back floor mat was one single piece to be trimmed down, rather than the pictured two, individual mats. Finally, the mats did not have the WeatherTech brand or logo imprinted anywhere, indicating that these were either knock-offs in hopes that someone wouldn't notice, or a genuine shipping error. I initiated a return today and will order direct from WeatherTech. Please see the attached photos for reference.",

I had to let them sit out for a bit to straighten back out. 2. The Auger anchors that came for the driver's side where very cheap and would not bite through the carpet to hold them in place.
