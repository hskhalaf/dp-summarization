There were scuffs on the surface, and some of the lettering had rubbed off. I would have returned it, but I stupidly threw away the packaging, and the package slip, before I got a good look at the ball - a mistake I will never make again. Ultimately, I decided to keep it. It is not new, as was advertised, but it is in decent shape.",

      "text": "This cricket ball has been fantastic Here's my list to simplify everything down Me and my mates go play cricket at our local park here in NY We don't have time for a full t20 match so we play t10 or 10 overs each. The ball for the 20 overs has held up incredibly well and it's easy to bowl. The stitching is good and hasn't torn. The polish after a few overs starts coming off but that's normal. In general I have to say it has held up incredibly well. There isn't much more to say So thanks for reading and if this review helped you out, please hit the helpful button!! Have a wonderful day !!",
