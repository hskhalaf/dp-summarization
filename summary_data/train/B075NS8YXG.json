The lights do not what so ever create enough light for even ambiance! Each bulb equates to what a fire fly would look like ! Extremely over priced !!!!!

Comparing them to the strings of lights they replace; the bulbs are plastic, not glass, the lights are as bright or even brighter than the bulbs they replaced, the wiring is lightweight and black, the previous wiring was slightly heavier and brown, (my wife didn\u2019t like the brown wiring on the black iron fence), the replacement doesn\u2019t require a timer, and finally the lights don\u2019t use electricity since they are solar! Technology is great, when the right company uses it.",

They went well over 10 hours in one test we did. The light is just right, not faint, not bright. It's a very nice touch to have some lighting come once the sun goes down.",

I\u2019m amazed that on occasion I\u2019ll wake up at 3am and the lights are still on. I just bought another string for my front yard and front walkway as it gets zero light and is pitch black at night. I was able to place the solar panel in an amazing sun location and now I feel very safe approaching my front door.",

They came on as soon as it was dark and emitted a soft glow that was bright enough to light up the camping area. And... they stayed on all night! Every time she came out of the tent in the middle of the night they were on. What a relief to have light when it's so dark without having to light a lantern.",

Positioning of the solar panels took two adjustments after we realized one panel wasn\u2019t catching enough sun. Measure your space completely.
