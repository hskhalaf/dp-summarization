Four batteries a week is not cheap over the long run and I really expected the batteries to last longer than a week. I do not use the keyboard daily and I have tried to see if battery life is increased if I turn them both off when I am done using them and it didn't. I also tried different brands of batteries to see if the batteries were the problem and no matter what brand I bought a week is all they last.",

Each keystroke bottoms out and is quote audible; not the gentle click many of you may be used to. Update: Keyboard still works great, however the wheel on the mouse no longer works. I contacted the seller BisonOffice, they have a 7 day return policy and basically told me to go away. They do not stand behind their products, I would never purchase from BisonOffice again. In my opinion they should replace the item or return my money and work with Adesso to get their money back.",

I bought my keyboard and then within a few weeks some keys stopped working. I got a replacement from Amazon. It worked when I used on it on rare occasion but then the receiver broke. Two keyboards broke in less than two months under very occasional use I tried getting Adesso to fix and they are completely unresponsive. I'm looking into buying another USB receiver but then I have to pour more money into this thing. Right now I just have a keyboard and mouse that don't work. Save yourself the hassle and buy something else.",

When I tried to remove it, part of it stuck in the USB port. I just hope this piece of junk didn't ruin the USB Port on my computer. I won't give it a third chance, that's for sure. I will suck it up and order the expensive Microsoft version of the ergonomic keyboard.",
