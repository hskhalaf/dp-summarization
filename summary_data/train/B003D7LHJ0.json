RAYOVAC Rechargeable Plus Batteries last up to four times as long as alkaline batteries, and twice as long as standard RAYOVAC rechargeable batteries. Use these powerful batteries time and time again to keep disposable batteries out of landfills and more money in your pocket. Recommended for high drain devices. RAYOVAC Recharge Plus batteries come pre-charged and ready to use. Lasts longer on one charge than RAYOVAC Recharge Batteries.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRayovac Platinum nickel metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries are the most economical battery solution for high-drain devices like digital cameras, portable video games, kids toys and wireless gaming accessories.\n\nTHE LATEST RECHARGEABLE TECHNOLOGY\n\n\nView larger.\n\nLow Self Discharge: These NiMH batteries have improved charge retention. With Low Self Discharge, the batteries are able to retain 70% to 80% of their full charge at 6 months and 50% to 60% at 12 months. Low Self Discharge batteries are ready when you are! If you have fully charged the batteries but left them in a device, such as a digital camera, or are storing them in a drawer, they will still have 70% to 80% of their full charge after 6 months! Non Low Self Discharge batteries, also called \"Standard\" NiMH batteries, can only hold 20% of their full charge capacity after 12 months.\n\nPre-Charged: Rayovac Platinum Rechargeable batteries come pre-charged and ready to use right out of the package. No need to charge them first!\n\nCycle Life: Rayovac Platinum Rechargeable batteries can be re-charged and re-used over 300 times.

Rayovac Platinum NiMH rechargeable batteries can be recharged at any state of discharge without harming the performance of the battery.\n\n\n\n\n\nRAYOVAC NIMH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES MAKE AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SMART CHOICE.\nREDUCE WASTE\nThey can be charged and reused up to 500 times, producing far less waste than disposable alkaline or lithium.\n\nNO TOXIC CHEMICALS\nThey do not contain the toxic chemicals that are found in older Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) Rechargeables.\n\nRECYCLABLE\nRayovac has partnered with Call2Recycle, giving consumers the ability to recycle NiMH batteries for FREE. There are 30,000 drop-off sites available at municipalities and retailers. Drop-off site locations can be found by calling 1-800-8-BATTERY or visiting http://www.call2recycle.org.\n\n\n\n\n\nRayovac Platinum NiMH Rechargeable Batteries are available in AA, AAA, C, D and 9V sizes.\n\nTwo chargers are also available, a 5 hour charger for AA and AAA and an overnight charger for AA,AAA, C, D and 9V battery sizes.\n\n PACKAGING\nRayovac Platinum offers a 100% paper package (made with 80% recycled content) on its rechargeable batteries.",
