These lights look amazing and no one is getting up close and personal with them to check if they are real brass or painted. I love them and have received so many compliments. The cords do straighten out from the weight of the bulb after a day or so. Very pleased and highly recommend!",

The cord is adjustable so you can make it longer or shorter. The cord isn\u2019t 100% straight but I\u2019m a perfectionist and it doesn\u2019t bother me. Our previous light had 6 bulbs so this does make it seem darker in here but I think that\u2019s just because I\u2019m used to it brighter. We got the bulb at Lowe\u2019s.",

The top of this light/base was attached at the top of a 14 foot ceiling but still had enough extension to hang down in a reasonable mannor. The cords continue to straighten out. I think these pieces might be one of the most beautiful parts of the house. So far....extremely happy.",
