But what has really impressed lots of outdoor junkies is the quality craftsmanship behind every pair.There are truly so many things to love about this shoe, including its stylish design and protective features. However, as some hikers find it, it isn't suited for long hikes or challenging terrains. In such cases, you are better off with a more rugged hiking boot.",

      "text": "Nice slip on moc by Ariat. I like the neutral heel, which isn't common for most Ariat boots. I find them a tad small for a men's 10M. I didn't realise this until I wore them a few times, so too late to return them. As long as I wear no socks, I can use them for shoveling snow or mowing the grass. If you have a narrow foot, they seem ok, but they run small. Wouldn't recommend for hiking . They have too pointed of a toe box & a long day of hiking or trail walking will cause blisters . They do offer great mind foot support & the sole is good quality though",
