I'm not going to spend more money to let them decide if they are going to repair damage done at the factory. My more in depth review was rejected by Amazon so this simple one will have to do.

I didn't think it'd be much of an issue but with this odd hump and a very straight up and down final edge to every pan and pot, any hopes I had for sliding out food onto a plate would be challenging at best with this setup.

Note, had to return the set ordered through an Amazon supplier as they sent us the wrong set. Ended up getting the set through Crate and Barrel cheaper and with two bonus Calphalon items with a value of over $100. Check C&B online for deal.",
