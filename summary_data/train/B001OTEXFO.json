So the rubber seal on the lid on the Engel is a welcome plus. On the other hand, it's not completely clear to me that the Engel has any insulation between its walls either (the double walls in the sides and lid can flex inward quite a bit), and it remains to be seen if the Engel will last as long (20 years, I think) as our Playmate.",
