The fabric feels like every other cheap yoga pants brand you can get at any store. Same with the fit. The black pair makes every booty look good. This one does nothing. It looks horrible. The color isn't even really what it was in the picture. It's still a comfortable pair BUT not for that price. As I've said, I can get this kind of pair at F21 for $15.",
