Overall though, it feels like a pretty sturdy, solid couch.",

However, we plan on purchasing wood ones from Lowe's. Comfort we would definitely give it about a 7/8. All you need are some extra throw pillows for the arms. Would definitely buy again for this price - Sidenote the exact same couch is at big lots for $200 more!?!",

I've had this couch for less than 6 months and for awhile already I have been dealing with issues where the cushions are flattened and you sink into the couch.

This type of wear has occurred in such a short period of time and that is with me living by myself so its use has been relatively limited. Aside from the wear, the arm rest seem flimsy and start cracking with relatively pressure applied to them. It would also be nice if the couch was a little deeper.",
