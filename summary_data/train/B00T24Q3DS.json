These aren't \"compression\" style bags like one of the Eagle Creek line, but you can get a bit of compression by stuffing them pretty tightly. They have high quality zippers and they're made out of a tough, but still lightweight, nylon material. All in all, it was a good purchase and I would recommend these to others.",

I probably own about 20 sets in various sizes (and yes, between travel, RV's, packing my daughter's college clothing between seasons and semesters, I use them ALL) I have some sets that are probably 10-12 years old and they still look brand new. I can't say enough about them. I've never been disappointed or had something go wrong with them. Excellent product, highly recommend.",

      "text": "Love them!! I always tend to over-pack and had a very small suitcase (22 inches) this time. I used all the bags and was able to fill them easily (using the KonMari folding method from Marie Kondo's two books). As others have said, they act as little \"drawers\" during the trip and are very neat when opening and closing the suitcase. Only thing I would suggest to the company -make the six-piece set in 6 colors to make it easier to find items. I plan to tie on colorful ribbons - easy to do with the mesh tops.",

Overall, I would recommend this product. As for the dealer, everything arrived quickly and properly packaged. No complaints about service at all.",

Also the smaller eBags are great for keeping similar items together such as medications or undergarments.",

Even my husband noticed how neat everything was, and let's face it, he's a guy, and doesn't really care about the tidiness of the suitcase. Plus, our large suitcase ended up being 4 lbs overweight and instead of having to dig around for stuff to pull out, I just moved one of the smaller cubes to my carry on. DONE! Buy these now!",
