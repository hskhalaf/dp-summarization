It's a simple no frill device, no screen to scratch, and has all the functions i wanted (waterproof, changeable battery, message notifications even though it's inconsistent, and vibrating alarm. Unfortunately, the software is still immature. The battery status is ALWAYS \"Full\". the only way to know the battery is out is when the band won't sync. I bought this on march 5, 2017. the band was replaced once under warranty because it no longer sync. no reason provided by tech support that i can remember. the second band finally died a few days ago right after the 4th battery change from water leakage.",

Measures my exercise accurately, and my sleep as well. More importantly to me, I contacted their customer service department about a broken clasp, they were very polite, and extremely responsive, replacing it no charge very quickly. I also asked about a syncing issue, responded in a timely manner again. Very very happy.",

The only thing I am disappointed in, so far, is the app. It seems that Jawbone has more of a user friendly app, and is more customizable in terms of tracking workouts and syncing to other apps/devices.",

Also, it prevents me from monitoring my sleep. When the product works, it's great. Its lack of reliability makes it a very unsatisfactory product.",

It also vibrates at random times during the day - not the reminder to be active and also not a notification since I have those turned off. It's comfortable to wear and a good solution if you don't want a watch, I'm just questioning some of the functionality here.",

Such a bummer. The main reason I bought the Misfit Ray was because of the battery life feature. I was loving it so much and am now so disappointed. I'm hoping these were just crummy batteries, but that also sucks that something that states it comes is sent with sub-par or old batteries.",

Ray\u2019s clean lines create a form that is as much about fashion as it is about function. Wear it stacked with a smart Watch and cuff, or Customize it to your style - it features hidden 8-mm spring bars that allow it to be worn with almost any standard accessory, including Watch bands, bracelets, or necklaces.",
