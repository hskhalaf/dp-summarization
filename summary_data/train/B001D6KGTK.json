You can only cap a bottle if you have bottle caps - make sure you buy those as they are NOT included. Super easy to use. Just place one of your separately purchased bottle caps into the slot of the bottle capper that has a magnet end and then place over your bottle - also NOT included. Simply squeeze the handles together and bam, your bottle is now capped.",

      "text": "I like this capper because it's not finicky capping different bottles (champagne, sparkling wine, Martinellis, etc). If you're capping bottles other than easy big lipped beer bottles, you just need to use a little finesse (don't try to bring the capper ends all the way down) to make sure the cap is securely sealed. These cappers are quite versatile, but they will wear out after a few years of regular use. Also, you can break it if you try to force this capper all the way down on champagne/Martinellis/sparkling wine bottles. I would recommend using a small amount of silicon grease on the inside of the capping bell before bottling; less problems with sticking.",

Not much chance of gluing it in place, so now I'm investigating if it can be disassembled and a new part installed, though it appears that would require removing rivets.
