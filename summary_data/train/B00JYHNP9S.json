I also noticed that one of my lids has a dent in the metal part so it will not seat on the pans. I am very disappointed at this point. I expected for this cookware to be a much better quality.",

One note, handles will still be too hot to touch if it comes out of the oven even with the rubber. I knocked down one star because I have found that the coating on the outside of the pots is not extremely durable and has a handful of seemingly permanent marks (scratched of burners, some staining, etc).",
