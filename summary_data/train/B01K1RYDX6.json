This raised it up around 1/4 of an inch and the plate then fitted perfectly in the triangle slots. Now it works great. They most likely forgot to insert a spacer in the brown triangular thing at the factory. Anyway, it's fixed.",

      "text": "I often use a microwave in the kitchen without turning on the lights, generally to just warm up a drink while passing through. It's inconvenient to turn on lights so you can see all the buttons on a microwave with many options set up with light touch buttons. This unit is of good quality, and a short spin of one knob gets you cooking. Power levels are adjustable, and the size is fine for most kitchen tasks. The unit is not LOUD, but it's more than a gentle hum. I would but it again, though, since knob-based microwave ovens are hard to find.",
