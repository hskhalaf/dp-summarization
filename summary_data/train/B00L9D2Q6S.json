I received them and I am totally pleased with the quality of these pearls! The are well-matched and very lustrous. I got the 18-inch strand, and it hits just right where it should, at the collarbone. I plan to eventually purchase matching earrings and a bracelet from The Pearl Source. The quality to value/cost of the necklace is outstanding. The box it came in was \"meh\"...not bad, not great, but I have no complaints at all - I feel I got what I paid for, and then some!",
