It gave my shots more contrast, darkens the highlights to the point where I can use the image and of course, see through reflections. As a polarizer, it does what most polarizers do, I definitely would recommend this filter! Highlights: - Tiffen helps with maintaining the sharpness - Blocks reflections - Ups the contrasts in your shots and reduces highlights",

These same problems go for my other Tiffen filter as well. There are cheaper brands with better glass that don't attract dust. Then adjusting the filter will tend to dismount it from the lens as well. It works okay so it's still a usable filter, but I've been feeling let down from my Tiffen filters as I start exploring other brands.",

This also comes quite in handy if you want to shoot with a wide aperture on a bright sunny day, because it automatically lowers the amount of light reaching your camera by a few stops.

It's not bad, and so far hasn't ruined any images - the flare is in line with bright light sources so it fits the look.

      "text": "I have been using filters for years and had many Tiffen filters with no complaints, in fact my last review was 5 stars. The last filter I bough for my Sony A6000 a 40.5mm CPL is a useless piece of junk, I am even more upset cause half of my pictures are all bad beyond saving. The filter causes asymmetric lighting over the image, it causes vignetting and in many cases the images are just too dark. Instead of bringing up the colors the filter almost washes out the colors. I took over 500 pics on my last trip about half are total garbage. I will never buy Tiffen again I will pay more money but get something better.",

I do get the sense that a better polarizer would have a stronger effect, but I'm actually VERY happy with the pictures I get with this, so I'm not complaining. Overall great for the price.
