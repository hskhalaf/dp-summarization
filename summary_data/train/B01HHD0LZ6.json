      "text": "Very nice product!! Took about 15 minutes to assemble. Did a great job aerating the lawn I feel. I walked through about 1000sq ft. Of newer lawn I planted a year ago. It seems the ground was having a hard time with drainage and some fungus was growing. I think the shoes helped the ground to breathe a little better. Still too early to really tell but I feel it is helped. I suggest putting the shoes on and taking them off while you are standing on the grass. I also suggest using them after it has rained when the ground is soft.",

Be sure it\u2019s on secure, you don\u2019t want it to loosen up to much and feel the other end. But once you have the straps, in right order and with lock lever right comfortable position to adjust, works great. I do run a lot but even after using this, I felt and nice little work out feel on my calves when I was done. For price, its great.",

I got my order quickly, it's excellent quality, and I would definitely buy from this seller again!",
