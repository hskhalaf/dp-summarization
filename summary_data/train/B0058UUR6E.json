My latest acquisition, two 24\" ASUS VS248H-P monitors, replaced my single VE278Q. I'm not a high-end gamer and don't need a 144Hz beast. However, I do need lots of real estate to comfortable work in Visio and simultaneously flip through a zillion Chrome tabs. The monitors have only been up for a few hours, but I'm finding it very easy to keep everything in sight. I'm very pleased with my purchase and will continue to buy ASUS monitors in the future!",

Everything looks fantastic in 1080p on this monitor and I use it daily - never had any issues so far. It was also fairly easy to calibrate, the out of box calibrations were good, and I used some tools to sharpen everything a bit (everything is SO clear and the colors POP!). I absolutely love it and the 1ms response time is great for online gaming. Will continue to use this brand for any monitors I need.",

The color fades to strange colors on one of them occasionally, and I have to reboot it to clear it up. I'm concerned that this indicates something that may prematurely fail. I live abroad, and it's hard to get things, very hard to return them, and thus there is no option for me, realistically, other than to wait for it to fail and get an other pair. Other than that defect, these are great monitors. If you live where you could return one if this happens, I'd recommend them",

This screen is great and works, however there is a blurry/smudged/greyed look to it compared to the PA248Q which ruins color quality. I am currently looking to replace this with a better color quality monitor. UPDATE: Through color calibration and some graphics card software settings I have managed to get the colors to not be so bad. It still doesn't look as good as the PA248Q, but better than the picture shows.",

The only issue is that they will not automatically recognize that the input is HDMI so you have to make the selection via the button on the monitor, and you have to slightly press and hold the button to get the selection mode. Good video quality, decent size, reasonable price point.",

I personally like to have all the same monitors, and these did the trick. They are not too expensive, nor are they extremely cheap. Be wary though, these screens will tear if you are running games at over 60FPS. I have to 980ti's in my computer and that is way overkill. A simple GTX 970 will do these monitors wonders",

After removing the stands and installing the VESA hardware i had the perfect triple monitor setup...not! Take the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this item with a grain of salt. Massive color shift in two out of two units even when viewed dead-on. In a multiple monitor set-up like mine it's just maddening. The images tell the story. TL;DR If you are buying a monitor for the computer in the spare bedroom, it'll do...maybe. ASUS is there anything I can do here...I'd really like to avoid the time wasting dismantling process?",
