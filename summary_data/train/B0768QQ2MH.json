It\u2019s frothy, creamy, full of flavor and better than Starbucks!!!! Even though each cup\u2019s cost breaks down to about a dollar each, I don\u2019t have the need to ever order Starbucks again for that \u201cgourmet\u201d or \u201cspecial\u201d feeling!!! And I save about $4 a day! The machine is easy peezy too! You don\u2019t have to do anything but push the button. This one my all time finds!!!! If you love coffee/cappuccino you will absolutely love these pods and the Nespresso machine that makes it.",

I found this one at Home Goods. 7\u201d x 8\u201d x 9\u201d comfortably holds 66 pods. The Caffeine & Quarantine mug was purchased on Amazon through an Etsy artist. (May 2020)",

There's no store close to me so I send them in, which is free and Nespresso provides the bags for free also.",
