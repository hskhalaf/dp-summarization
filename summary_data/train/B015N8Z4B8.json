It only took a couple times of sticking a treat all the way in the back for her to learn to lift the support to scoot in on her own. The bed is nicely plush and the inside gets very warm. The only down side is that it 'sheds' a bit at first. The faux sheep fur material on the inside portion pills up. We've had the bed about a month and the shedding seemed to have stopped after a couple weeks. Definitely nothing to keep you from getting it. This is perfect for our dog for the Colorado winters.
