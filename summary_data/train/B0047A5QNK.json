Since my product is refurbished, I have an issue that the monitor shuts off sometimes in the middle of watching something. I think it is to prevent overheating, even though the monitor doesn't get hot. Some other small issues are that the touch screen buttons are a little too sensitive to touch, there is no remote control, and no speakers on this unit. Overall, I am very happy. The display is very crisp and colorful. Great resolution on the screen.",

The only down side of this monitor is the buttons, they are a little cumbersome but once you get all your settings done you don't have to play with them again so not a huge deal breaker. Performance is a 10 out of 10.",

Unlike other/older versions, it does tilt. Has DVI and HDMI ports. I've only used the DVI as that is the output from my MacBook Pro, but it looks great. Had it for 4 months now and no dead pixels. As long and you wake your computer up before turning the monitor on so that there is signal output, it recognizes the input right away. If not then having to scroll through the inputs manually is pretty annoying. I highly recommend this monitor.",
