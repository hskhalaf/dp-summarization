So, this camera I purchased works great. I have done my homework looking for new digital camera's and tried 10 megapixels and it still did not take as good as pictures as this Sony 5 mega Pix camera. The screen on the back is hard to see and the zoom isn't all that great but the picture quality is excellent. Here's a tip, buy a large capacity memory stick about 4GB and the pictures will come out clearer. Not sure why but they do.",

I had thought that I could abandon it after I bought this new DSC. But, I still need the old one. There are other complaints too. The memory chip is quite expensive - you know only Sony uses it.

We have to power down then power up again to take another picture. This has been happening more and more and we've only had the camera less than 2 months. We've tried reformatting the stick several times to no avail. Not sure what to do next. But the problem with the memory aside, it's a fantastic camera. Just hope there's a way around this problem.",

      "text": "I bought this camera for my wife as a Christmas present in Dec 2004. This camera is so cool. At first I was very unsure about the purchase of this camera with all the negative reviews. But once I got the camera and READ THE MANUAL, this camera takes pictures I can't believe! The pictures are crisp and clear! I was very scared about the reviews on blurry pictures... If you hold the button halfway before you shoot the camera auto focus kicks in! I don't understand all the negative reviews on this camera...It is all it is worked up to be and more! I'm very, very happy!!!!!!!",

If you can accept the trade-offs and want the ultimate in portability this unit is great. I wasn't interested in the video when I got it. I'm so impressed I want a bigger MS so I can do more. Picture quality is fair-good depending on lighting. It's not for art, it's for photos.",

    "title": "Sony Cybershot DSC-T1 5MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom",
    "description": "This Sony Cybershot digital camera features 5.1 megapixel effective super HAD CCD; 3x optical and 2x digital zoom; 2.5\" 211K pixels hybrid LCD color screen; 10-second self-timer; MSG-M32A memory stick duo media; MPEG VX fine movie mode and much more. Includes AC adapter/in-camera charger; Cyber-shot station; AV cable; USB cable; memory stick duo adapter; wrist strap; software CD-ROM. Made in USA. 2-3/8Wx3-5/8Lx4/5H\".\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer The high-end camera that fits in the back of your pocket. Sony's DSC-T1 features a huge 5-megapixel resolution, 3X Optical Zoom, and a 2.5\" Hybrid LCD Monitor, all in a package the size of a credit card. The T1 even packs extra features you would normally expect on a camera twice its size, such as a high-quality Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens, Sony's high-speed Real Image Processor, 5 Area Multi-Point Focus. It is even able to capture full screen VGA (640x 480) video at an astounding 30 frames per second. It's twice the camera at half the size.\n\n Features\n\n * The DSC-T1's super-sized 2.5-inch Hybrid LCD Monitor is much larger than the 1.5-inch displays common to other cameras in its class. (See detail)\n * 1/2.35\" 5.0 Megapixel Effective Super HAD CCD: Super HAD (Hole Accumulation Diode) CCDs provide excellent image quality by allowing more light to pass to each pixel, increasing sensitivity and reducing noise. \n * Compact Slim Body: The ultra-compact and thin size of the DSC-T1 makes it the perfect camera to tuck in a pocket or purse for high-quality, high resolution photos almost anywhere. \n * USB Cradle: The included Cyber-shot Station allows for easy connectivity for charging the camera, as well as transferring and viewing images either to the computer or on your television. \n * 3X Optical/2X Digital: 3X Optical Zoom helps you frame your shots for better digital pictures. And Sony's Precision Digital Zoom provides an additional 2X magnification without the jagged edges of other designs, resulting in smoother images. \n * 0 - 4X Smart Zoom Feature (at VGA Resolution): Smart Zoom intelligently uses the full CCD to let you zoom into the portion of interest by cropping the image size--thus avoiding the image degradation of Digital Zooms. \n * Continuous Auto Focus: To maintain accurate focus lock with fast moving subjects, Continuous AF keeps focusing from the time the camera is turned on until the moment of exposure, providing properly focused images even when your subject is moving. \n * Memory Stick Duo Media: Digital. Powerful. Transportable. Memory Stick Duo media is compact, portable and rugged--connects to a variety of hardware and software applications (may require use of supplied MSAC-M2 adapter). \n * 14-Bit DXP A/D Conversion: Sony's 14-bit Digital EXtended Processor captures the range between highlight and shadow with up to 16,384 values, for extended dynamic contrast and detail. \n * Pre-Flash Metering: With a momentary pre-flash, the camera illuminates the subject and sets exposure through the lens for accurate flash metering. Adjustable flash level and red-eye reduction ensure great flash shots. \n * Auto Daylight Synchro Fill Flash: When the Multi-Pattern Measuring system determines the subject is backlit or in shadow, the Daylight Fill Flash automatically fires to provide optimum exposure of both your subject and the background. \n * Multi-Burst Mode: Captures 16 consecutive 320 x 240 frames as part of a single 1280 x 960 image which plays back sequentially in the camera or as a single image on your computer. Selectable 1/7.5, 1/15 or 1/30 second frame intervals provide convenient motion analysis.\n\n About Sony technology:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens: The Vario Tessar lens is specially produced for very compact cameras. This specialized design allows quick autofocus, appealing zoom range while still maintaining a compact design. Magnifying Glass Mode: When shooting a close subject (within 1cm) the image on the LCD is enlarged over 3X for better detail and focusing controls. 2.5\" Hybrid LCD Monitor: High resolution 211K pixel design helps provide excellent viewing and image playback clarity. The Hybrid system consists of a transmissive LCD combined with a reflective LCD. By turning off the LCD backlight, it will capture more ambient light virtually eliminating \"wash-out.\" Images will be visible in the LCD even in the most challenging outdoor lighting conditions. MPEG Movie VX Fine Mode: Captures VGA (640 x 480) high frame rate (up to 30 frames per second) audio/video clips with length limited only by the capacity of the media. Video mail mode captures smaller file sizes suitable for email. 3 Area Multi-Point Auto Focus: By evaluating 3 separate focus areas of the frame, Sony's Multi-point AF system can intelligently focus on the subject and avoid mistakenly focusing on the background. AF (Auto Focus) Illuminator: Briefly lighting the scene in low- or no-light conditions, AF Illuminator insures a positive focus lock, allowing you to accurately establish and maintain focus in difficult situations. Multi-Pattern Measuring: Independently light-metering 49 points of the frame, Multi-Pattern measuring establishes the optimum exposure value, even in scenes where pronounced highlight and shadow are not centered in the frame. Slow Shutter Noise Reduction: This process captures the scene in two exposures. The second subtracts the noise pattern from the initial shot, resulting in a final beautiful photograph that is virtually noise-free.
