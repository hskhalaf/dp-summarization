I'm plus sized (18-20) and found it didn't sit around my waist well and my son would kind of slide into the gap between the pillow and my body. I haven't had either of those issues with the My Brest Friend. The buckle keeps in snug to my waist and makes it feel very secure. It's also very easy to release one handed. The pillow portion is firm, but soft, so it's very supportive for my newborn without feeling too hard. The cover is very easy to unzip to wash and super easy to get back on. This is my favorite breastfeeding accessory!",

So glad! My belly was really tender after giving birth and I hadn't realized how much the baby's weight made me uncomfortable. This improved that so much and took away the need for extra pillows.

I used a Boppy for my son while breastfeeding and I always felt as if he would roll down when I fed him. Since this pillow is flat, you don\u2019t have that issue. It\u2019s easy to get comfortable and situate the baby into a position when she remains while feeding. The back strap really does provide back support while feeding and helps you to keep your posture while feeding i stead of slumping over.",

The buckle & wraparound design make this pillow much more secure & high up on your abdomen, which promotes a better latch.

It also doesn't solve the problem of getting the baby at the right height.

      "text": "Best baby item purchase so far! My infant insists on being walked around when nursing, and this pillow has been a life saver. Instead of having to carry her weight for 20 minutes, she lays on the pillow and I just support her head/back. It gives me the ability to free an arm to be able to do things around the house. This is so much better than boppy pillows that get away from you. The only thing I\u2019d like better is if the strap was Velcro instead of buckled, because the thinner end sometimes slips up or down and has to be adjusted while I\u2019m walking around.",

Cover is machine washable. It fits to you and you don't have to worry about it shifting and readjusting while you're feeding your little one. The back support is nice as well. It keeps you from slouching to help position your baby correctly. Just a tip: you'll still need to put a small pillow or folded blanket underneath to make sure your baby is at the proper height to breast. But who doesn't have an extra cushion to spare?",

She was so happy to have something that actually supported her needs during nursing. when she fed our daughter, she actually got an amazing feeding, and it was half the time it usually took for her to do it. thank you thank you thank you. Forget about the boppy, this is so much better. You will not regret getting this.",

My newborn is 2 weeks old and couldnt nurse so I\u2019d have to pump around the clock and felt like a dairy cow cause I was so sick and it was exhausting. I got the boppy pillow but it kept slipping away while Im holding my baby and felt so dangerous. This straps on and wont slip and lets me hold the baby at the right angle. She couldnt latch but latched within the first try of using this! That means I was hold her wrong all this time. Thank you whoever invented this!",

My 6-week early son didn't latch too well but this pillow helped me focus on him and his position and what he needed versus my stamina or a moving pillow or anything like that. Adjustable strap means the pillow doesn't move so neither does the support when you're 20 minutes in and would otherwise be having to adjust a different pillow. The cover material is a bit thin, though this is of little consequence as it is removable and machine washable. Additionally I would protect the material under my kid by placing a burp cloth under his head which kept everything clean.",

    "description": "Color:FireworksBreastfeeding can be one of the most challenging routines a new mother faces. Many women stop nursing due to trouble with latching, not knowing that proper positioning might make all the difference. A lot of new moms consult with lactation specialists only after becoming exasperated and exhausted, feeling they should instinctively know how to breastfeed their own baby, and not understanding why they\u2019re having trouble. This My Brest Friend pillow is designed to give moms the confidence they need to feel secure and position them for breastfeeding success. My Brest Friend is here to help alleviate some of these stresses and demystify what many new mothers and fathers experience during those first precious months of your newborn baby\u2019s life.\nEnjoy The Support You\u2019ve Been Looking For\nDiscover the solution in the Original Nursing Pillow. After years of thorough research and real-life testing, it is specifically designed to make breastfeeding more comfortable. Its supportive backrest encourages good posture during breastfeeding and prevents neck and shoulder strain, too. Also great at minimizing strain at the elbows and wrists, so you can focus all your attention on your little one.\nInnovative Shape Keeps Baby Close\nMy Brest Friend boasts a unique shape and is the only pillow that fits snuggly against the wearer, eliminating the gap that most crescent-shaped nursing pillows have. This is especially important to facilitate proper latching for consistent feedings. Keep baby safe and sound and held securely in place on our firm and flat pillow throughout the entire nursing session.\nDesigned Just For You\nKeep all your maternity supplies and accessories easily within reach in the super-convenient side pocket. Store extra bottles, nipple cream or even your smartphone to avoid getting up in the middle of nursing and disrupting baby.\nWrap around design provides welcome support to your weary back and sore shoulders. My Brest Friend Original Nursing Pillow surrounds your body for the ideal position for baby. Clever silent-release straps lets you slip away quietly when your newborn nods off and unlatches without waking the babe.\nMy Brest Friend strives to provide new mothers with the most intuitive and useful maternity products on the market. We are proud to be among the most preferred brands for lactation consultants and mothers alike and keep the comfort of mother and child at the forefront of everything we create.\nPopular Positions for Nursing\nFootball: Mom puts her arm under her baby and supports them using her palm on their back and to support their head. Lay them down on a pillow next to you with their head at the end pointing down toward your feet, then put your arm underneath them and bring them up to your breast with their nose in line with the nipple, holding them similar to the way you would a football. Cradle: Your baby will be on its back horizontally and resting comfortably. If you\u2019re feeding from the left breast, its head will rest in the crook of that same arm. The rest of your arm will be under the baby\u2019s back and you\u2019ll need to make sure that its spine, neck and head are fully supported while its nose is in line with the nipple from which they are feeding. Relax & Snuggle: Mom can lay on her side propped up with pillows behind her and the baby is laid on their side next to her at her breast, using the breastfeeding pillow to keep them in place. Bring your arm over your head to cradle your baby\u2019s head and make sure it is properly placed at your breast as they feed.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe My Brest Friend nursing pillow is the perfect support pillow for proper latch-on and breastfeeding in comfort and security.
