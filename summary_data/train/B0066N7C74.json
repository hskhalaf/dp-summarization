I don't know what is wrong but I know it won't close. One time when I was trying to get it to work, it closed suddenly and almost caught my hand. I believe the open/close controls are poorly designed.",

Highly suggest cutting the 2 white safety straps off then take the y-shaped plastic cover off the middle sliding support beam and practice raising and lowering the stand to see how the cable actuated (via the red lever) release mechanisms work. Do this before you attach your saw. To lower the stand, you need to lift up an inch or two using the black handle to allow the metal catches to disengage and then guide the saw down (depressing the red lever the whole time obviously).",

Generally, the more complicated something is the higher chance it will fail somewhere down the road. So far it has been great, so time will tell. The material support arms are decent but they seem to lack the rigidity of other models. They seem to sag a bit as you extend them out and put weight on the ends. The assisted lifting is nice but not super smooth, it requires some getting use to. By far my favorite feature is the stand's ability to 'stand' vertically WITH the miter saw mounted, allowing you to store it neatly away.",

One critic I do have is that the instructions say to \"use the included tool\" to tighten screws, but NO tool was included. Be aware that there is some assembly, but the critical parts are already assembled, so you basically attach the handle, the lower leg, and the wheels. Dewalt generally is a reliable product, but looks like someone slipped up either in not including the tool, or leaving in the instructions that one is provided.",

I had to use a metric thread tap to clear/re-tap the threads before assembly. 2. It is heavy. With a saw mounted you are hauling well over 100 lbs. This can be a lot to lift into a vehicle or take up and down stairs. Otherwise, this thing is great!",

Second, one of the telescoping arms was bent so badly on the end that it would not sure slot in until I filed it down.

Stabile when using without any other help, due to weight of stand and saw it is very stable.
