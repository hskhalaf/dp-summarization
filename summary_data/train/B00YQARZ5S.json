We order radek one and downloaded the software on a Saturday and called the company for assistance and they called back right away. They explained how to use the equipment and read the data and it turned out my boyfriend was reading higher levels than the hospital prepared us for so we adjusted our routine and kept our distance . I feel like we'd be running blind without it and it's great to know what the Exact readings in our home are . Excellent support / great device .",
