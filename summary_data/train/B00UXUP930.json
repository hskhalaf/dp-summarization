It's flimsy with a shape on the pick up end that makes it impossible to slide under a flat item, like a magazine or piece of mail, to pick it up. The claws also tend to pass each other because the alignment is so loose. There is also a small hard nub on the corner of the handle that pokes the side of your hand when you are trying to use it. I have used other light grabbers, so the \"featherweight\" is no excuse. This is poorly made and pretty useless. Spend a little more and get something that works.",

Luckily, I haven't needed this product as frequently as others might, but I'm going to return it if I can. Again, truly a disappointing product.",
