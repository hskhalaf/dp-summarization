      "text": "This thing is freaking awesome. Well engineered with decent material. Not metal parts but reasonably strong plastic. The instructions are very clear but it will take hours to construct. I would guess 4 hours of solid concentration. Let the kid start it with you, put him to bed, have some beer and finish it. Mechanically, my one gripe is the spindle gear (pictured) has a lot of play in it. It feels cheap when you operate it. Still, I would easily place this at the $75 price point. Follow the instructions drink the beer and wake up when your kid does so you can modulate the enthusiasm. It is still plastic after all.",

The brakes also do not work very well and I think i'll need to add some adhesive to make them work better. The kit had some very nice and detailed parts that were well engineered and fairly easy to assemble. Despite the good directions this kit took me about 2 or 3 hours to assemble. I wish they color coded the parts in the instructions. It would have made finding the right part a bit easier. Really a shame the one piston (maybe most important) didn't fit.",

It took about eight evenings to get this thing assembled. At the end, we never could get the claw or the suction cup to work correctly; it kept sticking open. The other joints worked well. The boys were impressed with the hydraulic magic involved, and were able to make fixes, tube refills and so forth on their own.",

    "description": "Color:Hydraulic Arm Edge KitRobotic arm technology just got a little more interesting with hydro-mechanically fun. With Hydraulic Arm Edge, you will command six axes of varied movements: the gripper to open and close up to 1.89 inches, wrist rotation of 180 degrees, wrist mobility of 98 degrees, elbow range of 44 degrees, base rotation of 270 degrees, and shoulder motion of 45 degrees. With a vertical reach of 16.35 inches, horizontal reach of 12.42 inches, and lifting capacity of 50g, your robotic friend is ready for your genius to erupt. With the removal of the gripper, you can activate the suction apparatus. This feature enables the user to elevate objects with a larger surface area (like a small mobile phone). Another prodigious attribution is a braking system that is integrated in the lever controllers to execute all commands accurately. WOW! How does this equate to fun? Your children will have total command and manipulation using the science principles of a Hydraulic system and its application. Easy to follow instructions with detailed graphic illustrations pave the way for successful and satisfying kit building. Compliment your engineering, math, science, and technology (STEM) learning strategy. No battery or motor required. It is powered by water; thus, the \"Hydraulic\" significance and how it manipulates axes movement via lever controllers. - For more than 3 decades, OWI continues its pursuit to satisfy educational instructors and the most discriminating parents. Hydraulic Arm Edge is recommended for ages 10 and up, but with its 229 assembly parts, it will challenge the beginner engineering enthusiasts.",
