Stunning pictures that were crisp. It is not SLR quality but for $200 I was extremely pleased. Great camera that with a 32GB card and max resolution set allowed over 10,000 pictures to be on one card-amazing. 30X optical zoom with IS was surprisingly effective and also blew me away. I really warmed up to this camera in short order plus it is small and easy to use. I do miss having a viewfinder but not a big deal in the end. Recommended!",

The Canon photos were of amazingly poor quality compared to the 5S. I was actually shocked by the difference. If you want a point and shoot and aren't picky about getting a sharp photo this camera is easy to use. I like the grip on the side. Just don't expect to print this larger than 4x6.",

Also, the lens cap is separate, instead of just shutting off the camera, you have to put the lens cap off and on every time you go to use it. The photos seem to come out brighter. I'm not happy with 50% of the shots. It's a disappointment after my last powershot.",

Tried using an early digital Nikon (mistake!), and after several years, thought to try again, returning to the brand that I love, Canon. I would give this product 5 stars except for the fact that the instructions are only available on CD ... there's no booklet. Being a confirmed luddite, not have pages to turn, a familiar way of reading by index, the information about the camera is frustrating for me. What I have learned so far (and my learning has slowed considerably due to my reluctance), is that this was indeed a good buy.",

With a 35mm film equivalent focal length that extends all the way from 24mm to 720mm, your shooting reach is superb: you'll capture telephoto shots with detail like never before. The Wide-Angle Lens gives your images a distinctive sweep and grandeur, capturing landscapes, cityscapes, tall buildings and wide groups of people with ease. Genuine Canon optics help ensure that your images are resonant with the clarity and brilliance made possible by Canon's decades of industry leadership in optical technology.\n\nEXPERIENCE THE IMAGING POWER OF THE CANON HS SYSTEM\n12.1 MEGAPIXEL HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nThe PowerShot SX510 HS camera employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.\n\nCANON DIGIC 4 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nCanon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC Image Processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in high levels of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, Full HD video and Face Detection Self-timer. More powerful noise reduction algorithms also provide improved low-light capture.\n\nTHE CANON HS SYSTEM\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC 4 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot SX510 HS camera incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity, while the DIGIC 4 Image Processor enables an ISO range of ISO 80\u20133200. The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur.\n\nMEMORABLE MOMENTS IN SPECTACULAR FULL HD\nCANON FULL HD VIDEO ADVANTAGE\nIn addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor in the PowerShot SX510 HS camera makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24* frames per second, the PowerShot SX510 HS can also shoot 720p HD video at 30** frames per second.\n\n*Actual frame rate is 23.976 fps.\n**Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\n\nDEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON, WIND FILTER FEATURE AND OPTICAL ZOOM FOR EASY VIDEO CAPTURE\nIt's never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot SX510 HS camera has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. There is no need to go through layers of menus or operate switches or dials to switch to and from video recording mode. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The PowerShot SX510 HS also incorporates an electronic wind filter, which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. And unlike less sophisticated point-and-shoot cameras, the PowerShot SX510 HS lets you use the full range of optical zoom when you're shooting a video.\n\nHDTV PLAYBACK VIA HDMI OUTPUT AND CEC\nIt's easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot SX510 HS camera. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable. And because the PowerShot SX510 HS supports HDMI-CEC technology, you'll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TV's remote control. (CEC \u2013 Consumer Electronic Control \u2013 is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS AND VIDEOS\nSMART AUTO\nThe PowerShot SX510 HS camera features Smart AUTO: sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture, whether you're shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\nFASTER FOCUS HELPS YOU CAPTURE EVERY SHOT\nHIGH SPEED AF\nThe PowerShot SX510 HS camera is equipped with Canon's latest advancements in autofocus (AF) technology. Canon's newly-developed AF achieves a significant increase in speed for a shooting experience that's spontaneous and natural. The remarkably responsive High Speed AF lets you capture great shots as they happen, with reduced lag time.\n\nSeveral engineering breakthroughs contributed to this major enhancement to speed. In addition to improved AF algorithms, the camera can process multiple sequences simultaneously, and takes advantage of reworked controls between AF and the start of shooting.\n\nSUPER TELEPHOTO SHOOTING MADE EASY\nZOOM FRAMING ASSIST WITH SEEK FUNCTION AND ENHANCED AUTOMATIC ZOOM\nWith its 30x Optical Zoom lens, the PowerShot SX510 HS camera has the telephoto reach to capture subjects a long distance away. At maximum telephoto, however, it can be challenging to track a moving subject. The Zoom Framing Assist seek function makes it much easier to use the camera's powerful zoom lens. When you press and hold the Zoom Framing Assist function button, the camera will automatically zoom out to include a wider angle of view, enabling you to more easily locate your moving subject. Once you find it, releasing the button will cause the lens to return to its original zoom position, intelligently keeping the subject in focus until you're ready to shoot and capture the perfect close-up moment. You can even make zoom adjustments while the button is pressed, with an animated assist frame that makes viewing easy. When the button is released, the lens will return to the adjusted zoom position. And enhanced Zoom Framing Assist keeps your subject's face the same size in your frame no matter how they move. Tap the Zoom Framing Assist function button to detect your subject's face. As your subject retreats and advances the camera automatically zooms in and out so their face remains the same size. It's especially useful for capturing the expressions of fast-moving children. And, for even more convenience, the Zoom Framing Assist function is also available when shooting video.\n\nA STEADY IMAGE IS A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE\nINTELLIGENT IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS, analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to help capture the steadiest possible image.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. COMPOSE YOUR SHOTS IN HIGH RESOLUTION\nHIGH-RESOLUTION 3.0-INCH LCD\nComposing and checking your shots is easier with PowerShot SX510 HS camera's clear, high-resolution 3.0-inch LCD screen (approximately 461,000 dots). The extra resolution also makes using the camera's menu functions more convenient. The large screen is easily viewable from a wide angle, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nSHOOTING MODES\nPowerShot cameras offer shooting modes that make it easy to take perfect photos in a wide range of shooting situations by providing intelligent presets with optimized settings.\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nManual You have complete control of exposure, selecting both aperture and shutter speed manually. Aperture-Priority You set the aperture, controlling depth-of-field. The camera automatically selects the shutter speed. Shutter-priority You select the shutter speed to stop or blur action, and the camera finds the appropriate aperture. With slow exposure times, Canon's noise reduction system activates to ensure low image noise. Program Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically. Live View Control Enables Brightness, Color, and Tone adjustments to your images using easy-to-understand controls. Smart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Movie Digest Records a video clip before capturing a still image and then combines one day's worth of clips into a video. Now easily playback and review clips, and delete unwanted scenes. Portrait The camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject \u201cpop.\u201d Face Self-timer The camera waits for a face to enter the frame before releasing the shutter. High-Speed Burst Captures rapid action frame by frame, by shooting continuously at a high speed while the shutter button is held down. Low Light For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly-lit situations. Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint.
