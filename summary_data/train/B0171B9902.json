Install took about an hour, just because I wanted to run wiring in hidden areas. The sound level is off a bit, but it seems that you can adjust the dvd monitor and it makes the other monitor louder. Just had to play with it to find a good balance. Only complaint is, the \u201cresume\u201d feature is hit or miss. If it continues, I may need to return, as going through the menu to find the last scene is a pain. Other than this, you can\u2019t beat the value.",

So before install I would go through your owners manual or take apart the back of your chair and head rest to see if they will work. Good luck all.",

    "description": "Color:Black| Size:7 inch| style:With DVDThe Rockville RDP711 is a 7\"\" complete car video entertainment system. The RDP711 features a universal fit system and it includes all the necessary parts to fit any vehicle. It has adjustable and detachable metal poles that adjust left to right from 4\"\" inches to 7\"\" inches. Rockville will have you up and running and enjoying your system in almost no time. Installation is very simple. Just power and ground wires. Rockville takes the rocket science out of system integration, with our detailed and easy Do-It-Yourself Instructions. (Our instructions are written so that it is easy to understand). The headrests are manufactured of high quality leatherette with a plush comfortable finish and modeled to integrate perfectly into any vehicle.\nTwo headrest are included. The main headrest features a front loading DVD player that will play on both headrests. (The second headrest is standalone video monitor that will play whatever is on the main monitor). All Rockville DVD units are manufactured using original Sony laser lens pick ups for the absolute best DVD playability. No skipping or pausing. And even home made discs will play with no problem. Our loaders and spin motors are Japanese made by Mabuchi the world leader in DVD spin technology. This is one of the major differences between Rockville and some of the other brands. Image quality is at an amazing 800 x 480 resolution. The picture is crystal clear because this model is upgraded with digital panels that give a much higher resolution display than the older technology panels. All Rockville video products go through an extensive testing phase before production. We take a sample unit and keep it on for days straight (24 hours a day) and ensure that the picture stays crystal clear even after the monitor being on for long periods of time. The quality and longevity of these are among the best in the industry.",
