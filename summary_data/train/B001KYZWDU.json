My hope was to carry him though security without a big fuss but since the ring is metal I ended up having to take my son out and put it through the x-ray machine. Maybe I missed the trick on easily putting this on with your child but we always struggle to get in it comfortably for the first few minutes. Once it's on the padded shoulder is great! There is a little too much material though, the loose end seems to flap around and hit things when I walk around.",

When my kid is in a side-sitting carry (at 6 months) I bring the tail around to the side opposite the rings and tuck it till secure, using it as a cover for her legs and feet. We're generally barefoot inside and it keeps her feet and legs from feeling cold.",

I wouldn't recommend the padded shoulder if you're larger up top as it doesn't have the width to spread out, which is much more comfortable if you have larger shoulders. Note that it will be stiff when you first get it, but keep using it, sit on it and wash/dry it a few times to break it in. Once it's broken in, it really feels great and is supportive. Easy to clean, which is good!",
