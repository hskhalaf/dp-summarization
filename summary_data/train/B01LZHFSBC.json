Bottom line I highly do not recommend buying this phone or any phone for that matter that you can not just take back to where you bought it for replacement if it acts up!",

This is also a missed opportunity from Amazon. I suspect they have the capability to message people who have purchased an item through them about exactly this kind of problem.",

Also using a custom rom which fixed some of the CPU throttling issues. There is a weird effect in this, if you change /System into R/W mode the phone resets so any app which does that will crash the phone. All /System updates like updating the default apps in the /System partition has to be done inside like TWRP.",

Also that it is unlocked and basically \"Plug n' Play\". The only downfall is the fingerprint sensor and its location. In my opinion, the sensor was much better on the back. You could unlock with one hand. This one being in the front on the bottom makes it awkward to unlock when your hands are full. Other than that, I really like this phone.",

One was this one...the other was the BLU Studio XL LTE that allowed me to delete pre-loaded apps. That was my favorite...until I got this one. The Life One X is snappy, as long as there arent too many background apps running. It can process and upload pretty fast as well. My only gripe is that the picture will sometimes wash and distort the screen. It happens once in a while...but its a reminder that you need to restart the phone or shut it down and let it rest.",

And the response from the company? Silence, nonchalance. Today, I regret not coughing up the extra $400 for an Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. Today that extra $400 is looking like a real bargain",

I use it pretty heavily on a daily basis and it handles everything pretty well. Definitely spring for the 4gb model, its worth it. I use at&t and have no problems with 4g lte or any connectivy issues. I had one OTA update and it went smoothly. Highly recommend this phone in your budget cap is 200ish. I love it.",

No communication from their side and who knows when they will fix it. I'm not willing to do a factory reset but it seems like I will lose everything I have on it anyways.

Many of the preinstalled apps can't be removed from the home screens. You can move them around, just not take them off. These are really only minor annoyances.
