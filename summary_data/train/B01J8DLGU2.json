Holy moly, this gauge was exact compare to Costco's pressure gauge monitor to the T. I was left scratching my head. How can something so cheap in price and and plastic we were so damn good. I'm 100% satisfied and glad I purchase it. Lol. Thank you Amazon and to this company for a great deal.",

Seems very accurate, is extremely easy to use and is great at night. You know you need a tire gauge at all the inoportune times. I love that it takes a reading and holds it so you can bring the guage to your face, rather than having to squat in a ridiculous position to read the guage. GREAT IDEA!! It also allows you to bleed off extra air, which I didn't see mentioned - but that works great. This one is A+++++",

Not noted in the included documentation is that there are 4 batteries to replace - one CR2032 and three LR44 batteries.

      "text": "Super accurate, way better than the analog gauge I was using before. Easy to use. Only complain is that it's slightly counterintuitive in that you need to press the trigger button before you test the pressure. several times I press the trigger as I was testing the pressure, and got no reading. You have to press the trigger button to turn the gauge on, and then test the tire within a number of seconds. Super easy to read, especially with the back light",

EDIT: customer service contacted me after this review and sent me a new one free of charge. I bumped my two stars to four - because I still am slightly concerned that it might not work due to the cold if I leave it in my glove box.",

I can easily adjust to PSI readings \ud83d\ude00. THANKS! Very satisfied. The light is a big help because not all tire checks are done in bright sun!
