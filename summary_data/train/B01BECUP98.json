Then about 2 weeks later it came apart again and my husband ended up putting pipe glue on it to get it to stay together. Also, sometimes the sound is so distorted with static you cannot hear the music. This thing comes with a one year warranty and if it keeps tearing up and having distortion, it will be returned way before the year is up!",

It only costs 118.00 delivered to your door. All in all, probably worth about $200...so I will be fair and give credit where it is due. I'd buy it again. -Todd",
