I found out that the actual screen is coming loose from the body of the phone and that's why it's been acting like this. I keep it in a case, so I'm not really worried about stuff getting under the screen, but the shop I had look at it said it was likely that way for a long time and I haven't had it all that long. I guess I'll just chalk this up to learning my lesson at buying a refurbished phone from somewhere other than Apple directly. Wish there was better product support for refurbished stuff from companies like this.",

The only downside is that whoever owned the phone before would always start to charge it when it hit 20%. Over time, this will cause the battery cells from 20% to 1% to die off and shorten the battery life. So, whenever the battery hits 20% it's just a matter of minutes (sometimes seconds) before it dies. But, if that's the worst thing out of a used phone, I consider myself lucky.",
