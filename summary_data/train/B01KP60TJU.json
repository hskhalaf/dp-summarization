They require you to turn on push notifications in order for the device to work, and then they use those push notifications to send ads to your phone. SUPER IRRITATING!!! About half the time when you open the app you have to click through an ad to get to the controls for your device. The app is poorly designed in general, and functionality is glitchy. I've had several occasions where I disarm the device, and then proceed to get multiple alerts when I walk around in the room. I strongly regret this purchase.",
