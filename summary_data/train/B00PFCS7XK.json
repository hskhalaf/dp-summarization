Frankly, I have about three other concealers (always looking for the best one), and I can throw them all away. This is my keeper!",

The only thing I see is more attention to my wrinkled skin and bags. It isn't obvious that I'm wearing concealer, unless my friends are simply too kind to tell me. It is easy to apply and seems to go a long way with a little amount. It doesn't work on my age spots. It simply creates a lighter spot around the darker age spot.",
