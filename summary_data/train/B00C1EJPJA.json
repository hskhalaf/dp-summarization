The people that left 1 star reviews clearly did not know how to calibrate it and set the suction hole correctly. If you take your time and install it correctly it will work perfectly as shown in video. Also dont leave your vacuum in the pool 24/7 . make it a habit to take it and only use it when you need to clean the pool.",

My gripes about this is if you have palm fronds, you may find that the leaves sometimes gets tangled in the gears and the cleaner just stops running.",

I have to disable one of the skimmers in order to effectively operate the unit. I do like the unit and it does all the way up to the water line but I hate losing one skimmer.",

Zodiac does have a leaf catcher that can be purchased. Also, because of the amount of suction needed, the outflow water deflectors come off in the zodiac and have to be taken out.

The last cleaner (Hayward KingRay) worked ok but the MX8 works amazingly well. I am able to reduce the daily cleaning duration by almost half. It also goes up the walls well (I didn't use the included float and I put the suction to almost 4 on the included calibration tool). It does not get the stairs much but that is a small price to pay for not having to unstick it. It has not gotten stuck once.",
