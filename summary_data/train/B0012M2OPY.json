When I put it on it always makes snapping/popping noises like I'm stretching it too far even though I'm not pulling hard or far. When I finally get it on its super form fitting and digs into me some. Just not really my cup of tea when it comes to bras. I also wish it was a little thicker through the cup area.",

Breast tissue gets pushed to the sides and makes you appear even larger. It does seperate well though. Maybe it will fit a different shape better.",
