Even when used on level, still, surfaces I did note that if you get within an inch of the top that I see leakage. Mineral stains from the then dried water leave markings on the outside of the bowls. Not as good as a bowl then neighbors gifted me which had a more rubberized interior/exterior.",

Even without that I still consider it a very worthwhile set.",

The larger tote that carries the dog food is great and so easy to pack up in a camping bag and keeps everything dry. I am very happy with this purchase and it\u2019s convenience. It was a Christmas gift to my husband and he loves it.",

I actually fold the lip down to make them more shallow so she can drink water out of them easier. If I leave them without folding the lip down, she seems to have a little trouble drinking because they are so deep and her snout is not that long! But overall these are great! Very solid construction which I love, once you pick them up they immediately scream \"High Quality\"",

Very nice when heading into a hotel room at night with suitcases and stuff because this textile system makes it easy to carry the dog\u2019s food, water dish, etc. The rigidity of the bowls is perfect. Size is ok too. But, the bowls are not waterproof and for many reasons, that\u2019s not good. I figure I\u2019ll use either a hotel room\u2019s thin plastic liners or a poop bag folded over and line the nylon bowl with those (think an ice bucket liner in a motel room).",
