But for some reason, I suffered acute allergy reactions from something in the HVAC system. Having the vents professionally cleaned did not completely fix the situation. My daughter swears by these things so I thought I'd give them a try and oh my goodness! What a difference! Now I feel like I can't live without them. They have to be kept on 24/7 to be effective, so they are not suitable for a bedroom, but the two I have in our living room provide great ambiance with their warm glow. Very pleased!",

It was a gift for someone who was over when the box arrived. They kept it even though I would have returned it. Not sure if it has real benefits but definitely interesting. *If you purchase this as a gift open it and check it before giving it away.",

Told packaging about it, never heard back. I'll use it until the power cord shorts again like the first one did. then I will go to another dealer to get a power cord and dimmer switch.
