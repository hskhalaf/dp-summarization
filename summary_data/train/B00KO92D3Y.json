We only use it for heating so install was super simple if you pay attention to your wiring. Comes with little stickers to mark your wires which would be easier to use if they were longer. Our stickers fell off before I even had the back plate installed! Can't imagine it would be difficult to install for use with central air if you have the basic knowledge of your system.",

I can't believe they are allowed to sell this with what, buy now, is an obvious flaw in the unit's internal programming. I'll get better use out of this as a range target.",

Not only does it have 4 time periods per day, and separate settings for weekends, but it has a settable \"span,\" to determine how many degrees to go below and above the set temperature before switching on or off. A wider span can avoid cycling your furnace or pellet stove too fast. Other thermostats this price lack that feature. It also can be set to ramp between settings, rather than suddenly change them at the set times. Definitely requires reading the manual. The controls will not make sense without it. Several switches on the back which have to be set right for your system before putting it on the wall.",

Called my electrician and told him the brand i purchased, he said that this particular brand has a low success rate of working properly. He suggested a Honeywell brand. I installed the honey well and now everything works perfectly.",
