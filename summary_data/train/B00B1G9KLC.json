      "text": "I've had 2 mesh style harnesses from Voyager which have been perfect for my french bulldog Barley. With the weather getting colder, I purchased a Chocolate Latte harness, which is made of suede material. It keeps him a bit warmer and looks great as well. I originally ordered/received the wrong size in the mail, but Andrea in customer service responded promptly to my message and immediately mailed the size that I needed. Barley is 20 lbs and a Medium fits him well. I am very satisfied with the quality and durability of this harness. I'll be grabbing another Voyager harness soon in a different color/style and without hesitation, I easily recommend Voyager collars/harnesses to others as well.",

There is an adjustable velcro strap to custom fit to your dog. If you've never used a harness before, you want it snug enough so it won't pull forward when you walk your dog. If you have it too loose, it'll rub against their front legs and be uncomfortable. You want just enough room to fit 2 fingers under the harness. The benefit to a harness over a collar is you won't choke your dog. The pull from the leash gets distruputed over the chest area.",
