After reading the reviews I took a chance hoping that all my parts were in the box.....they are not! 4 bolts and 4 nuts missing. Had to go to the hardware store. After 2.5 hours I was finished. Hooked it up to my lawn mower put down the blades and 20 feet later the left wheel fell off! Bad weld on the wheel support! Others have had the same problem. Also had snapped the head off of two of the bolts....poor quality! Will return tomorrow and find another manufacturer that makes a product that will last more that 2 minute!! Fo not purchase!!",
