They are simple and you worry about beating them too fast.

Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is probably the best platformer I've played. The level design, gameplay, puzzles, worlds, characters, art, music, etc. all are very well done. The game is a bit difficult for younger kinds, but you can play in co-op mode with Funky Kong and it makes it more bearable. Pleasant surprise, lots of fun, highly recommend!",

Also beware, I noticed it had a PEGI 3 rating label on the cover, seems the PAL (Nintendo of Europe) version is mixed in the Amazon North American batch.
