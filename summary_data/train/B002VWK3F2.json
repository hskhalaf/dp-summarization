      "text": "I bought this walker for my grandfather. Out of the box it only took 5 minutes to complete. All that was needed to build was to attach the handles. Wheels, frame and brakes are already built. Strong amd sturdy. Big enough for a man approximately 6'1\" when the handles are extended. Anyone taller may need to adjust it by drilling an additional hole in the handle bars but would be fairly easy. As is it was perfect for our needs. Liked it so much that we decided to buy a second walker, one for upstairs and another downstairs.",

What would give it a perfect 5 stars is a little locking mechanism for taking it in and out of the car because it tends to open up a little which makes it difficult and I'm afraid of hurting myself because I have a lot of health problems.",

The only negative I found, is that the wheels are cheap plastic, so when using the walker going down a ramp at restaurant, the wheels just slide on floor when you apply brakes.

But if you need it for some general safety when walking, then it's great. FYI: don't get on the moving sidewalk with it...just ask my hard headed FIL, lol. Some people just don't know any better, bless their hearts. : ) p.s. he was ok, just his pride wounded : )",

It's stable and glides well with all four wheels rotating. Lifting the seat can make it kind of awkward to fold, it's not the lightest, and the brakes are not the tightest but we chose this for function and durability.",

I was folding it but found that I can leave it open and it will fit which saves time. I would recommend to anyone looking for a walker that has more than just a frame and wheels..",

It has been life-changing for me. So easy to get around now. So many well thought out construction details. Sturdy device. The seat is so handy for transporting drinks/refreshments. Little vinyl basket is very useful for transporting hobby supplies around the house. Love the way lifting the strap folds it right up. The brakes are a bit difficult to use, but everything else about it is top notch. Love this deep red color.",
