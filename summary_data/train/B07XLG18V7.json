      "text": "This was a birthday present for my wife. She had been using my old ipad 2 (2012) but was unable to use some current apps, so this was a much needed upgrade. At first she wasn't sure it was worth it when she found out how much it cost, but after using it for a few weeks now she says she loves it! Compared to the old ipad 2 it's like night and day. I have an ipad 2017 and it would be difficult to justify getting the 2019 version since it seems only marginally quicker, but if you have an older ipad (or any other older tablet) I would definitely recommend this. Happy wife = happy me! :-)",

      "text": "I started using my new I Pad a week ago, and I can't log in already. It asked me to think of an alphanumeric password when I first started using it. However, yesterday when I switched it on, it was only possible to use numbers, with numbers underneath small and unusable. Also, it wasn't doing fingerprint recognition at all, which was working the first day that I used it. I think it's a ploy by Apple to get you to buy other Apple products, so that it doesn't take you so long to log in or reset your password. I'm not buying the new Apple IPhone!!",

As a professional, I would say that its performance is absolutely enough to run games and high-definition movies. Under normal circumstances, you don't need to buy the air version, nor the pro, unless you want a lighter laptop. Personally, I prefer to use macbook pro because the system is more solid and stable. The iOS system is still best for iPhone and iPad.",
