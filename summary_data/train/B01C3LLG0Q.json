I can't tell you how much a good pair of shoes are worth to your whole body! They have tremendous support, light weight even though they don't look it, and very comfortable! I'm in love with these shoes and plan to buy more each pay day. I recommend you do the same!",

Also does not offer ventilation resulting in hot feet. - Outsole is hard and does not offer much cushion; insole has some memory foam but it is a thin layer. I may try insoles to improve the cushioning. - They feel clunky and thick; it seems like my toes/feet can't get a good read on the floor when doing, say, a STEP program.",

The limit is 45 days. I did not see this anywhere when I ordered them. I am not pleased about this. I should think that maybe a gift card could be given if Amazon chooses to not give cash back. I am very disappointed.",

      "text": "I use them for gym workouts and classes. They feel very stable but without feeling like the sole is extended. Flatter than my running/walking shoes, in a good way. I usually wear an 8, sometimes an 8.5, especially in athletic shoes -- these were definitely better in 8.5 for me. These were on sale for a good price when I got them, and I ordered a much more expensive pair of running shoes at the same time. I like the running shoes pretty well, but I love the Pumas (my first pair ever). Would definitely buy again.",

I needed something with side to side stability, cushioning and support. This shoe meets most of these requirements. The toe box is a little tight on my foot but I think it's not the shoes fault. I think I need something with a mesh upper rather than a more rigid material like this shoe's upper. It has the stability and fits well but the arch support was insufficient for my foot. I bought a full length orthotic to replace the existing shoe liner and all is well.",

My last pair of Puma's are a little more low profile (and probably a different style), which I prefer. But other than that, they are really cute.",

So, my foot sweats more in this shoe than in others.. All in all, I'm going to wear them because I bought them. But, probably wouldn't purchase them again.",
