      "text": "I\u2019m very disappointed by the ingredients of this food when this company claims to sell high quality food. I care about feeding my turtle a healthy and natural diet and this food is filled with unnatural and filler ingredients. The 2nd ingredient is Ground Corn. The 4th ingredient is Poultry by-product meal. That means they are eating random body parts and guts of animals. I\u2019m pretty sure in the wild turtles do not eat cow, chicken or pig body parts. I will continue to search for a healthier turtle food. I feed my turtle a variety of green vegetables and I\u2019m looking to add a little bit more variety to his diet.",

I remove the food and give him something else. The next day when I went to feed him the tank had very mucky water. I had just cleaned and refreshed the tank three days prior so it shouldn\u2019t have gotten mucky from food. Anyways, we won\u2019t be purchasing again for our turtle. My turtle dislikes this product. My turtle of 20 years never turns down food.",

This food is well-received by all my different turtles, from sliders to mud turtles to Malaysian box turtles. I do still supplement with greens and the occasional fruit treat just for variety. Definitely a winner, in my book.",
