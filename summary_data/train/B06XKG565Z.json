This unit is replacing my Sharp microwave that died (the touch panel gave up the ghost) after 20+ years. Remains to be seen if it has legs like that!

The hOmeLab at 1050 watts heated the bowl of water 4 degrees F hotter than the 1100. Happy cooking!",

The oven had fingerprints all over it and had been clearly repackaged (and poorly at that). It was also missing all documentation (instruction manual, warranty card, etc). The 4 feet pads on the bottom of the unit are not level so that it see-saws (which I corrected by adding a small shim to one of the feet). I suspect this may have been why it was returned in the first place. I suppose I should have returned it, but time is money . The path of least resistance was to just keep it and move along.",
