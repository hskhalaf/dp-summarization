I have to reconnect and it start over and no matter how tight I try to make the connection eventually it will work loose. I'm thinking ??Superglue??

The brush roll is so clogged up that it won\u2019t turn anymore, and I can\u2019t get it cleaned with my hands and scissors. It needs to be taken apart, but there is a special screw which requires a tool that I do not have, so they make it so you cannot even fix this. First, it does not do what it was advertised to do which is clean up here. Second, once the brush roll is clogged, it\u2019s impossible to repair at home. I owned this less than a year.",

I'm actually concerned about the squalor I've been living in, based on just the first pass over area rugs. Only downside is that its suction is so much that it pulls up smaller/lighter area rugs. Had to give counter force to keep it from getting sucked in. HUGE fan. #sharkvacuumsforlife",

It works well on both hardwood and carpet and moves easily around the house. It gets most of the pet hair up but I did find a small clump of hair when washing my carpets after using the shark, but there was a huge difference. My rugs even feel softer.

And the attachments that do have a home fall off easiky. Especially the extension wand. It falls off frequently if you breath near the machine. The lift away is heavy. All in all.... I say boo! Bottom Line: I would return this vacuum if I could. The suction and edge cleaning are it's only attributes. Shark...do better!",
