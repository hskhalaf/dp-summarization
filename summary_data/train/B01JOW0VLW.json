The material seemed kind of thin and although it did not rip, it felt maybe too thin. Only used this once and tossed. For a one time use, it works well but that's up to you. If you want one of these so that you can bring the parachute up and you can run under to the parachute and sit to make a parachute, then definitely go bigger!",

The trampoline has 6 poles for the net and I just alternated putting bungee cords on every other parachute handle to attach the item to the top. Its a great colorful addition helping to keep the trampoline shaded. I have not taken it down after about a month and it has held up with no damage to the handles or rest of the parachute. The bungees however needed to be replaced after been eaten up by the desert sun. This item also held up with heavy winds and rain.",

It could have been so much worse. The fault was completely mine for thinking the parachute was a safe and fun beach toy. I'm sure it is quite safe and fun with more adults in control and if used in an area where there are no strong winds. Use the product wisely. My apologies to the seller.",

      "text": "Stiffer and thicker material than other parachutes I've used in the past. This sounds like a good thing, but it makes stiff-plastic rattling sounds and doesn't lift and flow in the air as beautifully as a softer material. Also it doesn't fit back into the bag after you use it the first time. On the plus side, it looks sturdy, and it has 12 handles for lots of little hands to hold it.",
