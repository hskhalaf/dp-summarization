I've loaned it to friends and family. It cleans patios and siding (vinyl and aluminum). Its cleaned my deck several times. If used correctly, this should be a long lasting power washer for you. Best way to ensure your power washer pump lasts is to ensure you get water to the pump before you start the engine.",
