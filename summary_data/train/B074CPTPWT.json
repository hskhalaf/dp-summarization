We did not opt for the RV package, but are very happy with the results. All of \u2018our\u2019 channels on the road, in less than 5 minutes. Our only complaint is the length of cable (included) is usually not long enough to get signal, as we are mostly in wooded areas when camping. An \u2018on the go\u2019 system should include 50-75 feet of cable so that you can get the satellite reception anywhere needed. We spent an additional $30 for a longer cable.",

The product works great, it does bring in the HD channels and finds the satellite automatically. One thing to keep in mind if replacing an existing satellite dish, the power to operate the PL-7000 dish is through the coax cable and requires no separate power line to connect. As Dish uses several satellites, one feature that I do especially like is when you change channels the dish will find the correct satellite in just a few seconds.",
