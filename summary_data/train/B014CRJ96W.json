I bought them for a work function where I brought cheese and crackers and I got a number of compliments and asks of where I got them. They are easy to clean and lightweight so easy to store. They seem very sturdy and good quality. Hoping they last through many a dinner party! 100% recommend as they're an inexpensive way to class up a cheese board. Who doesn't love looking fancy and adult??",

I think one thing that is great about these is that when I serve cheese, I slice it before guests arrive, but these make it so I do not need to take the time to do this before - guests can slice their own cheese as they eat.",

The color of the wood (whatever it is) does not match the bamboo color. I bought it as an addition to a cheese set, that i have lost some of the tools. It looked exactly the same in the picture, in reality not even close.",
