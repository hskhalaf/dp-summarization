No toxic ceramic leaching lead and who-know's-what into your beverage. We've had 2 mugs break, one fell off a table onto a hardwood floor, the other my husband poured boiling HOT tea into it (it broke cleanly in half, into 2 pieces). These mugs have handled very hot liquids, hotter than we can drink; just let the water cool ever so slightly so that it's not literally boiling. These sturdy thick mugs will not tip over like those with narrower bottoms. I'm here to purchase another set for us. Highly recommend!",
