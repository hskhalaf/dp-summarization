These things are a little stiff at first. So if you can get your skates baked I would. A blow dryer could kind of work, as some do. But it'll fit better with a professional bake.

There is a small toe-pick, not apt for jumps of any kind, and the ankle support is so flimsy I nearly broke my ankle many times. It is an okay skate for just going forward and backward, but anything beyond that will destroy the skate within days.",
