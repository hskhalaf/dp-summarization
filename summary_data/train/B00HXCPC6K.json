When the B&D trimmer/edger works, it works well, but manually advancing the line doubles the trim time. We have 1.5 acres with a lot of concrete, shrub areas, and play areas to trim around. We decided to try this trimmer one more time because we already own so many batteries that fit it. We need 4-5 batteries to do all of our trimming.

This is perfect, lightweight (photo), adjustable and has 2 lithium batteries that charge pretty quick, and its VERY powerful, cuts through heavy stuff. Had to write this review, been meaning to for the past three years! Thank you Black & Decker, I love this tool!",

We have a big back yard and it will run for a good half hour before swapping batteries is required. Plenty of power for our needs and the auto feed seems to work well. I hate having gas mowers and appliances around. Noise and messy although admittedly they have more power. But for our needs this meets the bill and its power is not to be underestimated. I highly recommend this sturdy little tool for ordinary garden needs. I wouldn't recommend it for clearing large fields or farming applications but I think that goes without saying.

Trimming around the fence, under bushes, under the deck where the mower can't go and around the the sides of the house as well as edging the sidewalks really requires use of a trimmer-edger. No more down on my hands and knees trying to edge with garden shears and clippers! This Black + Decker was reasonably priced and has made my life so much easier! Went together quickly, it's not too large or heavy and I can have a well trimmed yard in a fraction of the time I spent before and with much less effort!",

He's a pro now, and this has made his weekly yard work absolutely easy. He doesn't even complain anymore about taking care of the yard.

Now I've upgraded to a 20V trimmer, and have six batteries and three rapid chargers (every walk back to the house for fresh batteries involves a steep uphill walk). The trimmer is a real upgrade: multiple power output choices, sturdier build. The batteries are lighter than the 18V NiCads, but don't last a lot longer except for the white extra charge ones. Lighter batteries help with the fatigue factor (I'm 72 years old and 5'2\"). Luckily it uses the same trimmer cord as the 18V one.",

No bumping to advance string, no mixing or filling with fuel. Love it love it love it.",

Im going to try winding string myself onto the empty spool. Light to carry and work with. Not very ergonomic controls for edging where you have to hold it upsidedown and twist your hand around to press the button.but I love it anyway. Lithium batteries rule!",
