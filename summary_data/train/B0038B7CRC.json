The next thing I knew all his friends at his birthday party were inside of it with him. I was worried that it would not support the weight but it did and it held up well. Now his mother uses it to put his toys in and she can wheel it around as she is picking up the toys. Once it is full it is easy to wheel it into his bedroom for storage. His mother is very happy with this item she said it works well.",

Our eldest grandson really enjoys the fact that he can push this toy box around. We had fun putting the stickers on together as well. There is no lid to close the box. Some may prefer this as that would make the room look tidier. This toy box is for when the grands visit and is stored in an area that is not used daily, so isn't a requirement for us. Highly recommended, despite there being no lid.",

This is a little bit hard to move around because it only has 2 wheels and they don\u2019t turn. It was pretty easy to assemble. I definitely recommend it to others it you\u2019re looking for a good toy storage container. Item arrived a week after purchase, so pretty good delivery speed.",

Also, because it has wheels and the compact size, it makes it easier to move from room to room, if your ever inclined to do so. It\u2019s pretty sturdy, you place the stickers on it. Might take two people to assemble, depends. We bought one and then purchased another for the grandparents house.",
