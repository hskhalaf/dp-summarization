I was reading thru the reviews and was surprised to see I've not written about this wicked awesome dock so here I am to share my experience. This awesome little device is as exactly as described by JBL. I recommend it to anyone.",

The wall-plug, battery, and USB powering options make it truly versatile. Remote doesn't always get detected by unit, but I haven't tried fresh batteries yet. Sound quality is unquestionably excellent, so the reviews stating poor sound quality either got a damaged/defective unit, or they are writing propaganda negative reviews for JBL's competitors. Be aware, the product info states it takes 4 AA batteries, which have a lot more mAh power than 4 AAA batteries and are cheaper per mAh. However, this unit indeed uses AAA batteries.",

      "title": "Broken sound after played the ipod",
      "text": "Unfortunately for my friend, I ordered this JBL On Stage Micro III before I leave USA for my friend in Thailand. My friend just told me that after he unpacked the Micro III, plug in the power and use his Ipod to play music on it. The item didn't work well, the speaker's sound broken. He tried to use different Iphone, MP3 player, the result was the same. I am not so sure about the warranty in Thailand will cover this Amazon's product or not because shipping back to USA should be the same cost as buying a new one. BR, Burachat",
