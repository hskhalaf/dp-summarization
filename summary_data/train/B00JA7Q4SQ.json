I couldnt imagine shaving with a manual blade every day so I decided to give this a try. WOW it is the closest and most comfortable shave ive ever had in my life. I recommend this to everybody! Great price. Much better shave then buying a bunch of cartridges. Glad i tried it!",

The older one had a metal band on the outside of the plug that made contact with the shaver (that's what broke on my older one). I don't see this cable ever breaking. At first it didn't shave as close as the older model, but after a few weeks it is getting better. My skin had to get used to the new razor. It is the same when I go from Braun to a Norelco. My face gets rashy but after using it for awhile, my skin gets used to it.",
