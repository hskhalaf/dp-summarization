      "text": "I bought these tires for their price. I find tires to be a consumable item. I ride aggressively, kind of like I was on a supermoto. I brake hard, accelerate hard, and \"back it in\" (slide) to corners. I go through tires about a set every 4-5 months. Naturally, I bought these because they were the cheapest ones that fit. Mounting them was easy, and they don't seem to be directional. They're rated 50-75psi. Do be warned they're 700cx35 and my old ones were 700cx25, so they're considerably fatter. No big deal, maybe a little more rolling resistance. They are very comfortable and have a lot of grip.",
