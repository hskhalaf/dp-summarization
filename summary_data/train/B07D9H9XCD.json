I tried everything including talking to Amazon support who was not able to get me connected. My son-in law was able to get me connected after several attempts. I would give this product a five hands down but the connection to Echo I would have to give a 2, sorry but instructions not clear. If you are not technically savvy stay away from these devices. Again, once connected they work great and 5 stars plus or better. Seller is great, and will offer better instructions for connecting to Echo.",

We must have 3 or 4 different remotes with different channels and the buttons wear out quickly and quit working. I decided to try using smart outlets this year. They work great with our Amazon Echos. I have 6 of them deployed for the Christmas lighting and put them in a group so all my wife needs to do is tell Alexa to turn on/off the Christmas lights. Not finding the right remote for the right string of lights. These are so convenient! My one complaint is that they are a bit large and partialy cover the second outlet enough to prevent it from being used.",

I believe some reviews said that there wasn't room for another cord in the outlet when you plug one of these in, but we had no problems with plugging in another regular cord.

Setting up timers is really easy too. My only complaint is that you cannot set up a daily schedule for the timer - would be nice for customization.

You have to give your wifi password to the app and that is always risky. I'd like some more assurance that no one else has access to my data or my network.

The app is also poorly designed, and is clearly a ripoff (or was ripped off, not sure which) of a similar smart home app, with only the colors being different. It also makes an audible clicking noise when the outlet turns on or off.",
