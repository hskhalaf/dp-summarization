I returned them because the materials felt cheap, I could see glue, the edges were out of line, and the overall appearance looked as if I made them at home as a crafting activity.",

I remember that, but stick with it a while and see... After twenty years, I now put them in all my shoes except Chacos. Many hundreds of $$ well-spent. Invest in your feet. Not cheap considering the low cost of materials, and yet somehow worth it because of the performance. Perfection.",
