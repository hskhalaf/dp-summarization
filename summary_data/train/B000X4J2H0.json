I have no complaints, they work great and are more adjustable than the standard tongue and groove style Channelocks. The teeth and shape of the jaws are also better than standard Channelocks. They get a much better purchase on things and the pliers are more easily adjusted with one hand.",

The knurled handles (non-rubberized grips) are awesome and easy to use. Cons: The oil coating was thick and difficult to remove.",

      "text": "Purchased these on a recommendation from YouTuber \"AvE\". Great design!!!! Their design has a better grip than Channellocks, especially towards the jaw tips, which allows more force for turning the fastener and less force \"squeezing\" the jaws closed when in tight places. Their precise slip joint adjustment allows for a more \"squared up\" jaw parallel contact with the fastener's \"flats\". At times, the Channellock's slip joint adjustment doesn't allow for the upper and lower jaws to be parallel when grasping the \"flats\" of a fastener, causing slipping. A welcomed addition to my tool box!!!!",

Also, once you set them to the size you want (simply press the center and slide open or close), they stay in place and don't accidentally slip into a different position. The quality of materials and workmanship on these is also spectacular. Highly recommended!",

Tighten a pipe with a pipe wrench, or worse with left side/right side hinged channel locks and you will either slip or at least mar the pipe.

The standing on them when on a pipe (or their demonstration display) was impressive then and still is now.. Damn you Knipex, now I'm going to have to buy the 3 pack 7\",10\" & 12\" Worth the money.",

      "text": "Electrician here. After using channel lock brand for over 20 years, I decided to try these after hearing how a co-worker of mine loved them. Well, he was right. These are great. The button adjustment took only a few days of use to master and once you do it's not a problem. It won't slide out of place so if you're running 1\" pipe it will stay in that position. The angles on the head really grips pipe and connectors very well. But what I like most is how thin they are. Makes a huge difference in getting in tighter spots. They are very strong and well made. I wish I bought these years ago. I highly recommend.",

    "description": "Size:10-InchNo more time-consuming test-adjusting of the correct opening size. Just position the upper jaw to the workpiece, push button and move close the lower jaw, ingeniously simple. 30% more capacity than a conventional pipe wrench. Self-locking on pipes and nuts due to teeth set against the rotation - no slipping on the workpiece. Pinch guard prevents fingers from being pinched. Adjustment at the touch of a button. Has 25 adjustment positions to adjust to hex nuts up to 1 13/16\" and round pipe up to 2\".\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nSelf locking on pipes and nuts (view larger).No more time-consuming test-adjusting to achieve the correct size. With the Knipex Cobra water pump pliers, you can simply position the upper jaw to the workpiece, push the button, and close the lower jaw. And you'll also be able to say goodbye to blood blisters you get with other gripping pliers. With safety its first priority, Knipex has designed a built-in pinch guard that prevents blood blisters on your hand.\n\nThe unique self-locking adjustment and induction hardened gripping teeth means that once it's set, it stays. There's no slipping and no need to waste strength squeezing the pliers \u2014 ensuring operator safety and more efficient work. Cobra's unique jaw configuration can grip any shape object \u2014 flat, round, hex, or square. It also eliminates nut burring to avoid stripping pipes, nuts, or bolts. Additionally, the Cobra's newly redesigned adjustment provides 30 percent more gripping capacity than previous models.\n\nA simple push of the patented push button adjustment maintains jaw size setting and gives you the correct size opening every time. Just position the upper jaw to the workpiece, push the button, adjust the opening, and close the lower jaw. And it's easily done with just one hand for trouble-free operation in confined spaces. \n\nCobra water pump pliers are constructed from chrome vanadium electric steel, an innovative high alloy, oil tempered steel that ensures longevity. And their thin head design helps you get into spaces other pliers can't, so there's no need to change tools when working in tight confines. \n\nPatented push button system (view larger).QUALITY IN EVERY DETAIL\nSometimes we give our pliers a really hard time. We try to destroy them to find out what makes them good and long-lasting. Because we don't want to leave anything to chance, we take a long, careful look. \n\nThe steel Knipex uses is precisely hardened with a maximum of 0.8 percent carbon and defined parts of chromium and vanadium, guaranteeing optimum cutting performance and service life \u2014 even though it requires special production and costs a bit more. But our high product demands require this.\n\nThe rivet of our high-leverage diagonal cutter also has to stand up to a lot of stress. That's why we literally give it backup: we forge it straight onto the pliers. This means extra effort as we have to precision mill the rivet to a few hundredth millimeters. But satisfied users are worth this effort.\n\nKnipex also looks closely at the small details. The angles, the sharpness, the hardness, the toughness of the cutting edges. The precision and smooth movement of the joint. The handle design and the finish. We keep reviewing these subjects, we research, we test, and we improve our pliers.\n\nABOUT KNIPEX\nHeadquartered in Wuppertal, Germany, Knipex is an independently-owned family enterprise steeped in tradition and specializing in the manufacturing of high-quality pliers. It all started back in 1882 when C. Gustav Putsch set up his own forge shop in Cronenberg (now a suburb of Wuppertal), and the company is now run by a fourth generation of that family. The world's leading brand in pliers today, Knipex is focused on the performance, service life, and ergonomics of its tools in order to meet the high expectations of professional users.\n\n87 01 250 COBRA PLIERS, 10-INCH\nAT A GLANCE\n * Adjustment at the touch of a button directly on the workpiece\n * Fast, firm adjustment directly on the workpiece\n * Self-locking on pipes and nuts: no slipping on the workpiece and low hand force required\n * Gripping surfaces with special hardened teeth\n * Pinch guard prevents operators' fingers from being pinched\n * Chrome vanadium heavy-duty steel, forged and oil-hardened\n\n\nSee larger image.\nSPECIFICATIONS\n * Jaw capacity: Up to 2-inch for round and 1-13/16-inch for hex\n * Adjustment positions: 25\n * Length: 10 inches\n * Weight: 11.1 ounces\n * Handles: Plastic coating\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWith these Knipex 8701250 10-Inch Cobra Pliers, fast adjustment directly on the work piece eliminates time-consuming test adjusting of the correct opening size. Just position the upper jaw to the work piece, push button on pliers and move close the lower jaw. Once adjusted the pliers self-lock on pipes and nuts with no slipping. Optimized shape jaw will grip round, square and hex shaped material. The box joint design provides high stability because of the double guide.\n\nSee more",
