So far this has only done duty in my yard, but it looks and works great.",

    "description": "The secret of many successful mule deer hunters is using a decoy to stalk bucks or lure them into bow range. It just makes sense. For that reason, Montana Decoy has created a one designed for the avid mule deer hunter. In stalking situations, the life-size body of this decoy gives you cover when there isn\u2019t much. Its realistic pose will grab the attention of rutting mule deer bucks and offer a distraction as you take a shot.\n\n\nLike every decoy we create, the photo-realistic body pops open in the blink of an eye and folds down tight to the size of a dinner plate.",
