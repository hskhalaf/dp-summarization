      "text": "I am a mechanical engineering student and am required to use an FE-approved calculator for all my classes. I love this one for the matrix functionality (great for linear interpolation!), quick decimal-to-fraction conversion, and scientific, engineering, and decimal display modes. I wish it had a graphing function, but since that's not allowed on the FE exam, I'm pretty happy with this calculator. I recommend watching YouTube videos about it to learn all the cool tricks you can use to get more out of it. As my thermodynamics professor exclaimed when describing this calculator, \"all the math you can do for only about $17!\"",

It calculates probabilities easily as well - you just shift between \"comp\" mode and \"stat\" mode. And it is very inexpensive IMO. I suppose you could use a laptop or iPad but this little thing is handy. It does lots of other things that I have not looked at - but stat students will like it I think.",

It's not that expensive, go with this version over the non-Plus. It'll blow you away with how much you can do compared to a graphing calculator (e.g, TI-89 titanium).

It is so simple to use yet does all the calculations you would ever need. I definetely recommend purchasing this one over the TI if you are a college student needing this for class and/or exams. PS it does 40 different conversions, check the back of the case! It is really handy when you need to convert temperatures in chemistry - all you have to do is push a few buttons and done (and you know it is correct). 10/10. Buy it, people.",

You definitely want a backup for the exam, and it would be really annoying to have a different backup calculator in the event that you had to use it. These exams are stressful enough to try using a different calculator than the one that you've been using while studying. So buy 2 of them, they're cheap enough that it isn't a big deal.",
