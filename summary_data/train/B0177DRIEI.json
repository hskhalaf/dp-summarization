I can\u2019t tell you how wonderful it is to look in the mirror and find zero blemishes on my face for over a week now. Usually I\u2019m lucky if I can get 2-3 days a month with clear skin. My husband even noticed the difference. For reference, I have sensitive fair skin that is oily. This has decreased the oil and isn\u2019t irritating at all. I will be ordering more. Thank you for this soap.",

No problems though :)bo Feb 2019 edit: changed from 5 stars to 1 star. This product is no longer scratchy. I loved the bits of scratchy charcoal, but they are not in the soap anymore.

      "text": "I know this product wasn't listed as an acne treatment, but it was recommended based on all the reviews. I've had acne for years, enough that I have never had a day without a least one breakout somewhere on my face or back. The acne on my back is especially painful and if this soap could just help that it would be amazing, but it did not. I have noticed no difference. I have since switched to the new proactiv MD, and that has actually worked. So if you like soap that smells nice, great. This purchase is totally for you. If you have constant acne like I do, don't get your hopes up from all these other reviews.",
