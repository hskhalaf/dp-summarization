We were feeding towhees, grosbeaks, Stellar\u2019s jays, finches, and several smaller colorful songbirds. The birds loved this seed mix. Yes, it is expensive. However, I tried a couple of other cheaper brands and we ended up with moths several times, along with wasted \u201cfiller\u201d materials that the birds would not eat. Will be sticking with this mix from now on for summer feeding.",
