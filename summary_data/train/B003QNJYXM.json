I used to have to gag them down. As for the seller, these bottles came pristine in the box, no leakage. If you read the reviews of people selling the 24 packs, commenters have complained about the bottles leaking. It's worth it to pay a little more than having to mess with leaky bottles.",

Only buy this box when its priced here for $24.00-$28.00. They can be up to $3.49 per bottle retail in the stores in OHIO. I would not drink the whole bottle at once. Please sip!!!
