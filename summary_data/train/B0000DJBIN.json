It barely moves when adding/removing pans and the added shelf in the middle holds my bulky stock pot. This freed up much needed cabinet space for other items!",

I have many heavy pots and pans (I'm actually over the limit in weight it recommends) and have had no problems whatsoever, of course make sure you hang the hooks in a joist (wood), do not take shortcuts and anchor into plaster or drywall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a pot rack..",

      "text": "This is a great pot rack for a very, very reasonable price. I initially had some hesitations putting my 15 pound oversize cast iron pan on it, but after screwing the hooks into studs on the ceiling and testing the rack with my weight, I had no qualms. The weakest link will always be where it is attached to the ceiling - the rest of the rack is quite sturdy. It made my kitchen much less cluttered and utilized previously empty space. Great purchase!",

I priced a lot of different pot racks at cooking supply stores & the internet. Obviously, the prices at those stores were well beyond my means ($200-300). So when I saw this one on Amazon for about $38 + S/H, I thought this would be fairly cheaply made. But when I received it, I was very surprise to see that it was pretty well made! Can't beat this rack for the price plus it comes with 12 sturdy hooks to boot!",

On top we fit the food sealer and all of it's accessories and it could have handled more weight I'm sure.",
