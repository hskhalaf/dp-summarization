Being a millennial, however, requires that I follow trends and try weird stuff. My moms home made turmeric milk with a dash of honey, black pepper, and turmeric (all ingredients that cost a max of $5) was way better. The proportion of spices in this mixture yields a bitter after taste. You are better off making your own with organic turmeric, cardamom powered, black pepper, etc. we also use turmeric atleast once if not twice a day in our cooking.",

Also, I had to take some kind of sleep-aid every night if I wanted to get a decent night's sleep. Now that we are taking this Golden Milk Powder, we are feeling so much better and I do not take any more meds for sleep. What a relief! We highly recommend this product and have already ordered more so we will not run out. We were also surprised at how good it tastes as we have had turmeric before and it was not something we could tolerate. We look forward to our drink every night.",

It was a time consuming effort and yielded a fantastic elixir. I started missing many chances to make my own Golden Milk due to added time constraints and started thinking maybe a premixed powder my be the better way to go for now. I've only been using this Turmaquik brand for a few days and I'm extremely impressed by the well balanced flavor, with zero sweetener added. I love how quick the prep is.

      "text": "Bought this after reading about turmeric and its anti-inflammatory properties - was hoping it would help with my psoriasis. I use a scoop a day in oat milk and actually really like the taste - it is kind of like egg nog. After i raved about it my husband started using a scoop in his oatmeal and he is also a convert. I have been using it for about a month and it is definitely helping my psoriasis - the patches on my elbows are much improved and i will definitely keep using this fabulous product!!",
