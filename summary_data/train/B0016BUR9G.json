The Harbinger brand mat is only $9 more, and it's a brand whose quality I can count on. This might work for a child's plaything, but not for any actual athletic uses.",

I don't do \"yoga\", but I can't imagine that it wouldn't function very well for that. I bought it as an emergency \"crash\" mattress for my office, and it's the perfect \"firmness\" for that.",

It's like doing a jumping jack on a bed, you're going to sink in or get unbalanced and injure yourself. The thickness doesn't matter when you just sink through it. For a MSRP of $70, and sale price of $40, I DO NOT recommend it.",

Looks like it will rip apart if you are doing aerobic exercises on mat. Also, while returned and did not try, looks like it will throw your standing poses off because foam completely compresses at point of pressure vs. surrounding area on mat.",

Also they are missing the Velcro pieces that hold them together! I was bummed about that because I needed them to connect in order to give enough space for tumbling.

My 2 boys have taken quite a liking to them, too. They throw them around at times and are not gentle with them and they hold up great. There are a lot of uses for these mats. Love that they fold up and have handles and the support is just right. I highly recommend these, in fact we ended up getting another set because they all enjoy them so very much.",

So don't get surprised if you see another brand PRINTED on the mat that they don't show you here on their picture. Also the mat IS NOT 2\" Thick. The actual size is 1 INCH. So take that into consideration before buying this product. Well at the end I returned this mat and got a full refund. So their customer service is good.",

And the thickness is not the best for some types of exercises; it all depends what you need it for. The folds make it easy to carry and easy to store, but sometimes one has to change position because of them; that is a minor issue, however, a tradeoff.",
