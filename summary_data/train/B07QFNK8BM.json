The wearers marvel at the support and stability it gives for various exercises. Its overall design has also pleased many users.The main caveat about the trainer lies in its narrow fit. It hasn't let a number of buyers enjoy the shoe\u2019s benefits to the fullest. But for those who managed to get the right fit, this shoe has become one of the top choices for cross-training.",

They are a bit snug when you get them, not enough for me to go a size up but they also loosened just the slightest over time so I stuck with the same size on my second purchase. They are comfortable in that I wear my old pair almost every day now outside of the gym. Will buy again!",

Lots of heel slip Terrible arch support I\u2019ve ended up with foot cramps twice during workouts. The first was a jump rope intensive HIIT and the other was during a Crossfit metcon with push presses. I can\u2019t recommend the current version of this shoe.",

I feel they do come a bit narrow, it's a snug fit for sure with a good amount of room in the toe area but defintely a little too tight on the midfoot, not a deal breaker so far though. My favorite thing about these so far is the stability for squats/deadlifts and the flexibility when doing things like burpees or push presses. Love the look as well (black/gum). There is a break in period of a few days, so expect that.",

I would caution buyers that the shoe isn\u2019t great for 400m runs and longer, but I would say the same for the metcon or the nano.

    "description": "Under Armour TriBase Reign Training Shoes When you hit the gym, you need to feel as connected with the floor as possible. Every lift, rep and WOD starts from the ground up. Under Armour's TriBase technology maximises ground control with three points of contact for a low, stable base that allows natural foot flexibility. Well-constructed upper The TriBase Reign are another in a long-line of well constructed shoes from Under Armour, built using tough ripstop materials and a durable mesh for lightweight support these are the perfect gym shoe. An external heel counter has also been added for increased stability and heel lock-in helping keep your feet in place. This helps reduces the risk of injury in the gym and gives you a more comfortable and tailored fit for your feet. TriBase The outsole contains Under Armour's TriBase technology. This technology has been adapted to maximise ground contact where your foot needs it the most, allowing you to have superior upwards flexibility. This will promote natural motion and ensure downwards flexibility can grip to the ground during lifts. TriBase has been designed to ensure that when you lift, you have maximum support from your shoes and your feet giving you the solid base you need. The low to the ground construction adds to this, allowing you for greater feel and power transfer during dead-lifts. As power transfer is essential during lifts, Under Armour have constructed the shoes with a strategic rubber built under the toe box for an even more powerful floor grip making these the perfect shoes not just for lifting but for all those intense workouts. Cushioned Midsole and Durable Outsole A full-length Micro G foam midsole has been added for ultimate responsive cushioning, this ensures that the TriBase Reign give you the full support you need in the gym during any type of workout. A full-rubber outsole wraps up the lateral and medial sides of the feet providing you with maximum support all around your feet. Adding to",
