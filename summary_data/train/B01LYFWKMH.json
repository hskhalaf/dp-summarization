I think the digital monitor is a little off (I think it says you're doing better than you actually are as far as calories, distances, and speed goes), but overall, it's literally my favorite buy ever! It's super-quiet (can't even hear yourself ride it), and it's perfect to keep you motivated. No more excuses as to why you can't cycle! Also! I'm 5' (on a good day), and this fits me perfectly on the shortest setting. Thinking even if I was an inch or two shorter, I'd still be able to work it. That was my biggest concern when purchasing it :)",

The bike came very quickly (free shipping, came in 4-5 days max) and was easily moved in the house. I was able to put the whole thing together, by myself, in 10 minutes. The directions are very clearly written and easy to follow. It's also pretty common-sensical. It's compact, fits nicely in my small space and does fold up. The bike is pretty sturdy and you can definitely work up a sweat. Great quality and great price. Perfect for moderately interested fitness or health folks looking for a low-investment piece for their home.",

Super easy to assemble. Our whole family has been LOVING this bike for cardio during quarantine. Doing it on level 4 and above will definitely make you break a sweat. The seat took a little adjusting to but once you get used to it (by the third ride) it\u2019s comfortable and enjoyable. Highly recommend this bike but do keep an eye on the price as it fluctuates frequently between $120-$150.",

For biking, you should be able to stretch your leg to a relaxed straight (basically straight, not absolutely straight) but for me, this bike is too small. While this is not the real problem, the big problem is, the resistance is weak, you can't work for sweat with it. So, OK for kids and a bit activity other than sitting at the desk for a whole day, not for serious workout.",

So compact, fits easily in 2 br, 1200 sq.ft condo, extremely quiet, great resistance, comfortable seat, well made all around.

      "text": "So quiet! I can hardly hear it. We have it in front of the TV. We live in Pasadena where apartments can be kinda small (for waaay too much money!) and it takes very little space. The controls are basic and we don't need anything more, we like basic. If you're looking for a solid built, no-nonsense exercise bike and don't want to spend hundreds, this is the bike. But if you want to spend 500 or more for a huge boat of a machine to hang your jacket on, be my guest. Glad I bought this one.",

I can't bend my right knee past 90 degrees so I needed something tall enough that I could adjust it to accommodate that limitation. On the longest setting I can use it and it feels great to be able to get some cardio exercise again! Very happy with the purchase and I hope my review can help someone else.",

I use it daily in my small apartment and it doesn\u2019t take up much space at all. Which was a huge selling point for me. It tracks your distance, heart rate, time, speed and calories. It has the loops for sneakers, so no specials shoes needed. And the seat is actually comfortable!! If you are looking for a good way to get some exercise in at home while you locked in or even just cause, and you don\u2019t want to spend an arm and a leg this is a great bike to have.

I feel like the calorie counter is also really off as it seems to burn calories super quickly. On another note, the pedals on my bike were dirty and covered in some gross dusty brown substance. But admittedly the bike does get the job done and the resistance on it is good, can definitely get a workout from it.",

The XTERRA Fitness FB150 Folding Bike is the perfect exercise tool to help you comfortably pedal away the calories. With folded dimensions of only 18.1\u201d x 18.1\u201d and built in transport wheels, it allows you to store it away when not in use and free up some valuable floor space. For troubleshooting the noise sounds: (1). Confirm if the unit is completely assembled and all bolts/nuts are tightened. Also, the seat height adjustment should be tightened. (2). Rotate the pedals, moving on to pulling on the pedal and crank arms to check for play/movement. (3). Separate the front covers to get a visual of the inside rotating assembly. (4). Look for anything making contact with the rotating assembly inside or if the parts rotate without a wobble.",
