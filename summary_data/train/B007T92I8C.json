It was a surprise gift for Easter, so I was worried, since he is so fanatical with his guitar quality, that he would think it was not great quality, but he really loves it! I really can't get over how great it sounded! I'm so proud of myself!",

It sounds really good, looks cool, is very sturdily built, and comes with a convenient screw-in 3-leg adjustable height stand. I paid twice as much more for a top-of-the-line Hilton Pro Guitar Limited Edition volume pedal, to get the best swell effect with it. (My pedal board's Boss volume pedal wasn't cutting it very well for this purpose.) I play to play it at times with my UU church band, once we get back to having in-person services someday. Looks like I'll have plenty of time to get competent on it, unfortunately.",

Its a simple fix if you have the ability to take the socket out and put the right size nut on the other side. Other than that it sounds good and plays smooth.",

It works well with both my amplifiers and produces a nice clear tone. The supplied legs are adjustable and make playing very comfortable. It also lends itself to many sounds through an effects pedal.
