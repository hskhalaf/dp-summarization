The bass is so unbelievably strong and the music so crisp, I almost regret ever purchasing other systems. I\u2019ve previously owned a Denon 5.1 System and a Pioneer receiver. You will not be disappointed. I promise you.",

After using the speaker alone for about a month a sprang for the second unit. Haven't regretted that decision for a minute. Pairing the two speakers was difficult as the instructions do not explain the process well. You must pair the speakers together before connecting to your bluetooth device (music source - Phone, Tablet, Computer, Etc) If one of the speakers pairs with your device before you attempt to pair the two speakers, they will not pair.",

Then I remembered this brand, and for the price decided it was worth a try. Upon opening the box I was filled with excitement. It\u2019s so elegantly designed. After testing out the sound, well... I may have danced around with joy. I can\u2019t recommend this more.",
