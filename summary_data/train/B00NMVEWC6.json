Put a battery AND a SSD slot in it and you can kill two birds - fix the storage issues and add battery backups and it wouldn't really raise the price since these are addons. This unit is the only windows machine I have seen using 7 and higher that does not have a \"no HD sleep\" setting while on battery. Therefore, it has to be plugged in for all updates or it will sleep during them. Skip a few updates in this way and you end up with a very unfriendly machine as my wife learned.",

As some others have said, the keyboard portion and the tablet portion feel flimsy and cheap. However, I've been using mine for about 7 months now and it is still operational. The only real big complaint that I have is that sometimes, when the lid is close, it will simply shut down. It's supposed to go into sleep mode. It doesn't happen everytime and it's hard to pinpoint the conditions in which this happens. Overall, it's a really good notebook/tablet.",

I wanted a mobile platform for writing code and reports, checking email and playing the occasional game. This did those things OK, but felt very cheap and was not very quick at doing any of it. I paid $450 for it, but for $510 I was able to get a Dell 13 7000 laptop that is vastly superior in every way except size. It's not bad, but it's at the expensive side for a tablet/portable combo and in that price range you have to compete with smaller laptops. In my case, the laptop won. Your mileage may vary.",

I am not sure if we just got a bad egg because none of the problems we are having have previously been reported, but weird issues such as occasionally turning it on to an insanely loud, mechanical noise that won't go away unless you manually CTRL+ALT+DEL shutdown. Not to mention, the keyboard has a really difficult time detecting the monitor when attached and beeps constantly as if the monitor is constantly sliding out even though it is not.

      "text": "I've had mine for over a month now and I'm liking it a lot. It's honestly a bit lacking in tablet mode, hence only four stars, but as a laptop it is quite good. The screen has a plastic layer; it's not glass like most tablets. It's also a bit bulky as a tablet, in part because of the large bezel. The extra width does result in a much more comfortable keyboard though. The keyboard and touchpad are both very solid. Performance wise this device is also pretty impressive. It's much faster than other Atom devices like the Venue 8 pro. Overall I like it.",
