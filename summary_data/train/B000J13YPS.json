Never trust made in China or Vietnam. Real UGG does not hide where fur connected to skin at top openings but these do , what do they try to hide? Apparently poor quality.",

I really look forward to coming home after a hard days work, taking off my socks and slipping these slippers on. What a luxurious feeling. I am regularly a size 8.5 but with no half sizes, I ordered an 8 and they fit perfectly. After a few days of breaking in, they are even stretching out for a little extra toe room. The apparent quality in materials and stitching lead me to believe they will last a very long time.",
