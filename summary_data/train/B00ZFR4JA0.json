The fastener holder is removable and it does have a light that may assist the right handed user. Cons: Unfortunately the handle is in my opinion exceptionally small which limits leverage. The bits are tiny and the fastener holder really does not provide sufficient grip. The light is on the left side and is blocked by the upper housing from which limits its use.",

      "text": "this screw driver is great for light duty work as the battery doesn\u2019t last long and requires frequent charging. The screw driver itself has challenges when screwing in a screw in hardwood as it feels like it is about to stop working. The convenient automatic drill bit changer is a great idea as you don\u2019t need to look around for various types of drills as these bits will do the job. I think this is a great addition to the kitchen draw for light work such as hanging pictures, etc and at the price you can\u2019t go wrong. I will keep mine for those everyday projects that pop up.",

The idea of having a screwdriver that holds all of the bits I need was a major plus for me, but I was worried about how it would actually work when it came down to the operation. Definitely made right, very easy to switch between drill bits, and the cartridge is removable so that you can keep multiple for different jobs. Torque is exceptional, and the battery life is great. Lithium powered was absolutely a plus. Overall exceptional product, very sturdy, super easy to use. Good for a variety of tasks around the house.",

First using the holding device prevents the screw from being screwed all the way into the wood as the screw holding arms are between the bottom of the screw head and the wood . Second it'll screw at a max 1\" screws. For screws longer than that the power is not enough and the motor stalls. Third the trigger is an on/off function. Power drivers need to have variable speed so that the screw can start at a slower speed until it catches and then sped up. I returned it",

I had trouble getting it to work at first because the action is very stiff, but I suspect that it will loosen up a bit with use. I noticed that the action is pre-lubricated with machine oil, so that's not the problem. This driver just looks cool and it works well. Just don't let a police officer see you holding one!",
