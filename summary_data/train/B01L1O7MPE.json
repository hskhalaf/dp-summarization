The fan definitely blows sufficiently and heats well, even on the low setting. The tip feature works well. Some of the heating elements are bent. So far, I am pleased with the heater, just not pleased that I received a return.",

The fan was so nice I even posted a mini review on my own social media.",

      "text": "I bought this so I could warm up my home office space without having to heat up the whole house. It heated up the room in about 15 minutes and kept it at temp the whole time. It is a wonderful product. It arrived on time and well wrapped so it wouldn't get damaged during shipping, I appreciated that. I would recommend this product if you need to heat up a small space. The safety feature worked, I tipped it over on purpose to see if it worked, and it shut off right away.",
