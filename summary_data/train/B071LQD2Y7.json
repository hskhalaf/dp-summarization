This stand allows you to play in \"tabletop\"mode while charging. Although it is a bit difficult to open, it folds to a compact size. Fits in the back pocket of my jeans, but I doubt it could survive being sat on. It also fits into the top of my Breath of The Wild Switch Travel case. Works great as a stand for the Switch, if you want to play on the integrated display with Joycons detached while charging. Has rubber grips, and posts on either side of the charger cutout to prevent sliding.",

I think the majority of my issue is with the compact nature of the JoyCons. The solution? Tabletop mode with a controller! I like having the ability to charge the console while playing. A perceived design flaw inherent to the Switch is the location of the USB port (on the bottom). A stand is required to charge in tabletop mode. This is a fully functional stand. It's plastic. It will probably break at some point. I will likely purchase another. WARNING: flat surface sold separately!",

A bit large, but a small sacrifice for that peace of mind. And the price isn't that bad either. I say, if you're worried the others will fall on you or won't last, go for it! Better to be safe than sorry with a $300 system.",

Searching on Amazon, I stumbled upon this stand. For the price, it is great and easy to use. However, my only dislike is that it can be a little unstable if you don\u2019t have it on a completely flat surface, such as an ottoman. All in all, worth the buy if you need something to put your switch on to charge and play.",
