I'd been taking a cheap brand from the Big Box stores for years until a friend pointed out that turmeric needs pepper or BioPerine to be absorbed efficiently into the body. I wish vitamin companies would realize that things like this are vitally important, because what is the point of manufacturing supplements that are cheap but don't work? And many of us don't have time to do extensive research. It didn't even take a week for me to notice the difference. Grateful!",

      "text": "Recently I read an article that stated the properties in turmeric, enhanced by black pepper, were shown to relieve pain, similar to that of ibuprofen. As a nurse I deal daily with mild back pain and I am aware of the detrimental long term use of ibuprofen on your stomach. Therefore I purchased this product and use it every day, not only to keep the inflammation at bay, but for all the other benefits provided by the turmeric/black pepper combination. Divine Bounty makes a quality product and One to two capsules a day have become part of my daily lifestyle.",

      "50% MORE POTENT, BEST VALUE - Our Turmeric Curcumin with BioPerine formula is the most potent on the market. A highly POTENT 750mg per capsule (most other brands are only 500mg per capsule). Turmeric also contains beta-carotene, vitamin C and calcium.",
      "HIGHEST QUALITY INGREDIENTS - Not only is our tumeric curcumin supplement more potent, we use the patented black pepper extract BioPerine (5mg) for increased absorption and bioavailability. Curcumin with black pepper is essential in good curcumin supplements. We only use the best, because you deserve the best!",
      "STANDARDIZED 95% CURCUMINOIDS - Normal turmeric only contains 2-6% curcumin. Yet studies show much of the health benefits come from the curcumin found inside. Beware of 'turmeric curcumin' formulas that simply contain a high dose of regular turmeric. We include Curcumin standardized to 95% curcuminoids, which means you're getting a highly potent dose of concentrated curcumin (not just regular turmeric).",
      "FEEL THE DIFFERENCE - We stand behind our tumeric curcumin supplement and are proud to have the best formula on the market. Give our tumeric pills a try and if you don't feel any difference, let us know.",
      "CLEAN, PURE & MADE IN USA - Many competitors include ingredients that are harmful or you do not need. Our formula is Gluten FREE and has no GMOS, binders, fillers, preservatives, artificial ingredients or stearates. There is also no soy, milk, egg, shellfish, wheat, peanuts or any other ingredients that shouldn't be in there. Best of all, it's made in an inspected facility following strict GMP guidelines to ensure purity and potency."
