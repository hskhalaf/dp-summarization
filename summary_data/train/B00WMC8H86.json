We wanted to keep him around to remind us of the wonderful years we had spent together . We looked around for reasonably priced quality urns. We purchased this one . When we received it ,we were totally blown away. The urn is high quality and beautifully etched brass. Christine from the Pet Memory shop sent us two emails to let us know the status of our order and contact info if we had any questions. If you are looking for an urn for your pet, don't think twice---order form Pet Memory shop. You will not be disappointed.",

The etching of the cat head was perfect for him, since it looked like an etched picture of him!we didn't think that we would be so devastated about his passing. However he was part of our family for nineteen years. Your product met our expectations and beyond. You personalized it with a lovely card which I felt was sp wonderful. I would recommend this product highly.",

Christine, the owner, emailed several times and I was surprised because not many owners do that now a days. The urn came very well packed and I had no trouble with the top as far as it screwing on and off. It had plenty of room for my tub of love kitty. The gold is very simple, not brassy or overly done. And that with the soft black, it looks elegant. So, honestly, it wasn't something I wanted to purchase, but I'm very pleased with it.",

A tip, place the velvet sack inside the urn with the draw string portion out at the opening. Use a wooden spoon handle to poke it around on the inside to line the urn. Cut the corner of the plastic bag the ashes were returned in and slowly pore them into the opening of the velvet bag. Tie off the velvet bag and tuck in the urn.
