It exceeded my expectations for quality of print, price and size. 4x6\" prints, fast print time and easy setup with their app. Easy to set up to wifi, make a template background and lock and set print display options. The guests loved it and were able to also send their photos to facebook, instagram, email and twitter. Plus we were able to keep all the photos taken. For the price and the amount of photos it could print, I would suggest this printer over and over again.",

Turns out, she likes using this one even when she\u2019s near her big printer. I bought her the 108 print toner and paper kit, which turned out to be a great idea. If you want a photo printer, get this one.",

The start up time after plugging in and turning on may be a tad longer and this engine has never been fast, but that is entirely masked by the ease of printing directly from the phone. I haven't tried the buttons or screen as I've never seen a need.",

      "text": "I think I figured it out. When you open the photo app on your phone you have to click share and then click print. So far not a bad printer it prints really fast but the coloring is off. If the original picture is a really good picture and have the perfect lighting then it will print just fine. Once I print a picture you can definitely see the difference. I am wondering is it worth keeping and spending money buying ink and paper or just spend money going to Walmart and have them print them. I ma still not sold on if I want to return it or not.",

The pictures themselves are good. To me, colors look slightly washed out. My quick fix for this is just turning up the saturation in my pictures before I send them to the printer. After turning up the saturation, the pictures look better to my eyes. I wish there was an adjustment on the printer itself but I couldn't find one.",

The print speed is a bit slow at a little over a minute from file send to being done, but the prints were great little souvenirs to take home. Now I\u2019ve used it at home to get prints off my phone. They are a little small at 4x6 but the quality is good. Just be sure to have good color on your phone and the prints will be great.",
