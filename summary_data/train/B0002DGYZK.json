We have used this type of perch for years, and have always had nicely trimmed nails on our birds. They get quite sharp without regular care. One bird is quite traumatized when getting nails trimmed, so this is a good alternative for her.",

The neutral color and modest size did nothing to intimidate her and after a week, I've noticed her claws are slightly less sharp. My one gripe is that it arrived cracked across a narrow portion, but whatever is being used as a core has kept it from affecting the stability. The washers included as anchors are very large compared to most perches I've bought, which is wonderful and appreciated.",

It actually fell down while my bird was on it even though I (erroneously) thought that it was secured. At first I though, \"no big deal\" and intended to pick up a larger washer at the local home big box store. Not easily accomplished since the bolt is small enough that in order to get a washer big enough to fit the circumference of the perch itself, the center holes of the washers were all too large, thus, making the wingnut not able to fit tightly. Not worth the hassle, or the money.",
