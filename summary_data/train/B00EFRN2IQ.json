Sims 4 has nice graphics and character creation, but they've stripped the game down so much that there is little to do. It makes the game boring until more content could be added. It's actually very disappointing. I'm glad I waiting for the $29.99 sale, but it's not even worth that much. I'd say it's more worth around $19.99. Very disappointing...I hope that future Sims games improve. I was looking forward to being impressed...not this time.",

I don't mind the small lots and little travel because I rarely ever had my sims go anywhere in TS3. So TS4 works just fine for me. Patches have likely made this game better overall since it's debut, and it will likely just continue to get better. In all, I recommend the game.",
