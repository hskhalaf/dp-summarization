The bolt (mine was 6mm, not 8mm as others have said) that holds the seat rails was so tight I couldn't loosen it. And I have the long allen wrenches with handles that the bike shops use, and which allow a lot of force to be used. So how'd I loosen it? Since I don't have a vise, I put a put a pipe wrench around the seat post, another pipe wrench around the allen wrench handle, pretended I was the incredible hulk, and it barely worked.",

From a former bike mechanic and racer this is the only flaw I see, but is one I find unexcusable. Now I either need to return, or buy a hex wrench size that I have never needed in 35+ years.
