Also I had many leaves leak out of the ball, not really sure how that happened since it seems pretty closed up once you turn it shut. I would not recommend this for someone looking to get the most out of their brew.",

I bought this so I could drink an herbal peach tea and ,while it prevents the larger pieces from slipping into my mug, it does little for the smaller bits. Also the turning mechanism in the handle has started to become loose after consistent use after a couple weeks. When I clean, I need to use individual scrub brush bristles to clean the individual holes. Overall, don't think I would recommend this or buy again, though I am not so dissatisfied that I am going to prematurely throw it out.",

I thought about buying a cheaper type of tea ball but I can see this one will last a while so I think it was worth it. I've used it every day for a week, and it seems well built.",

Better than the reusable bags, as they stain, mold, and get tea caught in them. This is the way to go!!!! Own three, one for work, home, and cabin.",

I use a larger leaf tea but I can see that a lot iof vigorous stirring would have smaller leaves escaping. But it's not been an issue for us at all. Easy to dump and rinse- no rusting yet. So far we are very satisfied- this was a Christmas gift.",
