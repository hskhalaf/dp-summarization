I slept till 10am or even till noon one day while other campers struggled to sleep past 8-9am because their tents were too warm or bright that early. Everyone wanted to hang out at my tent and everyone kept asking where I got it. I set it up easily by myself in about 15 min, maybe less.",

I do wish they would have the blackout material on the ENTIRE bottom half of the tent. The material works but it's only on the window flaps so, not getting the most out of the technology.",
