You're already going to spend 40 or 50 bucks, go for it and get one that will last a while and really look nice. It doesn't need any programming, you just set some configurations on the app for your phone and it does the rest. It can tell when you're home and will adjust the temp accordingly. You can also set it through the thermostat itself. It's already started to save me money by keeping the temps at the appropriate level and not heat the house when no one is home. Hope this helps!",

The lack of IFTTT integration was another strike against. I really like the idea of geo-fencing, Lyric does it, Nest doesn't unless you get a third party app. The app was five bucks, I bought the app. Lyric is fine if you don't really want to play around with it, but Nest is just a better experience.
