I would suggest this to people who wouldn't be bothered by the loud noises in a hard floor environment; I would suggest it if you have carpeting or plan to keep this toy outdoors.",

They don't make much of a mess either which is a plus. The bacon scent seems to peak her interest too. She knows they are for her and won't chew on other items.",
