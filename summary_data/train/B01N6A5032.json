Trust me, Snapclips are on a whole other level... Should be weightlifting product of the year.",

Now that I have multiple collars, all my bars can be used at the same time (safely). I did a quick angle test to make sure they hold. Loaded 100 lbs on one side of my straight bar and angled my bar up about 45* from the floor, and the collar held. Didn't even budge. My bar ends aren't smooth, so I'm sure that helps.",

I bought a pink pair because, well, not only is pink my favorite color, but I figured it would be easy to identify if someone were trying to \"borrow\" them (and accidentally walk out the gym with them ... ahem!).",

They are small enough to fit in my gym bag with the rest of my gear and they never get snagged on anything in my bag even when I reach for them underneath everything. I ordered the black ones. They are a shiney plastic. I put a couple stickers and wrote on them with a silver sharpie just in case someone tries to snag them.",
