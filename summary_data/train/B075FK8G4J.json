Seems a little pricey given the original playset had more activities and cost a few dollars more. It was more exciting to explore the first time but doesn't get too much play time.",

Also, you can store hatchimals in here. You just have to put them in specific places where they won't be in the way of the playset closing. Some other reviewers said they couldn't store their hatchimals in there. Anyways, great product!",
