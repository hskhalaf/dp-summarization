This red was fairly close to my copper red, and different color of the bangs is not nearly as evident in person as it is in the pictures. Several friends thought I had actually cut bangs! This is a really fun product. I went with a group as Doctor Who companions, and these were the perfect bangs for Donna Noble!",
