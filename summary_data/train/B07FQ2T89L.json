Only configuration which is perfectly can be done remotely without visiting sites. This camera controls are very simplified and intuitive what you can do from NVR the same thing can be done via app on your phone which is a great thing. I would definitely recommend this brand for CCTV installers. I've been tracking their product for awhile now and always try their newest things including their 8M camera which is great. Additionally they have MicroSD card slot so even you loose internet connectivity you probably won't loose footage.",

Compared to my dome cams which suffer with IR reflections this thing really shines. Day picture is stellar and the POE functionality made wiring easy and super clean. FTP function is great, not even using the SD card so I have all my videos in one place. The web app is, well the web app, but it's not terrible. The mounting system is odd and feels a bit flimsy with the exterior being metal and the actual mount points being plastic. I'd definitely pay another $15 for this exact same camera with metal mounts.",

Can't speak to the Reolink recording or monitoring software as I just push the feed to my NVR, ivideon, which I highly recommend. It's free with optional upgrades if you want cloud backup and way better than much pricer NVR options like blue iris.",

Even with sensitivity set to the lowest level the motion alarm is triggered every 30 seconds with the shadow of the tree moving in your set area of detection. On partly cloudy days, the same motion sensor is triggered by the sun going behind the clouds or coming back out as the brightness in the lens of the camera is changing and that alone is enough to set it off. So unless you're using it indoors, or you don't plan to use the motion alerts, don't waste your money.",

I have to say I have never had a camera easier to set up that this. As soon as I plugged it in and it initialized, the app recognized it and added it to the stream, literally less than 2 minutes. The construction is solid and I am excited to add more to the network.",

Really quick and easy setup, works well with my existing NVR software but also find the Reolink app responsive and easy to navigate. Very good 5MP image and video quality. And for the price, I'm impressed with what I got. Most comparable cameras I found going for significantly more. Had to pose a question to Support as the website isn't the easiest to navigate, but Support was able to answer my questions and overall had a great experience.",
