Original: These shoes look and feel great, but on day 2, after only about 3 or 4 miles of walking, the sole has started coming off of the canvas. I'm very disappointed that these shoes are not as well made as I expected. I'm still enjoying my Superior 4s, but I will probably return these.",

If you need arch support there is not much there. I do not need arch support, but I can feel the lack of support. Get some proper insoles if you want to use these to run or walk in. They are a fun casual shoe that gets many compliments for me.",
