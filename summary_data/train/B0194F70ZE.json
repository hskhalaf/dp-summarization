Only reason I did not give this 5 stars is the direction of the pockets are different on either side, so you have to open it flat or some things will fall out. At first I thought it was defective but it matches the seller's photo.",

I am using the case daily and I can open it up without anything falling out, since I have put my vape pen with the cartridge on the side with the elastic and mess pocket so that my pens through the elastic hold and the mesh is on the top part holding my cartridge mouth piece in place, while the pockets on the other side hold my charger and cover for my cartridge. It protects my items like I wanted and it is a pretty color purple.",

Charger comes in handy for her phone as well.",
