It\u2019s obvious my Beagle is quite comfortable in it. She takes her job very seriously and was proudly strutting her stuff in this harness. I love that it\u2019s pink too! It\u2019s very quick & easy to get on & off. Sizing chart is accurate. I\u2019m going to order one for my mom\u2019s diabetic service dog as well.",

Please keep in mind that this vest is only good for a certified service dog. There is a metal ring on this vest that you attach the leash to. If your dog isn't a true service dog and wants to run at another dog then the vest won't be as reliable as having the leash attached to the collar and you will be facing charges. Don't order this vest unless your dog is trained very well.",

The clip works great and it's padded for his comfort. It's smaller than our previous harness and that is really good for hot days. My pup is black and white so I think the color compliments him. The only warning I have is if your dog sheds a lot the fur does get stuck in the velcro so to keep up appearances I have to pick it out.",
