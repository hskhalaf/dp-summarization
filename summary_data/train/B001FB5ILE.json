I found the scent to be light and pleasant, unlike the shaving balm which does have a stronger fragrance and I did receive comments about it's scent. Lastly, online seems to be the only place to find this product as it has been removed from the shelves every retail drugstore where I used to buy it. I highly recommend the product.",
