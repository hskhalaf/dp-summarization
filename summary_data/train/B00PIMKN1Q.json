My Macbook Pro started having some issues with a few keys (coffee spillage) and I needed a temporary keyboard before I replace the native one. I placed my first order for the Amazon Basic keyboard, which turned out to be too small (black on the pics) This one (white on the pics) is pretty much identical to the native Macbook Pro in terms of key sizes, spacing and layout. The keys are slightly \"higher\" than the Macbook's. Paired easily and seems to be working great. Internal battery with USB charging is a plus.",

I bought an iPad as a replacement for my computer which was running extremely slow. I bought this keyboard and a stand and haven't looked back. Its sleek and modern looking. I only bring the keyboard when I need it to save on space. My partner has complained about the battery save mode which will disconnect when you don't use it for a while, he says the restart time is too long. But I haven't had any problems.",

Here's why: - Works really well. - Much lighter, quieter, and thinner than the Logitech (430?), which makes typing in a classroom less awkward. - Shallower keys, so easier to type for me. I know folks out there are raving about mechanical keyboards. This is not, if you want the opposite of mechanical keyboards, like I do, then it is for you. - Connection isn't as perfect as the Logitech, and sometimes (very briefly) lags, but can be resolved by holding a key for a couple seconds. - Rechargeable, so I don't have to worry about destroying the earth.",

One of the worst being the space bar, it usually doesn't work (unless you hit right in the center--which is stupid & slow) and yet sometimes creates double spaces? Mainly, no spacing in all my text so it's REALLY slowing me down (and I'm a grad student with homework so this is mortifying). Also, the caps button is off too. overall just jenky product, so disappointed. Such a struggle to use that it wastes time and creates frustration.",

After suggesting several things to try, Anker determined it was a hardware problem and shipped me a replacement which I received 2 days later. You couldn't ask for a more responsive solution. This isn't a one time incident. Each time I've contacted customer service, I've been impressed with how they handle things. Excellent.

I haven't had issues with the auto-sleep that other users mention- it takes several minutes at the very least for mine to 'go to sleep' and it wakes quickly. Very lightweight, easy to slip into a bag and bring along. The keys move well enough and don't stick, although the action is about what you'd expect for a portable keyboard. The function keys are really handy with iOS. Keyboard cases add bulk to the case, cramp the keyboard and they're much more expensive. I'd strongly recommend this as a solution for anybody looking to word process on a mobile device.",

It disconnects as soon as you stop using it for a minute, I'm not a fan of having to wait for it to reconnect each time I want to go back to typing, but I dealt with it. Now one of my arrow keys stopped working, so I need to buy a new keyboard because I use them a lot. OK as a budget keyboard if you need something to tide you over until you can afford something better.",

As an example, you will constantly be hitting \"Function-S\" instead of \"Control-S\" to save. The keys were not as responsive as I had hoped. I had to hit some keys about three times for them to work. Otherwise, the price was cheap, Bluetooth appeared to work fine and the keys were comfortable to type on.

There are 6 rubber strips on the bottom that keep it from sliding around. The control keys are labeled for either PC or Mac users. The on/off switch is right on the side, and easy to reset if it goes to sleep while you are in thought. Only thing I'd like to see as an option with this keyboard is a cover.",

It didn't, nor did the instructions say anything about alternative ways to get it to pairing mode. Considerable googling before I finally found a web page with the \"Fn-z\" backdoor to force pairing. I came really close to sending this back right out of the gate because of this though.",

I would spend the extra money to get the rechargeable version versus the replaceable battery option. All of the devices you will probably use this keyboard with are rechargeable so you might as well purchase an accessory to accompany it that is rechargeable as well.",
