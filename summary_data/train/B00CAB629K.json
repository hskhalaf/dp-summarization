I can actually feel the vibrations when I use these and I love it. Depending on the song the treble can get a little muddy but I find that most of my music, even if there isn't a lot of bass, still sound great with these. The have held up really well since I've had them and they feel like really good quality. I hope to never lose these but if I do I'm definitely repurchasing.",

Two, if you use them for video call on skype or whatever, you cannot move around much. These all come down to the fact that these headphones line wires terribly made. It makes these hollow muffle noises if you brush the line just barely. I had strong expectations that these were going to be good but not super amazing headphones. Pretty disappointed no lie. Though the sound quality is good for its price. Hopefully they fix this issue",

It says 3 button but I can only play pause skip and go back with them no volume up or down, little disappointed but not a big deal. I am using them on an iPod 5th gen. The plug is at a 90 degree angle. I use these 5 days a week on my way to school on the train. They cancel out sound good. The wire is long enough for me which is good cuz I'm 6'6 and most headphones are to short, so this is a plus. Great headphones overall",
