The anti-wobble is a knob on the bottom that you thighten instead of using a wrench to tighten a bolt. Makes it a lot easier to remove and install. This rack also includes a 1 1/4 to 2\" hitch adapter that works great. Feels pretty heavy duty although is pretty hefty. Guessing that means it is steel rather than aluminum alloy. Still, it comes in at a reasonable price and is a quality product.",

      "text": "Awesome hitch rack. Love that it comes assembled and that it folds so I can put in my trunk when not in use. The locking mechanism works very well to prevent theft. Very slick looking and it does not interfere with my car's parking sensors. Only wished the YAKIMA logo was not a cheap vinyl decal that I am sure is going to peel/weather off soon.",

On a side note, do to the different style bikes we have ( hybrids, bmx etc), 4 in all, i am glad i chose the 5-bike hitch as i had to skip the middle holder to get all the different bikes on. Also, if you have a female framed bike- i would recommend you get the bike carry attacher rod (sorry, can't remember what it is called) and again yakima has a great quality one!",

We have traveled across the state with bikes on this rack and we didn't have to worry at all. FYI, we own a jeep and have a larger spare tire on the back. Because the tire stuck out so much we did have to purchase a hitch extender in order to use this bike rack. Not a big deal but was an extra purchase. Overall, this bike was well worth the money if you have nicer bikes you want to take care of.",
