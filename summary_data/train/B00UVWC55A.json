After doing some research and calling KENWOOD (they had no idea and referred me to Crutchfield) I found it on the Crutchfield website. 10 AWG is sufficient for wiring this amp. The power/ground posts are so small you cant fit much bigger than 10AWG unless you had some special connectors to accommodate. I am very happy with this amp and would highly recommend it for the average stereo guy. It ain't gonna break windows or peg decibel meters but it sounds great.",

It gave me a lot more room underneath my seat. After I watched the youtube video by Dereck W. and saw the good price on Amazon, I was sold. This was my first class D amp and I can't hear any switching noise or junk. If you crank the gain controls way up, then you can hear the white noise, but with the gain at levels that matched my last amp, the hiss is barely audible with the vehicle off.",

I used them to power a set of Morel components (active) and Morel coaxials. One of the amplifiers is bridged down to 2 channels for the Morel woofers, the other drives the component tweeters and the rear coaxials. Bought these because I used to be a Kenwood fan but haven't used them in a long time. They still build some solid mobile audio gear and I wouldn't hesitate to buy these mini-amps again!",

The amp can be tucked away out of sight in small places and that's a main benefit for those who want a great sounding system without sacrificing appearance. I would definitely recommend, it was not designed to be the loudest most powerful but it is just right for those who want something a bit more at an affordable price.

This Kenwood KAC-M3004 amp has similar specification to the Mopar/Kicker Amp. I made my own harness using Metra radio and reverse wire harness. I did have to tap into the rear speaker out from the radio the get the 'un-filtered' signal. Now I maintained all factory functions. (Uconnect, Steering wheel control, front/rear/left/right fader control.) I also made a bracket to piggy-back on to the Mopar/Kicker amp. Hope this helps!",

    "description": "Many of today's power sports have very limited space to work in and tend to be a harsh environment for electronics because of the exposure to outdoor environments. Kenwood's compact performance amplifiers are small in size so they fit even the most limited installation areas. The amplifiers also use a conformal coated main pcb (printed circuit boards) which offer extra layers of protection to help prevent moisture or damp air from damaging the product. - Rms power output 2o: 75w x 4 - perfect for boats, atv's, motorcycles, cars and more - dimensions(wxhxd): 6-1/2\" x 1-3/4\" x 3-7/8\".",
