One thing that needs to be improved is the way the zipper is installed at the bottom of the jacket. It is difficult to fit the two pieces together because the straight prong is way to small. When clothing manufactuers want to reduce costs one of the first things to go are decent zippers. Still I give the jacket a solid 4 stars on quality, and price and go one size short off the chart.

Also the zipper sports a really tiny starter tooth, my only two complaints. I have to teach my left hand to pull a zipper...gasp!
