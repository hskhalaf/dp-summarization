Though it received many satisfactory reviews, others could not help but compare it in favor of its predecessor.

Overall, the Guide ISO 2 is a comfortable shoe, but it still needs some improvements to achieve a completely praiseworthy performance.",

I made a slight purchase error (my fault), buying the Gide modem instead of the Ride (which is what I wanted). Due to stupid manufacturer naming, it's an easy mistake to make.",
