The only way to turn the unit off was to pull the plug. Sometimes this would \"reboot\" the unit making the control buttons work again for a time, but they would inevitably stop working again. So we returned the unit, which is challenging given its size and weight.",

That would be done away with probably by letting it use room air rather than hooking up the hose that brings in outside air but it would still have to bring air in to replace what the exhaust takes away so it's pretty much a wash that way. Sometimes water condenses on the outside but that's mostly because we like a cold room for sleeping.",

Without insulation, it is REALLY hot.",

    "description": "Style Name:Air ConditionerA key feature of this portable air conditioner is its compact size and dual-hose system which facilitates better space utilization and more efficient cooling. The Whynter ARC-122DS portable air conditioner is the ideal solution for the warm spots in your home, office, server room or other constrained area. Portable and easy to set up, this portable air conditioner offers cooling relief for any area where excess humidity and heat cannot be remedied by traditional air conditioning. The unit can be easily setup in almost any indoor location and is most commonly used in data closets/server rooms, bedrooms, classrooms and garages or workshops. The Whynter ARC-122DS portable air conditioner provides 12,000 BTU cooling output while maintaining a compact and portable profile. The dehumidifier mode allows you to extract 76 pints of excess moisture during a 24-hour period. Equipped with an intake and exhaust hose, this system allows for more air intake, cooling power, and constant air pressure, which results to a faster cooling rate compared to single-hose units (can be operated as single hose as well). save energy and money by setting the unit to run only when you need it. Using the 24 hour programmable timer, the ARC-122DS can efficiently cool your space before you even get there. The timer allows you to set the unit to cycle on automatically, or once it is on, you can set it to automatically turn off. Equipped with a remote control that can easily control the Speed, temperature, and dehumidifier settings even from a distance, the Whynter ARC-122DS also comes with rolling casters that will allow you to move the portable air conditioner room to room.
