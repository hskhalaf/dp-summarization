He walks kind of funny when it first goes on. No one is allowed to laugh at him (openly). Then he forgets all about it. Not too sure he even knows he is peeing. Looks more like a corset than a diaper. Works great with liner or without. No problems with the washing machine & dryer. I would buy this again. Very inexpensive compared to buying shoes for other people.",

They bunch a little but don\u2019t slip off his \u201cjunk\u201d so my furniture is protected. He comes to me on occasion, looking ashamed and walking funny cause he peed his pants. It helped when my female pug was in heat because he couldn\u2019t get to her, but I wouldn\u2019t trust them for doggie birth control in general. I\u2019m definitely going to buy more of these awesome wraps!!",

One big problem - it says on the label and on website that it stretches to support a 35\" waist. It doesn't - not even close. The most this fabric will stretch to is 30\". But if you tried to put it on an animal with a 30\" waist, it would be so tight as to cut off blood flow. Also, you'll have a real struggle trying to get it on. If your animal has anything larger than about a 28\" waist, this contraption isn't for you. If your animal is smaller, this looks like a fine solution to a piddle-problem.",

The only time he has trouble with incontinence is when I come home and he gets so excited that he can't hold it. I use one of the heaviest human incontinence pads to line these belly wraps and that solves the problem of having to disinfect his crate and wash bedding every time I leave him. These are soft with just enough stretch so I think he's comfortable. They are durable in the wash. I recommend them highly.",

It was durable for hand and machine washing. I bought 2 so I could always have a clean, dry one. It also seems to make my dog feel less apt to have an accident in the home. Highly recommend. Other wraps in leg stores are fav more pricey, too.",

There are a few added layers of fabric in the right spot just in case the pad shifts. I would highly recommend using adult male urinary incontinent pads because they are meant for the correct anatomy, are thicker and also have elastic to prevent leaks to the wrap and beyond and cheaper! If you decide to use these instead of dog or female pads, order the wrap in one size up. Hope this helps!",

I think it will work in the smaller size, and the seams on the side seem like it will give our dog the comfort he lacks in the other belly band we tried. A note on sizing doxies - in the past I've never gone wrong by following the size chart (ex Puppia harnesses) even with the odd shape of the doxie body, which is the basis for my 3-star rating. Exchanges are a hassle and it seems the sizing chart is universally off on this product description.",

It may be the cotton wore out faster. I use these for my disabled corgi by cutting a Poise pad in half and then overlapping the two halves in the belly band. Works pretty well though the medium (which fits his waist) is narrower than the two Poise pads. The velcro is still good even in one I have that is so worn it has holes in it. The elastic has not fared as well and several have lost their elasticity after numerous washes.",

I can't say that HE loves it, but that's life. I hate cleaning pee, so he's got to wear the wrap until we can get him to stop.",

If you put a pad on the inside, it helps but the pad gets bunched up and the urine runs into the inside padding which will then absorb through to the outside. I think this problem would be alleviated entirely if the outside material was some sort of plastic. It's still a good concept and seems to work. The ribbing stays in the place and the dogs (we have two boys) generally won't remove it so that tells me it's pretty comfortable.",
