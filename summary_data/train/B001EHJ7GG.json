I felt this was the safest option, the most enclosed area ( with smallest entrance/openings), the best slide, strong material, and best reviews. We have used this inside and outside. This is very easy to start up and take down. The only thing is I wish was the side opening would Velcro together the entire length of the opening, but I love this! Great way to get the wiggles out in the northern winters! Oh and very fast shipping!",

It is a bit loud, but it is quieter than other bounce houses that neighbors have bought for their children! Would reccomend.",

Its easy to set up and take down...I'd say 3-5 minutes for either. I would advise you put some cushions right outside the entrance in case a little one rolls out when the flap is open. its not a high drop, but would save on tears if its on concrete.",
