It worked great until a few weeks ago, when I noticed that he had developed quite a bit of gas and was increasingly fussy. We tried adding gripe water and other supplements to the formula, but that didn't work. We switched him to Enfamil Gentlease and everything has been much better. No need for the supplements!",
