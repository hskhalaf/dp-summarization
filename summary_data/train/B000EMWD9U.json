      "text": "The output of this inexpensive camera is great. Well exposed and sharp across the board. The \"Auto\" mode will satisfy almost any shooting condition you come across. The \"Program\" mode will add even more control for the unusual type of subject. With another 18 modes to use, if needed, almost anything you would want to record is possible. The only shortcoming I can find is the weak builtin flash, but this is a common shortcoming to almost every point and shoot digital camera. The real plus of this camera is the long zoom range. Coupled with a really good lens it makes this an outstanding camera in it's price range.",

The cover over the computer cord receptical is a little flismy. And I've run batteries low while downloading to computer but that was more my error. The lack of stabilization has not caused problem. Overall, its what I anticipated and would but again.",

We live in a very dry climate and have had no problems and only had problems on our vacation in Mexico. Other than that it has been a great camera.",

I will admit the the flash recycle time may take 2-3 seconds but its really nothing to get worked up about unless you take alot of pictures at night or really dark places. Me, I just snap pictures of my 2 year old son outdoors in the day and in the house under regular and dim lighting conditions and the pictures are always about 90% acceptable. Considering this is Not a $800+ dollar Digital SLR camera, this is a pretty good percentage in my opinion.",

It got stuck in Play mode and will not switch back to the camera mode. Seems minor, but i will just wait and see what they say. So i gave it a 4 out of 5. 5 of 5 for sure if it didn't break.",

In a first for a 6x optical zoom digital compact camera, the PowerShot A700 features a real-image optical viewfinder, allowing fast framing and precise manual focusing without the LCD.\n\n The camera also has optional wide (0.7x) and telephoto (1.75x) converter lenses to extend the focal length range, for an effective 15x optical zoom. It is also compatible with optional close-up lenses for detailed macro photography.
