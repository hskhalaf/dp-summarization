And there is no way to reach them for product support on the issue without giving them my phone number (even via email) so I cannot contact them so I am returning this very expensive drive. Was a wonderful wonderful company, bought by Seagate, which is a dive company, and now they are taking LaCie down with them.",

Totally expected and the raring 3 out of 5 reflects the disconnection between the T3 component and its real performance. Wished laCie had made available the cache card offered for the T2 version",
