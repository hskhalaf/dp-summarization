I have used it to cut up and down about 35 young trees and wild privet hedges where a chain saw is too much power and heavy duty ratcheting loppers are not enough. It works well. I would recommend that you always carry the socket tool with you to open the hatch and adjust the chain because it will slip off from time to time or may get caught under compression of the weight of the tree. I believe they made it primarily for branches. The mini chain saw comes out and cuts side to side when you push on the handle. I will post a photo later.",

Sure the battery charger isn't the best, however once charged, the battery definitely lasts long enough for most jobs around the yard.

It worked fine out of the box for several sessions and I was about to rate it as a 4/5 but more recently the product has become recalcitrant by only sporadically engaging the limb to be cut. This in itself may be understandable and fixable - but what is not - is my inability to reach anybody at the customer help line. On hold for 20 minutes on 2 separate occasions and then left my # for promised callback - about a month ago and still counting.

We have a lot of buckthorn to clear from our property and this has made our tedious job much easier. It holds a charge a long time. The saw is light and easy to handle. However, the chain has needed sharpening several times already and I've ordered a spare to use while the other chain is being sharpened. I suspect the buckthorn, which is quite sappy this time of year, has been the cause of the dull chains, but it's far easier to handle than any of our chainsaws and seems safer to use as well.",

Maybe I misread the small print somewhere, but the branches I had hoped to cut down will have to wait until I order the additional part. Then again the battery wouldn\u2019t last long enough anyway. Highly recommend ordering a second battery when purchasing to avoid having to wait around!",

The battery life was better than I expected, but it helps to have a spare. I've had my Jawsaw for almost a year, and wish I'd found it sooner.",

      "text": "works as advertised and really is a timesaver. I had piles of larger branches laying around and I could just walk along the length without bending over and one handed lop everything into manageable lengths. It will cut stuff as large as the opening, but be patient and let the blade to the work. Liked the automatic oiler and the plunging action really does work well. I was going to get the other chain lopper by the other company but that works like a big pair of scissors, so was a two handed operation and more awkward. This is perfect for chopping up stuff on the ground.",

So I recommend getting additional batteries if you plan on cutting for longer than a half hour at a time.
