It\u2019s seems like it would be super comfortable and exactly what I had hoped for but it\u2019s dirty and there are puncture marks/ tear on the corner.not to mention little chunks torn. Was this maybe a returned product? There are smudge like fingerprints all over the top. So now do I just deal with the product or return it and wait for it to arrive and then get the replacement? Wasted time. This very well could have been a fluke but disappointed since I needed to use this for guests visiting.",

I am using this in conjunction with the Beckham luxury plush topper/pad and my bed feels better than it did brand new. I can't believe it. The plush topper is also an incredible value. Definitely recommend buying them both together.",

It unfolded easily and I followed the instructions for allowing it to air before putting a mattress cover and sheet on it. The grand kids loved the comfort also so it was a winner for us!",

      "text": "I love this mattress topper it makes my bed soooo much more comfortable! Even for only being 1.5 inches it makes a big difference. I'm a college student sleeping on an apartment provided mattress that has pretty uncomfortable springs that bulge out but with this topper the springs aren't even noticeable. I was quite surprised how deformed it was after opening the box and it didn't seem to be filling/straightening out very well but I gave it a few more days and it is completely fine so don't be discouraged if it's not flat after a day or two. Overall though love this product, great quality for a low price.",

We used it to sleep in the back of our Pathfinder and as a topper on a very worn mattress. Slept like a baby every time.",

We covered them with two 'EarthTrek Extra Large Zippered Travel Sleeping Bag Liners' so the mattresses would be protected and easier to roll. It looks like this will probably work fairly well for us. My only criticism is the Zinus topper was beginning to delaminate on one corner. I've read other reviews with the same complaint. Time will tell weather these hold up to our needs or not. My only other concern is that the 'memory foam' layer may become stiff and hard during cold weather camping.",
