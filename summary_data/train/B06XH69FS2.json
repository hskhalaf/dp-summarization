The small piece of paper outlining the directions was hard to read and wish it could've been color coded but realize that is hard to do. Maybe include a color picture of the completed puzzle with the instructions though. Overall, I think the kids will enjoy them. Hoping the don't find them too challenging.

The gear puzzle is easy to solve, but difficult to actually put together; I am generally pretty good at this sort of puzzle, but I\u2019ve been totally unable to get all of these pieces to stay together.
