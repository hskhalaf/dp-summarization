We have a dog that swims with us, and I can have him climb on the front section of the kayak with me in the seat area. I can paddle around with him sitting in the front area. The dog is about 80 pounds, so he is not little. The kayak is very stable in the water. They came with paddles, which are suitable. Lot of fun! Reasonably priced, too!",

Comparing it to an inflatable (Intex K2) I can go into areas to explore where I\u2019d doubt and wouldn\u2019t go with the K2 due to puncture incidents...a definite plus seeming I enjoy doing just that. The support from the seat is a big jump as compared to the K2. I can also sit crisscrossed or extend my legs out. I\u2019m 5\u201910 @ 215 lbs. No challenges from this to complain about. A fun new hobby to enjoy. Hope this review helps out.",
