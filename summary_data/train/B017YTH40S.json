      "text": "I have had my Asus ROG for over a year now and still love it..great to play games on because of the large screen and good graphics, plus very fast and good to look at. I also use it for Office, Facebook, Twitter, photographs, streaming, music and sometimes downloading TV programmes. I love the huge keyboard (USA) and the lighting behind the keys....Intel Core 17 and Geforce GTX. Brilliant screen, and lots of features......My favourite laptop and I have four of them....only my specialty made by tech guys desk top is faster. I recommend it now I have used it for a year.",

I've managed to break a couple of buttons while playing FIFA and had to order some spares for a around 50-ish pounds, but that's the only problem I've had with it. Very very pleased with it. Been doing software development with SDK, VM, lots of browser tabs open and playing FIFA while smashing the buttons because my reptilian brain thinks it will make the footballers run faster. 10/10 would buy again.",

It can virtually play anything you can think of with these graphics and I just love it ! I love the 17'' display, compared to my previous laptop this is definitely a massive upgrade!! One con about the manufacturing is that it's extremely heavy. Other than that it's perfect! Also it arrived by 22 July as stated, which is great!",
