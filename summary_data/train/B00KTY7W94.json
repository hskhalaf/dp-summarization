I put them inside of pill pockets; to make them tasty for her, since she doesn't like to chew tablets. She hasn't had any bowel problems since I started using Amazing Probiotics and I only give her one tablet daily. If I were to change anything, I would make the tablet into a soft chew, but that's a minor issue. I would recommend these probiotic tabs for anyone who wants to improve the bacteria culture in a dog's digestive tract, even if there wasn't a problem.",

One of my dogs has digestive trouble and compared to the Purina probiotics, this product is not helping with the loose stool or odor.

She is getting around easier, and her digestion seems like it\u2019s back on track. She\u2019s taking 2 of the probiotic tablets daily, and that seems about right.
