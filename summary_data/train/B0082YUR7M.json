I strongly suggest to anyone installing any amp to allow for plenty of air flow! they blow When an amp gets hot, If they get too hot you could get a fire, Mostly what happens is you will \"RAT: the speakers. If you don't know what that is, go sit in an old car with original speakers and turn the radio all the way up !",

My stereo was a C- before I installed this and now I give it a solid A-! Highly recommend to anyone.

I'm not much of a car electronic person so it did take me almost 8 hours to put this in but I'm also a perfectionist and had to have everything in the right place. Overall totally happy with this product but if you arent a tech guru I recommend you ensure you have a weekend to install it.",

If you want earth shattering bass, then look somewhere else cause this is not the right soln for that. Build quality is very good and extremely heavy, i was actually surprised.

It gets pretty loud but at higher volumes they lose their musicality and just get boomy without much expression. At lower volumes, set at the right crossover point, they're very punchy and compliment smaller door speakers very well. A larger driver with better quality wattage would obviously be better but for an all-in-one it's a really nice package.",
