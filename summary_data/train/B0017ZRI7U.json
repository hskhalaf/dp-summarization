      "text": "I've had mine for about 5 months and it's for a full mattress. I paid ~75 dollars. I haven't noticed a decline in support or any soft spots forming. I will recommend buying a mattress cover as well, because I've noticed the pad slightly yellowing over time (from the oil in one's skin). I mean, I bathe daily and change my sheets weekly, so it isn't like I'm a dirty person. I live in a dorm with a plastic-covered mattress and a hard spring brace. It was difficult to sleep prior to this topper. It's great with it. Now, I actually have something of value to lure my girlfriend over.",

Couple of years ago, due to bad back problems I invested in DreamFoam Mattress Ultimate Dreams 13-Inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress, which they all love. Well, can't really afford to buy 5 of those in twin so I ended up researching and choosing this foam topper for their beds. They LOVE it. We only just purchased, but all 5 are thrilled with this. If something changes over time, I will repost but for now, it seems like a good alternative. They are soft but firm so there is some support while being \"cradled\" and no pressure points like they had just on the mattress.",

My mattress is 18 years old and as soon as I put this on it, it felt brand new. Neutralize the smell with some air freshener or odoban and it eliminates the problem right away. Also give the pad a few hours to lay flat on your mattress so it can puff back up. The shipping was also incredibly fast, it arrived over a week before the estimated delivery date. I highly recommend this.",

      "text": "My memory foam mattress topper was delivered very quickly. It seems to be of high quality, is super comfortable and most importantly for me- it barely smelled of chemicals at all! When I have purchased other memory foam products- I have had to let them air out for over a week to get the terrible smell out. This one- I left it out for one day- and I was good to go. All memory foam products will have some smell when first opened- this one was by far the best I've encountered.",

However, I will just have to get used to it and remind myself to not buy anything foam again.",

After about two days it fluffed right up and is super cozy and comfy. I'll get a few more years out of my cheapo guest bed using this topper. It is thick. Three inches doesn't sound thick but when it's on the bed it really feels luxurious. Very nice product.",

It's comfortable, but I didn't notice until sleeping on it for about a week that there is a crimp in the middle of the pad which makes it sag in the middle.so now I try to sleep to either side, which is not so fun. I would have returned it but the thought of trying to fold & box it made me tired. Compared to the prices of other decent foam mattress pads I got what I paid for.",

    "description": "Size:Twin3.3 Cloud Visco Elastic Memory Foam out performs and relieves painful pressure points better than the leading competitor with innovative visco elastic memory foam technology and better formulation to help you sleep through the night without tossing and turning, allowing you to awake refreshed and renewed after a good nights sleep.Cloud9 Visco-elastic foam - memory foam - provides an ideal sleeping surface. In normal temperatures it is firm, but when you lay down to sleep it reacts to the temperature of your body and begins to mold itself to your shape. Weight is then distributed evenly along the surface, relieving pressure and helping you to sleep more soundly without tossing and turning. Cloud9 Memory Foam Contours perfectly and molds to your body, superior pressure relief reduces back pain, increased circulation for a deep sleep. They go right on top of your bed - very useful for making a firm, hard or old mattress much more comfortable. The \"Featherlight Sleep System\" will kindle a sincere delight when it's time to retire for the night. Our exclusive, \"Featherlight\" formula makes you feel like you are floating on CLOUD9, sailing forth into a sea of enchanted dreams. We usually recommend that if the person using the visco-elastic memory foam mattress pad weighs under 200lbs and they are just looking for added comfort they should get a 2\" visco-elastic memory foam mattress pad, if they weigh over 200 we definitely recommend a 3\" visco-elastic memory foam mattress pad and for those that weigh over 250lbs the 4\" toppers are the best option for pressure point relief and comfort. The 3.3 Cloud9 visco-elastic memory foam is SUPER SOFT being less dense and having a softer compression or ILD rating. The 4.3 Cloud9 Topper is slightly firmer and provides a little more support while at the same time remaining soft and supple with a slightly more supportive compression or ILD. Our most luxurious 5.3 Cloud9 visco elastic memory foam is firmer than the 3.3 and 4.3 Cloud9.",
