I run 6048x1080 so the memory and bandwidth make huge displays vey possible. I can run most everything on high if not ultra settings. And considering the real estate that is being rendered, that is really impressive. (This card comes stock OCed to the GPU frequency of its competitor) this one if better than it's competition for large display and multidisplay setups. Especially for the price!",

Never had ANY issues with AC5, not even one bug, crushes or black screens at ultra setting. It's quite impressive this GC. The best part of it: With my NZXT Phantom ATX, I have no trouble with temperature. Really good choice for real gaming experience !",

I am sure if you are looking at this card you have read the reviews, but I have a few points of advice. First, do not try to run the card without turning on the LN2 BIOS. When the LN2 is off, the card will throttle itself and you will get some pretty bad screen artifacts and tearing. Second: this is an air-cooled card, that is the way it's made. Those 3 fans on there can get really loud so plan on wearing headphones.",
