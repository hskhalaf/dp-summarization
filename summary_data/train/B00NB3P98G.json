I have to turn it off at the breaker several times, then wait a few minutes, in order to turn it on at all. Then I have to reset everything from the beginning.

After using this for the first two days, it became apparent that there was a slow air leak in the main tub.

It has a one-year warranty, but try to get your warranty validated, and your replacement parts, is almost impossible. My warranty expires September 2020. I submitted a warranty problem, on my filter which broke. I have been waiting three months now, For my filter to come in. You can\u2019t call them, you have to apply online. The phone number they give you doesn\u2019t work. So you have to request a phone call. Finally, they called me back. But I\u2019m still waiting to get my pump.",
