Its not worth my time to try and figure out why I received the unsatisfactory bundle of 6 rollers. I buy lint rollers a couple times a month. Until some explanation is on the product page I'll stick with the regular bundles of 6 which work better and have twice as many sheets.",

I then used the cheap roller from Ikea and went over the same area and that one picked up tons more hair. So I guess I'll use both of them. I did learn a trick....try spraying the hairy area with the anti-cling spray, let it dry a few minutes and then use the rollers....best trick ever!",
