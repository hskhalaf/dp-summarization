Instead there was cheap tiny scissors (broke) and a few stitch markers. The book cover is different but I assume it's the same beginner instruction. The 5 hooks & gauge are the same. I felt like returning the kit but I didn't have the time. I needed the hooks to start my lesson.",

I did benefit a little from the small section on interpreting patterns, and the fact that you get 4 hooks, a gauge card and other things with it made it a worthwhile purchase for me. I did end up using different hooks long term, but that comes to preference, and for learning I think the ones here are fine.",
