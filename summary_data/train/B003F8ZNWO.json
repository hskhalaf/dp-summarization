We bought this in hopes it would fit our 1 and 1/4 inch tree. We opened the box and were terrified. The stand had a 2 inch hole! BUT luckily they thought of that. There is an insert that you place inside the 2 inch hole to make it fit a 1 and 1/4 inch tree. PERFECT! We purchased the 32A-Inch version. This version fits a 2 inch or 1 and 1/4 inch tree.",

I was pleased that it not only fit the tree perfectly, it is also much sturdier and higher quality than the plastic tree stands that come with most artificial trees. I may eventually spray paint this to match my silver tree, but the tree skirt I have covers it nicely. My cat also enjoys sleeping under the tree and using this thing as a chin rest, so there's that.",

This replacement stand is superior to the original, slightly bigger and more sturdy. The main pole of our tree is 1 1/4 inches and it fits perfectly. Buy with confidence.

Because of this the stand is useless.The photo shows three screws, so you will not get the same item as is shown. The base of the tree cannot be tightened and will not stay in the stand. VERY disappointing. Will now need to it send back. A big waste of time. YOU NEED TO UPDATE THE PHOTOS WHEN THE PRODUCT CHANGES",
