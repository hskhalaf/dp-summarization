Its is packaged in a nice wooden box, but has to be store lying flat. It does not come with a lid!

What you see in the picture is exactly what you get. The tray is a nice sturdy wood, but it's very shallow - about half an inch deep - so you'll likely need to find something else to keep all the beads in. It doesn't come with a lid or anything to keep the beads in place, so I can see them getting scattered and lost very quickly once the plastic shrink wrap is removed. I give four stars for the overall product for this reason.",
