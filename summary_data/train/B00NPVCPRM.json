To properly support a mattress (as I now know) slats should not have more than 4 inches between them. On the surface this looks like a great deal - all metal, no chemically treated materials. But if the box spring cannot support the mattress than any amount of money is a waste. We bought a $1000 mattress and I was not going to risk ruining that mattress with this cheap box spring. Unfortunately, I bought 2 of these before speaking with a reputable mattress company and now have to sell them at the next yard sale.",

      "text": "After much deliberation and research, I decided to try this metal box spring assembly. It arrived unassembled but complete with bolts, nuts and tools. Assembly took me about an hour following the pictorial instructions. Parts are marked well and the assembly instructions are clear enough. Honestly, the tools are pretty much a one time use quality but they worked as intended. My only critique is I'd like to see better information on how to orient or install the cover. I installed it zipper down but changed it to zipper up when I realized it would wear against both the bedframe and the box spring.",

I don't know if this problem was caused by a mishandled package, but the box showed tears, bending and an open corner. The tubular sections are strong, but heavy. Not a fan of this item",

Either make the stupid cover bigger, or put zipper pulls on two sides of the cover. It can be used without a cover.

      "text": "This is not technically a box spring. A box spring has springs, a hard flat top to support the weight on the springs and a cover. This is a steel exoskeleton that will take you hours to put together. You then put a slip over it. With no springs. and no true flat platform to distribute the weight evenly - you are relegated to somewhere in the vicinity of steel bars with about 7 inches or more space in between each. For new premium mattresses they recommend a real boxspring or a platform .with slats no more than a few inches a part. If you are spending $1200 on a good mattress - you don't buy this to put underneath.",

      "text": "This is a product that had a well thought out assembly process. It had clear instructions, the bolts were labeled well and stored in a spot that keeps them in order. They also give you a ratcheting driver for the bolts, and this speeds up your process. The only thing to be careful of is how hard you tighten the bolts. You can warp the mounting points if you crank on them to hard. It has held up very well and we cannot be happier with it.",
