It took about 5 minutes to get up to 300, then I lowered the heat on the stove and it got to about 340 and stayed there pretty well without further adjustment. The cookie bars were done in 20 minutes and came out perfectly.",

Also, small cakes and have used it to warm up other foods. No generator needed. Save that for the refrigerator.",

I couldn't find an extra rack online to purchase, but I'm sure with digging we could. Lastly, finding pans that fit can be a bit of a challenge. A nice accessory set would be great. All that said, it was a nice addition to our gear, and a nice surprise for our group when we broke it out.",

BUT, the pizzas cooked up beautifully and quickly-- only about 10 minutes or less per pizza. It was the hit of the camping trip! The one con is that the metal is pretty flimsy and just from folding and unfolding it during our weekend camping trip it is already showing signs of weakening and I am not sure how long it will last. But I would still highly recommend this oven!",

      "text": "It's basically awesome. You need to bring the temperature up slow like others have said and you have to watch it. ALSO, the cook time is less then a normal oven so you have to watch closely. I found it to cook/bake about 1/4 less then the normal time asked for. I made cookies, muffins and pizza while camping recently!! It was awesome!!",

One problem with camping has been the lack of an oven. With all my stoves and grills and even with my Dutch oven there have been things I'm afraid to cook while camping. not any more. the temperature gauge on this allows me to control more precisely measure and control the heat I'm using. Knowing and controlling the heat allows for better quality meals. My meats can be cooked to perfection just the way we like them without having to guess and risk over cooking.",

The highest temperature I could get with the small stove is 300 degrees F, but that was good enough to cook these items. I like the way it folds almost flat, and it sets up easily.

We will experiment with Hotter fuel source.

    "description": "Bring the joy of fresh-baked muffins, cinnamon rolls, cornbread, and other treats to any campsite with the Coleman Camp Oven. Designed to fit neatly on Coleman propane and liquid fuel camp stoves, this portable oven gives you the ability to bake treats or keep food warm while spending time outdoors. The included interior rack adjusts to 3 heights, while the easy-to-read thermometer lets you bake with confidence. This portable oven is made from smooth aluminized steel that resists corrosion and scratches and wipes clean easily, and it folds flat for convenient carrying and storage when it\u2019s time to pack up camp.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nCamping stoves and other cooking accessories have made it possible to cook most things outdoors, but baked goods have always been out of the question. Until now, that is. Made of smooth aluminized steel, the Coleman camping oven lets you bake a batch of muffins, biscuits, or rolls right at the campsite. \n\n\n\nThe Coleman camping oven is designed to sit on a two- or three-burner camping stove.The oven doesn't require electric or gas power to work. Instead, campers simply place the oven on top of a Coleman two- or three-burner stove, which provides all the heat you need to bake your favorite dishes. The oven also offers such baking essentials as an adjustable steel bake rack and an easy-to-read thermometer. And when you're done baking, the oven folds flat for easy storage. Made in China, the Coleman camping oven measures 12 by 12 by 12 inches (W x H x D) when standing and weighs 7 pounds.  About Coleman\nMore than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a \"no light, no pay\" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. \n\n In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.",
