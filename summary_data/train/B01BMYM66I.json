Construction seems solid and the plastic is about as thick as it could be while remaining flexible. Of course, her school-issued backpack seemed pretty solid too at first, so we'll see. If we get a year out of this, I'll consider it good value for the money. It did give off an unpleasant plastic odor for a day or two, but that's faded.",
