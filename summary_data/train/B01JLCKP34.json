It asks to use an outside storage device for my updates and I have never ad to do that with any of my previous computers.",

      "text": "I bought this for my 1st grader because he had to do online schooling and i was working on main computer. This HP Stream is a lot slower out of the box with only 1 window open than my 5.5 years old MacBook with a few browsers open with multiple windows, and bunch of other apps/programs running. I'm keeping it because of the price and it's enough for 1st grader. But it is very frustrating to work on, even just to open a PDF worksheet. Also, I just now remembered why i pledged years ago that I will never buy Windows computer again.",

I\u2019ve never paid for software protection with my chrome book but with this I have to come out of pocket. Yes it\u2019s cute and affordable but so was my chrome book and it worked a lot better than this. Now I just want to get rid of it and get another chrome book. The specs are better! :(",
