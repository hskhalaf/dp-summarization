It is fantastic for the things that I need a computer for. Defiantly well worth the money & then some. I highly recommend the Samsung Chromebook for browsing the internet, and for note taking.

After starting it updated and allowed me to download android apps, which is great being you can play games or download other things not supported by chrome software. Sadly the android apps take up much space and I purchased a SD card but after trying to download android apps on SD card it did not work so it places a limit on how many apps you can have.",

      "text": "My 12 yr old daughter received for this for Christmas and it was exactly what she wanted. It never left the house, was never dropped or banged around, and nothing was ever spilt on it. She basically only used it got School work and to watch You Tube and Netflix. Within 3 months, half of the screen turned black for no apparent reason. We haven\u2019t been able to fix the problem or use it since. That was the 1 big item she wanted and it didn\u2019t even make it until Easter!! VERY disappointing!!",

Unlike other computers, it costs only one hundred and eighty-two dollars, and when my child spills juice on it I will only be out about half the price of most other chromebooks. Going strong after a year of daily use. Lightweight. Probably not good for people with large hands or who want to use this as a primary viewing device for television (quality is fine but screen is not as big as big chromebooks). Once I sat on it and it was fine.",
