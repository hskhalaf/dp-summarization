      "text": "Fantastically good docking station. Sits very neatly un I now have a single thin usb-c cable to plug into my 13\"mbp which connects 2 nice 21\" screens, a keyboard, ethernet & usb hd and it charges the laptop at full speed. Plus there's an sd card slot and a couple of usb sockets on the front for any other devices I might use. On the mac there was nothing to set up or install - it just worked. Only downside - the very bright blue led on the front required a very small piece of black electrical tape to hide it - tape is hardly noticeable now.",

      "text": "So I have SurfaceBook 2 and surface dock witch is very unreliable. So had been looking for dock witch I can use today and once I upgrade my machine keep using and this one is the only on the market with that requirement. Device is lovely metal case witch will help with the heat. It is really plug and play. works right away. and so far working like a charm, charging my device, external screens are connected and working unlike previously, headphone jack in good position up front, ethernet is stable no disconnect or packet loss. Overall if you have any of the new Microsoft Surfaces with USB-C get this one and forget the antient surface dock.",

I use this dock for my home desk, where I use a MacBook Pro, a Thunderbolt enabled windows laptop and a USB C desktop. Functionality is reduced when using USB C, but it is good enough for my needs. Pros: - Great look - Backwards compatible with USB C - 2 DisplayPorts - Easy to install - SD card reader Cons: - Can get very hot - Not enough USB ports - No extra Thunderbolt ports",

The Pro-Dock doesn't even have a thunderbolt output built in, I am so disappointed my expectations were high in spite of some negative comments which I have since proven incorrect.

This one does two 4K 60 Hz extended desktop monitors brilliantly. It's got just the ports I need, nothing too much! Additionally, it looks quite stylish, and it's colour-matched with all my Space Grey kit. The only tiny issue is that the dock is quite light, so a stiff cable will lift it from the table. However, this is a very minor nitpick, and does not affect anything aside from desk aesthetics. Highly recommended!",
