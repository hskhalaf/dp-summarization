Very easy for her to use with the camera capable of taking some fantastic pictures. I'm very happy with the reliability of our Canon cameras, never having had one break rather just upgrading to take advantage of new features. I won't buy a Nikon again.",

The Auto mode sometimes selects wrong setting in ISO and considers some shots as Macro. The number of options in the non-Auto mode is limited, but sufficient. I would always prefer the non-Auto mode. There is no option for fast shots in the non-Auto/Manual mode. The video quality is good. I would recommend going with a 8GB card. The A/V and USB covers are very flimsy so watch out and handle it with care. Viraj",

The touch screen is very fun and easy to use. And it's small/compact size makes it easy to carry/stash in a pocket or purse. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a wonderful camera for a decent price!",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD980IS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Ultra Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-inch LCD (Purple)",
    "description": "Color:PurpleFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCanon\u2019s iconic ELPH has always been a show-off, with the looks and smarts that make you want to carry it out in the open for everyone to see. The PowerShot SD980 IS takes the concept even further with Canon\u2019s first-ever touch panel interface. The camera that invented sleek and slim is equipped with a huge 3-inch PureColor System LCD screen that responds to your touch, delivering operation that\u2019s as natural and intuitive as cutting-edge technology should be. Four opulent color options are the icing on the cake. \n\nPowerShot SD980 IS Highlights \n\nLarge, 3.0-inch wide touch-panel PureColor System LCD\nJust touch your finger to the huge 3.0-inch PureColor System LCD panel and the PowerShot SD980 IS responds--creating a fun, natural interface that\u2019s just the way you want to interact with technology now. When shooting, you can choose an AF point, select a shooting mode, operate the flash, set exposure compensation and more. Playback functions are also performed at your touch: switch between images, scroll display, magnify a portion of an image and control movie playback. \n\n\n\nThe PowerShot SD980 IS\u2019s 3.0-inch wide touch panel PureColor System LCD screen provides an alternative to dials and buttons. With Active Display technology, a quick shake of the camera prompts images to play back, one after the other. When the camera is tilted while advancing the images, the advance speed changes according to the tilt angle. Additionally, by quickly moving the camera forward, you can jump between Focus Checker frames when reviewing still images. Using the same action, you can pause or restart a movie currently playing. \n\n720p HD movie shooting capability plus HDMI output\nThe PowerShot SD980 IS lets you record video in beautiful high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies (and still photos) on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high-definition monitor. You'll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 thumbnails at once. \n\n5x optical zoom in action 5x optical zoom with ultra-wide 24mm lens, plus Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer and 12 megapixels\nThe PowerShot SD980 IS gives you the creative flexibility to get up close or go wide, for impressive images framed just the way you want them. Despite its slim profile and tiny body, the camera is equipped with a 5x Optical Zoom--no more sitting on the sidelines with the action too far away. The lens is ultra wide-angle, with a focal length of 24-120mm (35mm equivalent). That puts more image in every shot for visual excitement and a high-end feel. And the best part? Even at the long end of the zoom, images are clear and steady thanks to Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilization that controls camera shake. And with 12.1 megapixels, the PowerShot SD980 IS provides amazing image resolution. \n\n\n\n\nImproved Smart AUTO\n\n\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SD980 IS to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you're getting dramatic, memorable images. Even if your subject is moving, Canon\u2019s advanced detection technologies capture the action as it happens. \n\nShooting Modes\nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 20 Shooting Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot SD980 IS Body \n * Lithium-ion Battery Pack NB-6L \n * Battery Charger CB-2LY \n * Wrist Strap WS-DC10 \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400",
