Each hook is very heavy duty and consequently two of them together at the end of a ladder makes it difficult to place on a roof peak. I returned them to the seller and was charged a 20% restocking fee, just so you know.",

So, with two hooks attached to the ladder they would not stay spread apart on the ladder. They would slide together.",

The \"cons\" are associated with their total weight due to the heavy construction. They actually make the ladder quite top-heavy. Also, no matter how hard I tightened them, they slid from side-to-side when rolling them up the ridge of the roof. I had to actually wire tie them to sides of the ladder to prevent this from happening.",

Does not adjust enough and not solid enough so the hook(s) just flop around and it impossible to use the wheels as a result. It is just a wing nut to tighten it up and does not allow you to get the holding bracket down to the ladder rung so it is not tight. Not impressed at all. Would not buy them again.",

The seller never disclosed there would be a 20% restocking fee, so I paid out $13+ for nothing. The item didn't work as described. Very disappointed and disappointed for being charged for nothing!",
