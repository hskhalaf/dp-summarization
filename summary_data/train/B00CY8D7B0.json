      "text": "These brackets lend an impressive industrial look to your project. They feel sturdy and are quite heavy. However, these required a considerable amount of work for my project. First off, the upper mounting points are laterally offset whereas the lower mounting point is central. This can make it hard to mount the bracket into a narrow stud. The screws included are comically undersized. They will not reach any stud, so you will need to purchase your own hardware. The eye holes in the bracket are far too small. I had to dremel them out to fit my larger, better screws in the hole. Overall the brackets are impressive, if a bit large (as a caution), but were difficult to use.",

My only complaint is the chintzy flat head screws they include. Who even uses flat heads anymore? They are way too small to be used to mount the brackets to the walls, and too frustrating to use for attaching the shelves to the brackets. Bring your own screws and these are a fantastic choice.",

In order to install these onto studs, you'll have to offset the bracket on the stud so that one of the upper screw holes, and the single bottom screw hole, align with the stud.

I LOVE that the screw holes are offset which makes them much easier to install having the hole be in the middle of the bar. For the price, these are perfect and I would highly recommend them.",
