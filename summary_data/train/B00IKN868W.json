I kept the extra benches that came without the table and ordered a second set. It\u2019s wonderful quality, careful with acids on the wood! I keep the extra benches outside and they have held up to almost a full year of Florida weather!",

It's large without being to large. The multi colors in the wood and powder coated metal legs make it match other wood types throughout the house perfectly. Highly recommend this table set, indoors or out!",

They wished that they would slide under, rather that stick out about six inches taking up deck and walking space.
