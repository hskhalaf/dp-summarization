However, immediately touching it (especially using it to dry off), I was sold! It's super soft, feels fine on the body and dries way quicker than your standard beach towel. A nice touch is the convenient little bag to put it in. It packs up really compact!",

      "text": "This towel is a great addition to my beach bag! I live in a humid environment and the quick drying capabilities have been a game changer for the beach. Because it is made from a quick-dry material, sand doesn't get engrained into all the little loops of a normal cotton towel. Also, how annoying is it to lay on a towel that is too small and you end up covered in sand which defeats the purpose of a towel. Luckily, the size of this towel makes it enjoyable to be at the beach and a pseudo-sand free experience, if desired. Great product and I will definitely be buying more of these!",

These are nice and light, quite absorbent and dry faster than a regular towel. Unlike most products that come with a carrying case, these are actually relatively simple to get back in the bag. These towels are definitely going with us on our upcoming cruise, and will be much easier to take ashore than the ship towels.",

I'm not a small grandma & have long hair to boot, it soaks up my water thoroughly & dries in an hour.
