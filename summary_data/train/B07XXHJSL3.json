It\u2019s inexpensive enough that if it doesn\u2019t there\u2019s not much lost. I run, bike, and swim, so my back has been very achy and I have had difficulty sleeping on my side, which is my preferred position. So far it\u2019s a definite improvement! Sleeping well and no pain. Weird to think a knee pillow would do that. The strap is an added bonus because it helps it stay in place. I recommend giving it a shot.",

Other pillows are too big and I end up tossing them aside midway through my sleep, but this one is the perfect size. You have to just trust me and buy it. If you don't like it, you can always return it, but I've tried at least three and this was the best!",

The strap is comfy and I am able to flop from side-to-side without waking up. The only issue is that the inner foam pillow has already cracked in half. Boo. But the good news? The manufacturer refunded my purchase when I asked about attaining a new foam insert. Now that is customer service! I will purchase a new pillow with the refund. Thank you!",

If, however, you sleep with your legs not fully bent -- say, at 60 to 90 degree angle -- this pillow will not work. It's very firm and and contoured. I've tried to for a week, but it's not even close to accommodating my natural leg angle as a side sleeper.",

One kind of silly gripe is the color - I can\u2019t find it against my black quilt or grey carpet in the dark. Given the option, I would have ordered a lighter color for contrast.
