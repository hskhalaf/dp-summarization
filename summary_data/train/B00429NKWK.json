I'm assuming the lifetime warranty promise will be a real pain in the butt to get honored, so I'll eat the $20 and look for the next miracle too-good-to-be-true product on the market. Update 8/19: The lenses are now yellow and frosty looking. It appears that the clearcoat, used in the final step of the process, is faded out, and the lenses look worse than before I use the kit. I will now try the 3M Headlight Restore Kit.",

It will look scratched up until you put the final clearcoat on. That is what leaves it looking like new.

Make sure you have a spray bottle with you as well as paper towels. Very nice kit though will buy again",

The drivers side looks better but it doesn't quite have the bright sparkle of a new headlight. So in summary, NOT like new but still very good.",

The first pass wasn't working and I ended up using 200 grit with a random orbital sander to get all the cruft off. Once this was done I went through the sanding and polishing steps. When I was done, the lights were still hazy and I was somewhat forlorn. But then I applied the UV coating and was amazed by the difference. Five stars.",

      "text": "Bought 2 kits, one for a 2006 Camry, the other 2010 Highlander. Both had cloudy headlights. Unlike some kits this one starts with a cleaner before going thru 3 increasing grades of sandpaper. Reapply the cleaner before adding the clear coat. I spent about 30 min on each vehicle between the cleaner, wet sanding and finishing. Each step is important, especially the sealer. While some people use toothpaste or WD-40, without a clear coat, you work will get glazed over and your back to square one. Good product, would buy again but I don't expect to do so because I expect it to work for several years.",

My lights look like new and as a bonus the kit is supposed to treat one pair of lights, however, I used only the minimum amount required to complete 1 pair of lights, then tackled another pair and was able to complete 3 pairs of lights total. Highly recommended. If you use my technique be sure to complete each pair of lights thru the final step before going to the next pair, that way you'll be able to see how much treatment materials that you have left to determine if you have enough to continue. I was also able to find a yourtube video that showed me each step.",
