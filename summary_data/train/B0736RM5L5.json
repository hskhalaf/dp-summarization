      "text": "For an everyday stylus this works great. For moving emails and basic stylus usage you won't be disappointed, but for creating art in a program the sensitivity is a little off. I tried it in a couple different programs to make sure it wasn't the program itself and each time had the same issues. There was a drag effect and/or loss of pressure sensitivity. The image attached is something I was able to create after a couple of attempts and was created in Adobe Draw. I love that it is powered by an AAAA battery and comes with an USB charger and an extra battery.",

      "text": "I have a touchscreen laptop, but haven't been able to use it for writing in any way because I couldn't find a stylus which would make precise enough lines. This stylus has solved my problem. I am able to take notes on documents onscreen with ease, and they are legible, which was always impossible previously. I have also used it on my iPhone and Kindle, and it works great. I especially like that it comes with a USB battery charger and 2 batteries, one for the stylus, and one to keep charged. That way, you never have to worry about it dying in the middle of use. Highly recommended if you are looking for an affordable active stylus.",

I dropped one of the stylus\u2019s and found the tip broke quite easily so I started using the spare. After only two days it stopped turning on even though I swapped out the battery. I chose this particular stylus due to issues with fine motor skill issues and gripping issues due to illness. I needed a stylus that was long with a decent sized diameter. The tip was also hard plastic so it was very noisy to use. Unfortunately I am unable to purchase another.",
