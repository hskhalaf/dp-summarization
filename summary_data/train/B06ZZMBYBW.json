One was so bad that when I flipped the top open the whole lid case off and the bottle Had expanded to a point where the neck of the bottle will no longer fit into the base of the lid. The item cannot be reused, which means I lost the bottle and all of the product inside. The second bottle was also mishappen and had expanded but not as bad. See photos.",

The caps themselves are pretty sturdy but I have noticed that if you don't grab onto the solid piece of the neck while opening it seems like you might break the tube apart so I haven't tried pulling too hard. But haven't had any other troubles so far. I like the switchable cap",
