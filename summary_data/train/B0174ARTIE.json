Btw, I don\u2019t even know what that means. I was told, I could send it back at my expense. It would take 6-8 weeks to get it and I had to pay for the shipping to have it sent back to me.

There are some apps that are not compatible--I would like to have Yelp! and Yahoo Fantasy Football.

      "text": "I love this tablet! It's a great size, runs smoothly with no hiccups, has excellent sound, and offers plenty of options for entertaining apps and other features. It's sturdily built, as is the keyboard, although the keys themselves will take some getting used to. Some sacrifices were made to buttons that you would find on a traditional keyboard, which is typical given the smaller size, but the trackpad is EXTREMELY sensitive, making the cursor jump to various places or make changes on the screen that I didn't actually want, so be forewarned. If I could give them separate reviews, I'd give the tablet itself 5 stars (more if only it were possible), but the keyboard, I'd give maybe a 2-3.",
