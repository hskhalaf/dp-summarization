Set up was a breeze and took seconds. I like that plants have adequate height & room to grow without touching the fabric. I also like the simple way to vent the tunnel. There are more affordable tunnels out there. I might try them, but I wonder if they would be as easy to use and well made as these? I\u2019d like to have half a dozen more!",

      "text": "Works well for its purpose but can be a bit frustrating to install as the cords on the ends love to get tangles in both the hoop spikes and any plants you are trying to install it over. Is durable enough to last >1 season in my hands. Not ideal for plants that you have to mess with frequently due to the need to readjust the spikes and hoops every time you need access to the plants. I will use in in plants that are sprouted but not yet in need of any other attention until they are ready to be pollinated, then again after pollination while I am awaiting fruit development. Fits perfectly into my 24\" wide raised beds.",
