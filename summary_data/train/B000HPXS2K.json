I like that it has a large water reservoir too, as plenty of water is necessary to keep your tree needles soft and pliable all the way until New Years. Also, how awesome is it to be able to order something like this online and get it shipped to your house!? My small town has very few options and I was glad to have this delivered to my door in less than a week.",

It says it can handle up to a 12\u2019 tree but I\u2019m only going to get an 8\u2019 tree. And there is also a limited lifetime warranty. The only thing I didn\u2019t like is that it\u2019s made in China.",

Be sure the tree is firmly wedged in place and the screws all tightened before attempting to set up the tree. We had no other problems once we reset the tree firmly against the base. It is very solid. Also it is very easy to water the tree with this stand. We recommend this product to others. The large size might be better for anything over 7ft trees.",

The basin is nice and wide, which makes it easier to see if tree needs watering and also for watering the tree.
