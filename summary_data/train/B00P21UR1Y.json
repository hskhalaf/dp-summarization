I like to get down on the floor on there level and this helps because i can sit lower but its way more comfy then sitting on the floor .",

      "text": "Got this for my son's bday but everyone in the house (including dogs) use it. It's very comfortable and large enough for an adult to lounge on it. You can even fit two adults who want to cuddle! Our dogs love it too and it has become their main napping spot. Because of this I have washed the cover a number of times since purchasing it in February. The cover is easy to get on and off, cleans well, and has shown no signs of wear. I am also surprised it hasn't ripped from the dogs' nails too! Definitely recommend this lounger over other more expensive brands...very good deal!!",

The bean bag is made of pieces of what feel like memory foam. It\u2019s compact in the box it\u2019s delivered in and you have to break it up for growth. This was fun because we jumped on it and threw it across the room!",

I spent about 20 minutes really separating the foam when I first got it out of the bag and it's been great since. You pick it up and turn it over and shake it around and it goes back to full form. Then set in it and it forms to how you sat in it. Repeat. No problem. I'm 6' 210 lb and have sat on it alone and with someone. I like to put it the tall way up and with an extra pillow for a headrest I'll use it kind of like chair.",
