The battery drains faster while charging than it does not plugged in. Samsung doesn't even have longer cords available for purchase. I'm very annoyed at risking the safety of my tablet because a proper charging cord in a longer length isn't available for it.",

Now that this tablet is 6 days outside of the return period, it's laggy in responding to touch and sometimes requires me to repeatedly poke at the screen to get it to register.

The chip set in this tablet works just fine and the speed is on par with anything in this class. You can actually watch a movie on this tiny screen and enjoy it. We shied away at first because of experiences with Samsung Galaxy phones (bloatware and Bixby) but this tablet has none of that. There is a silent \"Bixby Page\" but it is actually useful in this scenario. This outclassed my daughter's iPad so much that she purchased the Samsung Tab S5e for herself and handed down the iPad.",

Well looking at the box this am to get the return ready. I see the sticker on the side of the box says \"used very good\" Not a happy shopper. I thought I bought a new tablet. Be wary of this trick. The description says \"new and used\"",
