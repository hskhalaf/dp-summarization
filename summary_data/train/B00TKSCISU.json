The material also buckles while walking which is uncomfortable. I give this shoe 2 stars because it's still very stylish and looks like the true Calvin Klein model at 1/3 the cost, but they last 1/5 as long. I will not purchase these again.",

Some reviewers mentioned that it's too narrow - its's not. It's a medium (M) width shoes - that's how they're supposed to be. You definitely want to wear these with dress socks - these are dress shoes, folks! Anyway, couldn't be happier with the built, quality, and style. Great bargain.",

There was no hope that these would relax/stretch out enough to be comfortable. It's a shame because the look and feel were great. Seemed like it was a good shoe but it was just way too narrow in the toe box to even tolerate for more than a few seconds before causing my foot to cramp.",
