      "text": "I have tried a few different brands of media and all but 3 have been an unsuccessful burn. I use mainly Verbatim which IS compatible with this drive. After about 20 unsuccessful burns, the thing magically decided to burn media properly. I'm happy with it now, but my rating won't change for this because you shouldn't have to go through that many discs to \"break in\" a product. It costs an extra $8 for those wasted discs. Next time, it's Lite-On. Their products seem to work out of the box, not a \"break in\" product.",

The resulting DVDs are much clearer. For anyone who's ever changed out a computer disc drive, installing this internal drive will be routine. I had no problems whatsoever, and so far 100% of the discs I've burned have turned out perfectly.",

It was easy to install, but the face plate doesn't line up exactly with the front panel of my tower, so when I have the front panel on the drive won't open. So I have to leave my tower's front panel off. And I've been only haveing about a 50% success rate when burning DVDs. I don't know if this is because it's a dual-layer burner, but I'm still burning single-layer discs or if it's some flaw in the burner. Either way, I'm making a hell of lot more coasters than I made with my previous burner.",
