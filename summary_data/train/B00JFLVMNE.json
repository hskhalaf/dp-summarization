I sometimes wish I would have gone for the larger blender with 64 or 72 oz cups because I use this for meal replacing smoothies, but I am still very satisfied. One of my blades some how got bent one month after I bought it. Customer service woman with nutri ninja was very friendly and apologetic for the occurrence, and eager to fix the problem (1 year manufacturer warranty). So they sent me a new blade free of charge. Very pleased! Would definitely recommend the blender and the brand.",

Doesn't leak unless I overfill it, which is my bad. Even then, it only leaks a little. Good value for the money. I bought the extended warranty, but after using it for several weeks, it seems well-designed with quality materials, so I might not ever use the warranty. After reading other reviews, I concluded that any blender used frequently would break sooner than later. This Ninja might prove me wrong. Highly recommended!",

Don't go over the Fill line, or the cap with the blades won't screw on correctly, and the product won't work. I make smoothies with soy or almond milk and fruits. I also juice with filtered water. Whatever your preference. Kale is a good green to use, as is Dandelion. You can sneak in things that are healthy like Cauliflower, because they have no taste. One note: citrus fruits are not good to use. For some reason, they become bitter in the blender.",

I've not had any issues and would only say to tighten lid completely b4 blending so there is no leakage. I've not had a leakage problem but if lid is not tight it can vibrate just enough during heavy blending to loosen the lid. This takes up hardly any counter space - it's a win win all the way around.",

I have had it a month or two now and I love it a thousand times more than the behemoth vitamix that was more than 3 times as much!! You can quickly and easily make an individual smoothie or milkshake and throw the lid on and be good to go. When your done, the cups are dishwasher safe. Best thing I have ever purchased!!",

I had been using a full sized blender every morning to make my protein & breakfast shakes, the large size cup that the Ninja comes with is perfect for this purpose and everything blends way smoother and way faster than my blender ever did.

The only drawback is the fact that you must manually push down on the container and maintain pressure in order for the motor to activate. I would have liked to be able to attach the container and have an automatic function to get the motor going.",

I am SO happy with the product and recommended it to several friends who also love it! Although I've never owned a NutriBullet, I have had friends who say the motor doesn't last/lacks power.",
