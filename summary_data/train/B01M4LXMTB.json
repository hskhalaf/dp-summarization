      "text": "The handle is too small for a man's hands or a women with large hands. This makes it difficult to control the head while creating an awkward balance. It would be fine for light duty like hanging pictures and the quality is good as expected from Stanley. For a finishing hammer there are better choices like the Vaughan 7 oz. that has a normal size handle offering better control and balance. I ordered the Vaughan from Home Depot for only $7.98 to replace the Stanley.",
