      "text": "These shoes are so comfortable, right from day 1! The delivery arrived on time and in perfect condition. My feet can't stand flats or sandals and I always wear trainers with cushion heels. After going through a lot of positive reviews about this product, I decided to give it try and I am glad I did!! They are not only light weight but also look trendy for both office and casual wear. This is my first purchase from Sketchers and will buy from them again <3",

These are my 2nd pair of this Flex Appeal design (the others were black). I have wide feet and it is essential that I have comfortable, practical shoes for dog walking and long periods of standing at work. The other bonus for most Skechers designs is that they are washable on a cool wash. I would definitely recommend these shoes.",
