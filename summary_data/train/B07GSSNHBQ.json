We love this, it's easy to use and we can move it around the house to our needs, we are keeping it next to the tree and projecting on the wall, but we also have it outside for decoration. We plan on using it for a party soon to projecting on the wall in the foryer for guests to enjoy when they arrive. To top it off, it really keeps the kids happy and they love how it changes images, it keeps them busy for hours! We are going to buy another one to keep outside for our garage door.",

Each set gets about 10 seconds where it jumps between the two photos to produce the impression of animation. The only setting is on or off. I'm projecting onto a 14 foot high ceiling and the picture is bright and clear.",
