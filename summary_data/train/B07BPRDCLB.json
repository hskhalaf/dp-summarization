There are two zipper compartments, one much larger main compartment fits her homework folder and lunch also some extra clothes and the other smaller on the front fits some toys.I like the water pockets on both sides for drinks. The zippers seem to be good quality meta and smooth.My daughter loved the print. I loved the size and that the fabric is fairly durable.",

I ordered this one and crossed my fingers it would meet my needs. I'm relieved and pleased to say that it not only met my needs, but my little one approves of it as well! She has been wearing it around the house and cannot wait to start using it for school. The backpack is well made and lightweight. It arrived packaged nicely and on time.",

I'm pretty sure that tag said to hand wash, I will verify and see if that elevates the smell.",

He is a very tall kid, but he's still too small for a standard big kids backpack that I see so many preschoolers try to wear. The backpacks for elementary school-aged kids are just too wide and long for preschoolers (and toddlers). This backpack fits an extra change of clothes, wipes, plus a pair of shoes. The side pockets fit his water bottle just fine. And the chest clip helps keep the backpack steady while he runs around with it on. The dinosaur design is adorable and you probably will be the only one with this special backpack. Highly recommend.",

My two issues with it is the zipper can get easily stuck on the fabric, but luckily it doesn't tear or shred the fabric. And lastly, the shoulder straps move around so easily that they don't stay where you want them, causing the bag to droop down his back, so I've had to tie them. Other than, is a great bag for the price! Fits a lot of stuff. We once put shoes, a lunch box, and a jacket in there. Not bad!",

Once showing them the defect, they immediately said they would replace the bag with no issues. Overall, we LOVE this bag and use it as our toddlers backpack.

      "text": "The chest strap is CRUCIAL for me. My son needed a larger backpack for school, but it\u2019s hard to encourage a three year-old with special needs to keep his back pack on. This chest strap allows me to secure his backpack and it\u2019s contents. He\u2019s pretty hard on his belongings and so far so good with this! We\u2019ve only had it 2 months (using it twice weekly) but I think it\u2019ll last all school year and that\u2019s a reasonable ask for the price I paid for this.",

Some reviewers opted for the standard size as it fits a folder better, but I actually think this one is perfect for a 4 year old's needs. Sure, the folder is kind of tight but I don't anticipate him bringing a ton of homework and other documents back and forth at this age. Again, perfect backpack! Don't hesitate to buy.",
