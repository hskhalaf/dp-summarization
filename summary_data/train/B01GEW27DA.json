I wanted to be able to lock them into an app but we have been unable to accomplish this!

And third and not least, it makes for a good book reader due to its pretty insane battery life or can be a tablet for a kid.",

This auto-update, WHICH YOU CANNOT TURN OFF, ruined the device. I spent nearly 3 hrs on the phone with Amazon's Tech Support, and it's still barely usable. So, after a year of use, an automatic OS update ruined this device. Of course, there's no way to downgrade it to an earlier OS. That's why this is the last Kindle I'll ever buy.",

But i do have 7 kindles and only 2 of them work. Only reason both work is because they have the magnetic charging ports. Thats the weak point of this device. The charging port. Our 5 broken kindles ALL had broken charging ports. So if you buy this device, make sure to buy the magnetic USB chargers as well. They will save you lots of headaches.",

As near as I can tell, you have to download a bunch of apps from Google. But there is no straightforward description of how to do that. Amazon is usually focused on customer satisfaction, so I'm wondering if this is an example of Google vs. Amazon hostility. I'll keep trying, but if I cannot figure it out by tomorrow, I'll return this tablet. Too bad...",

So yeah, the price my seem reasonable, but if you have to buy a new one every year, ITS A RACKET!!!! After reading the reviews, something I'm ashamed I didn't do before purchasing, I see that, again, this problem is very common, yet Amazon continues to sell them. DO NOT BUY YOUR ELECTRONICS FROM AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!",

Fortunately, we haven\u2019t had any issues with our daughter buying anything she shouldn\u2019t, but we went ahead and removed them. In addition to the $15, we were charged a 14% sales tax. What?!

      "text": "Considering it was $49.99 I guess this tablet is doing the best it can. I got it for games and for my kids when we travel by plane. The operating system is very slow and crashes at times. The kid friendly options are fantastic but the slow operating system can be torture when dealing with an impatient 2 year old. Even writing this review I had to use my iPhone because it would be too slow and painful to do on the fire. Having said that, for $50 this is perfect to use to entertain the kids when stuck on a plane. If it weren't so slow it would be perfect as it does almost everything an iPad can.",

      "text": "It's a great tablet and I bought it at a great price, but you need to take into account that minimal storage and tiny screen. I solved the storage issue with a 128gb SD card (buy the Sandisk Ultra 128GB Micro - it's great and Amazon often has it on sale) and now I have more space than I know what to do with. But the small screen is smaller than I thought, and it does make some tasks a little less enjoyable. It's not Amazon's fault, of course. I made the decision to buy this size to save a few bucks. I regret it and next time I'll go for a few more inches.",

      "title": "okay for a kid tablet, I would not use one for myself",
      "text": "it's okay.... not great. I don't like the speed,it's slow. and I don't like that blocking things from my child in the free time app is extremely inefficient and takes forever. i don'tlike like that she can just download games inside the free time... she sees something she likes and touches it, it begins to download.... why? I like all the time restrictions and adding safe websites on a list. I don't like that i can't just add a youtube playlist link..... it wants me to add videos individually. it's okay for a kid tablet, I would not use one for myself.",
