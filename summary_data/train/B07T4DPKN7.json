Also, the base is super wide. Good I suppose if your doing a lot of hiking or on a surface that would benefit from a wider base. I wanted to like these shoes but they just aren\u2019t meant for thin, narrow feet.",

Including going into a creek/waterfall with get completely submerged! The longest I've walked since I purchased these was 2.5 miles. I didn't experience any soreness in my feet (and I am usually a complainer when it comes to shoes). They are so light and comfortable! Definitely my most useful purchase this summer. I love the purple color and am considering buying another pair in another color to switch off with.",

An 8 exactly fits my foot on the sandal but that's weirdly how I like it? Lol anyways once I got the sizing down I love them!! Super comfy, functional and look great",
