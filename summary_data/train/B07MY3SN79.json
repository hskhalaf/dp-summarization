One of the plants was clearly in pretty bad shape when we got it, but the rose succulent seemed okay for a month or so. I think maybe i over watered the rosette succulent, so that's my fault. In short they're very gorgeous large plants, with cute pots, and i think if you examine them right when you get them, you'll know how to help them and they may be okay.",
