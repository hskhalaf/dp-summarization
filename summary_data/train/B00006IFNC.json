And no, it isn't the little lock switch. I have only been cutting lightweight fabric (cotton) and single sheets of paper. As I say, very disappointed.",

The so called \"easy action\" aspect is basically a spring mechanism and IMHO I had to apply more pressure than I would have with a non-easy action scissors. Plus, I have small hands and from that standpoint it felt way big an clumsy. Overall very disappointed and now cannot return.",

Only negatives are that they are a bit clumsy in tight turns (so I got the ones with small blades too) and they \u201cclog up\u201d with fabric residue and begin to stick open. I cleaned and oiled the spring and they\u2019re working well again.",
