      "text": "I wanted some longer spoons for stirring drinks etc. in larger cups. These work great for that, and are actually a lot heavier than I was expecting. I noticed some reviews complaining about how they got bent, but these would probably need to be quite a bit thicker to compensate for the extra leverage the length gives them if you plan on using them to pry frozen ice cream out of a container or something. That said, the only real 'problem' I've observed with these spoons is that the scoop is maybe 1/2 - 3/4 the size of a regular spoon.",

But let me say it again, it's the beautiful color of rose gold and the extreme shine that makes these spoons so beautiful to look at and use = ) I know they are just spoons, but you'll see what I'm talking about when you get them. I just wish they made regular spoons, forks, and knives as well. I would literally buy the whole set.",
