I can see over a 1000 ft with these and scan all the fields. I spotted a possum over 1000 ft. I would recommend these. I bought a set for all my children and parents.",

But if you want the tactical, flashing function it requires a very purposeful, gentle touch. I find it almost impossible to make this flashlight go into the flashing strobe mode. I would imagine that at night, if I suddenly needed the flashlight to strobe, I would not be able to make that happen, since I can\u2019t make it happen under normal circumstances.",

I am impressed by their proactive approach and genuine desire to make my purchase a positive one. I am now the very satisfied owner of two S1000's. Both units operate perfectly. Each light fits snugly in the accessory holster, the beams are bright and clear in broad and narrow zoom, and the push button switch has a firm response. These lights are an excellent value for the price. I would buy from Gearlight again without hesitation.",

You'd be better off with a can of pepper spray. On the other hand, the SOS signalling could come in handy in an emergency situation. Standing on its end, aimed at the ceiling, it will provide bright enough light for an entire room. A very good flashlight for an exceptional price. I did not check waterproofing. With its o-rings it should do okay, but I am not about to put it to the test. Hate to lose it.",

      "text": "These Gear S1000 flashlights seem as sturdy and well designed as another similar different brand flashlight I already have. The Gears were easy to set up with my own AAA batteries. But when I compared the beams of the Gear with the different brand I already have, the Gear put out half the light of the other brand (which cost only about 20% more). So I'd say these are fine for average use, but if you need a really bright light, look elsewhere. If you're a penny-pincher, these would suffice for everyday use.",

      "text": "I've had two of these flashlights for about 9 months. In both cases the flashlights stopped working, and it turned out that the batteries enclosed with the flashlights had leaked, and I mean all three batteries. Cleaned up, replaced the batteries but now neither flashlight works reliably. UPDATE: Yesterday's mail brought, in response to my review, a letter from the manufacturer, two replacement flashlights, and a fresh 10-pack of Energizer batteries. They're certainly paying attention! As a result, and in the hope that all those 4.6 star reviews are justified and that my experience was due to their use of some rotten batteries for a time, I've adjusted my rating upward.",

They are conveniently sized, came with accessories routinely used and put out enough light to handle our uses around the campsite and to/from bathroom calls. We like the simplicity of the focus function just sliding the end of the light in or out for focusing the beams. We are 18650 battery owners/users for lots of other electronics we own and use, and had the recharge batteries and recharge systems already in hand to manage these additional torches too. Good buy, good value. Sorry, no report on water repellent effectiveness (yet). Aside from not testing water resilency, these are very good torches for very reasonable price.",

Not sure yet, but I still endorse the product because it does what I want it to do.

I don't keep losing the ones I've previously bought, I just keep finding more places I want them for safety reasons. (Car, kitchen, bedside table, emergency kit, overnight bag, desk area, work tote, etc.) I love the small size, the different flashing modes and brightness levels, and how compact they really are. Sturdy, strong, GREAT price! Sure, you may find similar items slightly cheaper, but I want the real thing and like getting a 2-pack in each box. These make GREAT gifts. It may not be the most sexy gift, but you can't put a price on safety of a loved one.",

They have a really nice heft without being too heavy. They are extremely bright with a nice, white light. Last night we had a power outage and needed to turn on the generator, and boy did this come in handy to see which switch to throw inside and then to look at the generator outside to make sure it was working okay. The 2-pack is perfect for us, and I would recommend these to anyone who wants bright, white light in a compact size. The zoom feature is an added nice feature!",

I've got 8-10 18650's from when i used to vape, and with some backup charging devices in means I could probably go MONTHS without needing to worry about a light source. These have incredibly bright beams for a price that's not much more than pocket change. I've paid $50-$60 for lights many times in the past and am equally impressed with these flashlights. Very highly recommended, again, especially for the price.",
