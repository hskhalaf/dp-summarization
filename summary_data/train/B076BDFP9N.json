I just can't recommend this to anyone, and don't know what to do with what's left in the jar. For reference, I tried this product 3 times with similar results. I had been using a dead sea mud mask and that has much better effects for my combination skin, so if you don't get what you're looking for here maybe try a mud mask instead.",

Using this mud mask once a week with a clay mask once a week is a great remedy for a breakout.
