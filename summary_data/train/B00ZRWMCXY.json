      "text": "I purchased this pillow for my wife two and half years ago. It started ripping at the seam that holds the two cushions less than a year into its use. The pillow was still usable all this time but last week, the rip finally exposed the foam inside one of the cushions and it started taking on water, soaking the foam. So we had to throw it away. I remembered the 10-year limited warranty so I wrote to Hills Point Industries on Friday. I received a reply back the following day. And after providing the Amazon order number and our shipping address, we received a new identical pillow today, exactly a week later. Very impressive.",

      "text": "I used this the first night that I received it and it was so comfortable. I couldn't lean back in my bathtub and soak before this arrived because of the abrupt edge, which hurt my head and shoulders. Now I can lay back and enjoy. The surface of the pillow is very comfortable and doesn't feel cold or sticky. I love it! Stays stuck and doesn't slip or slide. Seems to resist mildew, too. 12/3/16 - I love my spa pillow so much that I just ordered another for my daughter's birthday. This makes soaking in the tub pure bliss!",

About 9 months later it has lost some of it's suction power and there is some wear and tear at the seams. Considering the price of the item it was not expected to last forever, especially considering its use in the bathtub.",

      "text": "I have used this for about 2 weeks and so far I really like it. It is comfortable with the two sections of padding that cradle your neck and head. It's easy to change positions and still have plenty of padding behind you, whether you're sitting up, sinking down, or leaning back. The suction cups grab on easily and keep the pillow from moving around. You do need to take care when removing the pillow to gently pull up each suction cup individually (and not tug on the pillow itself) to avoid rips. Overall I am happy with this and would buy it again.",

It's easy to wash and dry. We've had one before it it would get so heavy with water and just fall off. This won't and hasn't been like that. Amazing bath pillow, for us",
