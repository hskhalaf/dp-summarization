They are more for preventing scrapes and bruises. And they are pretty comfortable and don't restrict movement. I'll probably wear them over some g-force elbow pads so I have more impact protection, as well.",

I will say these aren't for if you want to do large vert ramps though. They work great when falling off rails or if you catch a rock and fall. If you intend to catch big air I would search for something that offers a little more protection. I have crashed pretty good before and after getting these and I absolutely prefer to crash while wearing them.",
