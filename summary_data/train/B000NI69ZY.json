Seems to be well made and durable. Seems to be quite accurate. The device was more than I wanted to spend on such a tool, but it was recommended to me by others in the industry and it's living up to its reputation.",

I mainly use it on new construction, when they have the ability to make adjustments more easily. Works well.

They added a push button to allow the battery cover to slide off, which is located in the middle of the back of the meter body, so the light meter doesn't sit flat on the ground anymore. Other than that, it's a good meter at a good price.",
