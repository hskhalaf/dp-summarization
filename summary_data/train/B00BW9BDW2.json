I usually dig with a pick axe but recently needed a smaller similar tool and opted for the HART 1.5 Lb. mini mattock for expanding a flower bed. The photo shows a rock I dug out using only the mini mattock and a pinch bar. I used the mattock to dig and clear all the smaller debris from around the larger rock and the pinch bar for prying it out. Great digging tool.",

The wedged end of this mattock went through the roots like butter. The sharpened pointed end let me get dirt out from between larger roots so I had plenty of room for my hostas. I chose the mattock with a 1 1/2 pound head because I knew it would be strong and heavy enough to get the job done, but it would not be so heavy that it would tire me out or injure my hand. I\u2019d buy this again in a heartbeat - quality construction at a great price.",

I read the one critical review where the purchaser compared it with an Estwing hammer; that's a good analogy since Hart's quality is comparable to Estwing's which makes premium hammers. This hand held mattock has become one of my favorite yard and garden tools; I use it for planting new flowering bushes plus spring and summer flowering bulbs and have recently been using it to dig trenches in the yard, to form and pour concrete mowing strips. A superlative tool; well made, good balance and weight. I wholeheartedly recommend this tool for digging small to medium holes and areas.",
