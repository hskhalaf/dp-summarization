The pdf also includes a recipe that appears rather enticing. The pastry scraper is a very versatile tool - and easy to clean - so I find myself using it so much it hardly sees the inside of a drawer. Another good thing about this scraper, in particular, is the company Spring Chef provides a very personal, a very human touch to its service. Quite a refreshing experience.",

To my delight, it's far better than the items I lost. The pastry scraper fits my hand perfectly and comfortably. Gathering dough now is a quick, easy job. And the bench scraper is fantastic - not only does it comfortably fit my arthritic hand with no discomfort whatsoever but it does an fabulous job cleaning the work space. I'm thrilled with both products, so much so that I've recommend them to friends - something I rarely do unless the product is really outstanding. These are!",

I gave it an informal test today while making some mixed fruit breakfast pastries using thawed, packaged and rolled out ready to fill puff pastry. The plastic scraper clung to the dough and left part of it on the underlying parchment paper. The Spring Chef scraper lifted both dough and oven ready filled pastries without tearing or leaving dough traces behind. I had used it to cut the sheets of puff pastry after rolling and before filling. This utensil cleaned up easily and worked beautifully. It would be great for all kinds of dough and I am very well pleased with my inexpensive purchase. Bravo!",
