Simply pull the plug when the fat is separated and the remainder gravy easily pours into your pot for thickening. It cleaned easily in the top rack of the dishwasher.

I gave used my kids straw cleaners to clean them before, but those are skinny and a little flimsy and I need something thicker that can get down the spout and clean the oil. Other than that the product works great at separating, just make sure you have the stopper in first before you pour your juices in or the fat will go I the spout first.",
