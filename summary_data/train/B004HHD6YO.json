      "text": "My daughter has been using these as part of her training now for the entire 12u spring season. Good for increasing strength but if your daughter is not throwing strikes to begin with, these will really throw her release point off. Would be nice if they were hittable as well. The stripes are running for a 2-seam which is not the ideal starting pitch but would work for simple wrist strengthening or half-motion warm-up. Also very good for strengthening standard field throwing and may even be a bit better for that.",

As an adult who doesn't usually have time to get a full proper warm up before a softball game, tossing with these before throwing with a regular ball is a great way to warm up the muscles without straining yourself to hurry with a lighter weight ball. Now I don't have to throw a football beforehand - those are much harder to fit into a backpack softball bag. I almost don't even need the lower weights for throwing, could almost use two weights higher.",
