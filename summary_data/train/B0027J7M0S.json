We live in a row home and I wanted something that was easy to carry around the house. It\u2019s light enough to carry up and down the stairs but still sturdy enough to hold up to being banged around and not get damaged. It\u2019s versatile, you can decorate it however it suits your bird. I did not install the top bar or the wing flaps so that it is more compact and I wrapped macrame around the bars so my bird could walk on them easier. I love it!",

      "text": "I really like this perch. It keeps my African Gray from climbing all the way down to the floor. The reason for the 4 stars is because of where the food and water dishes are. I'm thinking who ever designed this must not know birds. They go to the very top to hang out, hence the poop goes to the bottom. I also think a better metal bar should be made for the top. Since that's where the birds go they have problems hanging on. Anyone that fixes these problems will have a not in stock sign out all the time. Also I put sisal rope all over the bars so he can climb and get around better.",

My only complaint would be the ladder rungs which are too small and my bird doesn't/can't use them. Overall, my bird really seems to like the stand and stays put on it for a while. So, I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone with a medium size bird.",

I have the same problem with his cage which is designed for a large to medium sized parrot. The perch is large enough but they need to make the catch guards larger to keep birds on the cage or perch. I can really only use this for him when I'm in the same room and can tell him to stay on his perch. So if you have a parrot that's an escape artist this might not be the perch for you.",

I followed the reviews and added the ripe around the top part of the stand. The bars were very small before adding it and the birds couldn't get a grip on it. It was much more then I expected it to be and such a good value for the price. I would recommend it if youre considering it.",

However I am going to wrap the top bar since he tried climbing it and swung upside down like a crazed Olympian, to his and my suprise! Top bar is very slippery and narrow for his chubby eagle claws. We both laughed literally! At least he thought it was fun but definitely needs better grips, will be ordering rope.",

Deck it out with rope perches, toys, and colorful vet wrap to make a magical parrot play-stand. Might want to go next size up for anything larger than an CAG. A bigger Macaw, or any bird with lengthy tail feathers, will need a little more space to maneuver.",

Not to mention, the wood perches should be a little more rough for easy grasping, but that is a easy fix. What I was pleased about was is the size...its perfect for smaller places and would be just fine for my bird if only it was designed more with a parrot in mind.",

My only complaint is that I wish the food dishes were up top because every time she's on the upper perch she ends up pooping in the water dish.",

My parrot loves to land on the very top... if you could make the diameter of that bar a little wider or turn it into another perch (a different diameter perch for variety) it would be great.

      "text": "Easy enough to assemble, good quality materials too. Comes with the Allen key, so no worry about needing any tools! Simple easy instructions, took about 30 minutes, with a toddler helping and running off with parts! I'll use it for cockatiels and african grey. Love how you can add or rotate toys. Nicely made, not too big, but not small and flimsy either.",

I did like another person suggested and wrapped the top piece in grass rope. BTW-- this was simple to put together. Had good instructions and took my hubby 30 min.",

The only drawbacks are; the size of the small bolts that are really tiny impossible to hold with out pliers and it does take 2 to get the seed shield together. As another person noted, if using for larger birds than cockatiels the top wire is too small and I did wrap with cotton clothesline to make it usable for her to perch.",

There are many hooks for hanging toys. I find that it's good for feeding fresh food because the debris is easier to clean than when he is fed the fresh food at his large cage, which will occasionally attract ants. Pluto loves the bird gym, and gets excited and perky when I say, \"Want to go to the bird gym!?\"",
