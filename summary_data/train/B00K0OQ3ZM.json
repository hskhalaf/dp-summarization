I used the new set for three sets of shrugs and the seam tore out of them, causing me to have them replaced. When the new set arrived, the same thing happened the first time I used them. In place of returning them, I removed the bent hooks from my old pair and replaced them with the hooks from this new pair. I used them today with more weight then I was lifting with the original new pairs, and I had no issues. I am disappointed in the quality of the stitching...",

They work beautifully for that purpose when doing heavy rows and other 'pulling' movements, and flop out of the way when doing 'push' movements like presses, so you can leave them on for the whole workout. A particular benefit that these have over most other weightlifting hooks is that you can adjust the reach by moving the hook from one side of the attaching strap to the other. The two positions make for a much better chance of getting them to fit you hands.",
