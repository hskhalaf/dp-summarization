I wear a size 10-10.5 shoe and I got these in 11.5 and was debating on going up another half size because they fit a little too snug. I just decided to get new socks instead of wearing 2 pairs, one being wool. It's a pretty solid boot, I gave it four stars because I prefer a stiff boot vs. a boot with flex. It's not extremely flexible, but it's there. They are really comfortable and the lining actually molds to your foot overtime which is nice. Overall, great price for what you get. I would recommend",

They do run small, I typically wear a size 10.5 in vans, and I ordered these in 11.5 and my toes barely fit, a 12 would have probably been more optimal for me. These boots do have flex to them, enough to be noticeable but it's not terrible. They also tend to come loose fairly easily, so you will have to re-lace a good amount throughout the day. They are really comfortable, and keep your feet nice and dry all day. For the price, I would highly recommend these boots.",
