      "text": "Bought for my 7 y.o. who plays academy soccer and he and his teammates love this glove. It offers grip, padding and finger protection usually available in much costlier gloves. The catch? You compromise in quality. They won't last as long. The palm will start peeling a bit after a few games. But in my son's case they lasted through an entire season of 2-3 practices/week and 2 games/weekend in decent enough shape which is what I needed (at this age they outgrow them quickly anyway).",

They no longer carry this gk mit, but amazon does! And at a better price, bonus! Would i but then again? Yes! Only downside i have come across with owning several of these is: The palm usually starts to wear & the side of a finger came unstitched. (But then again, my son plays nearly 7days a week: school, elite travel & indoor club, & rec leagues and is rough on gear. These lasted about 4-6 months: roughly one season, plus indoor.)",

So I ordered these in a size 9. Vizari's glove is a little smaller so perhaps next time I will go with a size 10. I have played 2 games so far. The padding is already starting to come off but honestly this happens with most gloves. My biggest criticism of this product is the velcro strap. When you strap it on there is nowhere to fasten the rest of the strap, so it just hangs out there (not normal for gk gloves).",
