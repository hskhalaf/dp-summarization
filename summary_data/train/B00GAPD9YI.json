Amazing after seven weeks, the bedwetting stopped completely and he continued to have no accidents. Take my suggestion if your child is a bedwetter buy this alarm.",

Chummie bedwetting alarm has been awesome but you have to commit and follow the instructions. For the first week, I slept in his room to help wake him up then the alarm trained his brain to get up as soon as it started making sound and then he started responding before it even made an alert sound. It's been less than a month straight of dry nights and we're so proud of our son and he's so proud of himself. We can say based on our experience that Chummie really works!",

So, we finally bought this alarm and in less than two months of use, he went from 2 accidents a night to completely accident-free. From then on, he has been dry every single night. Never one accident. It's been a month and counting. I know that every kid is different but we are thrilled with the results and would recommend this alarm for the child who wants to be diaper free.",

The alarm itself is loud and the sensor is very sensitive as it only takes a couple of drops of water to activate the alarm. Eventually the alarm stopped him from peeing in the bed and he learned to hold his pee. It has woken our son up even though he was a deep sleeper.

I tried the other methods before after a few months we gave up and went back to leaking, expensive pull-ups. He'd sleep through all other methods and showed no result at all. When I first purchased this product, I wasn\u2019t sure it would work, but after just a few weeks I saw a great improvement. The alarm is fairly loud so it woke both of us up, and for that reason it trained both of us. This alarm resolved the bed wetting completely in about two months. Great product, would recommend if you are having bed wetting child.",
