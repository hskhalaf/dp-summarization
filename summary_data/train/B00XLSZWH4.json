To pack them, just zip half way, and start loading up. I rolled all our clothes, and it held my pants, shorts, and tops, an all of my husbands shorts and tops.",

I don't have to worry about overhead storage filling up or what order I board the plane because I can just put my bag beneath my seat. These packing cubes enable me to fit more clothing items into my backpack and keep them much more organized. These bags seem to be high quality and breathable.

Also works well on a cruise when you may only have shelves for storage. The cubes are ideal if you use a duffel bag. They are very compact, and make organizing your suitcase so easy! The quality is very good. I've used these on at least six extended trips so far and won't pack now without them.",

The cubes are well-made and they kept our suitcases organized. You can pack a good amount of clothes by rolling them. Packing the clothes by category made it so much easier to get dress. It was a lifesaver, especially with a teenager who has no sense of organization. It definitely eliminated the \"Mom, where's my...?\" so I could enjoy our vacation and stress less.",
