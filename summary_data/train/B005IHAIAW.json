Her main interest is wildlife and insect life and I think this camera will work out well. The 10fps will really help with the hummingbirds and dragonflies. So far it has performed flawlessly. Very fast to auto focus. Also, compatibility with all her Sony and Minolta lenses is a big plus",

I can not say enough good things about this camera. A lot of people complain that the sensor is \"noisy\" but I don't see it unless I'm shooting at some crazy high ISO. The only negative I can think of, is that the 10 fps mode is program auto only, so don't expect to be able to shoot fast action sports with full control over aperture and shutter.",

Cons: Button configuration is different than past Sony models. For example, ISO button is on top near the trigger and it took some time to get used to. Not sure if this is bad luck or faulty design, but I've had to manually clean the mirrors twice in the three weeks I've had it.",

It directs light to both the image sensor and the Phase Detection AF sensor simultaneously.\n\n24.3 MP; best-in-class resolution \nYou get incredible detail and gorgeous enlargements thanks to an APS-C sensor with 24.3 megapixels. It's the worlds's first 24.3MPAPS-C DSLR\n\nUpgraded BIONZ image processor \nThe brain of the camera is a Sony's BIONZ image processor substantially upgraded for the demands of 24.3 megapixel photography. Chroma noise reduction delivers high-resolution, low-noise photos even at ISO 16000. Also enables fast processing for up to 10 fps continuous shooting of data-intensive 24.3 MP images, 2D/3D Sweep Panorama modes and 6-image layering.\n\nSony Exmor technology \nConventional image sensors use only a handful of analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, which can slow you down. The Exmor sensor provides more than 5,600 column-parallel A/D converters. This helps enable continuous shooting at up to 10 frames per second.\n\n\n\n\nUltra-fast up to 10 fps continuous \nThe translucent mirror makes it far easier to capture the decisive soccer kick or your baby at her absolute cutest. Shoots up to 10 frames per second at full-resolution 24.3 megapixels with continuous auto focus (AE locked after first frame). \n\nWorld's first OLED viewfinder \nThere's never been anything quite like the Tru-Finder OLED electronic viewfinder. For size, speed and brightness even after sunset, this is a gem. It begins with 2359K dots for amazing resolution and high contrast ratio for incredible depth. OLED reduces motion blur to a bare minimum. You can also see the results of camera adjustments in real time with superb color and detail. \n\nFull-Time Live View in LCD or EVF \nYou can use both the LCD monitor and OLED Electronic Viewfinder for composing shots in Live View. Both provide a what-you-see-is-what-you-get preview of white balance, focus, depth of field, exposure and 100% framing accuracy, plus informative on-screen displays. \n\nTilt/swivel LCD screen \nTilt it up or down to frame high- and low-angle shots that would otherwise be hit-or-miss. Tilt and swivel under the camera for self-portraits. Finally, the monitor folds flush to the camera with the LCD exposed for shooting or protected for travel. \n\n921K dot TruBlack LCD screen \nSony's 3.0-inch Xtra Fine LCD monitor has 921K dots for superb resolution. The TruBlack screen includes a special resin layer to suppress internal reflections, increasing contrast compared to conventional LCDs. Sunny Weather mode boosts visibility even further.\nGraphic Display \nClarifies the relationship between aperture and shutter speed, as well as the effect each has on photographic results.\n\nHD Movies at 60p, 60i, or 24p \nCapture spectacular HD Movies. This is the world's first DSLR to offer a choice of super-smooth 60p, standard 60i or cinematic 24p, all at Full HD 1920x1080 resolution. AVCHD Progressive codec delivers stunning picture quality. MP4 codec offers smaller files for easier upload to the web. \n\nHD movies with full manual control \nNow you don't need to surrender control when you shoot HD movies. Enjoy the full expressive potential of Program, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority or Manual (P/A/S/M) control in HD movie mode. \n\nFull-time Phase Detection AF \nYou get fast, accurate auto focus in every mode\u2014even HD Movie and Live View\u2014thanks to Sony's exclusive Translucent Mirror Technology. While Contrast Detection Auto Focus often hunts for correct focus, Phase Detection AF knows exactly where correct focus is, and goes straight for it.\n\nHDMI output for HD viewing \nEnjoy HD movies and stunning still images on a compatible HDTV. The camera includes an HDMI output. In addition, the BRAVIA Sync system works with compatible Sony BRAVIA HDTVs enabling you to control camera playback using the television's remote. \n\n\n\n15-point Auto Focus \nTo maximize the value of Translucent Mirror Technology, Sony incorporates Phase Detection AF of great sophistication. 15 sensors with 3 cross sensors maximize precision for both vertical and horizontal subjects. \nWorld's shortest release time lag \nHelps ensure that the image you want is the image you get. Once auto focus occurs, release time lag is the delay between fully pressing the shutter release and when the camera actually starts taking the picture. Long lag makes it harder to capture fast-moving objects. The Sony A65 boasts the world's shortest DSLR release time lag at only 0.05 seconds. \n\nObject Tracking AF \nLocks onto a specified object and maintains focus even as the subject moves. Unpredictable subjects stay in focus even while zooming. You can concentrate on composition without worrying about focus. 6-image layering \nLeverages the fast BIONZ processor to capture six images in a fraction of a second, and then combine the data. The result is one incredible single image that gets a cleaner result in Multi-Frame NR mode or sharper nighttime pictures in Hand-held Twilight mode.\n\nMulti-frame NR \nExperience incredible low-light shooting without a flash. The camera captures six images in a fraction of a second. Combining the data from all six, it creates a single image with a reduction in noise equivalent to two additional steps of ISO sensitivity. Sensitivity selectable up to ISO 25600. (Recommended for still subjects.)\n\nHandheld Twilight mode \nGet gorgeous shots at night without a tripod. Combines six frames into a single image for smooth, low-noise evening shots. (Recommended for still subjects.)\n\nAuto HDR built into camera \nCaptures more scene dynamic range than a single exposure can handle\u2014and more range than photo film. Combines the best highlight detail from one shot, the best mid-tones from a second and the best shadow detail from a third for one incredible shot. (Recommended for still subjects.) \n\n3D Sweep Panorama Mode \nCapture vast scenic vistas and 16:9 shots in spectacular 3D. As you sweep across the panorama, the camera records separate right-eye and left-eye images that make landscapes come alive on your 3D television. Records both JPEG and MPO file formats. \n\nSweep Panorama Mode \nCapture expansive landscapes automatically. Press the shutter, sweep vertically or horizontally. The camera does the rest, continuously shooting images and stitching them together. \n\nShot Result Preview \nSee the results before you take the shot. This preview takes the guesswork out of camera settings by showing the effects of the aperture, shutter and DRO settings on the depth of field, motion and dynamic range. \n\nMain Sensor Quick AF Live View \nCombines the fast focus of Phase Detection AF with high quality Live View images right from the main sensor. This is made possible by Sony Translucent Mirror Technology. You get accurate images and 100% framing on the LCD monitor or eye-level viewfinder. \n\nISO 16000 sensitivity \nIncredibly clear low-light pictures without sacrificing detail, made possible by the low-noise Exmor APS HD CMOS image sensor and refined BIONZ image processor. \n\nAUTO+ (Advanced Auto) mode \nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots.

Can prioritize children or adults. Face Registration can remember friends and family members and prioritize them. \n\n1200-Zone exposure metering \nReads exposure directly from the main image sensor. Choice of Multi, Center and Spot metering accommodates a full range of shooting situations.\n\nSteadyShot INSIDE stabilization \nImage stabilization reduces blur by compensating for camera shake. Typical DSLR systems build image stabilization into selected lenses only. SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization is built into the camera body itself. You'll reduce blur with every A Mount lens, including macro and wide-aperture standard zoom lenses.\n\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) \nImproves results with backlit subjects and recovers details hidden in shadows. Settings include Auto, Level with a choice of five operating levels and Off. \n\nSmile Shutter technology \nCaptures a smile the moment it happens. Simply select the Smile Shutter mode and the camera takes the picture automatically. You can prioritize children or adults and adjust the smile sensitivity. \n\nUp to 560 Shots of battery life \nTake up to 560 shots on a single charge with Sony Stamina battery power. Sony's InfoLITHIUM battery system enables you to see the percent of power remaining, so you can keep shooting in confidence.\n\nP/A/S/M exposure modes \nThe camera offers a full range of controls from the beginner's AUTO+ mode to P/A/S/M: Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual. On-screen prompts help you refine your skills, build your confidence and exercise greater creative control.\n\nAdvanced Anti-Dust Technology \nAnti-Dust Technology helps keep the CMOS sensor clean, resulting in consistently clear pictures.
