      "text": "Good little amp. I broke the stock tube pulling off the lid. My bad. The Groove Tube sounded better anyway. The design is pretty good, I have no complaints. I don't care for the color, but it doesn't bother me. Still braking it in, so we will see how long it last and if it starts sounding better. I would recommend this unit if you need a good headphone amp! I really like the inputs and outputs on this device. Two sizes of headphone jacks, awesome. Some say it gets really hot, but mine doesn't get really hot. You can still touch it.Has plenty of power for almost anything.",

This amp is really cool looking and built well. I use it for my computer, but I plan on making it a turntable amplifier in the future because I need a DAC. The biggest issue I have with it is that it pops when you turn it on. Whether or not this is unsafe for your headphones, I don't know. I play it safe and turn it on before plugging in my headphones. I advise you do the same.",

You dont need this for a pair of IEMs like my westone umpro50, they sound great with less exp amps but for some real power and class A this is it. Compared to a schiit magna 3 this blows it away and that is rated 3 times as powerful. Tube sound is awesome.",

I bought it to improve sound and get around the cell phone MP3 player's annoying volume nanny. I am very pleased with it. Actually considering buying a 2nd. The only con I've found so far is that if you leave the little transformer that comes with it plugged it, ever once in a while it makes a clicking sound. I only noticed it because I'm using it in the bedroom and it woke me up. I just keep it unplugged when I'm not using it.",

I ordered the $30 tube since the reviews recommended it. However, i can say i'm pleased with the stock tube, too. I just run it out of my iPhone into the Bravo and into my B&O headphones. sounds great. for the price, i am so glad to pick this up.",

I bought them both at the same time, but my Headphones arrived first. I tried them to with any amp and they sound good, but I felt that I was missing something. However, once I receive my amp, which by the way arrived days before the estimated time, it transform my experience with headphones. In addition to that I was able to hook this up with my xbox and It enhance my listening experience on my video-games and on my movies.",
