Fell apart a little when opened, which is fine, won\u2019t damage the product. USE BETTER PACKAGING TAPE. The tape left residue on all the rings that defies Goo Gone. The smaller ones I could remove mostly no problem. The large one were taped at three locations, all left pretty much all the adhesive onto the ring. It took soaking in Goo Gone, hot water, then a scourging pad for 15 minutes to remove 90% of it. This is a food prep product, tape is not food safe. Think of a better packaging.",

The tape was used to attach cardboard pieces to inside the package the molds arrived in. I had an extremely difficult time getting the glue residue off the metal, even with using \u201cGoo Gone\u201d! After baking, brown discolored areas where the tape was used. It was totally unnecessary to tape the cardboard to the mold set.",
