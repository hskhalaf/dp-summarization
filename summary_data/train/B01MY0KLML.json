      "text": "For the last couple of years we've had issues with destructive squirrels in our yard. They chewed through a beam in our pergola, destroyed our veggie garden and even ate the eggs right of a bird's nest. We sprayed a repellent and that worked temporarily, but you need to re-apply every month. I ordered the Picnic Table Feeder, not to use as a feeder but rather as a deterrent. We put it on a tree on the opposite side of the yard with some feed corn and it worked! I haven't seen a squirrel in our pergola or pool area in weeks, but we can still enjoy watching them eat and play from a distance.",

But it's a solid functional piece. I buy giant bags of dehydrated corn here off Amazon and the squirrels and chipmunks go crazy for them! Took a few days for them to take their first nibble, and now weeks later, they haven't left. They'll go through a corn cob in less than an hour. Perfect entertainment for me and my young kids!",

I just put a toothpick in the hole and it works OK. I can\u2019t see this thing lasting too long. The squirrels don\u2019t seem to like it either.
