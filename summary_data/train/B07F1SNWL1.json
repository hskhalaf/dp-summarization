      "verdict": "While it is certainly much cheaper than most digital smart scales and offers a wide range of body measurements, we find it difficult to recommend a scale with an app that describes a person 1% above healthy as \"chubby\". For that reason, we'd keep this away from children and anyone at risk of unhealthy body-perception issues. For adults who want an inexpensive set of digital scales, the Hamswan Bluetooth Smart Scale offers great value and a decent design - although its accuracy has been questioned.",

Weight reading seems to be pretty accurate, 200g variation.",

Healthu+ app can be downloaded for play store. Its easy to connect app to scales just follow guide. App itself is similar easy to use. There so many details it shows about body. Body fat, body muscle, bone mass, bmi, and more some of them i see first time. It very interesting to check your progress or regress:D",

The digital display was fairly accurate as long as you stay place your feet on the four electrons. The scale connects really easily via Bluetooth on the app and it allows me to check a variety of things which is useful and informative. Make sure you have 3x aaa batteries as they are not included. Overall I highly recommend this product!",

The scales are easy to connect to a smartphone and take about five seconds to transmit your data to your phone. The app enables you to record lots of data about your body as well as the basic weight and produces the information as a graph or a chronological list. It is early days yet but I think these are terrific value for money. It will be interesting to see how long they continue to work.",
