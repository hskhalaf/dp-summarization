The sleeves are a bit long and I have long arms. I would rather have this than have them be too short. Cons: It catches and pulls the thread out extremely easily. It says to cut them off right away but I\u2019d be cutting them daily if I did. If you don\u2019t have animals, kids, or construction going on in your home, this might not be as big of an issue.

She has owned it now about a year and a half and it has kept its color and feel with no problems. I would suggest this robe 100%",

I'm 5'10\", 170, 34C, usually a medium or large, and the M/L comes to about mid-calf and wraps around with a good overlap but without being huge. There is no inner tie, but the inherent friction of terry keeps it from slipping open. I haven't washed it yet, but it's already fairly soft and I expect it will only become more so with time.

My parents bought me a medium sized robe like this two years ago and it has always been way too big. When I finally decided to get a new one, I went for the small/extra small size instead and it fits perfectly! Couldn\u2019t be happier. Also? It\u2019s so cushy and soft!",

I bit the bullet and picked this up. At 5 foot 8, and 155 lbs, the small/medium fits very well. It's thick, warm, and heavy. My only complaint about the robe at all is that there seems to be a lot of loose thread/stitching. I've washed it a few times, and it seems to hold up well to washing.",

My wife is 5'5\" and about 150lbs so I got the L/XL thinking it would hang close to the ground (which is what she wants) but she said it felt a bit big and only reaches her knees. Oh well, she must like it because I see her wearing it all the time now. The material is high quality and I would recommend this and might buy one for me in the near future.",

It's incredibly well made and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a robe of quality and substance!",
