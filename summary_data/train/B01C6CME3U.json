      "text": "This is a wonderful product. Most pocket charts are flimsy and thin making the clear pockets loose and sloppy. This one is of excellent quality. It's thick and sturdy. The clear coverings are just as thick and there is nothing sloppy about it. This is the best pocket chart I own. I will be replacing my others with these as well. Not to mention, it's adorable! Love the design and color - adds a bit of fun to the classroom. Thank you for making a lasting pocket chart! Highly recommend.",
