Have had no problem with slippage / unraveling. Great product and highly recommend it for fresh and salt water. Be ready for some very long casts, and if using mono backing, make SURE you have plenty of Power Pro on to bury the union knot deep on the reel.

I also use about 2' of Fluro for a leader and the high viability of the power pro really shows what the sneaky fish are doing. I will continue to use it and suggest you try it as well.",

Buy your line in person is my recommendation. I\u2019ve always used Power Pro, but first spool I buy online comes in and is the worst line I\u2019ve ever dealt with of any brand or model by far.",

This is the third or fourth spool of braided line I've bought and this is by far the best. The strength of this line is incredible for the width. I wrapped 3 reels with this one spool and still had some left over. The line also bends and keeps its form so it is great for tying knots. This is just an all around great line for the price. If you want braided, this is the way to go.",

Unfortunately, the line seems a bit frayed in places when trying to spool a reel. I had to respool way more often than I did the first few small spools I bought. I have no clue how they could be different but it doesn't seem the same quality somehow but only in certain places in the line.",
