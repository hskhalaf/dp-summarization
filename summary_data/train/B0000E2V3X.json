Upon removing the pan from the box, I coated the pan with vegetable oil and left it in the oven to heat for a couple of hours. We have have used it many times over the past few months (more than I care to admit!) and it works like a charm. It is a bit more expensive than most pizza pans but I have I doubt this pan will last a lifetime. Well worth the price for the quality. Would recommend!",

Then with what you've learned, use your favorite crust recipe. Better than a stone. Use it on the gas grill or use it on the charcoal grill for that extra added flavor. Use it in the oven if you would like. You won't be disappointed. Of course, you can use this as a griddle or anything else that a cast iron pan can be used for. It is big and it is heavy. Just treat it right, the way Lodge recommends",

      "text": "If you're looking to make pizza in the oven, this might be perfect for you, but not for the grill. The cast iron conducts heat so well it burns the crust really badly when used in a space like the grill where the heat source is directly below the food. I've heard these work really well in an oven where you can use the broiler for heat but it's a bust on the grill. Get a pizza stone for the grill, they work like a charm. Also, read this listing very carefully apparently returns are not allowed so be absolutely sure it will work for you before purchasing.",
