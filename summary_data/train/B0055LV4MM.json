I'm a renter and this was an easy solution since I can't buy a real gate for the house and when the dog comes in, I can easily unhook and carry the gate inside with me. As a bonus... this was also a great solution to stop the neighbors dog from coming over in the middle of the night and doing his business on my lawn every night.",

I wouldn't recommend this if you're wanting to protect a child from going up and down stairs. It does offer protection but not enough for me to trust it for that purpose. As for blocking off a room, this is perfect. I've attached pictures for reference.",

We loved that we didn\u2019t have to step over anything & had the full width of the doorway to use, unlike pressure-mount gates which narrow the opening considerably. We did not use them on the staircase & would not recommend that because the bottom doesn\u2019t have a horizontal brace. Very easy to install. A couple insights for consideration: install it a smidge higher so you can place felt on the bottom if using over a hard floor surface; install beyond trimwork & far enough out from wall/trim to avoid marking them up (1 less turn of the screws).",

Perhaps if there was a clip style hook that went into the eyehook, that would be better.",

Being at the top of stairs is dangerous, babies can easily shake it and have the latches break causing them to fall so I would not recommend that. If you are needing a gate that can expand wide areas and is easy on and off I would absolutely recommend this one.",

      "text": "We originally ordered a metal gate with the ubiquitous pressure mounts that (in theory) hold it in place in the doorway. That gate, while more attractive than the Evenflo gate, would not stay up. We like that the Evenflo gate can be quickly mounted in a doorway with a solid wood frame with screws. Our 60-lb dog has never even attempted to take it down. The only (slight) negative is that going in and out is tricky--you must carefully align two metal pins into the eye bolts, and unlocking it requires two hands. However, overall, we are quite pleased. If we ever feel like it, we can stain or paint the wood for a more finished look.",

The only way I could make this safe was to get creative with some wooden dowels and eye screws to prevent her getting her head through.",

I wouldn\u2019t suggest this gate for determined pups who tend to jump or wiggle through small spaces as they could get hung up on the gate and hurt themselves.

I stained it with Watco Danish Oil Golden Oak. Looks great and was easy to install. It is nice clear wood that took the oil finish very well.",

My last one was chewed apart by our beagle though so if you are buying this for a dog be aware that they can chew and ingest the wood.",
