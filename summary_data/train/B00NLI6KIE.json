Most of the places where holes needed to be drilled had small indentations indicating where to drill the hole, but a few did not. After we finished assembly by attaching the roof to the top, we noticed that the roof had a large dent on the front (see photo). Since the shipping box was completely undamaged, I think the roof piece was damaged during the manufacturing or packing process and the playhouse was shipped with a defective piece. Overall, I am not satisfied with this purchase.",

    "description": "There\u2019s a very good reason why Step2 named this popular kitchen playset the Happy Home Cottage & Grill. It makes kids really, really HAPPY! As in giggly, silly, jumping-up-and-down, can\u2019t-contain-themselves happy. The secret is in the many cool features it has that a lot of other play kitchens don\u2019t. Things like a built-in mailbox, chiming doorbell, play phone, wall clock, flower box, swinging dutch-style door, working shutters, hardwood-looking floor (with drain holes), fireplace, kitchen seat, sink, and toy grill. All absolutely necessary for great pretend play, of course. So, if you\u2019re looking for a kids kitchen set with a kids grill that\u2019s beyond fun, this is the one! Made in the U.S.A. of U.S. and imported parts. Adult assembly required. Self-Service is available for titles, product descriptions, bullet features and search terms. You can access self-service features on Vendor Central by going to Items > Edit Products.",
