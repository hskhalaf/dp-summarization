Both dogs found their spots, curled up, and slept like babies - with Bulldog drool of course. The mattress wasn't too hard nor was it too soft for them. They also seemed to like the ability to see out the windows that they are unable to see out of without the mattress. This fits both cars well (Lincoln and Ford) and we recommend. Would buy again.",

      "text": "I tried it out for the first time a few days ago. I liked that it was easy to set up. The smaller part of the mattress that fits in the area where you put your feet didn't stay inflated and I'm not sure how that deflated. The mattress wasn't bad, but, it was hard for me to sleep in my backs seat. I like to stretch my legs out and not be so confined. I might just use it for short naps during long car drives or give it another try since it was my first outing and trying it out. I'm still on the fence if I would buy it again.",
