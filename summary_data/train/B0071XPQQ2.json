I am a big fan of cerave and I\u2019m not sure if this product was just a miss or if i got something inauthentic but this product smelled horrible and broke me out even more despite being noncomedogenic. It did not improve the bumps I have on my arms at all. The original cerave moisturizer did a better job and I will continue to use that one. I recommend you look elsewhere, especially considering how expensive this was for the small amount that it comes with.",

It's the only thing that has EVER made a noticeable difference on my upper arms and shoulders. It's a slow process, and I try to really scrub my skin before applying for (what I would hope to be) the best possible results",
