However it\u2019s so high quality and fits so well when on I can overlook that. It\u2019s cut well and feels great swimming laps.",

When the suit came, the bra area was dented in a very unflattering way and I almost returned it, but decided to give it a try. It worked itself out after the first two swims. The suit is also a little cheeky, but when I'm in the water it's fine.",

The material is soft but still thick and good quality, and it provided good rear coverage. Since one-piece suits are more in style now, they tend to be low cut and cheeky. This one is definitely not and is more practical over style, but still cute. I'm 5'6\", 34-25-36, and I ordered a SM/34. It's a little loose for me around the waist but that was expected based off the size chart, if I went any smaller it wouldn't have covered my rear enough.",

I wanted a bathing suit for doing laps, and I didn't want one that was too revealing or sexy. Just a utilitarian, functional bathing suit. This is it. I have a curvy figure and would like a tiny bit more coverage around the chest, but this will do. I think most people would find it's adequate coverage. There is soft padding in the chest so nothing pokes through :) For reference, I am 5'5'' and about 140 lbs, and I ordered size 36. If anything it's a tiny bit tight, but I think the next size up would be too loose.",

Well, they were way too big on her, so I ordered her a 32. She said the 32 fit great. Now she has two swimming suits so this worked out great for her. She has long legs and a short-ish torso, narrow shoulders, skinny but long neck, thin waist, small bust, flat butt, wide hips, if that helps anyone.",

I bought this one to just get through the season. It's quality is exceptional and it's a very cute, modest suit. I think she will wear this during the summer as well. It's not technically a full competition suit, but she is not a serious competitor. Would be great for a practice suit, and do economical!",
