      "text": "I bought this for my 6yo son who's learning kajukenbo. I wanted him to be able to practice and strengthen his kicks and punches. I've had it for about 6 months now and it's still holding up great. The material inside and the the outer material are holding up fine. I don't know if I would suggest it for older kids or adults, as I'd imagine that they'd need something with more compact material.",

      "text": "Unfortunately this product began to show wear after just 6 weeks of moderate usage. I teach a KB class at a corporate fitness center and my members made this thing look like they train Muay Thai in Thailand. It started fraying almost immediately. Then one of the side straps broke. Now the back has split. The tiger kick shield is vastly superior.",
