Three different cookers. 1st time... yeah OK its a fluke.. buy another. 2nd time... hmmm same problem. Read the instructions again.. aha! 3rd time. Did EVERYTHING to the book in the instructions. Distilled water, cleaning with vinegar, blah blah blah - died YET AGAIN. Life shouldn't be this hard. Years ago I had a West Bend egg cooker that lasted from high school through college. I think I dropped it and it finally died. Thought this would be like that one. NOT RELIABLE",

Also, being able to cook 10 eggs at a time is great, as we often had to run two batches through our old machine that could only cook 7.",

Also brown your veggies a bit if you want them pan-fried before adding to omelet. The best part is that I can mix up an omelet, jump in the shower and have it hot and ready when I get out! This will be great when RVing too. Really a great appliance.",
