Users with foot issues like Plantar Fasciitis and overpronation commended how the footbed helped in their condition. Unfortunately, some had problems with sizing and found out it fit smaller than expected but was quickly remedied by going half a size up. In the end, the pair's simple, laidback look of the shoe is what attracted the consumers, but the supportive and comfortable feel of the cushioning was what hooked them.",

The insert isn't that good, very flimsy, & though the arch support is good, the foot bed part is very thin. You can feel pebbles & such thru it, going to put another insert on top & see if that helps. My main disappointment is with the color. I ordered grey & it's more of a taupe brown. I happened to be wearing brown shorts & a grey t-shirt when I got the shoes, so I'm sharing the picture so you can decide on the color yourself.",

I already had these in red leather so I figured I\u2019d try these again. Love them! The material they are made with is soft and supple and the metallic sheen is pretty without being ostentatious. The arch support is the best part though. This is my third pair of Taos cute sneakers and I love how they are not only cute but supportive and comfortable all at the same time. This taupe color will be so versatile too. Thank you Taos.",

However, I've owned these less than two months and they are already coming apart. I can tell they likely won't last me past 6 months tops, which is (to me) unacceptable for this price. This isn't from intense use, just regular standing/walking in the office during the week. Additionally, the heels have squeaked loudly since day 1. Overall, while the comfort is good, the shoe quality does not match up to the price or the reputation of Taos, and I wish I hadn't missed the return window.",

Now they are wonderful. If you are willing to experiment with getting your own insoles these shoes are great. They are now very comfortable and fit perfectly. The sizing is good.

I've gotten compliments the few times I've worn them but they are very hot when worn in above 80 degree weather. I have very flat feet and these are great support for me but because of my flat feet and the say they move in shoes, I can't wear sock. That could be why they seemed so hot. I don't know. Bottomline, they are very stylish shoes for being orthopedics!",

I cannot give them a really bad review, I got a great deal and I made the purchase for a pair of black sneakers to wear for short periods of time. But I am mentioning that this shoe is not sized as buyers are accustomed to, and full price purchasers should most definitely order a size up.",
