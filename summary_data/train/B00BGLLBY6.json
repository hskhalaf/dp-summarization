The tire was relatively new and I didn't want to replace it. I had troubling finding the leak. Was thinking of plugging it when I came across this and thought I'd try it as it seemed easier. This sealant did the trick on the first time I used it. It's been two weeks and the tire is holding pressure. Relatively quick and easy fix, though getting the tube over the tire stem was a pain. You can see and hear it working as it bubbles and oozes out initially. Recommended.",
