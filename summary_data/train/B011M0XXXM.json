No wires or instructions to read, just follow the pictures or experiment on your own. No wires to connect, solidly built pieces just snap on. Two switches (1 flip, one push button), three things that light up, blades that twirl, and a piece that has sound. 21 combinations to build. Gave it to him yesterday morning and he could hardly stop to eat at mealtimes. Played with it again today. Will definitely purchase companion sets in th future.",

The cool light-up features & moving parts dazzled him & still hold his interest after a few weeks. The pieces are sturdy enough for him to play with. I like the picture directions, allowing young pre-reader kids to put it together independently - my kid is still a bit young for this, but I think a 4 or 5 year old would do great. Highly recommend this set.",

He made 9 projects in less than 15 minutes all On his own and his face would lit up with every finished project!

After two sessions with me, they were able to go through the instructions by themselves. While we worked on the kit together, I was able to talk some basics to the five year old (!!!) concerning circuits and switches (and one-way LEDS). Almost unbelievable, but the gospel truth.

After working with my Nephew on a couple of projects, he was ready to tackle the rest of the projects himself. The pride and sense of accomplishment he experienced was priceless.

When you install the egg on the LED (which looked cool BTW), the egg acts like a huge lever on the two tiny wires that connects the diode. Whatever you do to the egg, say pushing it, pulling it, twisting it, etc., even with the lightest touch, will notably bend the wires. I tried to keep my 4 year old from touching the egg as much as I can but still, within one hour the LED is snapped off. This is clearly a design flaw - the base of the LED should have been sandwiched between two plastic pieces, rather than mounted on the top surface.",

One reviewer noted that they wished the pieces were transparent to see the wiring underneath, I agree with that as well, but it's only a small gripe. Also, I wish there was an explanation of how each project works so that I could explain it to my nephew the best I could, in the very likely case that he might. Again, however, another small gripe for such a great product!",
