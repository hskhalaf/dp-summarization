      "title": "Remove the ear pads for best sound",
      "text": "I found the sound on these headphones muffled and fuzzy and the headband too tight and unadjustable for tension. However, when I removed the ear pads (they're held on by magnets) - the sound improved dramatically - I mean like they sound completely different. Otherwise, these look great, are well made of high quality materials - nothing about it feels cheap. They even fold up nicely and comes with a color-matching hard case. If only someone at B&W paid attention to how much the ear pads affect the sound. I don't know if this was an oversight or a quality control problem - did the factory change the materials to something that wasn't acoustically neutral?",

      "text": "The sound quality of these headphones is excellent - no doubt about that. However, after 5 minutes of wearing them, I realized that they are not for me. They are so tight and hurt my years and head so much that it was simply impossible to enjoy them. I don't think I have a large head: an average for a 5.9\" person. The problem is, you cannot regulate the pressure of the headphones by extending or contracting them: when extended, they slid off the ears and moved very easily with my head's movements; when contracted, they hurt my head even more with the band. I have returned them after 2 days of interrupted use (could not stand the pain).",
