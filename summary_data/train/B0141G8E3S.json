I had other rings in my junk box, so fixing it wasn't a big deal for me, but I shouldn't have had to do it. The real problem is that it stains my dogs coat an unattractive gray. This stain does not wash out with standard pet shampoo. I'm not a metallurgist, but I've never seen stainless steel that goes from bright to pewter gray in a few weeks. The whole tag is dull now. Certainly not 18/8 or something else decent. I'm replacing this tag with something else.",

Frankly, I didn\u2019t expect them to look this good, especially since they were so inexpensive. They\u2019re much easier to read than the ones I\u2019ve gotten at the kiosks and they hold more information. They arrived a day earlier than I expected, too.

I plan to order a new one every year whenever I get a new Rabies or county license tag for the dog. It's better than having 3 tags jingling around, to just have all the info printed on one nice tag front and back. Much easier to read, and quieter too.",

I turned the writing of my phone numbers to the most outerward tag so it won't rub against the other tags. That should help it last.

My dog is about 50 lbs--lab/shepherd mix and this tag is the perfect size, not too small or large. I do expect that the metal will scratch with time and wear, however this tag works perfectly for her! It definitely seems more durable than others I have purchased. It did take a little longer to arrive than expected, but I was very excited to finally receive the tag and put it on my pup's collar!",
