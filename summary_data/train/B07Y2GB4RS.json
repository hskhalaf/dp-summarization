It\u2019s just challenging enough to where it\u2019s fun but not overly easy. The music is extremely loud but we taped over the speaker on the bottom and it helped a ton\u2014 you can still hear the music but not as obnoxiously loud.",

Toy chute- the slightest move and toys fall out of the chute, defeating the purpose of the claw Back opening- again, wide open. There needs to be a door Music \u2010 loud and annoying. I expected this. Claw- doesn't grab anything!",

I had to put 3 stickers over the speaker just to get it a normal volume! And then. It\u2019s so lame! It doesn\u2019t work at all. We tried 3 different kinds of candies! Laughy Taffy (WAY too big), tootsie rolls (too rolly and slippery), and HiChews which was probably the best option but it STILL wouldn\u2019t stay in the claw long enough to get to the shoot. It was very VERY disappointing. I have no idea why it has such high reviews. I would NEVER recommend this.",

But good product for the price I payed. I already tried it with small snicker candies and those squishy toys like seen in the video. My son loves it, but he's 2 and just wants to press buttons. Not recommended for his age but great for 5+, like me \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude1b Haha",
