I my case, however, it turned out that when I had removed the cloth filter from the plastic retainer to knock the dust off, I had put it back wrong, with one flange going over rather than under it's retaining projection. As for its performance, it does what I want. I bought a Dyson stick at the same time and that seems to have a more powerful suction, but I find it's the B&D I grab for quick jobs because it's lighter and less hassle.",
