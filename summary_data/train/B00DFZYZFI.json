The plates are decent size, the bowls are fine (they appear small but are deep) and the coffee mugs are normal size (for camping). The utensils may be a little flimsy, mainly the plastic. I haven't used them yet so I honestly can't rate them. The ceramic coating was not chipped and looks really nice except for one plate. The plate has a darker spot (shadow) but for me it's fine.

I do not expect it to last long. Plus having a plastic handle on the end is not very helpful while using it near the campfire or stove. I replaced it with all stainless silverware after the first use.",

As for the product itself, they are very lightweight and so far have been easy to clean. One concern that we will figure out once we are on the trail is the durability, while cleaning the plates there was considerable \"give\" as it felt like they were bending out of shape.",

      "text": "I bought these back in July and just now got around to opening the box for a camping trip. I opened the box to find that the metal was bent on about 4 of the dishes, causing the enamel to crack off. The enamel is still flaking around the damaged areas so I'm not even sure if they're safe to use. Looks like I'm stuck with them now the return window has long passed.",
