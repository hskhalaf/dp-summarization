There's definitely a line where they can veer into \"elderly orthotic\" so I plan carefully. Skinny jeans and pants, joggers, rolled cargos, etc look cute and with no show socks. I'm normally an 8 in most shoes (Vans, Nike, Jeffrey Campbell, Seychelles) but got the 7.5 in these and they are perfect. I have a wide forefoot and narrow heel and have no issues with them being too narrow or coming off my heels.",
