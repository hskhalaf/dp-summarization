The lightweight eye mask features luxury nylon on the outside, and luxurious memory foam eye cavities on the inside.

Whether you use it for travel, meditation, or daytime napping, our mask allows your body to feel rejuvenated when you wake.\n\nDeep sleep improves your productivity and decision making processes during the day. Since even small amounts of light can disrupt your sleep, the Living Pure mask provides pure darkness to help your body increase the production of melatonin--a natural, sleep inducing hormone. For best results, combine our eye mask with our Living Pure Tranquility essential oil which is a blend of Valerian, Lavender, Italian Bergamot and Frankincense to calm the mind, relax the body, and serve as a powerful sleep aid that will ensure a luxurious and restful night's sleep. Start your day off right by guaranteeing a deep, restful night of sleep!\n\nAt Living Pure, our products bridge the gap between ancient Apothecary and Modern Herbalism and Aromatherapy.
