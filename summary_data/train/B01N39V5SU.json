The pump is useful but if you are using this in the garden you may find that it you have to fill it a lot! Great buy I will be using it for the next few seasons no doubt it will last a good long while!",

It is incredibly fine and dusty though so if you don't want to be finding it on everything you own for months thereafter you'll want to cover everything before spreading the powder on your carpets.",

It does not seem to harm the reptiles, birds, gopher (I need those). I recommend this. I grow organic fruit.",

The second time, I mixed it with water and put it in a bowl and used a paint brush to apply it. It dries as powder form and so it's effective. It's not effective when wet, but it's much easier to apply when it's wet. I'm glad I took the chance and bought the product.",

Also it you do it inside (like I did) it will create a lot of dust. Haha! Do it before you leave or go to bed.",
