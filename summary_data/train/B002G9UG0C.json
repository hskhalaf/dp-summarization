Compared to the 800, this is a better option with seemingly larger insert rings, sliding T-tracks, larger table, specialized router mounting plate with quick release, and semi-functional storage bins. I would have preferred two bags instead. I don't use it often. It's a good hobbyist unit. Compared to the Bosch table, this fence face is melamine laminated, and I didn't want to risk a warp in the aluminium. It's also collapsible and ties into my other Skil machines. Sturdier if you screw it down to something.",

Those are plastic construction without too much fanfare, but they do the job pretty well. Table itself is kinda weird; it's portable, which is awesome, but the legs are odd. Not bad, but odd. The storage bays are the only thing I don't like; they aren't even big enough to hold the accessories the unit comes with, let alone router bit cases. The unit comes with 2 router plates and a vacuum dust port. I use the small plate almost exclusively, and it was super easy to hook up to my dust collection system.",

I considered drilling my own holes in the mounting plate, but the base on my Skil 1827 router was just too big. I ended up buying a Dewalt (DW616) router to keep mounted to the table, and that works great, but it was money that I didn't really want to spend. Another review mentioned safety concerns of the quick release mounting bracket. Because of that review I do double check the mount to make sure it is secure, but I personally have not had a problem.",

Cons: the biggest con by far is the fact that the rings around the bit opening are pretty far from flush with the table top so parts hang up when they pass over them.
