      "verdict": "Vibram FiveFingers created a winter version of the massively popular Trek Ascent line in the wool-insulated model. The more aggressive and ultra-sticky outsole makes running on icy and wet conditions a breeze. Provided that runners don\u2019t run on puddles or tackle more than 1 inch of snow, their feet should feel the comforting warmth of the wool collar and sockliner. It delivers a rightful blend of the great traction and superior comfort that barefoot runners can hardly find in today\u2019s market.",
      "pros": [
        "Most of the reviewers exclaimed that the Vibram FiveFingers Trek Ascent Insulated is easily the most comfortable shoes they have ever worn in winter",

        "A large number of users considered the price as truly reasonable",
        "The shoe is easy to wash, commented several runners",
        "The outsole\u2019s tread gained positive feedback for being efficient on dry and wet surfaces",
        "Some runners have used it on the trail and on the road",
        "There are enough ground feel and adequate protection, according to more than a handful of users",
        "Several consumers lauded the lightweight nature of this running shoe",

      "cons": [
        "Some runners pointed that a heel loop would have made shoe entry and exit substantially easier",
        "A few complaints were made about how difficult the shoe was to dry once it got wet",
        "The water-resistant upper barely shielded the shoe from water, according to a handful of reviewers"
