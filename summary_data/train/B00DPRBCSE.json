The product details said it would juice lemons, limes and oranges. I think it will only work for small oranges. My grandson opened it and went right to the kitchen to begin using it. It is as advertised except that you may not realize how small it is until you open the box.",

Also would have been nice to allow the middle yellow juicer piece to flip over and fit inside the main jar so that I could travel easier with this as one unit.

I get much more juice out of my lemons and even when a seed gets thru, the slight lip keeps it from pouring out with the juice most of the time. The screw-on lid makes storage of extra juice a breeze but I love it for storing the other half of my lemon for the next day. This Prepara Chef's Citrus Juicer makes me very happy.",

The glass collecting base also has a screw on cap for interim storage of the squeezed juice. A good size to hold enough for most recipes, and it fits the hand well so as to hold it stabile while juicing. All in a well designed and well constructed kitchen tool.

I've tried so many others over the years and they're dull and require too much manual pressure.

      "text": "Meh. It's just okay. As other reviewers have pointed out, the white plastic piece (that supports the yellow juicer part) does not screw easily or well to the glass base. Sloppy manufacturing? Whatever. Also, how difficult would it have been to add some measurement marks to the bottom base? That would have raised my rating to 4 stars. As is, it does the job of juicing my lemons well. It's easier on my hands and gets more juice from them than squeezing by hand. Some seeds sneak through, but that's not a big deal to me. If I had it to do again, I'd probably select a different juicer, but this one works for now.",

It is also sturdy, which is great when you're a clutz like me! The only thing is it lets quite a bit of pulp and some seeds get through, but I think the spaces are probably as small as they can be to still have it work properly. I would definitely buy this again",

It's easy to ream ALL the juice from the citrus, shake the remaining pulp into the glass (if you like the pulp, which I do), and dump the seeds. The juicing component screws on to the glass, but seems to fit perfectly over most of the glasses in my cabinet, so one less thing to wash. Great, sturdy, effective product.",

This works perfectly for citrus, the strainer catches seeds & excess pulp, the pour spout is very handy and it has a lid for storing the juice! I'll do a whole piece of fruit or two, use what I need for a recipe, then store the rest in the fridge, all in the same container without using more dishes or jars! And the jar is glass so the acids from the citrus can't etch it the way it would with plastic! Perfect, highly recommend this to anyone. This would make a nice gift at a bridal shower or as a housewarming gift.",
