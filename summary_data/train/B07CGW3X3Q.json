She\u2019s an Original size Barbie doll and she has XL-sized feet so she\u2019ll be sharing shoes with Wonder Woman, *but* the shoes she comes with are really cute. Her robe is gorgeous and very well made. I love that she\u2019s multi-jointed for greater pose-ability. You can put her hair down but it\u2019s cut very specifically to be worn up, so it looks cute in the front but wonky in back when worn down. Most of all, I love that Ms. Minerva is a beautiful older doll (she even has age details on her hands) that can be used as a mother or grandmother doll in your own Barbie world. Love it.",
