Still, it works for me as it is also very adjustable so those hooks can be moved around easily.",

The design of this makes for a gap between the shelf bracket and the wood shelf, the shelf is not flush against the bracket against the wall so there's less shelf space available. Also the way the hooks hang is they connect through the top, so each hook has a metal part that protrudes from the top of the shelf making usable shelf space even more scarce. If you place a pot on top it looks uneven and unbalanced. Didn't realize all this till it was already drilled onto the wall, I'm sure you can find better.",

      "text": "Really easy installation, but design could be a little better with the hooks as the mechanism can make the surface of the shelf uneven and hazardous for lots of pots and lids. It depends on where you position the hooks. Attached to the top of the hooks are large round metal nubs that sit on the top of the shelf. The solution is that if you have the hooks hanging from the slits closer to you, then the nub will make the pots angled towards the wall (and safer), rather than angled towards you where it can easily fall.",
