After declaring the firearms and going through the TSA checks, I just put a lock on it and put it in my checked luggage. Used the pick n pluck foam to fit 1911s without rails up to 5.75\" in barrel length. Essentially this case can fit a full size 1911 or smaller. I have attached pictures of my Ruger SR1911 Commander. The case is sturdy and has double throw latches. Overall, great quality for the price. BTC: 1HJb8vykapxgiSg8xpg2AMnHcUQ7eyaJVq",

This older style has the padlock holes mounted inboard making it hard to match up with a lock just by eye alone. Read a lot of reviews but no model numbers for suggestions. So here is some help. Amazon has a two pack of padlocks that fit perfectly and look great. Masterlock 380T with Rustoleum finish. About $15 for the two keyed alike locks. Bonus is the locks do not touch the surface of whatever the case is setting on. About 1/4\" clearance. I believe they look sharp. Enjoy!",

It has multi squared foam in the inside which you can cut or separate to your gun size and still has space for at least another magazine.

However, the foam-dirt strips easily so I wrap my weapon in two sandwich sized plastic wraps and the mag in one so the items won't get dirty. These pelican cases are highly protective and that's why they may be a little more expensive but they should use better quality foam.",

Only downside is the lock ports are a bit on the small side, so even if you have a SFF-ICC padlock, it can't rotate freely (this can be good or bad). May work fine with a small Master lock or something, but the large form factor locks with the thick shackles will not fit. You can also see the squares cut into the foam easily, so it can be a bit of an aesthetic issue, but you'd just have to get a solid foam core and use a hot wire for that.",

The case has two latches that are each lockable with padlocks (that you would separately provide).

I swapped out the 'pluck' foam and use the case with no problems. If you plan on using the case for only one item, this is not an issue. - The pad lock holes are in a tight location and make certain size locks difficult to use.

      "text": "A great little box for delicate or sensitive equipment. Keep in mind that the inner pluck foam is a little more limiting than the size they specify for the inside of the case(s), so I recommend going a bit larger to be safe - and depending how much padding you want around your equipment. I purchased this for my Feiyu FY-G4 3-Axis Handheld Gimbal and it take the entire length of the inner foam. Still okay for me, but it reached the max space for the length. The box is typical Pelican - hard, solid, tough, and worth every penny!",

I know the foam will compress for larger items but if you don't want the extra tight fit maybe these dimensions will be helpful.",

Those only come in the slightly larger and more expensive cases. The pluckable foam is simple to setup for your items. After plucking you may want to save them to glue down below your items to help raise them up (Actually mentioned in the directions).",
