      "text": "I use tattoos weekly. This was the first time trying 'white' ones. I was a bit skeptical because I have found most blacks and colors are harder to apply and to do not last as long as the gold and silver. This was super easy to apply! Easier than any other color I have used, however it does not last as long. When treated right, gold and silver will typically last a week- a week and a half. The white only lasted 4 days. These are BEAUTIFUL though, so I will add these to my tattoos I currently offer.",
