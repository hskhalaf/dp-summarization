I am very disappointed, and sick to my stomach over this purchase. I have tried various cleaners and polishes, and nothing works. I have attached a picture.

Tape each corner of the pad to the back of the carpet. Once you do this, you can pick up and move the rug as much as you want without ever having to line up the pad underneath again!

The pads work great; the carpets\u2014which used to drive me nuts with how they used to slip around and creep up the baseboards\u2014stay solidly put. I have repositioned them several times and have not noticed any residue. Very good value for the money!",

What I like best about this option above solid pads is that you can easily shake these pads out to remove any dirt or grit and clean the wood floor below. The heavier pads are much more difficult to move around. They do not really add much \"padding\" effect, they really function to hold the rug in place well. I would highly recommend these pads if you are mainly looking for a way to keep your rugs in place but not looking for a thick padding effect.",
