The removable insoles also gained this footwear some positive feedback. However, despite the claims that it fit comfortably, there were complaints that it was not true to size and width. Other issues with this model included the long strap but short Velcro and the stiffness of the platform. But in the end, the shoe came highly recommended by those who enjoyed wearing a comfortable pair of strap-closure shoes.",

        "The strap displeased a minority of users",
        "it was very long, but the Velcro did not cover its entire length, so those with very slim feet found it hard to tighten",
        "The trainer was stiff and needed to be broken in, according to several consumers",
        "Because of durability issues like the interior lining deteriorating quickly or the outside stitchings unraveling, some testers considered this footgear pricey",
        "Seams inside the shoe irritated the toes, noted a few individuals"

Other than that, I really like this pair, which is my second pair of Propets. Still wear my first pair for puttering around outside the house or running errands. They have loads of miles and memories on them and have walked where ancient kings and caesars have tread, literally! I keep this pair for casual outings and socializing when they're not likely to get dirty. The color goes well with blue jeans, gray or off-white khaki or olive cargo pants, even some blacks. 2 for 2 so far, Propet!",

They are deep enough to easily add an insert, though he hasn't felt it necessary to use one because they are comfortable as is. The double velcro straps make it much easier to put on--better than the one strap he had before because it opens up more. He is very happy with these shoes.",

I will see how the shoes wear,, but he is very pleased with them so far, and so am I - they are not only good-looking, but sturdy enough so that I worry less about him falling. I didn't ask him about the arch support - I'm sure it is quite adequate. Thank you for making such a nice product.",

Noticed that most of Propet shoes are pointed- at least the many walking shoes I looked at. I kept the shoes because am going to use them for biking and like the strap design- no laces to get caught in chain. Plus I'm sure the shoes will expand over time. Also there are two inserts for each shoe- removed both and used my own that has much better arch support.",
