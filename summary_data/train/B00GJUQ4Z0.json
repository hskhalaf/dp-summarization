There are phantom clicks on the screen which will switch windows, minimize and even close apps, browser windows, and folders. Screen will randomly not accept touch commands either from the finger or stylus. Orientation was stuck in portrait until I changed the settings in Control Panel. Just a subpar product overall. The inherent kickstand feature is nice, the magnetic keyboard is efficient, and the size of the screen is large. Will be going back to a laptop ASAP.",
