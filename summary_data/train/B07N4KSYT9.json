Both the seller and this product get my recommendation.",

The fingerprint reader is fast, and sensitive enough to work even when there are small obstructions (dust & debris from my workplace, for instance.) The sound quality from both speakers is great, both in volume and clarity, I love how loud this phone can get, when I feel like blasting my music! The processor is fast, I can run multiple high-CPU-taxing games simultaneously with little to no lag or disconnections. If you're considering buying this phone, DO IT.",
