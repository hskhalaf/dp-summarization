This is what I settled on and mostly it's a great phone, it works just like any other android phone I have used. The reason I couldn't rate it any higher is that the phone crashes when I try to play games on it. Most other apps work fine on it, but it doesn't handle games very well. Anyway, if you are on a budget then this is a great option just don't expect it to do everything.",
