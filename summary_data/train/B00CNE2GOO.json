How to: clean and prep nails, apply base coat (I use OPI), apply 2 coats nail polish, allow to mostly dry, apply 1-2 coats vinylux. Reapply every couple days to help mani or pedi last. I can usually get polish to last for 6-8 days with this when nails are well prepared. It's also very shiny, which makes nails look extra beautiful!",

Mine only lasts about 4-5 days before it starts to peel/wear off at the tips, but that is better than anything else I have tried. I bought this with the vinylux nail polish...they are good quality and put a thick-gel like coating over your nails, without having to use the uv light and special gel polishes. Overall, very happy with it...not much more than regular nail polish costs at the store, much better quality.",

I;ve used this as a top coat with other brands and types of polish/lacquer and it works well with all of them. It dries fast, gives your nails a wet, glossy look, and prevents chipping longer than any other type of top coat I've ever used. This is currently the best top coat on the market that's available for non-professionals.",

It will not wear like a UV or Led cured lacquer but does well.",
