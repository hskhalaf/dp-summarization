Nothing huge, just a little extra noise is all. Pushes a lot of air at full speed and for the price you can't go wrong with this! I have had my fans for about 2 years now and one has been running 24/7 since the day it arrived at my house, the other has been off and on as I need it. Both work perfectly still, no signs of one getting weaker then the other or anything.",

It allows the fan to run whenever the room gets warmer or cooler (depending on the setting) than the rest of the house, thus equalizing the temperature of the room with the temperature of the rest of the house.
