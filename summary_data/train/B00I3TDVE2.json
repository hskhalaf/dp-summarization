      "text": "This little saw sure surprised me. I did not expect it to work nearly as well as it does. Of course, like all tool manufacturers, the saw came with a $2 blade (because they ran out of the $1 ones :). Get yourself a good blade and this little thing will cut. I even cut some white oak with it... and this applies to the entire Porter Cable 20V lithium line. I have the drill, jig saw, circular saw, and the multi-tool. All are great. With the drill, I can compare the PC to Makita and Milwaukee, since I also have recent versions of those. The PC is a little less expensive but works just as well as the others.",

I ended up buying a DW 24 tooth thin kerf blade blade and man, what a difference. I also use an off brand 20v battery that is bigger than the ones that came w/ my drill.",

I would say it is great for a homeowner with projects, large and small. Might not be powerful enough for the professional who uses it all/every day. Update. The saw died after less than 8 months of light duty homeowner usage. I do not recommend this saw, and reduced the rating from 4 stars to 1 star. I may give back a star if Porter Cable replaces it under warranty.",

The notch to line up the blade to your mark is slightly off, maybe 1/16\". The flimsy plastic guard easily allows larger debris to wedge in between it and the blade, jamming the unit. And it goes through the Porter Cable batteries (both small and large) fairly quickly. Despite these small issues, it does work rather well, it cut through all the materials with no issues, and the stock blade it comes with does the job. I've always been happy with Portal Cable tools, it's their batteries that are junk.",
