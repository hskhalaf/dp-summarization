Don't let that fool you. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that everything in this case worked exceptionally well. I have to say it again, I was very surprised especially with the impact wrench, it worked on the first attempt and I doubted that it would work at all.",

      "text": "Wow I love this thing! I purchased a new 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid to find out they do not come with a Spare or any of the essentials to change a tire. Well I purchased a donut and this kit in case i ever get a flat. I have used to assist other people whom have gotten flats and I just love it. I mean electric jack! no more using those scissor jacks that take forever to lift the vehicle and then you have to reverse to put back in trunk. Then the impact wrench. Kind of odd the way it tightens and loosens the lug nuts. But it works and I had no issues",
