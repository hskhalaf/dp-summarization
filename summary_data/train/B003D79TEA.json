Upsides: These seem to be good at leaving makeup unperturbed while reducing shine. It's really easy to tell when a sheet is saturated and therefore probably of less use (the paper looks like vellum and goes slightly transparent). No scent or coating at all and doesn't annoy my stupidly sensitive skin. Verdict: I will keep using, but I'm not well versed with alternatives.",
