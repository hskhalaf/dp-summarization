      "text": "At $43 these are a steal considering my favorite high end department store is selling these full price. I bought the conductive version and it works well... I'm sure these will keep me warm in freezing Seoul this winter and allow me to take photos while being cozy. They aren't as awesome as a pair of Hestra gloves (no tech fingers) I tried on, but they will do, especially for the price.",

But the main reason I bought these gloves was for their touch screen ability on each finger... and that went away after 2-3 months almost completely on each finger except one spot on one thumb.
