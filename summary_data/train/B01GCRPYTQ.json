The install is complete laid out in the Power Supply instructions. Takes maybe 10 minutes, to get everything connected. I also added a simple push button similar to this. Not the exact one, but almost. Couldn't be happier! Should anything change, I will update accordingly.",

My favorite: Seco-larm 1200 lb. 600 lb holding is really not sufficient; if you're going to do this project yourself, do it right. In addition, the KEY to a proper installation is the template! This unit did not come with an installation template. All instructions were in Chinese with much to do about architect specs, but no template. The 1200 lb Seco-larm is a brute and weighs a ton; get it!! Aloha.",
