I had hoped to transfer the books - some of which were gifted or purchased from non -Amazon parties - to my \"new\" kindle. I was able to make the transfer but was unable to open them. In a chartoom exchange with an Amazon kindle service rep I was told only books obtained through Amazon can be accessed by my \"new\" kindle - unlike my \"old\" kindle. Thus I lost a series of books written by my son and purchased from Smashwords -a digital publishing outfit. I also lost other books gifted to me from non-Amazon sources. Very disappointed.",

CONS - My cat gnawed the case and now it has beauty marks... why didn't it come with those already? - Does not sync with my car to read e-book over the speakers",

      "text": "I bought this for a specific trip. I've used the Kindle app on my iPad for a couple years. But wanted something smaller for travel. Was initially concerned about the size, but it turned out to be perfect. Easy to carry on a plane. Very readable as long as you have a light source. Page sizes are ideal. Navigating my library of books as well as navigating within a book is pretty easy and intuitive. Very happy with my purchase for the price. It's no more or no less than it needs to be: a book reader.",

      "text": "My husband purchased this kindle for me for my birthday. This was the first kindle I have ever owned and was excited to get this product, but I ended up returning this kindle and exchanged it for the next model up. The main reason why I exchanged this kindle for a different model was due to the lack of screen brightness. This kindle had no settings for back light, meaning I would have to use a book light, bed side light or natural light to read. I enjoy reading in bed and wanted the option to adjust screen brightness if needed. The next kindle model up was an additional $30 and I felt like that was worth the price difference.",

Text is ok, better when zoomed in, forget reading in any type of low light situations as this screen does require a very good amount of light. It is NOT \"anti-glare\", if you hold it at certain angles whether indoor or outdoors it will have a good amount of glare. It can be a bit slow at times when loading different menu options. Overall this is not that bad of a product, BUT i would definitely recommend buying a paperwhite or oasis instead.

Once this is liberated from its packaging you are left with model SY69JL etched the back. The Kindle product naming structure is poor. Searching on SY69JL returns a few hits, all for covers. 2) The cover our daughter also gifted us was the wrong size due to this bad model naming structure I suspect. It took me longer than needed to find a cover I was confident would fit. Also, this takes a bit more ambient light than a book. If I bought one I'd spend more to get one that has backlighting.",
