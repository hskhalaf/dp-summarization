If I'm going to spend that much money on a small pouch of protein powder I should be able to reseal it. I will not be ordering again because it's annoying and messy to have to pour the entire pouch into another container. I'll be looking for a replacement brand.",

I'm giving it 2 stars because it does mix smoothly even though the flavor is a big fat 0. I've even tried adding a cup of blueberries to disguise the cake mix flavor, didn't work either. I notice most of the 5 star reviews are older, probably before it was sold to Nestle with a follow up recipe change. I will will check review dates before buying in the future...Buyer Beware. I'm not picky about food at all but still can't get this down easily, very unpleasant flavor.",

      "text": "I find the Stevia aftertaste to be a bit much for me, but I was pleasantly surprised by the rich vanilla flavor. I bought this as an occasional alternative to my whey protein to get more plant-based nutrition in my diet, and because I liked the idea of getting both protein and fiber at the same time. I don't know if I will buy it again, but it was much cheaper on Amazon than in my local store so it was worth a shot. It tastes good with my unsweetened Almond Coconut Blend milk so I'll finish the bag.",
