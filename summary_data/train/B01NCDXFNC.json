However I am disappointed in that after I cook with it, the wok immediately starts to rust. I don't leave food in it long after cooking it because the food taste \"rusty\". I know about the care of cast iron. I don't use soap. I have tried canola oil, coconut oil, and peanut oil to no avail. I always end up with a rusted wok! It may become my next planter!
