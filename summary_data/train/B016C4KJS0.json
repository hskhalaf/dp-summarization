All the other sealers I have had overheat and you have to wait several minutes to continue. I always wrap my meat in one layer of paper, a trick I learned from a meat cutter, to keep the moisture from being sucked out of the meat. May sound wasteful to some people but I am very particular about the quality of my meat. It also prevents perforations of the bags by bones during the vac process.",

The reason for that was that the automatic one released the vacuum as soon as its done \"sealing\", fail. Since you control the lock on this one, you can leave it under vacuum and just press seal again to get a double seal and finally seal wet foods! Yeah its slower, and a pain to use, but it works. Its also portable which is a plus. I thought that this one would do continuous seals (no waiting), but just like the automatic version, you still have to wait 10 seconds before itll go again.
