Have had zero issue with the command strips coming off in fact everything is so sturdy that you can semi slam the cabinent door with the controllers mounted on them and they won't fall off! Super easy to attach. I did get a little OCD with alignment for our specific use but total installation time for all five mounts was about ten minutes with all my measurements. As an added bonus I think they look really sleek and modern. Highly recommend for your gaming storage and organization.",
