The size is perfect - it's easy to use anywhere - on the table while reading, while using the desktop computer, while crocheting, I even used it on the kitchen counter this morning while making & packing today's lunch. I especially like all the options it has: 2 colors of light, 3 intensities in each color, and the timer function is fantastic. This is SO much nicer than the light box I had years ago that was huge and only had 2 settings - on and off. Highly recommend this for anyone who suffers from SAD; it's a life-saver.",
