However, it very clearly states that in the description. Fortunately, we have several old Nintendo DS chargers lying around. The price was similar to what I've seen in retail stores, but a lot of the stores around us had sold out or didn't carry this model. I got it from Amazon in about 3 days with no shipping.",
