After I started using this one, it seemed so light! I didn't think that it would be possible! The charger is great and charges my phone perfectly since I usually carry a power bank with me. I love the 3 compartments since it helps me organize my things. Absolutely a great buy!",

      "text": "Love the backpack for hauling my laptop back and forth to work. Only two small complaints. The straps tend to come apart or not stay at the length you want because the straps are smaller than the bracket. Other thing is the compartment for your laptop is quit large for modern laptops, so my laptop isn't as secure as I would like and things tend to fall in that pocket, which could scratch it. Like I said small complaints and I still love the backpack. Color is great and love the charging port on the outside.",

It does NOT fit a whole lot, the flap which goes over the top serves absolutely no purpose except to go over the top zipper, plus this flap's got some weight to it...useless. The zipper designs are very annoying to me, because they keep getting stuck in weird positions. Personally, I believe all bookbags should have double zippers for every zipper pocket, but the only area where there's a double zipper is in the main cavern. I wish this book bag was less heavy and fit a bit more.",

All while keeping a nice upright form which helps with the organization of it instead of slouching with no structure like other bags AND the way the bookbag holds the weight makes it feel waayyy lighter than it has in any other bookbag I've used when I pick it up! This is awesome I definitely recommend it! 5 stars all around!",
