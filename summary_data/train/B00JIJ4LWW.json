We always try out new products on our vehicles (other family members or neighbor vehicles) first, just in case. We were extremely impressed with the results. My husband ended up taking all the other leather conditioners out of our Detailer case and replaced it with this. We will definitely be purchasing more!",

I spend a lot of money to get high-quality handbags, and this is the best for keeping them in tip-top condition. It's also much better than spending the money on the conditioner the department stores try to sell you. Plus it comes with a great buffer sponge/pad that is a nice accessory and helpful when cleaning.",
