That aside, the camera is ok, definitely lacking some of the good software features most modern cameras have, however the picture quality and simplicity of use is good.

I'm impressed by the greater dynamic range and resolution of my photos. The camera feels good in my hands - it reminds me of my film days, using my Olympus OM1 back in the 70's! Be sure to purchase the US version from a Panasonic authorized dealer for the Triple Your Warranty promotion (check the Panasonic site.) One difference from the LX 7 is the LX100 can't focus as close for macro shots. This was disappointing at first, but maybe with the higher resolution I can crop and have them be equivalent?",

I think I made the right choice and choose the best one out of these 3. I'm BEYOND impressed and pleased with Lumix.",

This camera has a real aperture ring on the barrel of the lens and a real shutter speed control wheel on top of the body. Of course everything can easily be set to full auto with the touch of a real button. The four-thirds sensor is much bigger than the one-Inch sensor found on other compact cameras (it's the sensor size that really counts).",

Since the sensor is not self cleaning like on most dslr's, you are stuck with sending the unit back to Panasonic for service. I don't. Have 6 weeks to wait. I would not recommend this model because of this major design flaw. Too bad - could have been a great camwra.",

Yes there are smaller cameras with touch screens so if you want or need either of those attributes then this may not be for you. This shoots fantastic video and when synced with a smartphone you can easily shoot yourself and essentially the camera becomes a touch screen via the phone's screen. The only minor frustration is that the camera lens auto retracts after a few seconds in various menu or review screens and this cannot be turned off with the current firmware as of 8/1/2015 but maybe they'll fix that in an update as other people mention that this is a bit annoying.",

The box the camera came in says that a flash is an \"optional\" accessory. Someone needs to update the item description and stop misleading people. The camera does NOT come with a flash, and it seems Amazon does not offer one for sale. So unless I plan to shoot 100% in daylight, seems I am out of luck. Camera is being returned.",

The sharpness of the images has been a problem for many including myself. While it does improve a little with RAW it still really isn't that good. My indoor shooting was very disappointing. I was blown away that my Olympus XZ-2 was capable of higher image quality even with the much smaller sensor. Bottom line, I gave this camera away to one of the kids for their hiking adventures, which it may actually be good for, and switched back to my Olympus PEN.",

It is very disappointing as it was a purchase for my daughter who is leaving for an internship outside the country. We did not have enough time to order a replacement and get it before she left. And shipping outside the country adds all kinds of costs. Bummer for something that isn't cheap.",

I am very disappointed, as I loved the form factor and the styling of this camera\u2014and was pleased with the image quality of the few successful exposure I made.
