We have a number of tubes, wakeboards, skis, etc. and time and again we find Big Mable is the one we use the most on the lake. Great for all ages from the little ones tucked in safe to teens and adults looking for a thrill.",

So it's not as nimble or fun as a small tube with more control, but the kids & adults all enjoyed it. It will deflate over the course of the day. You can re-inflate it with your mouth though, as it doesn't deflate completely (which would be way too much to do by mouth).",

This season, I bought a \"Big Mable\". It popped out it's plug on the first usage, then it had a leak in a seam on the second usage. I was told by a Sportsstuff employee to seal it with Aquaseal, and that worked well. However, another leak appeared just 8\" to the left of the first one on the same seam on the third usage. That suggests that something in the material caused it. Now its developed a rise in the middle after 5 usages!",

So, if you are like me, and think that being thrown from the tube is half the fun, that is the way you will want to ride it! If you just want the tube ride without (a large) probability of being thrown off, then towing it forward is the way to go. It even made for a comfortable lounger when at anchor.",
