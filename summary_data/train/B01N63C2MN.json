These are non-toxic and sturdy enough to hold up to her biting down on them. When they bounce the direction is unpredictable because of the little spikes on the ball and she just loves when they go every which way. I'm sorry I can't give a review as to how a child or adult might like these as a \"stress ball\" but my Bulldog loves them.",

I only wish they sold these in a 5 pack of yellow since that is the easiest color for dogs to find in the grass. We'll save the yellow one for outdoors only. It is so hard finding balls like this without the squeaker inside. I used to buy gorilla balls, but they changed their materials or something so now he chews them up- plus they are expensive. Anyhow- love these sensory balls and so does little Pepper",

    "description": "Whether in search of a new fidget toy or tactile / sensory toy, our spiky balls are perfect. Firm but squeezable, they're perfect for sensory and tactile stimulation, as a tactile roll or a sensory brush. They're bouncy, too! Made with 100% high-quality thermoplastic rubber, they are hypoallergenic, nontoxic, and free of BPAs, phthalates and latex. Our spiky balls are strong, durable and safe for kids and adults alike. Dishwasher safe. Perfect for the classroom, home or office, they're great for parents, teachers, students, therapists and anyone else (even people just looking for fun desk toys). A great alternative to other sensory toys, including sensory brushes, rolls and sticks. Each unit is 2.5\" in diameter. 5-pack as shown. Fidget and sensory toys are great for all children ages 3+ and adults, but especially those with special needs requiring ADD toys, ADHD toys / ADHD fidget toys, OCD toys, autism fidget toys, or fidget toys for anxiety. These toys help promote a sense of calm, reduce stress / anxiety and can increase focus / attention.
