The compression is verrrrry tight at this point (they were hard to get on) but the tummy control is real! I would say if you order your true size they should still have a good amount of squeeze but if you are between sizes and want some serious compression then you should still be able to be comfortable in a size down. I really love these leggings. They are also pretty soft. My only wish is that they had a side pocket but the hidden pocket is pretty big so at least there is that.",

I\u2019m still thoroughly happy with them! They arrived early and came with a bonus shirt that was equally as soft and comfortable. Definitely recommend giving these a try!
