However, the lighting is noticeably more even with the 10th gen (my older one visibly fades from one side to the other) and there's a ton of variability in the tone of the screen. Overall, for me it was worth it, but your mileage may vary if you don't read in a dark room (so as not to wake the spouse) before bed very often.",

Very quick and snappy but does have a little bit of the normal kindle jitter between screens. Something I've been told I'll get used to. Unfortunately I can not post my full review until Sunday, 2 days from now, when my router and modem gets here. So for now it gets 3 stars. Will update my review when I'm able to get my 2.4ghz wifi up and running. Make sure that your current router supports 2.4ghz wifi. My router never worked on 2.4ghz.",

I loved both of them but missed having the manual buttons on my Paperwhite, so this time I ordered the Oasis. The problem I have with the Oasis is that it slips out of my hand both because the metal case has zero traction and because the side that is meant to be held is heavy. For this reason I am returning the Oasis to get a Paperwhite. I went into Best Buy to check the two current versions of Paperwhite and the waterproof version is very light and the back of the device is made of that rubbery material which provides traction.",

This one is worse. Touching the panel where the buttons to advance or turn back the pages does the trick. Way too sensitive and the unit is heavy and cumbersome, so you have to really hold on and, accidentally, make the device jump ahead one, two or three pages. Needs refinement. I bought one of the first ones shipped. So maybe they'll get better with fixes. Best wait for the bugs to get worked out.",

Most of the times I was out of concentration as once I started reading I was distracted for whatever reason you can imagine: upgrades, e-mails, checking old files, listening music, watching videos, etc. With my new kindle Oasis I finished with all the distractions. It is comfortable to carry it for long times with one hand only. I like the buttons to change pages and he most important for me: my eyes are not stressed any more.",

The Oasis is awkward to hold, the screen is much smaller than I expected, battery life is so-so, and having to use a headphone for any audio is a pain. Hell, even a phone has a speaker. In all, I find the Oasis not worth the money, the iPad has page turns where the kindle just flashes for page transitions, all this means that for an almost $300, the Kindle Oasis is short on features. For a few dollars more you can buy an iPad with any more features in a book-sized form-factor.",

In my opinion, that and the warm/cool color temp and many LEDs are what you're really paying for. It is considerably more expensive than the other Kindle, and for that I wouldn't 100% recommend it unless you have spare cash to burn.
