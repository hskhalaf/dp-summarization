Probably OK for a use were you can keep an eye on it but probably not for longer term storage. Will try a Pelican box instead.",

      "text": "These are awesome. Purchased as dry boxes for keeping keys, wallets, cell phones dry and safe on my boat. The end game is that you ever have to abandon ship (like a family I picked up out of the water when their boat caught on fire) you just grab this and chuck it overboard to find later (after you get off). The color stands out in the water and can easily be found.",
