The control is always close and handy to adjust if necessary. I am a bit annoyed that the temp level is not continuously lit, and that I must touch a temperature adjustment to see the illuminated level. Of course, they probably do that so the control does not \"over illuminate\" your room while you're in bed.",

In fact I would say this one gets very warm, but not hot. The others all lasted 3-4 years before they stopped working.",

The heat would go on and off even though the remote showed it was on the entire time. After about 5 minutes of being on, it would turn cold. Then, after a few months, it just stopped working altogether. I requested a refund through Sunbeam since they have a 5-year warranty. It is next to impossible to get in touch with Sunbeam. I messaged them on Facebook, left a comment on a post and emailed them six months ago. I just received a reply this morning. Look elsewhere if you want a reliable heating pad.",

The heat is not as good as the prior version, it does not get as hot, and it does not maintain heat. Again, I had the same product previously and it was great. Looks like the manufacturer cut some corners so I would not recommend this product. I'll toss it and buy another brand.",

Feels like the heat isn't coming through when not on the skin at first, it must be put on the skin to feel the heat. 5. Auto off option nice feature. Can be set to auto off in 2 hours or leave on indefinitely 6. Extra long cord",
