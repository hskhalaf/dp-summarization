I love Roku because it is truly provider agnostic meaning that it is not captive to any individual media provider like Amazon, Google or Apple. This device works exactly as expected. It was a great deal and does a fantastic job streaming video from a huge variety of sources. In short, I would highly recommend the Roku Streaming Stick and look forward to using it for years to come.",

The problem we are experiencing on all 3 of the streaming sticks we purchased is that the remotes don't work well. We thought maybe it was the batteries that were sent with the product, so we bought brand new batteries and put them in, that doesn't seem to help. Every time you want to change the channel we have to hit the reset button in the remote or on the TV and move the batteries around to get it to work....and that is short lived.

I'm having trouble believing that Roku is balancing their lead in the streaming market on flawed products. Hopefully they will learn from Apple and Microsoft that pushing out substandard quality product will not bode well for them. If this 3600R is a failure, I will move over to Amazon streaming stick or Google and never look back. Roku - your reputation is what you are - learn that quickly!",

With that said, I do like that I had a choice of which apps to include instead of being stuck with dozens I'll never use having to scroll through those to get to the ones I do use. Overall, if you take a little extra time upfront to do all the options, this is a user friendly design, very simple to use & I'm now considering purchasing more to replace my expensive blu-ray players that seem to break after 6-12 months of use.",

      "text": "Roku ROCKS. What more is there to say. WAY WAY more channel options than Chromesticks, easy to connect and up and running in just minutes. This is my 2nd Roku device, use them both on 2 different non-internet TV's. And ROKU is the only one so far w/ Amazon Prime streaming video. Chromestick? Nope. The WiFi receiver on this seems really good, I've never had a dropped signal even tho its clear across the house from my router. Zero complaints. Small size, fits out of sight behind the TV and powers from the TV USB port, so no extra cords needed. It can be plugged into a wall outlet if your TV doesn't have a powered USB port.",

      "text": "I decided to try the Stick for my third TV instead of a traditional Roku which I have on my other two TVs. I purchased it new 7 months ago. My TV no longer recognizes it and the light won't turn on when either plugged in or powered through USB. I have tried doing a hard reset, unplugging, trying a new outlet, trying exclusive USB, and the power indicator light will not turn on. This is a dismal addition to my Roku collection and I think I will try the Amazon Fire Stick instead.",

      "text": "Product was ok at first. It supports most of the same applications as the standard Roku box. It was though signicantly slower and lagged terribly. Even the remote was slow to respond. The roku remote app also constantly had issues connecting to the device. Now, after four months of use, the device has stopped functioning and is stuck on the loading screen. I will be buying a Fire TV stick to replace this device. At least the Fire TV device has an android based operating system which may allow for customization. Now, if the Fire TV devices would just support HBO go.",

      "text": "Well, its much cheaper than my local satellite providers monthly bill. You're not going to be able to get your favorite channels live of course and some of the programs have ads. However, those that do have ads are approx. a minute, more or less. Big deal. Its still better than 5, 6, or 7 minute ads four times within 30 minutes. Most of the present TV programs are just mind dumbing so I don't miss them at all. There is plenty of good content available with Roku. Sports, travel, cooking, movies. If you want to spend .99 cents you can bypass the ads or for a couple of bucks a month you can access your favorite shows.",
