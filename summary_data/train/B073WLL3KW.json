The mattress 'inflated' within 20 minutes, which surprised me -- I was prepared to wait a day or two before being able to sleep on it. Is pretty firm right out the box but I have a feeling it will break in. Will update at 6mths or so. UPDATE- It has now been about 8 months and it is still very comfortable. I have not noticed any sinkage or anything like that. Very happy with my purchase, would recommend.",

We've only had it a week or so, so can't speak to the longevity, but can't beat the price regardless.
