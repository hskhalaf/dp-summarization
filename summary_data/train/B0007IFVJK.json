I believe I bought it in 2006 or 2007 and it's been with me through cross-country moves and numerous computer upgrades. Sure, my ceiling lights flicker every time I hit print--this little guy must draw a ton of power--but it's been reliable workhorse. In our throwaway world of planned obsolescence, I have to give mad props to any piece of tech that lasts this long. May it last another decade.",

For me, it's not a big deal--the speed and resolution more than make up for it. They don't curl into a circular tube, the ends of the page turn up a bit.",

The print quality and speed and both very good. My only complaint, as mentioned by others, is the fact that the printer slightly curls the paper when printing. If you are thinking about replacing your old and expensive-to-operate ink jet printer, this is a good choice. Your basic ink jet printer will cost an average of 10 cents per b&w copy, whereas this printer will run you 2 cents a copy. I would recommend this printer for light duty home use.",

You will need a USB 2.0 A/B cable (e.g., check out a Startech item that Amazon sells for about $6).

Third toner is almost gone, And it is still working. This printer is really good. pretty fast, pretty clear, pretty cheap (five star for these reasons) But if you want to print out more than 30 pages at once, it just throw up papers without printing anything. I think it's because printer gets hot after printing 30 pages. If you print 10 pages and let the printer have time to cool down like 10 or 20 seconds, it will print out very clearly without problem.",
