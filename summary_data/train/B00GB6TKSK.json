Well, he wasn't kidding when he told me I would have blisters on my feet! These boots are working boots, not fashion boots, and they fit your foot like a glove. After the initial, and sometimes painful, breaking-in period, they are perfect and beautiful! I expect them to last quite a while.",

My pair was true to size, and true to the picture. I have skinny calves, so the boot shaft fits me well, but if I had more robust calves, I'd look for a different style. Also, the sole is cushier than I had expected -- a pleasant surprise! I am still breaking these boots in, but they feel comfortable enough for all day wear -- as well as sturdy enough for riding. They're too pretty for barn chores, though.",

They are absolutely beautiful, love the color and have worn them for about 4 days now all day everyday and have not had a problem with them hurting my feet. Will buy Justin's again.",

I will warn you that they will be tight and stiff when you first put them on, but they will soften up in a few hours of breaking in. The seam on the inside of the boot is pretty thick and rubs on my ankles but wearing thicker socks seems to help until they are completely broken in. They look very sturdy and are made of very thick leather. I've been wanting brown and turquoise boots for years and I'm extremely happy with my purchase!",

I have a fairly muscular calf and they fit fine, with a bit of wiggle room to spare. I am 5'2\" and they hit me at the widest part of my calf. Overall, a great find!",

I bought them to wear in my friends wedding and I was not disappointed. I wore them the day before the wedding to stretch them out/break them in and they were perfect. I wear and 8 to 8 1/2 in shoes and bought an 8 1/2 in these boots because I wanted to make sure they fit and the size was perfect. I probably could have bought and 8 and they would have fit fine but I like wiggle room. I would recommend these boots.",

    "description": "The Standard of the West Since 1879 The story of Justin Boots began in 1879, when H.J. Justin moved to Spanish Fort, Texas to become a boot repairman. He was a quick study, with an eye and talent for boot making. H.J. soon began his own boot company, Justin Boots, which he operated out of his home to serve cowboys passing though town. H.J. saw the potential for his business, so when a railroad was built ten years later in Nocona, Texas, he moved his family there to capitalize on a bigger market. In 1908, Justin Boots became a true family company when his sons, Earl and Avis, came to work for their father. Their combined efforts pushed the company forward, and just two years later, Justin Boots had doubled its production and was being sold in 26 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and Cuba. Seven years after their father\u00b4s death in 1918, his sons moved the company headquarters to Fort Worth where it still operates today. Every pair of Justin Boots is a salute to the spirit of independence, hard work and authenticity of the cowboys who have worn them since 1879. After more than 130 years of Western boot making, Justin Boots is still true to its roots. When you purchase a pair of Justin Boots you will own the most authentic and stylish Western footwear available. And with Justin\u00b4s patented J-Flex.Comfort System you will be wearing the most comfortable boots ever made. This is why Justin Boots has been crowned the Standard Of The West Since 1879.",
