All the beads and wooden bits fell to the bottom of the cage and left 4 inches of bare, frayed cotton shoe-lace rope hanging down. Lovebirds can hang or choke themselves on ropes like this, as well as ingest the fibers if they're chewers (like mine is). I had to remove the toy immediately. I will use the little parts to make something he cannot unravel so easily.",
