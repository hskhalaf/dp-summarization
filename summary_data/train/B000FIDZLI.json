      "text": "I think it was worth the money--not a lot--but it is very cheaply made. I wanted to make it really function as a secondary seat--which it is too short (never mind too obvious) to do normally. So I went through the process of obtaining a hassock seat for it to sit inside Had to buy three to get a match so I thought I'd pass this along. BEST Octagonal Folding Ottoman, Blue  This was a great improvement, though the hassock is a bit too deep so adding a layer of cut 2x4s to the bottom of the space was necessary. The combination is fantastic--makes the original product much more useful IMHO.",

We used 2 black trash bags and poured a few inches of cat litter in. After a few uses we would just add another couple of handfuls of litter. After our morning coffee, we would pull the bags, drop them off at the dumpster and start the process over. No smell, the lid stays on snug. Would highly recommend, especially for women.",

As it is, ideal for under 5'8\" and 140lbs...or kids that have good eye hand coordination. Dsigners, two small plastic squeeze clips along slot couldd fix issue?

      "title": "Best portable toilet",
      "text": "Have used the hassock for several camping trips. I like it much better than expensive portable toilets that I have used in the past. The set up and cleaning is so much easier. It is no problem to transport and store due to light weight. The only negative is that, after the first new use, I do not put the paper holder back because it can become soiled. Once soiled the challenge is what to do with that piece when \"nature calls\". I may do away with the paper holder and find another way to store the paper so it is ready-to-use. I would definitely recommend this has the first choice for anyone wanting a portable toilet.",

      "title": "Great simple portable toilet",
      "text": "Lightweight and reasonably comfortable. The lid keeps smells at Bay, so it can live inside. Once you pull the lid off it can get a bit pungent quickly, however. It depends how often you empty it, and how much kitty litter or absorbent gel you use. The \"Double Doodie\" bags don't hold much. They need to be changed after 5 or so uses. I'd recommend using plain old heavy duty kitchen bags instead (double bag it!), and sprinkle some kitty litter in after each use. Then you don't have to change the bags so often. Perfect for camping, and to avoid covid-infested restrooms when traveling by car.",

Chances are we won't use if there are other feasible options and if we did have to use it, we would do our business and easily dispose of the waste without cleaning, storing of water and lugging around a larger device in our vehicle. We bought the disposable bags, some deodorized kitty litter and some wet wipes and we are ready to go.",

I am a regional truck driver, I stay in the truck for days at a time and sometimes I'm in places where there's no restroom, or in the middle of nowhere. I keep it under my truck bed, and it just been so useful. The only reason I won't give a 5 stars is because it is sturdy but it could be a little more sturdy. I weigh 182 lbs so I'm average not overweight, and It supports me okay but what about those who are heavier than me? Would it support that weight okay and still keep its original shape?",

Packing it back was easy...put camp garbage in over top...folded back closed and put lid back on...and nothing spilled or smelled in car ride back to dumpster. pack in pack out. keeping campsites cleaner!! would be great if you have kids who can't wait to get to toilet.",

Wiping one's self, is. But, a little gymnastics solves that. All in all, a great value.",
