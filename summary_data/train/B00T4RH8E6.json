He suggests browsing for a different product, based off of his personal experience.",

It cuts the top from the side (so it creates a reusable lid) but you have to hold it down thre entire time. Having to hold the can and depress thre handle the entire time may sound petty, but I guess I was expecting more. It's not new technology. Pros: looks cool. Cuts from the side.

The fact that it cuts around the side of the can makes opened cans really easy to handle There's no fussing to pierce the can top to get it started and it is suprisingly quiet. I do recommend following the instruction from other reviewers to stop the process as soon as the can has made one full revolution. This easy to do because the sound changeswhen the cutter hits the already-opened spot.",

All around a good purchase because it easily does its job. So glad we picked the right one. Thanks Amazon, its just what we needed! This is a good product so don't hesitate to buy.",

Listen for the can cutting, and when the pitch goes higher, stop at once, as you are 100% around the can. Of the 100s of cans I've opened, not ONE failure. Best can opener I've ever seen.",

This opener does open cans but does it extremely well cutting just below the can's rolled edge so you lift off the top just like a lid. Not once in 2 years of use has it failed to give a clean perfect cut. Never have had to struggle with a lid that the opener didn't quite make a clean cut all around as experience with other openers I've used.",
