      "text": "Works well. Takes a few minutes to start producing full steam on a cold water fill (approx. 15 min.) but after that it will produce good steam for an hour. Sets up easy enough. Only issue I have could be with the floor and stitching durability. With the support bar up you can see the stitches stress enough to open up holes around them. If you choose to sit in a chair I would put a towel down to protect the flooring too. Aromatherapy oils work fine. I like sitting completely inside covering the neck hole with a towel although it's not the most comfortable with a back rest.",

This allows the user to have greater flexibility in running and stopping the sauna without having to get out all the time, Also i accidentally fell because i had a bad chair and broke one of the contact pipes which i am wondering how to replace for the front.",

Few caveats: there\u2019s no chair included and you need to turn the pipes sideways, so that the steam is not directed at your petutie. One more thing is that I started putting a towel inside the sauna while using, otherwise you will have a puddle on the floor afterwards.",

      "text": "Love this...I need to find a comfortable chair but at 5'10\" I wouldn't expect that to be an easy task so that is not a negative for me. Easy to use, a little annoying to set up so I just leave it set up. Great for steaming with essential oils when you are sick. I just throw in a cotton ball soaked in the oils into the tent, I don't add to the water as I'm not sure if that'll mess up the steamer. But again that's not a negative for me either. I love this steamer.",
