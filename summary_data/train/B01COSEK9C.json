As a parent (because lets face it, that's who's buying it) I'll tell you what I love about it. #1 It comes with batteries HOORAY! #2 Not only can you turn it off and on, it has a volume controller (double hooray). #3 It does more than 3 things, so you aren't listening to the same sayings or songs over and over and over again. It's small enough that he can set it on his lap while we're driving and play with it as well. All in all, this was money well spent!",

It gets a little frustrating when trying to lay my son down for a nap and pick up the toys in the room and it begins to talk, I have to walk it to the next room so it will not be a distraction until it turns off. Otherwise, its a fun toy, and a good size.",
