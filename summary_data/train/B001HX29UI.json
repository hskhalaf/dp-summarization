I have posted images of this fake ugg next to the real brand (Fake images on left). Feeling the fur and sole clearly gives it away. However, the packaging is identical. The suede on the real ugg also feels so much better. This product is advertised as the true ugg brand even charging a similar price as the retail store.",

In my experience with slippers, there are none that hold a candle to Ugg with regard to comfort and durability.

I got the Espresso color because I often eat and cook in my slippers and drip on them so hopefully stains won't show. This is my first pair of UGGs and my first slide-in slippers. The rubber sticks well to the floor or carpet for an easy slide in.",
