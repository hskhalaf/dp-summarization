One major problem I had was one of the the 12 volt plugs would not seat into power receptive on one of the DVD players. When comparing to the second power cord, it's obvious the end plug is much longer than it should be. This is why it doesn't seat and player won't turn on. Additionally, had to mess around with headset for a bit to get it to connect to the DVD player that worked. Headsets don't fit toddlers well. My first Pyle dealing since their junk reputation from the '90s. Seems not much has changed.",

Love the ability to look at two different movies at once. With older and younger kids, this feature comes in super handy!

The instruction manual has no details on the setting, such which feature does what. I struggled just to get the headphones and the wiring harness output to work. The buttons/wording on the remote control are small and hard to use. Couldn't get the MPEG4 to work on the SD card.",
