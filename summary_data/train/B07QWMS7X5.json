One complaint: the extruded aluminum case lid is badly warped along the back edge (see photos), which makes it difficult to close. I've tried bending the lid straight, but it springs back, and unless I drill out the hinge rivets to remove the lid entirely and then replace them later, there's no good way to get enough leverage to fix it.",

I have figured out a way to use it sideways to avoid it not being wide enough. I recommend taking cardboard or a blanket or something that you can place behind you.

It's great. I love it. I tried a pop up one before this on a stand, and it just.... Wasn't as good. It was bulky and awkward. It took up more space. I was just trying to save the money.

This product allows me to have a Green Screen when I need it, and it stores right under my couch. Takes seconds to set up, seconds to put away! Superb quality! I had my doubts but to be honest I was very impressed and totally worth the price.",

Being able to set it up a little further away would make this easier. Overall I would recommend this product for anyone looking to chroma key in a small or shared space.",
