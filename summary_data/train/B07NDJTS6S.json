The shredder overheats when the barrel is full, and I have to remove the accumulated shreddings from the teeth frequently. I would not recommend this shredder for someone who has a lot of paper to shred; instead, invest in a better quality machine that will last longer.",

Regular staples are no problem and it can even take flat cardboard from cracker boxes, but, doesn't do well with paper napkins. The bin could be larger and as it fills to the top, you need to manually move the pieces around to prevent jamming. Nice household unit and I dump the pieces outside for mulch in the planting beds.",

      "text": "Generally speaking, this shredder works great. I can only put 2-4 pages in at a time max, or they get stuck & it jams. One card at a time too. If you continuously use it for a long period of time, it gets overheated and will stop working. Once it cools, it\u2019ll start working again. So don\u2019t rush through your shredding and it does a great job of shredding. It\u2019s about the size of a small trash can (next to a laser printer in photo to provide comparison). Everything shreds into confetti sized bits - so if you really want things destroyed, this shredder does it! (See photo to see shredded papers.)",
