Except maybe the connector for the freezer part to be up higher to it doesn't stop the tray from going all the way back (when the shelf is at the top level). Also, it does make a (fairly) loud \"click\" when the fridge turns off/on. I got the orange one so I could get a white 'T' magnet for the Vols. for at least 1/3 off the price of an \"official\" TN Vols fridge! Fits perfect under my desk in my office. Go big orange!",
