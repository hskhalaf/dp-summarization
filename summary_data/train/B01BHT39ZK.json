Out of curiosity, I open the battery cover only to discover I was given a 1500mah battery, instead of 3000 as advertised. I don't know how else to communicate this as this is the first time I'm experiencing such, and so am not familiar with the process on how to go about it. I do hope my vendor can see this and get in touch with me",
