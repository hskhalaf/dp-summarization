To me it felt a little greasy, though, and not full coverage. To use it in a way to achieve full coverage you would have to use more - and because this product is so expensive, I was wary to do so. Delightful formula and shade range though. If price is no object definitely pick one up.",

The foundation blends in flawlessly with the skin, the only thing I would say that it's more medium-coverage than full-coverage. I really like the foundation itself, and the triangle shape, it's better than most stick foundations. The package came in nicely packaged and the product wasn't damaged in any way.",
